I had not heard of this author and only downloaded it because it was very inexpensive. Turns out this book is absolutely terrific! I could not put it down and spent an entire Sunday reading and finishing it. It's a great story about family and romance with some suspense and mystery thrown in - perfect for reading on the beach or a quiet summer day."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I give this book five stars. The dynamics of the McKenna family are something! This author keeps you guessing, and keeps the plates spinning in the air; you learn so much about a lot of the people/characters in this book. The love, the disappointment, the heart-felt desires, and on and on. Five stars it is. I would guess that once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"Stormy relationships and a stormy sailing adventure combine to make this a better-than-average read. Barbara Freethy keeps you guessing about the big family secret and the ending is predictible but still fun. It's a great way to pass a summer afternoon at the beach or just curled up on the living room sofa."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book is all about secrets, which helps the plot move along. A man comes to try and find out the secrets the sisters are keeping, while falling in love with one of them. He feels torn about trying to find out the truth. This is a good read, minus the grammatical errors. If you like mystery and mild romance this is a great read for the beach, road trip, wherever."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"If you want a love story wrapped up with some intrigue, SUMMER SECRETS is the book for you. All the while I was reading the book, I was trying to guess the secret ... and never could! The romance and mystery will keep you turning the pages as fast as you can. Great read."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I have always been a fan of Ms. Freethy's books, but she really stretches in this one. Here are the strong, and often emotionally complicated family relationships one expects from her books. But this time we also get a bit of suspense as secrets are slowly unraveled, a touch of adventure on the high seas, and lots more characters and complex relationships. It's a bigger canvas, and the author fills it beautifully. Each of the three sisters is fully realized, each distinct from the others, each with her own secrets and her own fears and her own strengths. I never guessed the truth until it was revealed, and I couldn't put the book down until it was. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"\\"Summer Secrets\\" doesn't break any new ground, but it does shove a lot of that ground into its pages. The dominating element is the standard stranger/secret investigator romance plot, but the chemistry between the two main characters is a little flat and a little forced. There is also a separate romance sub-plot of lost love, which probably deserved a little more time, along with the standard dysfunctional family story that sees to be obligatory if you're writing about a group of sisters and their dad. The best of the plotlines, however, is the mystery of what really happened eight years before the current story time. While it could have been a little more explosive -- Freethy shows her cards on one element midway through the book -- it keeps you reading through the more predictable fare."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"from the time i picked this book up i could not put it down..i soo wanted to know what was goin to happen..this author really knows how to snag you from the very beginning..love her.."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I read this book based upon reviews and have to say I was disappointed. I thought the plot was very predictable with little to no intrigue. By the end I didn't like the sisters at all for the way they protected their father who didn't know how to be a father to them. Will be hard pressed to read any of her other books."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"The books that I have read by Barbara Freethy have never disappointment me just like this one didn't. It's about three sisters and the faithful day that no one wants to talk about. Something happened and they are all protecting each other from what happen. Tyler has come to town and wants to know all about the three sisters he says that it's about the race but he doesn't tell them why he is really there, when it all comes out will everyone be the same ever again.

This was such a great book.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This may not be important to most, but to me it is. The only complaint I have about this book (and most of the other Kindle ebooks I have purchased) is that there seems to be a lack of editing before they are published.

However, I would never have finished this book if there was not a \\"summer secret\\" to discover. The editing was terrible, the circumstances were unbelievable, the language was elementary, and the character development was amateurish. There were many twists and turns, which Freethy even pointed out in a sentence that read along the lines of \\"even Tyler could not believe this unexpected twist\\"... not exactly a sophisticated writing style. I could have easily read this book in 4th grade and understood it - not my idea of a good novel. However, if you want a mindless read or care more about entertainment than quality, go for it."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This book is the perfect blend of family, adventure and romance with just the right touch of mystery added for good measure. It's the ideal summer read! The characters are rich and wonderfully dimensional and the story will tug at your heart strings while it spirits you away. Grab a tall glass of strawberry iced tea, settle into the porch swing and be prepared to be dazzled by Ms. Freethy's marvelous storytelling talents!"},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"This was a bit long (for my taste) and I think could have been edited down a bit; but that was not enough to detract from the fantastic story and intricate plot. The characters were all wonderfully developed and I got pulled in enough to understand each person's motivations even when their actions seemed to defy reason. Kept my interest and kept me guessing the whole time."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I could not wait to finish this book. Predictable plot and two-dimensional characters. Eye rolling writing. I wish I could get my $5 back that I spent on Kindle so I could flush it down toilet.

It felt like a bad \\"B\\" movie. Keep searching...."},{"Title":"Summer Secrets","review":"I generally like any kind of book, including chick-lit or romance on occassion.

I will definitely continue to buy her books!"},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"This is a reprint of the 1974 2nd edition. So what is Numerical Analysis? It's the down-and-dirty methods of approximation and interpolation of equations that don't have closed-formed mathematical solutions. Just about every real-world problem in material engineering from pipe flow, wing design, convection currents to multivariate econometrics have to resort to numerical approximations. You'll find all the familiar names from your undergrad Math and Physics courses here (Newton, Gauss, Largrange, etc.); however, advanced methods in Numerical Analysis has changed tremendously since this book was published. Since NA is dependent on present computing power, what was once too expensive or unthinkable in the 70s can be done today. However, it's still a great introduction and a great bargain from Dover. The writing style is informal and conversationally peer-to-peer, rather than teacher-to-student. There is no historic consciousness placing methods and men in context. You won't find programming algorithms here (not even Fortran or Pascal). There are probably better books out there for what ever your specific speciality is, but at five times the price of this Dover reprint. You'll will find the old favorites here. The book covers the various finite difference approximations (forward, backward and central differences). It uses the operational approach for these. The later chapters cover splines, continued fraction and iterative methods. More importantly it covers the difference between round-off error v. truncation of divergent series in approximations -- something that still confuses practicing professionals. Be warned there have been many improvements in theory and methods in finite element methods of Fluid Dynamics and other 3D modeling (bezier and NURBS); And, the whole world of Complexity and Chaos theory happened well AFTER this book was published. Calculus and Differential EQs are prerequisite, there's no attempt at introduction in the text."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"Although old, this is still an outstanding introduction to a wide range of topics in numerical analysis. I get impatient with the amount of detail Hildebrand devotes to some topics, but that's because those are topics where I already know the techniques and pitfalls.However, I have one serious criticism of this book. Hildebrand in very many places drags in the question of inherent errors in input data, but fails to distinguish the different views one must take depending on how one got involved with some topic. In 50+ years of doing numerical analysis and numerical software from time to time, I have come to realize that three quite different issues of inherent error occur.First, one may be working with scientists or engineers to derive results for a specific problem or set of problems. In this case, one must ask two pertinent questions, and keep asking until one gets clear answers: \\"How are you getting the input data?\\" and, \\"What are you going to do with the results?\\" Given answers to these two questions, one can do analysis and computation knowing from the start how accurate the input data is likely to be, and how much that matters to the results. Hildebrand pays little attention to the quite complicated problem of how one should do the analysis and programming in those situations.Second, it may happen that there is no input data from the real world, and hence no inherent error; the input data is conjured up out of whole cloth, as happens in many calculations in \\"computational physics\\". In those cases, one wants to produce results that accurately reflect the hypotheses provided by the people with the problem to be solved. Usually, one finds in such cases that the more accurately one can do the computation or analysis, the better one can serve one's users.Third, and most difficult, is the situation where one is writing a utility routine for use by large numbers of people, most of whom one will never encounter. Everyone who has done much numerical programming faces this issue from time to time. Here the problem is that the users are likely to place absolute faith in the results, even in cases where you, as the implementer of the software or originator of the analysis, may know all too well that the results are unstable with respect to very minor variations in input data. This occurs with monotonous regularity, for example, in routines that manipulate matrices to derive such quantities as eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In my own experience, a high proportion of the actual matrices that users present to \\"utility packages\\" are ill-conditioned, and there's a reason for this. If the problem were well-conditioned, it wouldn't be a problem for the scientists or engineers or financial types who need a solution; they would know a priori from experience what the answers are. I have no good answer for how one should think about such \\"utility software\\" and neither does Hildebrand. The way I deal with it myself is to ensure that mathematically accurate results are provided even for ill-conditioned problems, and to provide documentation for users that includes the equivalent of: \\"If you ask this software a stupid question, it will give you a stupid (but correct) answer, so if you are unsure about the stability of your data, please call or visit or email me to discuss your specific problem.\\"In short, despite the virtues of this book, it doesn't come to grips with the issue of numerical analysis and mathematical computation that I have found causes me more headaches than any other."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"The quality of the writing is extremely high in this book. It's obvious that the author was a most attentive teacher. It may not have C++ or Matlab code or a lot of the modern techniques.As an introduction you can't go wrong with this book which is excellent for self-study, especially at the price."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"This book by Hildebrand along with its companion Methods of Applied Mathematics are a perfect match for students of Science and Engineering. It is a must for this era where the blind use of mathematical software is prevalent masking the intricacies of the method.The details of the method employed in the software should be understood to have any faith in the software output."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"Certainly one of the best books on Numerical Analysis ever written. Since this subject matter is vast, it has not been covered in its entirety, but what has been covered is simply the best. Moreover, it has been written by one of the best mathematicians. A MUST READ for everyone using numerical analysis."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"This is an excellent numerical methods book ,covering many techniques especially the polynomials which are not used much by practising engineers today , but who knows,may find applications in odd places.Prof Hildebrand easily builds up so that one can understand the steps from a first course in Calculus...Glad that Dover has reprinted this classic book."},{"Title":"Introduction to numerical analysis (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","review":"This book is really one of the best books on numerical analysis I've ever seen. It is simple but complete."},{"Title":"Impossible object","review":"Mosely writes in the end of Impossible Object, &quot;But you always read books more for form than for content,&quot; giving away, I believe, an epiphany that mostly comes to those who have read many, many books. Mosely's form in Impossible Object is extremely interesting because of how intertwined the stories are--characters reappear, images recur, and narrators are constantly positing on what exactly constitutes love. When you're finished reading the book you could very well wonder if it is really a short story collection or a loosely-stitched novel. You can decide. Whatever it is, I really enjoyed the book and think that Mosley is a fine writer who deserves a larger audience. Sometimes the characters are a bit on the undercharacterized side--making them a little vague and mildly uninteresting--but Mosley's prose makes up for that easily. The first line of his short story, &quot;Life After Death&quot; is a good example of the unique vision Mosley captures in his text, &quot;Walking through streets late at night I saw a crack in the sky and a red arm coming through with the fist clenched like a foetus.&quot; It's pretty hard to walk away from a line like that--not exactly your usual sunrise. Very refreshing."},{"Title":"Impossible object","review":"I was left with a sense of confusion after reading this book. There is so much interpretation that needs to be done after reading this, that a reader needs to back and re-read many times. A handful of stories were very interesting, and the rest, well, I can't comment on them because I didn't fully understand the book. Anyone who is up for a challenge,and good at interpretation of books on many levels, would enjoy this, and those who undersand it..e-mail me and tell me what you thought it was about."},{"Title":"Impossible object","review":"Like \\"Accident,\\" \\"Impossible Object\\" is another example of an excellent 1960's novel which pushed literary boundaries at the time but is somewhat neglected now. Although advertised as a novel (and it IS a novel) it reads as a collection of short stories. Connected, yet so unique in style and substance they are initially recognizable as a narrative theme rather than a cohesive story, it is only in the end that the characters and storylines are shown to be the same throughout the work. This is a novel of multiple episodes, captured by multiple narrators, all attempting to come to terms with the impossibility of idealized, romantic love.The narrative follows the arc of romantic love experienced by someone who initially thinks he has lost it: a man envies the idealized love his older son seems to have for a village girl; a couple's marriage slides into battle and guilt as their romance evolves into routine; a couple's apathy towards one another paves the way for infidelity; an outsider gives a sympathetic view of an affair from start to apparent finish; an impromptu love/lust is quickly distilled to base elements of jealousy, control, and selfishness; a man contemplates suicide after losing both his wife and his \\"true\\" love; a man takes a coward's approach to the aftermath of his adultery; and an affair rekindled by an illegitimate birth ends tragically.This is not an easy read: multiple narrative voices are (intentionally?) confusing; some of the language is absurd and disjointed, matching the mindset of the principal actors; interconnected existentialist interludes deal with God's place in a world struggling to forget him, become increasingly unhinged, and finally close the novel with by explaining its initial intent; there are multiple references to Neitsche, what he thought, and why he went crazy. Despite its struggle in pieces, it is excellent in the whole. This is a very fine book which runs circles around current reflections on the same topic. Recommended."},{"Title":"Impossible object","review":"If you read my other reviews, you'll see I'm an absolute snob. Just take my word for it. Beckett, Chekhov...Wallace Stevens, that kind of thing. I'm always skeptical when someone recommends to me a book by an author I have never heard of, especially one more or less recent. I won't summarize the book for you, just say that I hope you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was. The form, the content...WEIRD and very difficult even to explain. I'm normally not a fan of the \\"interweaving\\" thing with literature or movies, but something about the first person narrators makes it work in a very interesting way in this book.The book also has some kind of meta-fictional effects going on, but nothing too self-conscious as one would see in a postmodern novel.I recommend this to my fellow lit. snobs."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash 8 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"This is a PeachPit Press \\"Visual QuickPro Guide\\"--similar to their \\"Visual QuickStart\\" training book series, but aimed at more experienced users. The series uses a task-based training approach, teaching skills through short step-by-step exercises. This approach has some major drawbacks for me, although this particular book seems to have dealt with some issues fairly well. My first complaint is that task-based training tends to focus too much on quick, \\"surface\\" results without really giving an understanding of what is happening and why it works. This makes it difficult to apply skills effectively in future situations, or to know when they ought to be applied. A task-based organization also makes it difficult to use a book as a reference, since information is dispersed throughout the exercises.I was pleasantly surprised with Macromedia Flash 8 Advanced in many ways. First, I found that the chapters had a good mix of theoretical instruction and practical exercises. Almost every exercise was accompanied by an explanation of topics: what might be new to Flash 8, how the techniques might be important in a larger context, and an overview of how they work. There were a lot of explanatory sidebars and tips that offered very useful, relevant information. I was also pleased with the indexing, and I was able to find information on several topics as I worked. Most of the step-by-step instructions were very general, giving a basic process without getting sidetracked into specific projects.Overall, I found that this book does just what it claims to do: it gives good, quick explanations of some advanced Flash topics and skills, such as external communications, sound and video, and dynamic content, as well as complex handling of things like movieClips, text, and buttons. It does not offer much in-depth discussion on any topic, and it does not focus on any area of Flash development specifically, but it takes a very broad approach to expanding Flash skills. I should particularly mention that I wouldn't recommend the book to someone trying to learn actionscript, since the actionscript in the book lacks the depth or focus that can be found elsewhere (O'Reilly's Actionscript for Flash MX), and information is dispersed throughout the book. It also does not really cover Flash components. I would recommend it to Flash users who want to expand their general skills and (especially) keep current with some of the growing capabilities of Flash. The book also includes a CD with working files for the exercises and a trial version of Flash 8."},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash 8 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It goes in depth in covering the actionscript language for Flash 8, and starts off at a relatively slow pace so you don't feel overwhelmed. My only complaint is that it relies a lot (at least in the beginning) on using the script assist mode which I think is a waste of time for those trying to LEARN actionscript. In it's defense, the book weans you off it as it goes along, and I can see someone with no actionscript experience finding that extremely helpful. Knowing a decent amount of actionscript before reading this, I found it a bit annoying but like I said, it fades out of that as the book goes on. Great for learning the newer way to code, and gives a good basis to really use Macromedia Flash to it's full potential."},{"Title":"New Maps of Old England","review":"The enigmatic title refers to how the author has redrawn the physical landscape of his native Old England, but it contains no illustrations. It is rather an original, intimate and detailed account of the journeyings of a Ghost Finder, but he has kept many locations secret, maintaining that some are too dangerous to visit. It is a collection of ghost stories and tales of monsters that are enjoyable in themselves. It is a quest to discover if any of the nightmare literary creations of Lovecraft and William Hope Hodgson had any basis in reality and is a stark reply to the observation that \\"ghosts may frighten you, but they can never physically harm you.\\" The author Dennis Price has visited some truly dark and shunned localities, often alone and by night, and has had the sense to realise that some experiences are best described not by scientific measurements, but by lyrical, evocative prose and occasionally by blank verse, which he employs to great effect. He does not aim to supply proof, but rather to convey the power that some of these awesome sites possess to evoke wonderment and sometimes real fear. He has not confined himself to an exploration of his own country \\"Ultima Thule\\", although the majority of the locations are British, among them the mysterious Tor at Glastonbury. His journeys have taken him to a grim castle in Scandinavia and as far south as a secluded island in the Mediterranean to spend the night in ruined temple of a lost God. Whether you want to read about ghosts and demons, or wish to delve into a enthralling study of the \`genius loci' accompanied by liberal & enlightening quotes from classical texts, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Yes No (Nursery Board Books)","review":"IS AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND MY SON LOVE IT HE 3.

This is sadly not so.This book does have some of those explanations, but not anywhere near as many as one would expect. I read through several chapters, and I found myself not only still lacking understanding of the covered lines, but unimpressed by the book and the opening itself as well (the latter is probably because I lack the understanding I should be getting!). One particular example is \\"the position is now very sharp, and both sides should be fully aware of the latest theoretical developments.\\" It stops there; gee, I thought I was supposed to be learning something.On the positive side, the author does cover the critical lines thoroughly. However, the coverage is mostly in variation-by-variation form and wanting in clear explanation. This might be helpful to a strong player who could understand what was going on, but not to the rest of us.In short, do not buy this book if you are hoping to have your eyes opened to the beauty of the Leningrad Dutch and gain a healthy understanding of it. You will find yourself disappointed [...]."},{"Title":"Buying into Condomania: Delight or Delusion : A Guide to Decide","review":"This book is lacking in substance. The text only contains 14 pages of information -all of it so superficial that it is of no substantive value. The remaining 60 pages consist of 3 appendices that are nothing more than sample condominium declarations, rules and bylaws. This, the lion's share of the book, is given without any guidance definition or analysis. This book reads like it was written in one afternoon and it probably was. To add to the this insult, the construction of the book is in keeping with the lack of serious content.

Skiing is far from surfing, in fact a swim coach would probably have a better idea of how to condition for surfing.

They have a certain taste for these kids and hunt them down.Iggy, Fang, Gazzy, Angel, Nudge, and Max find out new strength and who they are. This is definately a Maximum ride alright.

Because it only gets better and better throughout the pages. ^_^"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is so good I could hardly put it down! James Patterson has rolled action, adventure, mystery, suspense and drama all into one book. The 413 pages may seem intimidating, but with its short chapters and fast-paced wording, it truly is a must read.Maximum, Angel, the Gasman, Iggy, Nudge, and Fang are six children with something that sets them apart from everyone else in the world. They are genetic experiments. With wings and superhuman powers they are constantly on the run from the Erasers, Erasers being genetic experiments also, but instead of having wings they are able to morph into wolf-like creatures in about two seconds. The flock has another mission other than getting away from the lab, they want to find their REAL parents.I think that anyone who reads this book should also get the second in the series, MAXIMUM RIDE: SCHOOLS OUT--FOREVER. That is the only way to answer all of your questions about Max and the rest of the flock."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride is the title of the book and also of the main character,a 14 year old girl with wings who along with other orphans like her must elude Erasers(men that are part wolf).The plot is simplistic,the concept not that orginal(X-Men have been tackling the same theme for years)but what makes it work is that it has a sense of humor and heart.With bite sized chapters about 3 pages each this book (Bad Pun Alert)literally flies by.Not a lot of questions are answered in the end but it's so much fun you'll look forward to continuing the journey with these characters in the sequel."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"i bought this book for myself and couldnt, wouldnt, and am very glad i didnt put it down untill i had read every page. it kept up the pace, was funny, never strange or out of place and left me with a new perspectave on the subjects it touches on. this is a definate must read and worth you while. go buy one for yourself and one for all your friends."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I will have a review below, but I obviously need to clear up a few things, first:First of all, to everyone who is carrying on about how this book has not followed the same story as \\"When the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Lake House\\" and is so upset about how the character has changed, etc. - READ THE INTRO THAT MR. PATTERSON WROTE!!! I quote (emphasis added my own):To the reader:The idea for \\"Maximum Ride\\" comes from earlier books of mine called \\"When the Wind Blows\\" and \\"The Lake House,\\" which also feature a character named Max who escapes from a quite despicable School. **Most of the similarities end there.** Max and the other kids in \\"Maximum Ride\\" **are not the same Max and kids featured in those two books.** Nor do Frannie and Kit play any part in \\"Maximum Ride.\\" I hope you enjoy the ride anyway.All you had to do was read that single paragraph and you wouldn't have had the misapprehension that this book was a sort of sequel or cover of the earlier novels. The earlier works were only a sort of jumping board for the idea.Secondly, for those who are upset that the novel doesn't have a conclusion as such, and leaves a great deal uncovered - could it be because there is a planned sequel? Let's see . . . YES - look inside the back here: Upcoming from James Patterson:\\"Maximum Ride: School's Out Forever\\" I imagine you will get some of your questions answered there.Please forgive me, those who are looking for an actual review, but it irks me when people go off half-cocked and trash a perfectly fun book because they didn't bother to be fully informed.Right, then. This novel is, as many have pointed out, about a group of children who call themselves \\"The Flock,\\" because they have had their genetics tinkered with so that they were born with wings. They all spent a period of their formative years (from birth on) at a place called The School, living in small cages like lab animals, until one of their caretakers there took pity on them and helped them escape. At the time the story opens the eldest are 14 (Max and Fang), and the youngest is 6 (Angel). Although they have what they feel to be a fairly safe place to hide out, they have to be constantly vigilant for Erasers, which are the security forces from the School, more genetically altered humans - this time people whose DNA has been mixed with wolves, creating a sort of werewolf, for lack of a better term, although they are in control of their metamorphoses.Shortly after the start of the story, of course, Erasers show up for the first time in 4 years and after a fight, they make off with Angel, so Max comes up with a rescue operation and they set off. Too many details would spoil the book, of course, but throughout the book it seems that The Flock - and especially Max - is somehow being continually tracked by someone; sometimes this is to her fortune (when her hidden benefactor (??) manages to get an ATM card to her in a most unlikely spot - in a way likely to raise goosebumps if you believe in Big Brother!), and sometimes not (such as when Erasers continue to pop up everywhere they go).This book seems to have been written specifically to make it acceptable to a teen/young adult audience while remaining interesting to adults as well - Mr. Patterson does not use any specific profanities nor put in any sexual innuendo or scenes. There is violence and a bit of gore, but I would feel comfortable sending this book on to my 14-year-old niece. In fact, I probably will once I get at least the 2nd book in the series, or maybe 3 if they remain as fun as this one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"As said above, angels aren't just fantasy anymore. In my personal opinion this book is pretty good. \\"Maximum Ride\\" would probably be a better book for ages 9-11, or really anyone who's imagination is that of a child's. Patterson did a fantastic job in creating the chracter's thoughts and emotions. Personaly my favorite character is Fang, but who doesn't like the strong, brooding type? Back to my point, this book left me thirsting for the second instalment. Of course I can't spill out only good things here. One thing that irritated me is the fact that every chapter was only 2-3 pages long. Making 100 and something chapters out of a 422 page book was a tad bit disturbing in my case. A little confusing in other's. But all in all, I say why not spend $12-$17 on a book like this? But we are all open to our own opinions, so if you read the book on my word and don't like it, it isn't my fault. It's your interest in it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The first thing to say about Maximum Ride is that it doesn't come close to ending. It's more of a half-book than a full one, and I'd recommend that one doesn't bother to pick it up until book two comes out. Certainly there are lots of trilogies and series out there, but most of them bring each book to some sense of independent closure while still leaving room for sequels. Maximum Ride ends with very little resolved and there's much more frustration at the close than usual with series books for that reason.That said, Ride is worth a read for many reasons. Its narrator and title character, Max, has a winning voice and is a compelling character, though more so at the start than the close. She and her six \\"flock\\" members are escapees from The School, where they were raised and trained in brutal fashion. They all are part bird and have the wings to prove it, though each seems to also have some individual gifts not seemingly tied to their avian genes. Since their escape they've been hiding out from the School and its Erasers (wolf-based humans) and the book opens with a bang as the Erasers show up and kidnap Angel, the youngest member of the flock. This sets in the driving premise of the book--the flock's attempt to rescue Angel from the School and hide out again.As promised by the start, the book moves along at a very fast pace. The escape attempt is interrupted by various individual quests (a rescue during a bullying, a search for a birth parent) that add depth and character to each of the flock members without slowing the main story's advance. In fact, one wishes at times Patterson had slowed down a bit as none of the side stories feels fully explored.The book maintains a sense of tension throughout most of it and moves relatively smoothly between these periods of slow tension and big action scenes (such as the actual rescue attempt). The rescue of Angel becomes wrapped up in something much larger as the flock seeks out their origins and their purpose and this is the plot that drives the latter part of the book. Here the pace slows a bit and things become more vague, leading to the lack of resolution at the very close.The other major problem is that the book is too often marred by strangely clumsy contrivances--necessary skills that suddenly appear in characters, money almost literally falling from heaven, and so on. These instances read like first draft filler points that Patterson never went back to fix and they stick out noticeably, pulling the reader out of the text too often with a grimace of \\"c'mon, I won't even buy that in a book with winged kids and half-wolves\\".Take those oddly amateurish flaws out, explore a few ideas/characters more fully, and grant a bit more resolution and Maximum Ride would have been an excellent book. As it is, it's a flawed good one that ends up with the reader wanting more (a good sign) but not quite delivering. Recommended with the advice to wait for book two to ease the frustration of the ending and also with hopes that the sequel improves on the first."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Narayan of Rebeccasreads recommends MAXIMUM RIDE as an extraordinary tale of even more extraordinary \\"people\\" & their fight against even more extraordinary \\"people known as Erasers.It's been five years since James Patterson enthralled us with the fabulous WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, & two since its fantastic sequel THE LAKE HOUSE. Now he takes us on another wonderful exhilarating journey in MAXIMUM RIDE -- one that will leave the first-time readers absolutely stunned... & the ardent Patterson reader glued to the pages of the work... as always."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"One of my good friends recommended this book to me and kept on irritating me about it. She somehow found a way to bring it up in every conversation. So, for her sake and mine, I got the book. It had me at \\"only 98 percent human.\\" Maximum Ride is our main protagonist in this book, where she and the flock - Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gazzy (the Gasman), and Angel - were created on purpose. The other 2% of their bodies is bird DNA. Well-written is an understatement for \\"The Angel Experiment\\" and it took me no longer than a day to finish it off and finding the next one in the series. If you like action, you'll love it. If you like adventure, suspense, you'll enjoy it like nothing else.And, well, if you just like to read - it'll be a number one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Maximum Ride novels sat on our local public library's shelves, and never once did it ever cross my mind that I would enjoy them.

After reading the first book in the series, I can see what she loved about it. It's a fast and thoroughly fun read. The action starts early and doesn't slow down very long. James Patterson wrote this book with a lot of imagination and enthusiasm in every sentence. Highly recommended. On to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Started reading Patterson through Alex Cross and caught a glimpse of this crafty title. Free so you almost HAVE to atleast take a peek into its pages.But the novel is fast paced, new, and refreshing. The concepts and ideas for the kids \\"born\\" in the labs are a little young x-men-ish, but only in every way that is positive. This book covers background detail, and basicly defines the series and gives it soul... that which makes it worth reading. Although it is said to be for a younger audience i'm 28 and found it an interesting read. I'm about to buy the other books in the series momentarily hoping to enjoy the rest of the series as i have this title. Happy reading to all...... Live long, Love hard!!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was very good I loved all of the characters and I loved having a strong female lead as the main narrator in the story.

The book flows well and it's easy become drawn into the plot. The characters are so real.Maximum Ride is Book 1 of a series, so be prepared to order more books once you have read this one, because the ending is not complete. The novel is about a group of children from ages 14 to 4 who look human, but who are also able to fly. Max is the main character in this novel. Max who is a 14-year-old half human, half bird is the leader of the pact. The story begins when the group go hunting for berries and Erasers (the bad guys who try to kill them) attach them, and kidnap Angel (4-year-old flock member who can read minds). After Angel is kidnapped the flock takes off on a journey to save her, whereby they begin to discover new abilities."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel Experiment (Maximum Ride, Book 1)James Patterson's venture into teenage fiction writing has been an unqualified success. I am familiar with Patterson's adult mystery fiction. I was intrigued by the title of this book. I found it to be a suspense filled adventure. The fact that the main characters are all teenagers and children makes it all the more interesting. It's a decided page-turner for sure. I plan to finish the series. I have read Schools Out Forever and Saving the World both of which are sequels to the Angel Experiment and each as good as the first. Next up, Final Warning."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The book Maximum Ride: Angel Experiment is an exciting read because it intrigues the imagination. It has mutant bird kids who have been living as science experiments for most of their lives in the \\"School.\\" They are Max, Maximum Ride, the leader and the oldest; Fang, a strong silent kid, who is a person Max confides in and second oldest; Iggy, a kid who loves explosives and who became blind because of one of the experiments the \\"School\\" did to his sight; Nudge, a little girl who can talk non stop; and the only two people who are related, Gasman, or Gazzy, a boy who tries to be brave, and Angel. The book is mainly about the adventures of these six kids hiding away from the School's minions, the Erasers, who are ware wolf mutants. They escaped because Jeb, a scientist who likes the kids and was like a dad to the kids or as they call themselves the flock, helped them. However, he has been gone for four years so they think he is dead.It is a good book because it shows that they are still kids, just kids with wings, and it has great detail about everything they do and what every thing looks like. For example, it went into detail about how the Erasers not only looked like but how they changed form human to wolf. It also modernizes it by having some of the places that people can recognize, like Central Park in New York City. However, it does makeup a restaurant in New York and some streets in California but most people wouldn't recognize that unless they researched it.The short chapters in the book may keep people form reading it but for me it helped me read it faster because I just kept thinking one more chapter then ok that was short I can read another and before I knew it, I had read half the book! The short chapters also keep you wanting to know what happens next. It sometimes switches characters between chapters so you have to keep reading to see what happens to that character. It truly can entertain people with even little imaginations and keep people guessing throughout the book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is one of the best scifi thrillers I've read.

I could'nt put it down. Great novel."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read. You can tell a lot of thought went into the characters and the plot. It was hard to put down; the type of book one thinks about reading on the drive home from work.We got a lot of use out of this book as my 10 year old son and wife also completely enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The premise of the Maximum Ride series as a whole is pretty simple. Six kids have escaped from a laboratory that experiments with human children. They are 98% human and 2% bird, and, consequently, have big stinkin' wings.The series involves the six kids, or 'The Flock', as they reel around the country, constantly pursued by another group of test-tube humanoids known as Erasers. The lab in question, or the 'School', as Max and her friends call it, wants the escapees back at all costs. The true intentions of this underground organization are slowly given out over the course of the latter parts of the series.And overall, this simple premise works out well. Like the numerous reviews on the front pages of the book said I would be, I was quickly drawn into the plot, and, I'll admit, it was hard to put down. As I see it, James Patterson has created a formula for these books. More action, more going on, at the expense of character-development and detail. This works, for the most part, partly because this is a YA book more than anything. The action was great. Sure, the characters were for the most part flat, and a deus ex machina clanks along pretty well throughout some parts, but it made for a good book nonetheless, and it drew me into the series. I am 15 years of age, and while I'm not prone to YA fiction as much, I can easily recommend this. It's easy, there are no slow spots, and if it gets kids to read, where's the hurt in that? Sure, there's a lot of better literature out there, but James Patterson has written a book that reads like an action movie and thrills like a thriller should. Kudos to him for that."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"i enjoyed the book, but not as much as the first six. this one ended too abruptly, with really no action on the part of the protagonist, the guy in the plexiglas body. not long enough to care about the characters, although i did cry when Akila \\"died.\\" very funny in parts, and what was up with that ending......doesn't final mean final? i hope if there is an eighth book it's a little more in depth(?) i've loved all the Patterson books i've read to date, but thought this one was just a bit lacking. i think Total stole this one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: the Angel Experiment by James Patterson is the first book in a series.

When one of the flock members, Angel, is captured, by the school, they go on an awesome journey to find her.

Wasn't happy at all with the way Mr. Patterson left it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"It was a good read. The fast paced story and short chapters helped me read this in one sitting. I like the idea of the story and i like Max, but i feel that the story had to many \\"holes\\" in it. Although it is a series, i feel like the first book in a series can determine whether someone continues reading it or not. I felt that there wasn't enough depth in the characters. Also i felt the story was wasnt consistent. Some parts of it were written so well you could feel the mood of the situation; the tension, or the relief, but other parts felt rushed. There were some moments were i had to re-read a sentence, because some things had happened so abruptly.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER:[like when Ari died, although i understood it was supposed to be a quick death, i felt like it was too rushed, right after Max killed him she left. Furthermore it was hard to feel any sympathy for Ari when we knew so little about him. \\" at that moment i thought to myself \\"wait, thats it? He's dead?\\" i had wanted to know more about him.)SPOILER(END) SPOILER(END) SPOILER(END)In this story, i just wanted more, more depth, more emotion, more detailed interaction between the characters. Im not saying this book is bad, if it was i probably wouldnt have finished it. It just disappointed me at certain times. What i was expecting and what i got were two different things. I just didnt think the characters were going to be so short with each other. No one asked what happened to max when she went to help elle, or even what happened to her after talking to the man that was supposed to be a \\"father\\" to her. Or ask what actually happened to Angel in the lab. I am most likely going to read the second book because i do like the overall plot and i want to see what happens, maybe i might see more of what i wanted in the next book.

This type of writing is what gets young readers hooked on the wonderful world of getting lost in a book, living out other lives many times over.

I do not have a lot of time to read anymore; however, I just could not put this book down! Loved the plot and it seemed like I knew the characters so intimately. , Can't wait to read on in the next book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I really enjoyed reading Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment by James Patterson. The main character, Max, is a very strong and brave, but kind-hearted 14-year-old girl. She is the leader of a flock of kids- Iggy, Fang, Nudge, Gazzy, and Angel- who escaped from The School, a place where scientists experiment on children. Now they have wings and must stay hidden from society as well as from Erasers. Erasers are also from The School and they're trained to kill the flock.The characters all have very strong personalities. Even though every character has a different personality, they all work well together. The flock acts like a real family and keep each other safe. They also all seem like real and relatable people.I really like the author's style of writing. He uses just enough similes and metaphors for the reader to understand him. He makes the narrator, Max, seem like she is telling the story to a friend. He makes the book as realistic as someone could make a book about flying children be. I also like that Patterson wrote the book to feel more adventurous and dangerous than over-dramatic. He does a great job of letting the reader understand the problem at hand without making the situation seem whiny. He is very good at help the reader hear and see what the characters hear and see.The plot and action of the book is very different and interesting. Even though the plot is very peculiar, it does an amazing job of keeping the reader's attention. The strange twists throughout the entire book make the reader want to read chapter after chapter to find out what happens. There is a lot of action. Action scenes seem to happen almost every few chapters.The setting of the book is in many different places. The flock sometimes gets separated too, so the setting changes every chapter sometimes, but it's easy to follow and understand what is happening. Wherever the flock travels, the author does a great job of describing it. He uses descriptive words and imagery to give the reader an authentic feel of what the flock sees.This is one of the few sci-fi books that I liked. I loved how Max's personality was so strong throughout the entire book. I also enjoyed how Max would try to keep tough situations light by using humor. It makes the book more enjoyable. The book starts out action-packed which I really liked since usually the first few chapters of a book are the worst because they're so slow. This book starts and ends with action. I recommend Maximum Ride for anyone between the ages of 12-16. It will definitely be a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Max is a fourteen year old girl with a problem. She has wings. At birth, sick genetic scientist mixed her DNA to be 2% bird, and 98% human.After being freed along with five others like her, Max must hide from the enemy: Erasers. Half man, half wolf, all pretator.But when the Erasers find them, they take the youngest, and most dangerous, of the flock:Angel.Now Max and the others must find and save Angel from becoming a failed experament.Patterson son has created a cast of characters whom you cannot help but love. With Max and her snarky humorous self and the stubborn and loyal flock, this novel will keep you turning the pages with plenty of twist."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The book is titled The Angel Experiment, so one would assume that the plot is based on Angel's abduction. However that is just the beginning. Patterson seems to be rushimg through it. There is not enough detail nor is there a comclusion. zthe overall realism is pathetic. I still don't know where the climax is or the real problem. It seems whem they get taken back to the School, they ae rescued in the most unlikely manner, by a flock of hawks."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"As with all James Patterson books, I found this book to have good characters, a good idea, but awful writing. This is one of those times when I sit back and ask, \\"does James Patterson have any writing talent at all?\\" Honestly. My daughter is 14 and she can write much better than he. However, the book had funny characters that kept her going despite the writing. The series goes downhill from here, but this book isn't all that bad. If you're between the ages of 13 and 15, go on and try it for a quick, exhilarating read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I thought The Angel Experiment was a very interesting and well written book. In the beginning of this book however I did get a little confused. First I wasn't even sure if Max was male or female until about the fifth chapter. Also I felt like I didn't get any background information on anything. For instance, I didn't understand how they could fly, and at times in the beginning I didn't know if Max was dreaming or not. Although as the book progressed I began to get much more involved with each character. Some parts in the book were extremely unrealistic like how would a human not see a werewolf transforming in a restaurant, however this is what make it a fantasy book. Also at some points I did get slightly bored because I felt like it was repeating itself over and over by continually getting attacked by erasers. One last thing I would have liked to know is how is the voice inside Max's head and what's the point of the erasers if they're never going to really try and kill the main character. I also enjoyed the ending even though it never says what happens to the other mutants. It was a very good cliffhanger. Overall I did really enjoy the book and I've already started on the second one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximm Ride, by james Patterson is an epic book! The story has a great storyline and each character is unique in their own way. Maybe, with other series it gets boring, but with this one it's addicting. I like it because in each chapter a huge problem arises, it's a great page turner. Plus,if you want to read it to your kids or your class thats fine because its not confusing. Once you read Maximum Ride you'll love any book by James Pattison. But like in every book there is stuff i did not like. Because they talked about Iggys and Maxs And angel And last but not least Nudge old life. But they left out Fang and he's one of the main characters. I think because Fang is such a big part in the book, he should have a bigger part! But other than that it is the best book in the whole wide world!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Max Series is amazing. I have read every book and am waiting for Nevermore to come out. The stories are gripping and full of action. Once you start you cant put it down. If you like the books i would suggest the mangas."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I woke up at 6 in the morning to finish the book. I could not put this down! The only flaw was the way the author cramed two books into one...Minor spoilers start here (they end)I personally think the plotline about Angel being kidnapped should have been its own book. Then the rest about their journey in New York would also be a seperate book.Minor spoilers end hereNone of this effected my enjoyment of the book though! A must read!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I started reading thes series because it was on a high school recommended reader list and we received good marks if we read from the list. I immediately got hooked. I finished the book without putting it down when I returned home. When I went back to school, my first stop was the library to continue the series. Currently I'm on sitting on edge waiting for the next book in the series to hit."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have never read any James Patterson novels before and this looked interesting so I picked it up @ the local library.Maximum Ride is a girl about 14 years of age, Iggy is blind but a very intelligent 14 year old (4 months younger than Max), Fang is 11 years old, Nudge is 9 years old, The Gasman is 8 years old, and Angel is 6 years old. Together they are The Flock.The Flock are very enhanced mutant children with the ability to fly. But they have stayed in hiding for 5 years. So what happens when Angel gets kidnapped?There is some violent scenes against the Flock and the Erasers, they are wolves, and mild language. About 10 years old and above should read it. VERY GOOD!!!!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I've been seeing the \\"Maximum Ride\\" books strewn through my house for quite some time, and finally had to investigate whether the kids were on to a good thing this time or not. Well, now I will have to read the series!This is a fun read - though clearly intended for young and restless readers. Each \\"chapter\\" covers only a few pages, and the episodes are brief. Breaks between the action are just barely there. Plot developments are barely plausible much of the time, and generally involve desperate battles.But the basic story elements are all where they need to be, and the reader cannot help but be pulled in to this roller coaster of a series. Who can resist a young homeless teen girl struggling to be surrogate mom to a motley crew of younger children? While we are horrified at the plight of these kids - homeless, hunted, friendless, family-less - we also cannot help envying their strength, their speed, and most of all, THEIR WINGS.Compulsively readable despite its shallowness."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have to say, I was reluctant to try this book. At first it seemed very juvenile, but it really sucks you in and you wont be able to stop reading. It is fast paced, easy to read. The author does a great job developing the characters and I became attached to them. I cant wait to read the next one! This was a real treat!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I don't think this is the greatest book I have ever read by James Patterson. It wasn't all bad. It was a little hard for me to get into it, it's just not my type of story. But I did read it and now I want to know what happens so I'm going to be reading the rest in the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"the story is excellent to start out with, it keeps you reading from start to finish. i really loved the kids. a reader of any age can enjoy this sci-fi action adventure story. i fell in love with these kids and this story. heather belle, louisiana"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I recommend this book to all readers who want an exciting adventure and a book they can feast their eyes upon all day long! An amazing read; Patterson is a wonderful author who has a unique talent that he puts to paper with rewardable mental vigour.I would not recommend this book to those who rely solely on the author for mental images of characters. He describes Max well enough, but none of her friends have that solid image that everyone who reads 'The Angel Experiment' will have in their minds. I am slightly dissapointed in Patterson because I feel sorry for those select people I told you about. And at the same time I am glad that at least one author has gotten the point. Don't over characterize! If authors do that, they are not giving the reader a chance to decide what they want the character to look like. Sometimes readers are just not satisfied with how the author characterizes and they describe them their own way, with their own style. So I applaud Patterson for that. In making a marvelous book, and being one of the first authors in our generation who has managed to grasp hold of a big point in readers' satisfaction."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Ok, I'm an adult reading YA fiction. It was recommended by my 13-yo nephew and I like to be the \\"cool\\" aunt, keeping up with what the youngsters are doing. (\\"youngsters\\"? did I really say that?!?)The Angel Experiment: Maximum Ride, Vol. 1 held my interest to the very end. James Patterson is a great writer whether he is writing for adults or teenagers. He puts the same amount of energy into every chapter and creates a wholly believable set of circumstances around his unbelievable characters.I gave The Angel Experiment 4 out of 5 stars because...well...the cliffhanger was just way too predictable. I understand that Patterson is beginning a new series but does he have to make is so obvious? It's 464 pages and as I was coming upon page 350, I knew that we'd never answer all of the questions the plot had raised thus far. Honestly, I was waiting to read: \\"We'll see you next week. Same bat time. Same bat channel.\\" (again, did I date myself? *LOL) surprisingly though (and without giving too much of the plot away), a fair number of answers came out in the last 60 pages or so. That is not to say you can skip to the end to figure out the entire book.Also, there were issues that I'm sure will not be answered in the subsequent sequels. (It is difficult to talk about a book without giving the plot away, but I'll try.) For instance, no one else notices the Erasers? Dr. Martinez finds a tracking device in Max's arm, yet Max continuously asks how the Erasers are able to locate them so quickly? (Max is supposed to be the smart one!) Are we really expected believe that 6 flying kids are relegated to page 6 of The Daily News on only the second day after the event? What happens to the second band of mutants from The Institute? Did Fang just really let them go with Birdgirl?When I discussed the novel with my nephew, he was totally oblivious to my queries so, I guess, Patterson did his job. I completely recommend reading it from start to end and I will purchase the other three volumes in this series...if only to answer my own questions."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I thought this was a good read.

Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is simpl breath-taking! Always full of suspence and excitment. I highly recommend this book to other readers. Iggy and Fang cease to make me laugh and brighten my day! Very funny, well made, and very entertaining. Let's hear it for James Patterson!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is about six kids: Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gazman, and Angel who are are part of a scientific experiment that made the 98% human and 2% bird. When six year old Angel gets kidnapped by the \\"Erasers\\", Max and the gang have to go on an adventure to get her back. Along the way, they start learning about who they were before the experiments and that Jeb, their once father figure, was alive and has betrayed them.This book was so fun. It filled with action packed adventures, page after page. It was definitely a page turner. I always wanted to know what happened next, who was going to come up with what, and when they would have to run for lives....Again!I loved every single character. Each character brought their own elements to the book that made it so enjoyable. Max and Fang are my fave. You was the leader didn't want you to see her sensitive side, but that what made me like her so much. When you see her sensitive side it makes you think that, Oh yeah, she is only 14 years old. Fang is Mr. Dark and Mysterious, who never shows his emotions. So it was too cute when Fang and Max kissed when Fang got hurt. Everyone was in a state of shock, including Max and Fang. Iggy, Nudge and Gazmen are hilarious to me and Angel, I like her but something is kind of off there.Ari, I seriously didn't like you one bit. Jeb, how could you! But they brought out some of the best action in this book.The storyline was great. I loved where it went and how it develop. I was left satisfied. What threw me off in the beginning where the chapters. All the chapters are like 3 or 4 pages each. It threw me off a little bit. But I got use to it.Overall this book was great. It was a fun and a quick read. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good action pact adventure throughout the entire book and just love a good light read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"WARNING: SPOILERS! WELL, IT DOES CONTAIN SOME OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOKTitle: Maximum Ride: The Angel ExperimentAuthor: James Patterson--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This book is about the life of a fourteen-year-old girl names Max. Maximum Ride. And her family: Fang (14), Iggy (14), Nudge (11), The Gasman (8), and Angel (6).They are all experiments. They ended up 98% percent human, and 2% percent avian hybrid. In other speak, they are 2 percent bird. They have wings, enemies (Eraser, part wolf, part human), and each other. They used to be held in the School, and they never wanted to return. But they have to.Angel, the youngest, is kidnapped by blood thirsty Erasers, and taken to the School. Max and the flock have to save her, and the only way they can is if they have each other. Max goes trough anger, fighting. And maybe something with Fang, who is her best friend, the one she trusts most other than herself. They may be ready to be more than friends!I'm a Fax fan, and I love this book. Cleverly written, and I literally laughed out loud reading the snarky, sarcastic, and hilarious thoughts and remarks of Max and the others.GO FAX!!!!!

I was surprised when I found out who Ari was. My mom has read the whole series and said it's all very good. I am a teen and I think it is definitely a teen book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I really loved this book. The first book of maximum ride wasn't the best but it started me on this series which is AMAZING. I know some people thought this book was incomplete I however did not. But I also read this series in order in about 3 days so I didn't have to wait for the next book at all. I seriously could not put this book down I read this book in less than 2 hours and rushed out to the nearest store because I couldn't wait to get the next book. I personally did not think this was the best book in the series I liked Max, Fang, and angel the best but you have to read this one first. I cannot wait for the next book to come out February 2012. I was such a nerd I know when the last book comes out before amazon. Also this book is really open ended towards age groups and gender. I would recommend this book to anyone between 8 and ancient. I really loved this book and I know that my friends who read it think it is amazing."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I love these books, take it from me.

I sent the ones I finished to my daughter, and she loved them, and now my 13 year old grandson is reading them. The fit all ages."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I normally enjoy these types of books. I read the Twilight saga but I don\`t understand these books. If you like very fictional books, these are for you."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel Experiment is quite good, and very entertaining. Max is a character that is easy to like, the humor isn't too stressed, and the novelty of kids with wings is interesting.Also, this particular book has good direction; right away there is a clear goal that needs to be accomplished, and while later in the book the kids just fly around New York for a while, the beginning really helps to hold the rest together.The first book in this series is 'okay', but the rest of the books are a repetition of the end of the first one; plotless bits of, \\"Let's go here!\\" The books are headed nowhere and have a lot of loose ends."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Right from the beginning, this book was like one high-intensity climax after another. After less than 100 pages in, all I wanted the characters to do is sit around and stare at each other for awhile, let me breathe. The basic premise of the plot was hide from the bad guys, run when they found you, escape and retaliate when they caught you... and repeat. Things did not seem to get really interesting until after page 200, when the group of winged kids started discovering new abilities.There are lots of things that don't get explained - which I understand some lack of explanation is necessary to draw out a series - but these kids don't know anything about themselves or even why they exist. The oldest one, Max, is 14, and she can't even deduce that the chip in her arm is how to Erasers keep finding them. I probably would have enjoyed this book much more if the reader could have been privy to the mind of Jeb Batchelder, who was once-acting father of this group of kids and keeps claiming throughout the book that he is one of the good guys. By the end of the book, the kids have cross the U.S. in flying distance, but have yet to really solve any of their problems or get any significant question answered, unless you count parentage.Another thing that really annoyed me was the length of the chapters, which were no more than 4 pages in length. I get that this is a YA novel, but a 400 page book with 134 chapters is kind of absurd. Mostly, the chapter breaks were used to switch viewpoints between the various characters, and lengthening the chapters in favor of cutting the quantity of chapters would not have harmed this.There were some touching moments in the book that I wish could have been drawn out, such as Max being with the Rodriguez family, Fang and Nudge interacting with the birds, or the kids being in the New York City toy store, but these moments seemed to be grossly overshadowed by the action and suspense.Normally, I am a big fan of YA literature, but I think this one is a bit too young even for me."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Maximum Ride series is AWESOME. They are so funny, and full of action. They are almost never boring. For people who say it's totally unrealistic, I encourage you to keep reading the series. James Patterson talks about real world problems like global warmimg and pollution. Sure, flying bird kids may not be real but it's fun to imagine and I think Patterson makes it sound real. I think these books are amazing ad everyone should read them!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was suspenseful, yet written in a young teen's humorous voice. This book was absolutely a page turner, forwards and backwards. What I mean by this is; the plot was full of that \\"I NEED TO READ MORE\\", but there were times where you had to flip back a couple pages, and re-read certain things to fully understand.I did like the characters, but just a warning, there's quite a few, and they may be easy to mix up.This book was written in the form where the main character is the narrator. But the fun thing about it, is that there were chapters where you were brought into the other characters mind. This helps explain the characters, which in some areas, this book lacked. Only near the end of the book do you find out the character's appearance, which can throw you for a loop.This book has a lot going on, and for the majority of the book, you felt as if you too were experiencing the stressful days with Max, Fang, Angel, Nudge, Gazzy and Iggy. But certain areas near the end of the book seemed slightly rushed.The idea of the story, which is young humans with animal DNA ( you have to figure out the rest ) is interesting, uncommon and fuels up a great read.In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone who respects books with sci-fi, suspense, and flickers of romance and humor. This would be a good book for ages 10 and up. This isn't a personal favourite, but i might consider reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is my favorite series that I have ever read! I'm a 12 year old girl and my friends love it too. I read some reviews that people wrote saying that it shouldn't have been written like it is. I totally disagree.

I absolutly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I gave it a try since it was free. I didn't know it was a series.

I repeatedly stayed up late to see what happened. Text to speech not enabled. I like to listen on my way to work. The book was geared to teens, but I'm in my 40s and loved it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Not normally a fan of fantasy, I found myself repeatedly putting a low priority on reading this first book in the Fugitives series, in spite of my 11-year-old son zipping through all six books in a matter of weeks. When I finally read it, I was pleasantly surprised. Although the logistics of things like - exactly how the retracted wings look, their attachment, and how they formed after the feat of genetic engineering required to \\"make\\" them (at a scary sounding research lab known as the School) is left a bit vague, and the author's use of the active voice seems extreme at times, imaginative readers will likely get as wrapped up in this action packed story about six \\"mutant\\" creatures (98% human, 2% avian) and their adventures involving their evil counterparts (the Erasers, part wolf) as I did. Fourteen-year-old Maximum, leader of the flock of six, ranging in age from four months younger than Ms. Ride to six years old, calls the shots, which involves occasional Notes to Self, e.g., \\"Give subconscious a pep talk re: better dreams.\\" For the most part, though, she uses split-second decision-making skills. In this first book, the Erasers kidnap Angel for use in performing cruel and extensive experiments. And in spite of the winged-kids' near humanness, lab workers treat her poorly. Due to Maximum's sense of justice (and a desire to help a fellow female), she gets sidetracked before the rescue can begin. Several surprises (including the appearance of an unexpected person, and a revelation about an enemy) take place as they attempt to retrieve their flockmate as well as while they try to solve the mystery of how they came to be: specifically, how they ended up at the School in the first place. The cliffhanger ending will likely leave readers needing to know more about the fate of these brave and crazy winged kids. Maximum Ride is an excellent, action-packed, fast-paced story about a flock of extraordinary genetically engineered winged kids. Also good: The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, the Gregor the Overlander series also by Suzanne Collins, and Coraline on audio CD read by the author, Neil Gaiman."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Maximum Ride series is a fast-paced collection of books, similar to Harry Potter, that I LOVED!

Max is the oldest of the six members of her family, or as they refer to themselves as the flock. The others are fang- a boy who is four months younger than max. Iggy- who was blinded by experimentation on his sight at the lab. Nudge- a young girl who talks non-stop. And two kiddies, the Gasman- an eight year old boy with persistent intestinal problems. And Angel, his six year old sister. Max and her companions were kept in cages and subject to repeated scientific experiments during their life at the School (the lab). They were eventually freed by one of the lab scientists (also known as whitecoats) named Jeb Batchelder. Jeb brought them to his mountain home and raised and educated them ever since. But then one day Jeb suddenly disappeared two years ago and the flock has been on it's own since then. Suddenly, erasers (experimental beings also developed at the lab who can morph into powerful wolf-like creatures) raid the family's mountain hideaway and kidnap Angel. It's up to the flock to save her.CONFLICT/RESOLUTION: Angel gets kidnapped by erasers and it's up to the rest of the flock to save her. That might lead to Max having to save the world.SETTING: Maximum ride and her flock- Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. Late summer in New York City."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I liked the book all together because of the humor, action, and love in the book. I also liked the setting and the plot of this book. This should be a movie sometime soon :)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I borrowed this book from the library because my little brother has to read it in class, and I figured he might need some help understanding it with it being by James Patterson and all. This is officially my first James Patterson book and it's quite good for that age range. I have no problem that my brother will (mostly) understand it, and that he may actually enjoy it. He's not a big reader- other than Naruto, Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Captain Underpants- so I should probably reserve judgement on whether he'll enjoy it, or even finish it.\\"We were bird kids, a flock of six. And the Erasers wanted to kill us.\\" (26)Max and the rest of her mutant flock are a rare breed that have been experimented on and tortured before breaking loose and finding their safe haven. After being found and kidnapped by their torturers, they must find and keep freedom again all while searching for answers of their past and evolving their own powers. They learn that flying isn't all they can do. In a rush of fast paced adventure, Max, Fang, Gasman, Iggy, Nudge and little Angel try to survive the Whitecoats and Erasers on their journey of liberation and self-discovery.\\"Sometimes it felt as if we would never be free, be safe. Never, ever, as long as we lived. Which might not be that much longer, anyway.\\" (326)On my part, I found the adventure that Max and her flock are thrust into, quite thrilling. On the other hand, 134 chapters+ Prologue+ Epilogue is extremely excessive, especially since the chapters were only 2-3 pages long and could have easily been combined. Perhaps this is a method by Patterson to make his young reader's feel like they have achieved a lot, but I'm not sure. I also found everything in the book to become redundant. Repetitive actions and scenarios just added more paper throughout the book and just kept putting the characters through the same ringer every time. Something else that nagged me in the book (mostly during the first, oh, 40 chapters) is how we, the reader, continued to be put through switches of point of view. Sometimes it would be in first and second person (Max) and then other times it would be in third person. After a while I just shrugged it off and ignored it because after a certain point it only continued in first person. All this being said, I did like the plot and with the unfinished ending I may, one day, seek out the next book in the series and give it a read. I'm also more interested in reading other James Patterson works as well, and as I found while browsing in the bookstore, there's a lot out there.\\"Is it important to be right or is it important to do what's right?

The Maximum Ride series was the first series that got me interested in reading for fun. It was fast paced and kept me interested. I'm 18 now and now I caught some of the jokes more then I did when I was younger. It's a bigger book, but it's a fast paced book. Although it's geared toward younger teens, it's enjoyable at any age.

This book is so action pack and so much drama! The best book ever!!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My mom told me maximum ride was really popular and said i should read it. So i picked it up and just let the pages fly! it has a really good story one that will make you want to not stop reading it. And there will be a sequel coming soon! and maybe a movie! [...]also... When the wind blows and the lake house according to the website have nothing to do with maximum ride they are a totally differant series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Let's say your 14 years old and have always wanted to fly away from your problems. What would you do? Where would you go? Who would be there along for the journey? Well, if your 14 year old Max (aka Maximum) Ride, be sure to buckle up; it's gonna be a very bumpy ride.In the novel, Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment, we are introduced to Max and her compainions Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman and Angel (known has The Flock). They are a group of young children who where born and raised in a genetics lab call the School, where they where given avian DNA at the time of their birth. Thus, The Flock is only 98% human and 2% bird, leaving them with wings and other mutant abnormalities. The novel fast forwards you to when The Flock are living a care-free life (the person who rescued them, Jeb, has disappeared two years ago) in the mountains. Suddenly, a group of other mutants from the School called Erasers (who are part human, part wolf), rain on their parade and kidnap Angel. Max and the other children then are off in a frantic search and rescue mission, as well as other surprises that might test young heroes.James Patterson, who is famous for the Alex Cross series, has managed to create a delightful spin-off from the characters that where mentioned in his two pervious books, When the Wind Blows and The Lake House. Granted, I have not read any other of Patterson's books until now, but I have become a fan! Patterson's characters are fresh and engaging, making you want to continue to read and explore the novel. Max is a much needed change of the teenage herione. Max doesn't have to worry about boys, the school dance, or being popular. She has much more complex issues to deal with (such has the constant reminder that she is destined to save the world; among other things).I also enjoied how Patterson manages to keep the action going. Once The Flock has entered a new surrounding, it makes you want to discover how they will adapt to it. Weather its gallvanting on a beach or just going into a toy store, Patterson makes sure that his charcters have an interesting time and always discover something new about themselves in the process.However, I have found (and have quickly noticed), that Patterson often has extremely short chapters (there's even a chapter that has a total of one page!). To me, this is a bit fustrating. Just has you get into one section, Patterson immedeatly drops you into another one; almost identical as the last! Still, this strategy works, as it enages the reader and makes you want to continue reading the book until the last page. Also, the whole book seems underdeveloped. You get basic discriptions of places and characters, but it would help if Patterson spent a little more time on developing these attributes instead of writting short, pointless chapters.But still, Patterson has created a great story that he will be continuing in the near future (it has been reported that the sequel will be coming out in 2006). If you are looking for a teen novel that doesn't use all of the typical cliques of the teen genra, then Maximum Ride is the perfect book for you!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If you are an adult considering reading this book, then don't bother (I did not know it was a kids book when I began reading it). It is a very poorly written story with zero suspension of disbelief. I only made it about 60 pages into the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Beyond the bad writing/dialog, I simply could not relate to a main character who is supposedly grieving beyond comprehension because her loved one was taken to be tortured and killed, but in route to rescue her she stops for a nap that turns into a slumber. After wasting all that time sleeping, she gets sidetracked again because she sees some kid who may be getting picked on that she has to stop to help... Really?? Loved one tortured and killed vs a kid maybe being picked on and you delay for that... Nice priorities! I'm sure it gets much worse than that, but that is where I had to stop."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have just recently finished the third book in the Maximum Ride series, and let me tell you, it is not worth your time. The back story is lacking, and only consists of Max (short for Maximum) briefly talking about what happened before you (the reader) came into play. The story then catapults into a broken record plot line of \\"The Bad Guys\\" showing up at wherever the group is, with the group narrowly escaping while making \\"The Bad Guys\\" look as foolish and inexperienced as possible. Repeat Plot line for all books, with a small dash of originality thrown in.RECAP:1. Would be a great gift for a young reader. (It does seem like it was written by someone under the age of 12.)2. Not so great for an older reader (15 and up)3. Don't read this, and hope that it gets better, it doesn't."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I personally loved this book. It had action, suspense, and drama. What more could you ask for from a mystery? The book is about a girl named Maximum Ride more commonly know as Max. She and her \\"family\\", Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and Angel know what is like to soar above the rest of the world. They have wings! Most people would think this was pretty cool but they would give anything to be normal and have parents. You see they were genetically engineered to fly by the most despicable scientists imaginable. Although they are not the only half-human creations to come from the \\"School\\" just the only ones who aren't completely insane. There are also the viscious Erasers that are half-human half-wolf monstousities that are used as the School's hunters. Throughout the book they are hounded by these beasts and become one step closer to finding the truth about who they are and where they came from. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Okay this was my first James Patterson book I've ever read and I think he got very close to Harry Potter (the first one since the 4-6 are showing less potential in the series) as in quality of the book. I started this book at noon and stayed up till 2 in the morning finishing it. Easy to say that this book is incredible hard to put down. Reason some James Patterson fans are shying away from this book is because they heard it was more of a teen book. Yes the characters in the book are mainly ages 6-14 but by no means is this book just for teens. Its for teens just as much as adults. No matter the audience it will take you for a ride. The title sums it all up along with the main character MAXIMUM RIDEHope this helps ya out if your not sure to buy this book or not."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I got this book because I am sure I've read something else by James Patterson, yet nothing looks familiar. When I started the book I didn't think I was going to like it. By the end of the book I find myself looking forward to reading the sequel. I thought JP did a good job with his characters, making them quite believable under the circumstances. Reading the other reviews, people found many of his plot devices too facile or bemoaned the lack of a true ending. Regardless, I read fiction to be entertained and this book truly entertained me. I am a mature adult and did not realize this book was geared towards children until I looked it up online. That alone, in my opinion, makes it a good book. Not only will teens enjoy it but adults as well."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"i loved this book because it's about people who have wings. i also liked this book because james patterson does a really good job portraying what it would be like to be a teen who has wings. he also describes things so well that you think you're right there watching it. to people who like to read sci-fi books this is a great book for you."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I am in love with this book! It mixes action, adventure, mystery, even a little romance... You fall in love with the good characters so quickly, and you end up hating the bad characters quickly, too. I found myself cheering on my favorite character in the battles, and when they get hurt, I felt bad for them. All in all, I absolutely love this book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I'm usually not a person who reads for fun but this book had me glued to the couch reading it. It combines humor, action, and suspense. This combination along with it being an easy read makes this book a winner. I recommend this book for anyone. Patterson is a wonderful writer and his genius shows in his work. He's got a way with words that makes the characters that more fun to learn about and the whole book that much more fun to read. Two thumbs way up!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel Experiment is a quick, light read. It's decently entertaining, and targeted, I'm sure, towards a younger more reluctant reader. Although I may have been just a little disappointed that my personal view didn't match up with the high ratings from others, I think the series shows promise for the subsequent installments.The writing was very basic, and not very interesting at all. I'm not sure James Patterson is the kind of author who can right from a 14 year old girl's point of view, especially seeing as he's a 63 year old man (not saying no male author can do this, just saying it didn't work out in this case.) At times, The Angel Experiment lacked substance, and more than once some of the characters came off as bad actors with clearly staged lines, rather than realistic people.The plot, while adventurous, was predictable and repetitive. The idea is so creative and original, and I can't help but feel that the quality of the writing and the monotonous plot take away from that. The rescue only takes place in the first half of the book. After that it pretty much goes downhill. A big chunk of the book was dedicated to switching back and forth from running from the Erasers, and descriptions of the large quantities of food they ate, without any other plot progression. The ending was a bit abrupt, and the resolution of their goal in the book was very anticlimactic; it was just rushed right through.Aside from the negatives, I did like the characters; they're probably the only reason I liked the book at all. They show a lot of promise for future books, and are the sole reason I will continue to read the series. I think they all complimented each other well, and I loved the way they interacted with one another. They each had their own distinctive personalities. Max was a motherly type who looked over the flock. She was a strong character, and always looked out for the underdog. I liked Fang a lot too, and I can sense some future romance between him and Max, which I'm really excited for.While I, personally, may not have enjoyed The Angel Experiment as much as I had expected, I can say it would be a good book for reluctant readers. And I will continue to read the series, if only for the characters and the hope that the series gets better with each new installment.Reviewed at: [...]"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson is a prolific and accomplished writer. He has skillfully crafted a YA urban fantasy about kids infected by scientists with a virus that gives them extraordinary powers. The story is original and suspenseful. However, IMO it would appeal to preteens rather than older teens or above. The five star rating is given for interested young teens. Adults would find it interesting and a quick read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"\\"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment\\" appealed to both the kid and the adult in me. If you love plot-driven storytelling, this novel will capture your attention. I enjoyed Maximum Ride as a character - a 14-year-old girl who can fly and hangs out with a bunch of kids who've become her family. The quest to free Angel, Max's little sister, is very absorbing. This series is a great escape and well suited to the modern attention span, with short chapters and plenty of action."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Fantastic novel for MG readers, even YA-ers would still get a kick out of it. Fast moving with dialogue that is appropriate for the youngest readers. There are no swear words, though they are comically implied. It's easy to begin to care for the characters and this is a book that would be enjoyed by adults as well* Caveat, if you're looking for YA/Crossover angst or love, it ain't in here. It's pure adventure with a multicultural cast of engaging teenagers.*This ain't exactly War and Peace here. It is sophmoric \\"literature,\\" but it's fun! Pick it up, you'll be done with it by the end of the day and you'll be happier because of it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The one thing I always liked about James Patterson novels is that you only need half a brain cell to keep up with the storyline. His books are the epitome of easy reading. And while they might not be the most well written things to hit the shelves, I usually walk away from them thinking \\"Hm, that was pretty good.\\" But, of course, those are his adult novels.His \\"kid novels\\" are a whole other monster.After reading the Dangerous Days of Daniel X (which was bad, you can read my huge rant on it in my review), I was not too excited to start this one. But, it seemed to get high reviews, so I gave it a shot. The first thing I saw wrong were the characters. Mr. Patterson, names like \\"The Gasman, Nugde, and Iggy\\" aren't \\"hip\\" and won't catch your young audience's attention. I think they'd be fine if you just used their real names.The Erasers were a big problem, too. They weren't very intimidating, if you ask me. Going around saying things like \\"What'd you say, Dipstick?\\" isn't very threatening. And they kept showing up like every two pages. Okay, we get it. They're searching for them.Also, how many powers can James Patterson think of for these kids? \\"oh look, I can breathe underwater!\\" \\"Lookie here, I can touch a computer and know who worked there!\\" \\"Wowzers, I can pick even the most difficult lock in seconds!\\" \\"Did you know I can influence people with my mind?\\" The list goes on. It's almost like if Patterson couldn't think of a solution to a problem the characters were going through, he would just grant a power that would fix that problem to one of the characters.However, this book did have its strong points. I liked the whole \\"Voice\\" section. Granted, you never really know who the Voice is, but hopefully in the sequels that will be revealed. Max was also an interesting character, and her sarcasm was much appreciated. The storyline was good as well, but of course, that's James Patterson's strong point.Overall, this is a high two stars. It was better than Daniel X, and enough to make me want to read the sequels, but I could have easily lived without reading it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I got this book when it was free in the Kindle store and read it within a few days. It had nice pacing and kept me mildly interested, but it seemed to drag on after a while with what seemed to be \\"filler action\\" that was relatively unrelated to the plot. At the beginning of the novel, I was entertained by these kids who were grown with wings and wanted to know more about the concept. The action started immediately and sucked me into the story, but after a while it became repetitious.It followed a predictable pattern: everything is good, bad stuff happens, more bad stuff happens, things go back to being good, rinse and repeat. It almost seemed like too much over-dramatized conflict, and might have been better if it was a) shorter and got to the point or b) had more depth to the story.Predictably, whenever the situation arose, the characters opted against progressing the storyline. Of course. How else would Patterson make another 3+ books to make profit from if he didn't drag it out and keep you waiting for answers? Typically, I'm okay with that, but it reads as if the story was churned out quickly, and reviews for the other books in the series suggest the same thing. Patterson is known for spitting out books quickly.This book is probably perfect for a younger age group, which is admittedly the target audience. I couldn't recommend it to anyone older than maybe 15 unless you wanted something out of the ordinary for a fast read. After finishing it, I didn't even give a second thought to purchasing the rest of the series. It was only slightly annoying, and I no longer really cared to have my questions answered. I'm glad it was free when I got it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I got this book free for my kiddle app. The first book I downloaded just to check the app out before I spent money on a \\"real\\" book.

Well that is what happened to me with not only this book but the entire series. After reading the Angel Expirement I immediatley got the second one and then the third and I just finished the fourth. And that has all been within 1 week. And actually I came to Amazon just now to get the 5th book. I was hooked from the get go. And I am not a teen...far from it.

I had no idea of the plot, nor did I know until finishing it and seeing the reference to the website [...] that it was the first of a series of books. I had assumed it being a James Patterson novel that this would be a crime mystery or something of the sort.You can imagine the first chapter took me by surprise when I realized the book was about a bunch of mutant kids with wings running from wolf-people. I considered just stopping right then but decided to press on. I'm glad I did.Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment introduces the reader to a plucky group of children, aged 6 through 13, who escaped from a research lab where their DNA had been altered so that they were part bird, part human. Blessed (or cursed!) with wings, superhuman strength, and some other unique skills, they were making a life for themselves in an isolated and remote cabin in the country when suddenly they are finally tracked down by the lab (called The School), attacked, and lose the youngest of the flock, Angel (who can read people's minds) back to the scientists and their wolf-people henchmen.The oldest and the leader of the group, Maximum Ride (she picked the name herself), rallies the group to return to the school and rescue Angel. During their trek back to the place of their nightmares, they each learn a little more about their past and their character.This is a fun and more than a little silly book. I've never read the Twilight vampire series but I imagine it is similar to this. I bet this is a popular series with teenagers. With Max just entering her teens, I can imagine all sorts of drama emerging as she deals with becoming a woman.It is a very crisp read and if you are looking for a guilty pleasure, even for adults, I recommend picking it up, especially since it is free on the Kindle.

That is sort of like me act now think later type. I hope that everything turns out all right for her and her flock, but with the Erasers, Jeb returning, and the constant running it doesn't look like the flock will ever have any rest & relaxation (r&r). Ari and Max do have a lot of things in common though, they both have that killer instinct, they are both powerful, and they both are to young to be in a constant war with each other.

It reminded me of a Harry Potter type thing; whereas kids and adults could enjoy it. The story is very entertaining and the action is literally non-stop. The plot develops quickly and the chapters are paced to be quick and short, which encourages you to keep turning pages. Although some of the topics and language can be a bit juvenile, the story comes through with ingenuity and a breath of fresh air. If you want to take a fun SCI-Fi trip with a mix of X-men and a family friendly story, this is definitely a fun read. JP: please make something similar in a more mature series, I would buy it instantly! Thank you JP for making my 4.5 hour layover in Chicago not a big deal!

It is impossible to put down - you instantly fall in love with all the characters and feel a part of their journey. I will warn you though, once you read this you will be hooked on the series.

This is an exciting tale that moves at a fast clip, but the ending does (unfortunately) leave some unanswered questions. The suspenseful chase of the Flock by the Erasers (who want the Flock dead to keep the experiment that created the Flock a secret) almost makes up for the too-abrupt ending. But if you like non-stop action with characters you really care about, Maximum Ride is a joy ride. Also read An Audience for Einstein, another very good novel that blends genres well."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Heard an audio tape selection of this book online and was hooked from the very first page.

Also, it does leave you with a lot of questions, but that's why I'm about to start reading the second one. I love this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I waver between giving three or four stars for \\"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment\\". The book really deserves three, but for some reason I found myself scouring the bookstore the next day for the sequel (they were sold out, unfortunately). This is because, while \\"The Angel Experiment\\" is far from great literature, or even great kids' literature, the premise of the promised trilogy is still engrossing, and, at least at some level, \\"The Angel Experiment\\" delivers.Even though I'm going to college this fall, I still occasionally indulge myself in a book really written for adolescents--perhaps because I have designs on writing for adolescents myself. If there are others like me, though, I would far more strongly reccomend Kenneth Oppel's \\"Silverwing\\" trilogy, for fans of winged critters who prefer a somewhat more engaging series with far better characterization. And for the ultimate in young adult trilogies, Phillip Pullman simply cannot be beaten.That said, \\"The Angel Experiment\\" is about angels on Earth--six of them, kids genetically engineered for a reason that will probably be explained in a later book. (In reading, my mind kept switching between N.A. Noel paintings and Ben Foster from \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\".) The book is about them trying to survive while being chased by lethal werewolves called Erasers. The plot never gets more complicated than that, but it's still truly fun to picture these genetic outcasts both trying to stay inconspicuous by mingling with human society and also coping with their obvious differences.The hugest issue with the book is, as other reviewers have mentioned, that it is phenomenally episodic, and the episodes don't get much different. There is a trap, the flock is attacked by Erasers, they fly away. This happens at least six or seven times. You would think, if scientists really wanted to recapture FLYING kids, they would try to do it with another breed of avians. But no, for some reason, Ari and the other werewolves like to stand around making pathetic taunts, giving members of the flock plenty of time to just... fly... away. There does seem to be some underlying theme here that the scientists don't REALLY want the flock dead, but tell that to the Eraser who misses little Nudge by a half-inch with a bullet!The best part about this novel is that, however shallow the characters may be at times, it's fantastically easy to fall in love with them. They're fun and, despite constantly sounding far too old for their age (I assume it's a genetic enhancement thing), they're believable. (I also had fun leafing through one of the characters' online \\"blog\\"--probably a goofy side project of the author's.) There are a few bizarre choices, like a little winged boy named for his tendency to flatulate (whaaa?), but there's also the nice touch of a black family member, Nudge, a blind boy, Iggy, and the truly creepy presence of little psychic Angel (apparantly, they let the six-year-old take the obvious code name).This little family of six brings to my mind another family of six superteens constantly in fear of their lives, six teens whose adventures K.A. Applegate turned into the best-loved children's sci-fi series of all time. Will Maximum and her ragtag crew of avian adventurers ever be as good as the Animorphs? Undoubtedly not. But kids will find much to smile over and dream about. And, should I falter in my resolve not to slip back into sappy juvenile sentimentality, I too may find myself in my sleep soaring with the hawks, flying for my life, but as free as... well, as an angel."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson has a large following, although I have never been a great fan; with that in mind, you may choose to take this review with a grain of salt from the start.A back-cover blurb by the Toronto Sun characterizes this book as \\"practically ready-made for a movie script.\\" Indeed. The question is whether this is a compliment or a criticism. Like most Patterson stories, this one keeps the story on a largely visual, on-the-surface level: it's a description of what the characters are doing and saying, rather than what they're experiencing or thinking. Internal dialogue is provided by italicizing the character's \\"thoughts.\\" While this is a common literary device, Patterson over-utilizes to such an extent that the book starts to feel like a comic book, complete with \\"word balloons\\" and \\"thought bubbles.\\" Skillful writers should be able to tell the reader what the characters are thinking without actually TELLING the reader what the characters are thinking (if you take my meaning).As a writer, Patterson has never been long on character development or exposition; most of his \\"chapters\\" don't run much more than two pages or so (this book has a cool 133 chapters...and an epilogue!). Believe it or not, just about every chapter has a glaring instance of deus ex machina--which means every other page or so, the characters are saved from some dastardly fate or another by some clunky plot device.In fact, the story is quite reminiscent of the old Saturday serials, where every installment ended with a cliffhanger...only to have this cliffhanger quickly resolved, almost as an afterthought, in the first minute or two of the next installment. An outline of the story would run something like this: Ch1--meet the characters. Ch2--characters are in danger. Escape seems impossible. Ch3--characters escape danger. Ch4--Characters are in danger. No escape seems possible. Ch5--characters escape danger. After about twenty chapters (or, to put it another way, about forty pages), the reader stops believing that the danger is real--some \\"dramatic\\" (or, if you prefer, hackneyed) escape is a foregone conclusion.The book is not without its saving graces, however. Patterson does a respectable job of keeping the largely first-person narrative grounded believably in the voice of a fourteen year old girl (a more cynical reviewer might suggest that most of Patterson's books read in a similar manner...even those that aren't actually ABOUT fourteen year old girls). The protagnoists manage to be endearing at times, almost in spite of Patterson's refusal to attempt any kind of in-depth characterization (although the bad guys, without exception, lack any kind of clear motivation or animus...they're \\"bad\\" just because they are).Patterson is a former advertising copywriter, and that background seems to have had a permanent influence on his brief, to-the-point style. That doesn't make his books bad, but it certainly keeps them from being anything more than average."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Really interesting germs of ideas and characters. Repetitive plot sequences Juvenile. I think many kids except perhaps very young ones would be bored by this book and would certainly feel short changed by the ending. I agree with the reviewer that said this read like a comic strip. I was very surprised since the author is so popular."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Best book ever. Period.Most of the bad reviews about this book are because of the short chapters. Well, the reason they are short, is because the only time I could pry myslef away from this AMAZING book was at the end of a chapter. It is for the readers best.As for the book, so much action, stategy, and cliff-hangers it seems to bemuch longer. And the longer it lasts, the better. More Max, more story. I have read this book 6 times, and was just as exciting every time. MAX FOREVER! :D"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was a good book, it kept my attention for the whole book. The only thing I can say is this really is a young adult book. I love James Patterson books, and don't get me wrong it was a great book, but it is a young adult book ages 13-18. I have not read any of the other books in the series and I am sure I will when I need a quick pick up book. If you are thinking about buying this book it will not be a waste of your money, you will enjoy this book.

Fang is probably my favorite character because he is so, well, mysterious I guess. I love how Max narrorates the books and that its like she's just sitting there telling you the story instead of you reading it. These books pretty much make me ignore everything around me while I'm reading them and I tend to not stop reading them until I'm done, even if that takes a long time. I found myself breezing through the Maximum Ride series faster than I've ever read a book before, not because they were short, but because of the storyline. It's amazing! It makes you want to keep reading and find out if the Erasers get the flock or whats going to happen to Fang and even if someone is going to die or not! I think they are the perfect books for people who dont like to read very much, or just people who have no idea what to read next because there is something for everyone in these books.

The thing is, I can only read a lot if I LIKE the book. If don't like it, it takes me forever to read! But with the Maximum Ride series, couldnt put the books down.

Read through the book so as to see what the storyline entailed. It is a good read, interesting story and moved along at a good pace."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The good: the book is written in a well-paced, conversational style that's quite easy to read. There's a lot of humor interspersed with the action scenes, which helps to keep the reader engaged. The protagonists are both distinctive and likable, though the depths of character development have yet to develop.The bad: though tagged \\"young adult\\", the emphasis should be on \\"adult\\". There's a fair bit of violence described in the book - it's not horribly graphic or gory, but it does, for instance, describe electrical shocks applied to a young child, which was quite enough to horrify ME.This is definitely not a stand-alone book. Although it ends at a natural pause in the action, it is clear one must buy future books to resolve the major plot-lines and answer the various questions the book raises about what's really going on."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was the very first book I read from James Patterson and he became my favorite author ever since."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The book Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment by James Peterson is an excellent book. This series was recommended to me by a friend who loves fantasy and fiction. Out of the whole series, I think that this book is the best. It is the beginning of the series and is very entertaining. I couldn't put this book down from the minute I started reading it.This book is about a group of kids who have certain genetic enhancements. There are six kids named Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman and Angel. Their special genetic enhancements are that they are 98% human and 2% avian (bird). For as long as they can remember, they have been at a scientific lab that they have nicknamed The School. At this lab, they are constantly tested because they are one of the successful experiments.You know that this book is going to be good in the first few chapters. Unlike most books where they have to give all the background information and the books starts slow, Maximum Ride takes off. To start the book off, erasers capture Angel. Erasers are another experiment by The School. The erasers are like the guard dogs of The School. They listen to the scientists and have to capture the flock (the avian kids) when they escape. After Angel is captured, the flock has to get her back from The School. Along the way back to the school a lot of stuff happens. Max is shot when she helps a girl named Ella, the Gasman and Iggy set off a bomb that kills a ton of erasers and Fang and Angel fly with the hawks.When the flock finally saves Angel, Max learns that there is a chip in her arm and the Voice in her head. When Max first hears from the Voice, she has terribly painful headaches and sometimes passes out cold. This Voice leads her to an Institute in New York City that has experiments that have gone terribly wrong. Because the flock themselves are experiments are want to help the kids out.From this short explanation of the book I hope that you can see the entertainment and excitement that this book holds. I loved this series. It holds action, mystery and just a little bit of romance. All of this makes the book Maximum Ride a best seller. Although many people may not have heard of this book I grantee that it is almost as good as the Twilight series. However, while the Twilight series is a love story based on mythical creatures, the Maximum Ride series will give you the same thrill. Max is on a mission to save the world. With her flock at her back they can do anything.I would suggest this book for teenagers, however adults can read this book too. It is easy reading and something that you can't put down. For all of you who love adventure, mystery, romance and action, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"You will fall in love with these characters. You will laugh at their goofy senses of humor, your heart will break for their tragedy, and you will be amazed by their ability to persevere. This series is about a group of kids who have no one in the world but each other. The love and bond they have together as a family is strong and endearing. The story is captivating and creative (and most importantly never boring)!This story is a combination of teen drama, humor, science fiction, and fantasy adventure. You get the sense that you are embarking on an epic adventure. The story reads as though you are seeing it on a big screen or playing a character along side the kids in a video game. It is an epic tale of suffering, good versus evil, choices, and friendship. This series is great for teens and adults alike."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Too much repetition in the dialog, and comic book like fantasy. It got better as it went along so I read number two and three.A less well written \\"Twilight-type\\" fantasy series, mostly harmless for the young adult reader. I wouldn't be thrilled if my son read books like this exclusively, though I've read the first three books pretty quickly so there must be something to them. Hence the three stars. If it weren't so cold I'd call them good \\"beach books\\". Fluff with a lot of action and likable characters. The writing is just not demanding or enlightening in the quality of descriptions or the smoothness of the plots. I've read a lot of fantasy and some of them feel real. These plot turns and histories are awkward and artificial. Kind of like a comic book without pictures.In sum. Easy to read, harmless, and mildly entertaining.A much better series for young adult and adult fantasy is the Bartameus Trilogy. Deep Character traits that grow with each book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is truely the best book i have ever read.

I know it's hard to believe but there are other nerds out there like yourself. Anyway back to the point, I picked up this book @ the Dollar Store. It is the best darn book I ever bought from there. It is so great, I cried myself to sleep over this book. It is a heart-wrenching story of young lovers in the city, with mutant freaks thrown into the book. More than that, it is about love and prosperity. It gives all something to hope for. It gives us a reason to live. My mom says this book is a waste of brain space, but my family put her in a home 2 days ago, so I guess that will teach her to give us her 2 cents.

Good story, interesting characters, not in any way predictable."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I started to get a bad feeling when Max says \\"Okay, maybe I can't cook, but I can still kick your butt.\\" That was my writing style in elementary school. The dialogue looks like it was written by a third grader.The story centers around stuck up, Mary Sue Maximum Ride, our witty, sarcastic hero who has a comeback for every moment. Everyone loves her, she is amazing and perfect, and I read the book a couple times and could find no flaws other than the fact that she can't cook.The series reads like a soap opera. She stops mid-rescue to chase some bullies away from a twelve year old girl. THe bullies shoot her (!!) and she goes to said twelve-year-old girl's house where her mom just happens to be a vet. Max falls in love with their family, somehow forgetting that six-year-old Angel is locked up in an evil torture facility, and just a few hours earlier she was throwing a screaming fit because they slept too long and had to get back to the rescue.Later, we find out that Ella's mom is, in fact, Max's mom as well. Seriously, people.Joy of joys, Max and Flock escape afore mentioned evil torture facility when HAWKS come and dive-bomb the evil scientists that created them, letting the Flock escape. They rush off to New York, where Max starts getting weird headaches that are NEVER EXPLAINED. She just happens to kill her arch nemisis Ari, but no worries. He comes BACK TO LIFE in the second book.Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment is a badly written version of what could have been a good plot. Very badly written. The third one was a slight improvement. (The fourth one stunk so much. Don't get me started.)This series is all hype and no talent."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This story about a group a kids transformed by cloning to be able to fly and other special abilities is interesting ...

A book should have an ending, closure, something that leaves us satisfied and still wanting. This book has neither of these. It just stops.

The questions like, who is Max, is Jeb her father, what about the other \\"angels\\"? What about the other experiments that they freed? Who is the voice? I know it sounds like I'm probably giving some stuff away, but trust me I'm not. The book could have been great if he had finished it. As it is, you get only half the book, half the story and none of it is satisfying in the least. Stick with Harry Potter.

Patterson is by no means a wordsmith, in the way that when you read say George R.R. Martin how well crafted his words are. I am by all accounts a horrendous writer, but I am a pretty good reader, and I have to say that the 'idea' / 'concept' is almost enjoyable, but man, the inconsistencies, happenstance nature, and simple minded style of writing just blew it for me.

Someone who read The Angel Experiment in two days (I had finals! sorry).This is what I wanted to read when I was in high school - Max, gutsy big-sister; Fang, (for any Gatchaman fan, he reminds me of Joe); Nudge, the motormouth; Gasman, Iggy, and Angel. These are kids raised in a lab in dog crates and they still manage to be fantastically, rounded characters.

The biggest thing that annoyed me was the thing that always annoys me most with authors who don't usually write about mutants/superheroes/magic, etc. It becomes a quick, convenient cop-out for their characters to develop or discover new abilities along the way to help get them out of each new crisis. I cry foul. Mutants & magic are fine- but set rules & parameters. If you can fly, you can fly. If you can read minds, you can read minds. But you don't get to suddenly discover you can talk to computers, or breath underwater, or commune with animals because it helps write you out of the corner you've gotten yourself into. Drives. Me.

It is filled with action and adventure and many twists. You are always on the edge of your seat. This book is about 6 kids, also known as the Flock, that were injected with avian (bird) DNA when they were younger. They were once held captive at a laboratory that is referred to as The School. This place was run by people called Whitecoats. These people also experimented on the main characters and many other kids. The main characters (Maximum, Fang, Iggy, Gassy, Nudge, and Angel) escaped from The School with a whiecoat named Jeb. He disappeared before this story starts. One of the experiments from the school was the erasers. The erasers were half people and half wolf. The erasers showed up one day at the flock's house. They fought and the erasers ended up taking Angel back to The School. This book is about how The Flock get Angel back from this horrible place."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If you want a soft, goody-goody book, then Maximum Ride is not for you. If you like fast paced books with a lot of other good qualities such as action and adventure, then read on. Even if you don't, why don't you try it? I think that the Maximum Ride series is awesome because it is an action packed, completely interesting, suspense filled series that has a lot of emotion. First, you need to know the group of kids who call them selves \\"the flock\\" are no ordinary kids and the main characters of this book. Their names are Max, Fang, and Iggy who are all 14, Nudge who is 11, the Gasman who is 8 and lastly Angel who is 6. The first thing you might be thinking when I say \\"flock\\", is birds. Well you have the right idea. These particular kids have wings and some other cool powers that you will learn along the way. You will soon learn that the flock is on the run but in this case on the fly from place to place all the time from the white coats and erasers (a.k.a crazy scientist and half wolf, half humans sent out to hunt them down). The flock goes through pain, anger, love, happiness and fear together throughout the book and the series. For example in this book the whole flock is mad at the white coats' because Angel is in big trouble and serious danger. They are also very worried for her. Going back to The School means that their monstrous nightmares come back alive for the flock. While they hope Angel is still herself. My favorite thing about the book is the suspense between some of the characters (especially between Max and Fang) and their knowledge about the white coats plans for them. Max will have to learn to be a leader even when the worst comes.

However, the characters are different, the story is different, nothing is really the same. The only likeness is the fact that there are mutant kids running around and they are trying to escape the bad guys from the evil school/institute that created them. It's like Patterson started the story one way and then went \\"hey, I do this for a young adult audience instead!\\" So it all started out very confusing to me. I loved When the Wind Blows. I did. This story, not so much. It was boring. The entire 400 pages was about these mutant kids running from the bad school guys. There were no answers provided. Only questions with names and more names. The redeeming qualities to this book were that you were introduced thoroughly to the various mutant kids and by the end of the book, you pretty much know them all, really well. I have no idea what the story was about or why the story ever was. I wish Mr. Patterson had stuck with the first story.What I disliked: How slow it all was. The chapters were very short (thankfully) but everything was so boring and so slow.What I liked: I liked the characters.

Or partially because this review is based in what I dislike and yawn at, and found right here.First, if you like characters running all the time to escape 'imminent problems', this is for you. I could muster it the first time, and maybe even the second, but time after time they kept running away from the Erasers. I understand that they are more \\"powerful\\" and that always surprise the gang, but gosh, it was overkill to read about it so many times.Second, if you like (really) childish character you might uber-love the second part of the book. I know that this is a young adult's book but I like adolescent characters instead of kids. Even worst, apparently the \\"childish\\" acts are nothing serious in the eyes of a lot of characters. Disappointing.Third, if you like characters with fantastical abilities but that are only used rarely, again this is for you. They might be growing now and understanding how their powers work, but the fact that they don't exploit those advantages seems so stupid. I like more malice in the mind of my characters, even if it's mixed with cliched thoughts.Nonetheless the book was very easy to read, and I always wanted to keep reading more (mainly because I was hopping that something exciting would occur, but it never did)."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Its that kind of book that makes u laugh wen ur character laughs, cry wen they cry, and smile wen they smile."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I got this as a free Kindle Download and was not expecting much.

I became so interested that I purchased the book to finish reading it.(sub time only about 45 minutes) However, I was unaware that the book was part of a series and the open ended ending for subsequent books to follow left me a bit disappointed. I like a whole story in one book and am not into sequels. I guess that is the teen scene."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride-The Angel ExperimentJames PattersonFiction Book ReviewThe Angel Experiment, which is the first book of the Maximum Ride series, is about 6 mutant-avian-kids, Max (the leader), Fang, Nudge, Iggy (he's blind), and the Gasman and Angel, the twins. It seems like their whole life is about running away from the Erasers. Erasers are mutant-wolf men whose job is to capture the mutant-avian-kids. Many babies were either taken away from their home or given away, to a lab called the School. The School is where scientists test on animals and humans to try to make mutants. But there was one special group, Subject Eleven, the mutant-avian-kids. They are 98% human, 2% bird, created as an experiment. You may not think it, but the 2% bird makes a huge difference. They have raptor vision, wings, and hollow bones that are great for flying. After growing up in cages inside of the School, a scientist at the School let Max and the rest of the flock escape. Jeb Batchelder, the scientist, took care of them like a dad would. They lived in a house on top of a mountain. But a couple of years later, he disappeared, leaving the flock with thoughts that he was dead. The flock thought they were safe until Angel got taken away from them by Erasers. Ari, an Eraser, would like to kill Max because his father Jeb, cared for Max and the flock, but not his own son. Before Ari became an Eraser, he was a little boy who loved to follow Max around, but Max wouldn't pay attention to him. While Angel is at the School and the rest of the flock is coming to save her, the scientists are running experiments on her. On their journey, the flock does things that bond them closer; they surpass many events, rescue Angel, look for a building called The Greater Institute for Living, fight Ari and the Erasers, and find out that Max is supposed to save the world. How's that for a destiny?I like how the author warns the readers at the beginning. He says \\"Warning. If you dare to read this story, you become part of the Experiment. I know that sounds a little mysterious-but it's all I can say right now.\\" That phrase really caught my attention because not a lot of authors put warnings in their books that make you want to read more. On the back cover it also had a warning like that and it caught my eye when I picked it up. James Patterson made the book with many action parts so readers don't get bored. The characters are well developed with very different personalities. For example, he describes how silent Fang is by saying he always appeared out of nowhere, like a dark shadow come to life. My favorite character is Angel because she is a cute five year old that can charm anybody and has the ability to read other people's minds.I would give this book a ten out of ten because of the attention-grabbing action of the story. I have never really read anything like this book but it gives the reader the reality of what being homeless and always on the run is like. The flock never gets time to settle down in one spot because the Erasers are always chasing them. I think anybody would be interested in this book. It's not just for girls or just for boys. Any group would like it. But I would say it would be for ages 11 and up because of some short romance parts that parents might not want their child reading. This book is amazing. It catches the reader's attention so easily and makes you want to stick your nose in the book the whole day long. If you like attention- grabbing and action-packed books, then you should definitely read this book and the rest of the books following it.Marika"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is best described by one word...\\"Fun\\". This book is filled with great characters, a solid story and lots of action. I was sceptical before I read this book due to the fact that I thought this storyline had been done before. For example Marvel comics put out a little story called the X-Men but besides the fact that they are mutans the two stories have very little in common.This is a very different story from James Patterson than you might be used too. I have read Alex Cross and also some independent novels by Patterson and besides the same ability to create great characters you might not recognize that this is the same author. This novel is certainly written for younger viewers but I think even adults that are fans of a nice clean action packed story will get a big kick out of this book.While this is not the normal Patterson novel I think if you are a fan you will get a kick out of this novel. Of course, even if you have never heard of James Patterson but you like adventure stories with great characters this is a book you should check out.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was fairly good in certain respects. It grabbed my attention early on. It was readable and fast paced. It was imaginative.However...In the long run, I was actually disappointed in it. The chapter breaks on every other page did not serve any real purpose or follow any reasonable form. The story started with difficulties and proceeded to the land of dark and tragic. And in the end there was no actual climax or conclusion. It was akin to reading a never ending teaser for a tragedy.I'm not at all sure why the author worked so hard to achieve such feelings of hopelessness and such a sense of there being no possibilities of ever reaching a resolution for any of the problems of the main character, but I had to conclude for myself, that as I am not entertained by misery this story was very poorly contrived. I'm actually quite heartily sick of the dark and despair of authors who seem to need therapy and good drugs."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was a very good book.

Just a little FYI there are 3 of these books, so just read th second and 3rd book and you wont hate this book so much.

I was at the grocery store and the cover caught my eye. I had just gotten my check and thought, it can't hurt to buy this because I hear Patterson is good. Right?After a few chapters, I was disliking this book immensely. I'm surprised I actually managed to finish it. The writing is choppy, the characters flat, and the dialog... lame. It was also a very quick read - the book looks thick enough, but when you open it, there's not a lot of words on each page - apparently the font and spacing were deliberately stretched out to make this book look meatier. The descriptions are sparse, and the idea - interesting on its own - falls flat within the writing of this... book.After that, I got Lake House (by chance - a coworker gave me a bunch of old books she no longer wanted) and read it, and was amazed at how much better Lake House was compared to this. By itself, Lake House is not that much of a impressive read, but compared to this 'young adult' novel, Lake House is masterfully written. I'm not sure why Mr. Patterson decided he needed to tweak the whole 'bird-children' idea for this book when it had been better in Lake House. After finishing 'Maximum Ride', I felt no compulsion or interest whatsoever to buy any more books in this series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Awesome book.

I'm usually not that picky about swear words, but I've had such bad luck with books lately, that this just made me happy. :)I'm not in a huge hurry to read the rest of the series, but I think I'll most certainly be picking them up someday when I need an escape."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"this book put me off the edge of my seat. i was always eager to find out what was going to happen next. the book is full of drama and courage. i have never read a greater book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Max is a smart and spirited 14-year-old with a few \\"issues\\".

This is the type of book you really can't put down. I dont remember once getting bored. So there are six kids who call themselves \\"The Flock\\" they are 98% human and 2% bird, so they have wings and can fly (which I think is really cool). They grew up in a place called the School where evil scientists make experament with DNA. They were some of the \\"mutants\\" in the School. But then they escaped from the School, and now Eracers, another DNA experament, half wolf half man people, are trying to caputre them. Angel, one of the flock is captured and sent back to the School, and the rest of the flock, Max, Fang, Nudge, Iggy, and Gazzy have to rescue her. It has some humor, but its pretty funny humor. Lots of people said it didnt have a complete ending, which I think is somewhat true, but it was a good enough ending for me.Now there were minor things I didn't like. First of all, this book makes science look bad, and science is not bad and is very important. The other thing is the names, I mean Maximum, Fang, and Angel are great names but Nudge Iggy and Gazzy? Really? And Jeb too. I thought Jeb was sort of a wierd name. Nudge's real name is Monique, they could have just stuck with that, where did they get the name Nudge?"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride= BEST SERIES EVER!!

Six genetically modified people are 98% human, and 2% bird. They are: Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. Erasers, humans who can change into super strong wolf-men within a second, kidnap Angel and take her to the School. The School is an evil place were mad scientists give humans different kinds of DNA, resulting in a cellular change. In this case, the six were given bird DNA and grew wings. Angel is brought back to the School because she can read minds and had a very, very, very high I.Q. She can even breathe underwater. When the other 5 try to save Angel, they all get hurt fighting erasers and stopping a few bad guys here and there. They fly to the School in Death Valley, California, where Angel is. Soon after that they discover more than they need to know about their own past.

Endings have meaning. Meaning is why we read books rather than watch shiny videos all day on tv, right? If Patterson wants to write a sequel, that's fine, but he owes his young readers a sense of closure, at the least, and the beauty of transformation, at the best.Of course, everyone loves pretty girls with wings, so I give the book 3 stars. But this is not really a novel in any traditional sense. It's a series of episodes."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"One of the best !!!

And that is who this is written for. I am 15 and I liked the book but Patterson dumbed down the book making it for more of the age group of 8-12.A few good points of this book would be...1) The geniticlly enhanced kids who have workable wings.2) The action and adventure brought to you by the protoganists and the antoginists.A few bad points of this book would be...1) The confusion some people have/had with the Max in this book and the Max in Patterson's \\"When the When Blows\\".2) How the kids who were so badly treated can just high-jack a car without having any problems.There are more good and bad points but I'll just you, the reader, to come up with your own conclusion.

At first I was a little disappointed that it wasn't an add on to the first two books with Max and some other characters (\\"When the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Lake House\\"). This book feels a little more appropriate for the young adult readers, while the other two seem more like grown up books. Now don't get me wrong, I truly enjoyed this story. My understanding is this is supposed to be like one in a series, but if it's not like some others have said the ending was not complete. The main problem in the story is solved (the kidnapped flock member) but you're left hungry for answers.

I've already chosen to use this as the book for our next teen book discussion. A young boy came in a few days ago and asked for a good fantasy book, although this book isn't exactly in the fantasy catagory I still gave it to him and heavily encouraged him to read it. He came in today and couldn't stop talking about how great it was. I can't wait for a sequal."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson has stunned the adult world with his beautifully poetic and thrilling novels. Finally, Patterson has made his move on overtaking the thriller world of young adult fiction. \\"Maximum Ride\\" is a COMPANION novel to his bestselling works \\"When The Wind Blows\\" and \\"The Lake House\\": in NO way is Maximum Ride a sequel to these books, it just contains relatively the same characters. It tells the story of the beautiful girl named Maximum Ride; Max for short. She would be a normal girl, except for the fact that she was been scientifically altered. Bird DNA has been added into her own, and Max now lives with wings in her back. She lives with a bunch of other kids with this same genetic disorder; Each of them(Iggy, Fang, Nudge, the Gasman, Angel and Max) working together as a family, even though they are not related by blood. They have all run away from an evil place know as The School, where scientist expiramented with this children and created their altered states. When the scientists find the flocks hiding spot and kidnap the beautifully young Angel, the rest of the group must fight for the rescue of their baby sister.Plot twists and turns abound, and the characters grow and develop into their own kinds as the book whizzes through its chapters. The ending is abprut and leaves many strings loose, making it seem as if the book will soon become a series.Patterson has a great plot to work with, and characters that he was already established in two preivously mentioned books. But, for some odd reason, he dumbs his novel down. I would give this book 3.5 stars if I could, because he treats his new teenage readers like their are little children. He makes his characters a little too flat, and our narrater Max is not the same vibrant girl we knew and loved. She seems overly burdened, and far too serious. Also, Patterson's style of short, quick chapters works agains him in this book. In one part of the story, there are three seperate plot lines, as the characters are split apart on their own adventures. His chapters flip to quickly from characeter to character, and he looses some of the impact that could have been inserted into this story.Patterson has set the foundation for what could be a artistic, original YA series, and his characters have HUGE potential. If only he would treat his readers like equals and let them enjoy this Ride."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Several people have written that they feel the book is unfinished.

But as you get to know the characters, the book is convincing, suspenseful, and completely interesting to read. It is so much fun and I can only hope there is a sequel because I enjoyed it so much."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If anything, I had seriously misconceptions when it came to Maximum Ride. For once it was written by James Patterson, world renowned author of murder mysteries that were turned into movies usually starring Morgan Freeman to name a couple. When I saw this down at the library in the young adults section, the immediate thought that came flying from my head was, \\"Somebody misplaced this book in the wrong section!\\" I thought this because I knew James Patterson for writing books for ADULT audiences only, so was irked that someone would leave the book in the wrong section of the library. Of course, it irked me so much that I took a chance and snatched it off the book shelf to read it myself (odd no?). After several weeks I finally got around to reading it. Without a doubt these pages DO FLY as the side panel of the book warned. The storyline surrounding the characters could be more well thought out; Its sort of hard for me to describe, but a short summary would be this: [Max and her band of brothers and sisters (the flock) find themselves hunted by a organization from a place called The School after being ambushed in their hideaway home.From there they find themselves constantly running for their lives while trying unravel secrets hidden from them]. The concept of children with the ability to fly (with the inclusion of Hollow Bones) with WINGS is a nice touch to the story; The flying scenes were written very convincingly. The description of the action unfolding the extremely short chapters were well detailed, the words unfolded in my mind smoothly, the pharagraphs constructed in way that you don't find yourself scratching your head trying figure out how'd that character end up in such a position and so forth.The characters are stellar; From Max to Angel, these Teenagers, tweenagers, and kids are excellent reflections of their real life counterparts to a T. And the villains, while they make you hate them, are well written. They're never so predictable, or straightforward with their plans it makes you roll your eyes. And, yes, while this book leaves some things unexplained and the story does end quite abruptly, Max convincingly shushes that with a convincing teenage comment. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"First of all, I've never read any other James Patterson books. I understand from the reviews that this is an advantage-- people who read \\"When the Wind Blows\\" and \\"The Lake House\\" seem to feel particularly cheated, because this book is a re-worked version of the story in those books but does not match up them. Without the hindrance of these preconceived notions, I quite enjoyed the story. Were it not for the huge flaw of the incomplete ending, I would happily give it 5 stars.I listened to it in audio format, narrated by Evan Rachel Wood. I thought her narration was excellent and well-matched to the story. The story is marketed as a book for teens. I am an adult-- I chose it partially for my own benefit, as a science fiction fan, and partially to preview it for the possibility of handing it down to my own children.As a parent, I found the content well-suited for a wide age range. Were it not for the problem of the ending, I would feel comfortable giving it to my 8-year-old daughter to listen to, and it wouldn't bother me if my 5-year-old son listened as well (though I don't think it would hold his interest). I particularly like the strong female protagonist. There IS violence-- the mutant bird-children protagonists are hunted by mutant dog-people and have several bloody fights. Most of it is fist-fight kind of stuff, but there is some gunplay as well. However, I did not find it gratuitous or unduly gory. There is death as well, but the death comes to \\"bad guys\\" and it too is not \\"gratuitous\\"-- it is treated somberly and with appropriate angst. Probably the most disturbing elements are those of the inhumane treatment of the children at the hands of the scientists who have genetically engineered them and raised them as experimental animals rather than as people. Most of this though happens off camera and is alluded to indirectly.The big problem with the book is the fact that it doesn't really end. Well, it ENDS, but it doesn't FINISH. I am a long-time sci-fi and fantasy fan well-accustomed to double-digit series, but this is unfinished even by that standard. There is no satisfactory closure and no real answers to the dozens of mysteries raised in the story. I sincerely hope that the sequel resolves some of these mysteries and lives up to the wonderful promise of this part of this story-- I will certainly be buying the sequel as soon as it is available! However, for those of you not yet involved, I think I would recommend that you not start this one until there IS a sequel, and reviews telling you that there is some element of completion to the story!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"\\"If you dare read this story you become part of the Experiment.

Even if you hate reading, like me, you won't be able to set this book down! It's a thrill/ adventure based book written by James Patterson, author also of best selling When the Wind Blows. Patterson created a fantasy clashing reality book that is telling about six young experiments and there life.Have you ever wished you could fly? Well the main characters in this book are six kid mutants from ages five to fourteen, Angel, Nudge, Gassman, Iggy, Fang and Max. The oldest Max, is the leader of the folk. These kids are a mixture of bird DNA and human genetics. All they remember is living in a lab, a lab of evil and hatred. This is the place where white coated people come and perform tests on them, hurt them, push them to a limit, and you are nothing but and experiment here even if you are half human. Through living in a lab they gained having powers that come to them as they grow older, such as far sight like a hawk, or being able to breathe under water (caused by tests). The whole reason why we know about these experiments is because they have been the only ones to escape.With these six escapees they are trying to live with out being killed by the government and there helpers know as the Erasers. All they want is to live, live and know what this is all about, and who they are and what they came from. However, this is or should I say, they are not to be exposed, this is the government's little secret. But, not for long... because once your start reading this you are a part of their nightmare. This twisted mysterious nightmare that I could never figure out to the last paragraph.If you enjoy a mysterious book that tests your limits of what is real and what can't be, then this is a book for you, for all- once your hooked there's no way out."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"\\"Congratulations. The fact that you're reading this means that you've taken one giant step towards surviving till your next birthday.\\"~Maximum Ride: The Angel ExperimentI have to say, seeing that James Patterson had written all of those adult murder-mystery novels, I had my doubts as to whether he could successfully write a young adult story. I was proven WRONG. This book is very masterfully done, and I know that Patterson is indeed a master at his craft, but since he had never written a book for the kids, this was a surprise.The main characters are: Max (the book's namesake), Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. They are all kids who were subject to genetic alteration at a very young age, and thus will never...EVER...lead normal lives. Max leads the pack (or flock, depending on how you look at it) as the oldest, who is in charge of keeping Fang's spirits up, Iggy from blowing up their home, Nudge from talking to the point that it drives everyone insane, and the most important-saving six-year-old Angel from being torn apart by the Erasers, wicked wolf-men mutants, or dissected by the evil whitecoats who work at the School.Max is an excellent character-funny, smart, strong, and sarcastic, which is a good quality for a lead character. Fang is second; the strong-and-silent type, but always feels emotion without letting the flock see it. Iggy is great-blind but incredibly intelligent and fond of making cynical remarks. Nudge is very nice, funny, a COMPLETE motormouth, and has a tendency to make quick decisions that no one can stop her from carrying out. The Gasman doesn't play the most enormous role, but as Angel's brother, he does make for a good one. And that brings us to Angel, the sweet little girl who was kidnapped by Erasers. She's very cute, and she has a special ability...make that TWO special abilities...which I will not name. She holds a special place in Max's heart, as her \\"Little Angel\\".There is a bit of a love interest between Max and Fang, but it doesn't become wholly evident until the second-to-last chapter in the book. I, being a complete sucker for love interests, love that part and wish so much that the sequel will come out so I can see more of it.The battle scenes in this story are amazing-almost like it's right there and happening in your living room...or bedroom or whatever. Very well desccribed, you can see it as a clear picture in your mind. Some are kind of graphic, so if you have any problem with reading about blood, I would reccomend passing on this one. If not, you're really in for a treat.Overall, this book was totally fantastic, and if you're considering purchasing it and you're reading this...buy it right now. I'm dead serious-your life could depend on it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment is truly an amazing book. I picked up at noon and couldn't put it down (literally) until 2:00 am when I finished it. I was so worked up i didn't sleep all night. I actually reread some parts of the book. This book is, in a sense, based on When the Wind Blows and The Lake House. Max, the main character is 98% human and 2% avian (bird)is in all three books, but the other characters are changed up a little bit.The book starts off with this warning, \\"If you dare to read this story, you become part of the Experiment. I know that sounds a little mysterious-but it's all I can say right now-Max\\" As soon as I read this, I knew this was going to be a good book. The main characters in this book are Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. The book starts off right in the first few chapters. Angel gets captured by the Erasers, part human, part wolf, and taken back to the horride School (which they escaped in When the Wind Blows). The flock then has to go rescue her and along the way, many things happen. Max gets shot when she helps a little girl named Ella, the Gasman and Iggy set off the Big Boy, a bomb, and kills many Erasers, and Fang and Nudge gind the \\"hawk\\" in them.When the flock finally gets Angel out, Max learns that she has a chip in her arm and the Voice in her head. Amazingly painful headaches announce the presence of the Voice. Painful enough to knock her out cold and fall dangerously from the sky at about a mile high. Lickily Fang catches her (one of my favorite parts). The flock eventually goes to this Institue in NYC and finds horrilbe experiments being done. \\"Gruesome,\\" was what one of the flock had said. The flock helps the kids get out and in the process, Max kills an Eraser named Ari.This, so far, is my all time favorite book. I love Max's character, not to mention her wings. Her spunk and her confidence in herself always amazed me. One reason why I think I liked this book so much was something that James Patterson said, \\"I think people like this book (When the Wind Blows-close enough) because everybody has, at one time or another, dreamt of flying. And these books bring you into lives of people who can fly.\\" I truly believe this is true, what J. Patterson said.This is an great book!!!:)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. It has a great story line. The action is very fast paced. I couldn't wait for the next book to be out. I think people who like stories that contain all the elements of love, hate, fear, and joy will truly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":". . . fantasy/adventure story for teen readers.I'll be honest. This is not the sort of book I typically read -- or review. But my 13-year-old daughter loved the book (and is almost finished with the sequel) and convinced me to spend some \\"down-time\\" reading the book.I'm glad I did. The book contains adventure, just enough realism to be believable (yes, an adult does have to suspend belief at the basic premise -- but hey, it's for teens!) plenty of action and plenty of drama.I won't include a re-hashing of the plot nor provide spoilers -- only a few comments.While the \\"good\\" characters are good (yes, they have flaws, but they are essentially normal human failings, rather than tendencies toward evil) and while there are some despicably evil characters as well -- there are other characters about whom we are unsure -- and are likely to remain unsure until the final installment is written.Sure, the character developments are not up to the level one would find in classic literature -- but that is not what this book is intended to be. In a day and age where much of what passes for young adult literature is c**p, this book was, for this reviewer, a delightful surprise."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment introduces Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and Angel: six kids who have been genetically altered so that they are only 98% human, and 2% bird. They grew up in cages, but now they're free, and live all by themselves. But when the mutant Erasers capture Angel, the Flock must leave the comfort and security of their newfound home and rescue her. Max, the oldest has a plan. But will it work, and what will they do after they find Angel? Find out in the young adult debut from James Patterson. Normally, this kind of book isn't my prefered genre but I really enjoyed this."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"THE STORY: Maximum Ride is a fourteen-year-old girl with wings (or a mutant freak depending on the current turn of events) who is the result of some experiments at a secret lab to inject avian genes into human embroyos. Max is the oldest of the six members of her family, or as they refer to themselves, the flock. The others are Fang - a taciturn boy who is four months younger than Max; Iggy - who was blinded by experimentation on his sight at the lab; Nudge - a young girl who talks non-stop; and two siblings, the Gasman - an eight-year-old boy with persistent intestinal problems and Angel, his six-year-old sister. Max and her companions were kept in cages and subject to repeated scientific experiments during their life at the School (as the lab was called); they were eventually freed by one of the lab scientists (who are referred to by the flock as Whitecoats) named Jeb Batchelder. Jeb secreted them at his mountain home and raised and educated them; but Jeb suddenly disappeared two years ago and the flock has been on its own since then. Suddenly, Erasers (experimental beings also developed at the lab who can morph into powerful vicious wolf-like creatures) raid the family's mountain hideaway and kidnap Angel.The remaining five kids determine to rescue Angel, who they assume has been returned to the School. Obviously the mission, for which they are ill equipped, will involve extreme danger despite the advantage of flight which their thirteen foot wing span provides them. Their journey begins with a return to the School in Death Valley, California; after a harrowing ecapes and great emotional trauma they eventually make their way across the continent to search for the clues to the identities of their human parents in another secret lab located somewhere in NYC. The fact that the Erasers possess a seeming uncanny ability to locate the flock adds to the tension which builds as the story approaches the point where the flock may be forced to choose between the bonds which have made them the only \\"family\\" each has ever known and the pull of searching for their biological parents. Each of them wants an answer to the question of how they came to be participants in such a despicable experiment; they also intensely yearn to somehow become members of a nuclear human family with a \\"real\\" mom and dad. As a point of clarification, despite the subtitle THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, the flock do not think of themselves as angels and while they bear a superficial resemblance to our general conception of angels, there is no mention of this resemblance at any point during the story.THE GOOD: the decision of James Patterson to attempt to realize the potential of Max's character (which first appeared in WHEN THE WIND BLOWS) after her adventures headed toward a dead end in LAKE HOUSE, which received very poor reviews. The basic storyline is quite clever and it has sufficient elements to develop into an interesting fantasy series, although some readers of the earlier books may be disconcerted by the fact that with the exception of Max's winged nature and her escape from a despicable school, there are few similarities with the earlier books. (In effect, this is a cover of those books not a sequel; it utilizes the same basic character but everything else is diffeent.) The situation in which the \\"children\\" find themselves evokes both sympathy and tension in the reader; the author accommodates his legion of fans with his usual style of very brief action-filled chapters and frequent plot twists. The technique of using Max as the narrator very effectively provides insight into her psychological travails and impacts the reader emotionally. While there is frequent violence, most of it is less disturbing than in some of Patterson's work, both because it is less graphically described and also because it occurs in the realm of fantasy. Finally, the examination of the moral and ethical issues relating to the scientific experiments which produced the protagonists and the discussions of family relationships and responsibilities are cleverly interspersed throughtout the narrative. It is this aspect and it's potentially thought provoking and educational impact on young readers (certainly an important target audience for the book as I will discuss later) which led me to slightly upgrade my two star rating.THE BAD: The potential of the story is never realized, as is increasing the case with Patterson's books. Interesting ideas are never fully developed, even the humorous moments seem rushed. Either Patterson is getting increasingly lazy and just attempting to establish a new franchise to milk or he is involved in too many projects; whichever is the case his editors should have required a major rewrite. The thought process was also sloppy, this is a fantasy set in the real world, not the creation of a whole new world. So, when the flock is in NYC, it frequents Central Park, finds sanctuary in St. \\u0003Patrick's Cathedral, and takes the Madison Avenue bus. Yet suddenly in a disconcerting switch with no conceivable purpose the kids visit a fictional AFO Schmidt (rather than FAO Schwarz) and dine at the Garden Tavern, which resembles in every detail the Tavern on the Green. The narrative content actually more resembles a comic book or a graphic novel than the usual hard cover of over 400 pages.THE TRULY UGLY: The author seemingly changes the rules at will whenever the flock confronts a problem. While it is difficult to be specfic without providing spoilers, two general examples will suffice. First, in the absence of any source of funds, the family soon confronts situations with which it would be very difficult to cope in their disguised state as regular children. So on two separate occasions, ATM cards very propitiously come into their possession, once in a totally unbelievable manner. In another situation, just when required one of them suddenly manages to drive a car. (These aren't the most outrageous examples.) But most importantly, THERE IS AN ENDING BUT NO CONCLUSION! Many events remain unexplained. The reader and Max are both left in a state of shock by the apparent implications of a horrible tragedy near the end of the story, yet there is no closure. Even when a book such as this one is intended to be the initial installment of a series, it should satisfy the reader on a standalone basis. This fails that requirement.SUMMARY: While there was no indication either on the book jacket or in the television commercials which I saw that this book was intended for the youth market (perhaps preteen), the price, the nature of the story and the website to which the reader is referred all seem to indicate that is the intended audience. I will obviously be interested in the opinions expressed in the reviews of such readers, but I believe that there are numerous better written alternatives available for both adults and young readers interested in fantasy. Among the best known works of recent vintage are not only the Harry Potter series but the wonderful Thursday Next quartet by Jasper Fforde. Thus I strongly recommend that rather than buy this book you at least wait until the sequel is published in the hope that some of the loose threads wil be tied up. If you are too much of a James Patterson fan to wait that long, either just borrow it from your local library (to which I plan to donate my copy, which is definitely not a keeper), or alternatively wait for the paperback rather than encourage the author and publisher to produce more books of this quality by purchasing the hardcover edition.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I loved this book, I love the story line and I only wanted to keep reading more.

Unless you are crazy I think you should read this book.Its about 6 Children/Teenagers that have grown up in a lab called the \\"school\\" and are now free but now they have to fight to save the youngest member of the \\"flock\\". Join the in this amazing adventure."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The story is about a \\"family\\" of six kids, ranging in age from six to 14, who live on their own. What bonds them together is the fact that they were all genetically engineered in a horrific laboratory called \\"The School.\\" The kids are 98% human, but also have 2% bird DNA. As a result, they have unusual strength and abilities (including flight). They escaped from The School four years earlier, and lived with their rescuer/mentor for two years, until he disappeared. As the story begins, the kids are attacked by creepy, super-strong predators sent by The School, and one of the kid-bird hybrids (Angel) is kidnapped. The other five embark on a cross-country trip to rescue her, and to find out more about themselves.The book is filled with danger, battles, evil experiments, betrayal, loyalty, surprises, and a quest to save the world. What keeps it from being a two-dimensional movie of the week is the strong relationship between the six kids, and their own internal vulnerabilities. The character that we get to know best is the Maximum Ride (Max) of the title, who takes her responsibility as the oldest hybrid seriously, and tries to be a mother/leader to the group. Lots of things are left hanging at the end of the book, ready for the sequel (Maximum Ride: School's Out Forever).I did notice a couple of coincidences in the book that struck me as ridiculous (a pet peeve of mine). Just as the kids need to change their appearance, they come across a salon advertising free makeovers. There's also a scene in which Max stumbles around lost in the woods, finally finds one lit-up house, and it just happens to be the home of someone she's helped earlier in the day. I don't know why these coincidence bother me so much, when I can accept the whole premise of human/bird hybrids without a problem, but there you have it. I think that the use of coincidence as a plot device, especially when you already have license to bend lots of rules because of the book's overall premise, is lazy.Overall, I did enjoy the book, though I wouldn't call it fine literature. It's fast-paced, with short chapters, and plenty of cliff-hangers. I think that it will be a hit with reluctant readers (especially after the inevitable movie comes out) in the early teen age range. I mean, what kid hasn't dreamed of how cool it would be to be able to fly, and to live without parents or school? I have to admit for myself that I'm interested to read the sequel. I want to know what happens next to Max and the other kids. If you're looking for a good airplane read, or you know a kid who is fascinated by the idea of genetic engineering and mutants with super-powers (a bit like X-Men, come to think of it), Maximum Ride is worth checking out.A slightly longer version of this book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on March 24th, 2006."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I really have to say I absolutely loved this book.

Excellent reading whether you are 13 or 35 years old and higher... I'm 35 by the way. A must read..."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Fans of Patterson's books about children with wings (AS THE WIND BLOWS and THE LAKE HOUSE) will recognize some of the themes in this book. They may be surprised at the paperback having never seen the hardcover. This is because many of the chain stores filed this on in the young adult or teen sections. There is a good reason for this as the book is all from the point of view of the kids. There are no prominent adult characters and those that do show up have very limited page time. The 400-page book is split into more than 130 chapters making this a very fast read.This is the story of Max (short for Maximum Ride) and five other children with wings who escaped from a facility known as The School. These are not the same winged kids and The School is not quite the same. They are also not the only half-breeds. On their trail are Erasures, half human and half wolf with the ability to morph between two physical states. Max and company have been on their own in a mountain house for a couple of years when the Erasers find them and capture the youngest. Max decides to lead a rescue attempt and the story begins.Each of the children has additional abilities and the youngest can read minds. The rescue begins a series of chases as the kids flee from Erasers at every turn. The chase eventually leads to New York City and below. But by the end while there has been a lot of running and foreshadowing, not very much has happened plot-wise. It does set up the next book nicely but one has to wonder if that will be more of the same or a real story.The thing that really got to me were the cultural references. These are kids who spent most of their lives in cages in a lab. Then they were hidden in a secluded mountain house. But despite that they have an amazing grasp of decades worth of cultural references. At one point Max mentions that they have a long history of dumpster diving even though they probably never saw one until they got to New York. Occasionally a scene is engineered to point out that they have lived very secluded lives but those scenes are far outweighed by scenes of the opposite. I don't think the author knew how to turn off his own knowledge to write like one of his characters."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is possibly the greatest book I have ever read. I don't mean in terms of great literature, fancy writing and all. This book is far more real, with charectars that we can all relate to. It is a grip-the-armrest thriller that will keep you reading until it's done. I have been digusted by the other reviews for this book, saying it disappointed When the Wind Blows, and The Lake House. It is not related to them! As James Patterson says, it is not a sequel nor prequel to that series. Read this book. It's the best thing you'll ever do."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is adicting from the beggining.

Everything about the book is so good. James Paterson is a good writer who adds lots of detailed adjectives that let the reader paint a mental picture of the story in their head. The only thing that bothered me though, is that each chapter is only about 2-3 pages, but i got used to it pretty quick. But other then that it was a good science fiction book. Some people have said that the ending to the book is \\"incomplete\\". It's because it's an open-ended book, it's supposed to be sort of \\"incomplete\\". James Paterson is going to write 2 OR 3 SEQUALS TO THE BOOK."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Okay, so this book is a little weird. At first I was kind of like, umm okay kind of wish I didn't buy this book. But it gets better later, well it hooked me into it at least.What happens is, there is a young girl (either fourteen or sixteen years old) named Max, Maximum Ride. She, along with five others, is a mutant freak. All of them were created at a place called the \\"School\\" where their human genes were added to with bird genes. So they now are 98% human and 2% bird. But that 2% of bird affects Maximum Ride and the others like her a lot, they all can fly. Maximum's ride five friends are called, Fang, Gasman or Gazzy, Angel, Iggy, and Nudge.The school also made other experiments. One of these experiments are called, Erasers. Erasers are half man, half wolf. These Erasers are extremely dangerous, and can you guess what their favorite food is? Yep, you go it, the 98% humans and 2% birds.This is an adventure about Maximum Ride and her friends. Between Angel getting captured, trying to find the Institute, finding out the truth about Jeb, and saving themselves from the Erasers, this is a very exciting journey. The only thing that I would hold against the author is that the end is not complete. It makes the author seem like a money making lazy person, and I'll tell you why, the ending is not complete. It makes you want to buy the next book. And yes, I know, that is a sign of god writing, but as soon as I finished the ending I thought to myself, \\"Geez, this guy just wants your money\\" and I know that that isn't what I want to finish a book with. Besides this, it is a great, exciting book. Hope that you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is almost a plagiarism of the concept of the tv show \\"Dark Angel\\" that ran on FOX: genetially altered kids who grew up in a lab, escaped and are now being hunted by those who want to destroy them or bring them back to the lab. The heroine's name is even the same!!! I am completely shocked that James Patterson can get away with something like this. It's completely ludicrous to think people won't notice. Not to mention that the characters are not fully developed, there is no consistency in the world he writes in (New York city ranges from real locations to made up locations) and the kids talk like adults and have conveniences like ATM cards that make no sense. They are orphans trying to stay together as a \\"family\\" (another rip-off) and though I would like them better if they were written with more layers, I have to say that Patterson did not make me care AT ALL what happens to these kids. A non-famous writer could NEVER get away with the shoddy writing in this YA book-- and by this I include characterization, world-building, plot and voice. The only good thing about this book is the premise, which like I said, has been done before."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The plot was just beginning to get somewhere when I felt it literally plunge down a cliff. What a downer! I can handle this story about children with bird genes since I have also read the Tolkien books. I thought it was creative but limited in being believable.

Is there some special credit ability that one of the children possessed?"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Okay, so I found this book moderately entertaining, but where is the ending? I feel cheated! Like I spent all this time reading a story without any pay-off. That's just wrong! And guess what? It wasn't so good that I'm going to rush out and buy the next one (which I think, is probably the whole point.) Also, there were lots of huge holes in the plot...for example, all that guessing at a password to use the jerk's ATM card. An ATM would've locked them out after three or four tries. And would've confiscated the card. Same thing with the computer they were trying to hack into. Jeez, even I know that, and I'm not a computer whiz. This is the only James Patterson book I've ever read. Guess what? I probably won't ever read another one.

I read the 2nd book in the series first, School's Out Forever. This one is just as good, only wish I had read it first... although it kind of sucks already knowing there are more books with all of the same characters in it, so you know none of them are going to die. I'm glad none of them will die (at least not in any books except maybe the last, which I haven't read yet), but the suspense is gone.If you liked the Dark Angel TV series with Jessica Alba, you'll like these books... mutant kids, escaped from an evil school/lab, same idea -- the main character is even named Max."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is by far the best of the five or six free Kindle books that I've read.

I found this to be VERY similar to the Pendragon series in that the writing sounds cheesy. To me, at 22 years old, this sounded like an old person trying to talk young. The slang seemed dated and unpopular. I would rather read this if it was written in regular style rather than with faux 14 year old first person. As far as plot goes, it started off pretty slow but picked up about half way through and ended with a bang. So that was good. However, It did seem to me like the sense of urgency to rescue Angel was much to mild. Also it got really old to hear a play by play of every meal they ate through the entire book.

Thank me later."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Three and a half stars for MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT.\\"Warning: If you dare to read this story, you become part of the Experiment.\\" If this cryptic little note for the reader, pasted on the book's title page and signed by Max, doesn't intrigue that reader, then I don't know of any teaser which will. MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT is James Patterson's first venture into the Young Adult fiction genre, and, as such, it's a commendable rookie effort. And, certainly, his target audiences have been enthralled all to bits as this one rapidly climbed the New York Times Bestseller list. Myself, I liked it, despite its flaws. THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT is inspired by (but not a continuance of) two of Patterson's earlier novels, the excellentWhen the Wind Blowsand the merely okayThe Lake House. Think of it more as a re-imagining done by Patterson as he extracts Max from that old storyline and gives her a new backstory. The name's the same and the sinister School is the same. But a lot is different. You won't find Kit and Frannie in this new series (which is a pity).Plot SPOILERS begin.Six kids on the run, relentlessly pursued by their School, which is a covert and sinister organization. Six kids, who were raised in a laboratory, locked in tiny cages and subjected to torturous, unending experiments. Who then escaped some years ago, with the aid of a scientist who now cannot be trusted. Maximum Ride (but call her Max) is the leader of these very special children. Very special, because, for one thing, all six have functional wings, having been cross-bred with avian DNA. But that's not the end of their extraordinary abilities. There's a perfect mimic in their midst, and a tactile empath, and a mind reader. And who knows what else, as new powers are constantly emerging. So you see why their old School wants its flock back so badly.So life hasn't been easy for Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel (ages ranging from 6 to 14 years old). Yet the children believed they had finally found sanctuary in the isolation of Colorado's Sangre de Cristo Mountains. But Max never planned on the Erasers - genetically-engineered, werewolf-like enforcers of the School - somehow always being able to track her and her flock. Things really fall apart when the latest run-in with a pack of Erasers ends with the kidnapping of Angel, the youngest child and a mind-reader. Much of the book's first half deals with Max and the others desperately attempting to rescue Angel, which does happen but not until Angel had been put thru more horrible experiments. Later, Angel tells the flock that there might be a way to unearth their birth parents' identities. But, to access this knowledge, they would have to find and infiltrate the shadowy Institute for Higher Living, hidden somewhere in New York City. So off they go...And, as if things aren't horrible enough, it gets even more challenging for Max. Suddenly, she begins to suffer from excruciating brain seizures. Then she begins to hear a Voice in her mind, which urges her to save the world. Max finds this demand particularly outrgeous as she can barely get her younger charges to clean up their rooms. Not to mention, vicious, lycanthrophic mutants forever trying to kill them.SPOILERS end.MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, straddling fantasy and science-fiction, is an effortless read, made even easier by the very short chapters and the fast pace of the story as the venue shifts from Colorado to Death Valley and, finally, to the streets and underground subways and sewers of New York. Patterson's storytelling skills are mostly on display here, okay, maybe simplified a bit to accomodate the younger years of the intended reader. But older, more critical persons can enjoy this, too. Patterson writes in some very good vignette scenes, as when an injured Max is taken in by a normal family, and the flock's misadventures in a toy store and a restaurant. Actually, I enjoyed these character-driven moments more than the frenetic action sequences. Not to mention, Patterson unveils some funny bits as Max turns out to have a pretty subversive sense of humor.Patterson makes sure that we come to care about these six kids as, in this incarnation, Max and company seem to be even better-developed (character-wise) and more endearing. Members of the flock get a chance to narrate a piece of the story from their point-of-view, except for the ever-reticent but always cool Fang, who is seen thru the other children's eyes and, therefore, comes off as the most enigmatic. 14-year-old Max herself makes for an awesome heroine, plucky and fierce and brave and very protective of her flock. And, because a huge chunk of the novel is told thru her first-person narrative, the reader will identify and sympathize with her inner turmoil and insecurities, things she's naturally reluctant to share with her younger charges. In fact, all the kids have their distinct personalities, and it's very easy to root for all six.But I can see where fans might become simultaneously intrigued and put off by this book. The premise is addictive, the characters are winning, the adventure is non-stop. Yet THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, clearly meant to be a first installment in a series, suffers as a stand-alone book. There's a hectic and disjointed feel in these pages. Partly because these Erasers pop out of the woodwork way too often. Partly because Patterson, perhaps unwilling to reveal everything as yet, becomes too stingy with the plot progressions and the big reveals. There are inconsistencies and too many coincidences (yes, the second credit card was a bit much for me). And the book does end on an unsatisfying note. So a huge chunk of how you end up liking this book will be determined by how much these kids ingratiate themselves with you. Me, I like them a lot, and well enough to forgive the book's several trespasses.James Patterson may have made his hay with the brilliant Alex Cross series, and, more recently, with the Women's Murder Club novels. But, with MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT, he's carved himself a new niche in fiction and has made me into an even bigger fan. Having just finished reading the riveting and much more cohesive sequel, MAXIMUM RIDE: SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER, Max may have just toppled Alex Cross as my favorite James Patterson-created character. The Maximum Ride series has blown up in a gynormous way, each of the books so far having garnered a spot on the New York Times Bestseller list. I can't wait to check out the third and fourth books. And the movie cannot get here fast enough (but it's still a few years away).The Maximum Ride series, so far:- MAXIMUM RIDE: THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT-School's Out - Forever (Maximum Ride, Book 2)-Saving the World (Maximum Ride, Book 3)-The Final Warning (Maximum Ride, Book 4)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"\\"If you dare to read this story, you become part of the experiment, I know that sounds a little mysterious but it's all i can say right now.\\" Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have wings or other special powers? I have always liked books like this and it is packed full of action.The book that i am talking about is Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment by; James Patterson. The book is about a girl named Max and her \\"flock\\" that live in a large secluded house in the mountains, and they all have a huge secret. The flock is trying to hide from bloodthirsty savages trying to kill them. Max's flock includes six people; herself, Iggy, Angel, Gazzy, Fang, and Nudge. My personal favorite character is Fang because he is both mentally and physically strong. All of the characters in the book are completly content under Max's care and they all love each other even though they might get into some fights.I thought that the book was an amazingly good novel that is filled with action and suspense, there is very little, if anything, wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a another great book in the Maximum ride series read all of them.These kids have wings and they are always on the run if anyone finds outthey might want to do more experments on them."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"my dad, who ikes to read books james patterson and other suck aauthors, saw the tantalizer for this book in the back af another book by the fore-said auther and thought it looked interesting. personally, i usually don't like this kind of book and think them rather stupid: they generally have too much gore, too muhc violence, are too fast adn just give TMI ( too much informaion for those of you who have never heard the term). the exceptions, in my case, ae the Da Vinci code ( which i will reveiw soon) and this book.anyway... i was sitting in my hammock reading last susmmer when dad came and found me. he said he thought i would like this book. since i have plenty f time in the sammer, i decided to give it a try. i picked it up and couln't put it down. it was amazing! i fineishid it in aobut on and a hlaf days. i ahd to put it down and move on to other books( i love to read and always have a long list to read; the summer si the best time to catch up on such things). i brougth it on trip later on in the summer as a back-up book, or a book i read onlyif i run out of other books. as it turned out, that si exactly waht happened. i was bored stiff untill i pickd up this book again. for the reast of the trip, i read it and average of one and a half times a ady! i think i have read it eight or nine times in the last six months.i know some of you are thinking i am getting alittle long-winded now, bt hang with me.i think i like this book because ihave always dreamed of flying. now in amn airplane; i have done that sooooo many times. i mean REALLY flying, like with the wings and all. i dream of flying at night ( i've actually had some pretty stupid dreams about Max, but those don't count.) i think this is why i love to swim, is becouse it is about the closest we can get to flying without big, fancy equipment. also, this book si written so realisticly, it is so easy to imagine that people really can fly.the book has some moral issues, suck as is genetic engineering good? but i won't go into those here.i reccommend this book for any mature person, boy or girl, man or woman, above the age of six.i can't wait for the third book to come out any more thatn i could wait for the second (i was in sheer agony while waitn for the 2nd) and thoughtoughly look forward to another enjoyable read.read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I love James Patterson and am thrilled that he wrote this book for the younger generation.

I didn't like the fact that Jeb went back to being a whitecoat, and I think that he did that so he could see how the flock would behave if they weren't in the environment of the lab for a while. I liked the fact that Max keeps glaring at Iggy, only to remember that it's useless because he's blind. I really like Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment, and I dove right into School's out Forever right after I finished it, and now I'm waiting for the third book in the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"first of all, I did like this book. the story line and characters of it anyway. it's just, JP is used to writing the adult thrillers or whatever and his approach at wiritng a teen novel doesn't come of exactly right. lets start with the dialogue. I don't know any kids that say all the wacky things that max and them sometimes say, the weird catch phrases or last words.what i want to know is, if a first time author who isn't known by the writing world (and JP is; he's pretty famous) wrote a book like this, with this writing style and layout, would this book be half as sucsessful as it is?And really, what is with the chapters? some of them cut off for no reason!I do like it, I just think it needs a few improvements. four stars."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a fantastic book as the title says. U might get bored in the beginning, which is probably just the first chapter but the chapters r just usually 2-3 pages long. There's definetly a hint of romance in it but only if u pay atention to those 2 ppl do u notice it.It's definetly interesting and it's a book that u'd never want to put down and there r 134 chapters but they r REALLY short chapters. There is an epilogue and I'm not sure if there is one in the hardcover but in paperback, there is the first 6 chapters for the sequel. I can't believe that I'm gonna have to wait for it cause it's just something that u want to read the second u finish the last page in the Angel Experiment. Oh, and before u realize after reading a few chapters later in the bool, Max is a girl. :P ^_^ hee hee Well I REALLY DO HOPE u read this book and when the second book comes out, that u will read it too!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Mybe this book has a lot of flaws but the hardcover edition is an easy read. Large boldface tpyeset makes this easy on the eyes. If you can accept that anything can happen and usually will, and can accept that the main character really has no control over her life. Than you will be able to accept the book at face value. All of Maxs life has been shaped by one man and he knows her intimatly. I hope that their is another book because I can't wait for her get back at her creator-mybe with help from as yet unnamed persons. And the hint that her father is her creator is priceless. And that she doesn't know these things that should have been told to her is her fathers sorrow because he sends her brother to catch her and she kills him- without knowing- she has no choice because he is not right. He was made into a wolman. It all adds up that the father is demented. I would like to see some kind of happy ending but in this book all that happens is they get away, not a good ending at all- you can't help but think what will they do where will they sleep that night- because they don't have a home anymore- in fact home was never safe. And I'll leave you with that. Please read the book- its a journey to self-awareness and maturity."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"GREAT READING!!!!!!!I WISH IT HAD BEEN THE NEXT IN LINE WITH \\"WHEN THE WIND BLOWS\\",AND \\"THE LAKE HOUSE\\",BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS A GREAT READ."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I read it in 15 hours and ive never read anything like it..... it was better than the books it was based off of."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have not read this book but reading the idea of it just makes me want to go to the store and buy the book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Don't ya hate it when you read all the way through a book and get to the end only to find nothing but a bag full of questions and no answers?If that's the kind of thing you hate, or even just find irritating, don't bother to read this book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"When I first read James Patterson's ALONG CAME A SPIDER, I became a fan for life. I've read most of his books and am elated when he takes on a different genre, such as he did with a recent romantic tale ... and another younger children's book. Since my first novel was an adult mystery adventure/thriller, and my second book is a young adult novel, I relate to writers who can juggle back and forth with ease. THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT is a very imaginative book, and I flew high with the characters, even though I don't have wings. You will love the adventures these kids have, and to see them triumph will thrill you. Keep up the good work, Mr. Patterson. You have given me much entertainment, many hours of reading pleasure and excitement.

I thought it was going to take me about a week to finish, but it was so exciting that I finished it in two days! I hope there's a sequel because the ending kinda left me hanging and wanting for more. Danger and surprises around every corner and moments when you wished the flock didn't have to go through and experience. All in all this book was excellent."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"It makes sense to put the bird series into a children's format. I just wish he had done it instead of writing \\"When the Wind Blows\\" and the \\"Lake House.\\" This was a great idea, but as a previous reviewer stated the book is open ended. I love the characters and the premise, but there is a lot of missing information. You are left in the dark. Even in a series, each book should stand on its own."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson, what happened to the start of a wonderful series? I have been an avid reader for over 50 years. When I read \\"As the Wind Blows\\", I thought it was magnificent. When I finished I could actually imagine the story line being true in some desolate place in the world. The book was full of love and compassion and the \\"flock\\" became real. Then \\"The Lake House\\" came along and picked up right from the ending of the last book. I thought, \\"this is going to be a great series, something to look forward to\\".Then came \\"Maximum Ride\\"! I have never been so disappointed in a book before. What happened to Frannie and Kit? What happened to the parents the children had met? What happend to the eggs that were ivory white with a pearly pink sheen? What happened to Frances Jane and Ozymandias? No mention of Oz, Matthew, Peter or Wendy !Maximum Ride was full of violence, blood, gore, unrealistic cartoon characters and had no connection to the other books accept for the School. No warm fuzzies in this book for sure.All I have left to say is \\"What happened, James Patterson, what happened\\"?"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I read When the Wind Blows and loved it - did not read Lake House but from reading other reviews I will read that one next. This book was like watching a mini-series without knowing that it is a \\"will be continued\\" until the end when you find out that it is nothing more then a set up for the next book - which I sure will not buy. Other then that I agree completely with the others who gave this book a low rating."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I tried reading this book, but I couldn't stay hooked on it.

DO NOT under any circumstances READ BOOKS FOUR THROUGH EIGHT. they were absolutely TERRIBLE but i think this was because JP origanally made Maximum Ride as a trilogy but people kept demanding more books so he made five more. but seriously they were AWFUL especially the last one and im certain others will agree with me. heres some advice..... read books one to three and totally ignore the others."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"this book is amaseing anyone that would rate it 1 star is a complete and total idiot!! sorry but this is my favorite seires ever and i would strongly advise reading it and eating tacos. if you like this seires then i would sughest some of james pattersons other books he is an wonderful author and has influenced me to write small books for the younger kids in my school! thank you for listening to me babbleing on and on about how wonderful this book is :) have a nice day!!!! :D lightinigfang sister"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book reads like a bad comic book. Not a novelization of a comic book, just a comic book. I was hoping I would like this book when I started reading it but, by the end, I had no desire whatsoever to read any other books by this author.While I started out sympathetic to the characters, I ended being very unsympathetic towards some of them, and ambivalent towards the rest. The action and suspense in the book do well enough in creating tension. The suspense, however, seems to never be realized or closed, just extended. Even most comics wrap up their stories better than this!Deus Ex Machinas abound. It seems that everytime a situation arises that seems even remotely threatening, what I call a \\"SuperFriends\\" moment happens -- something incredibly lucky happens to the flock, or something incredibly unlucky happens to their enemies. They acquire new abilities and skills just when they need them. They gain resources in an equally timely manner. Their enemies get more threatening just when a threat is required, and become incompetent when an escape is necessary. These moments happen far too often, and they quickly vanquished my suspension of disbelief. I never got a good handle on the rules, if any, of James Patterson's little universe.I read novels and comics, so I have no problem per se with the comic book style of writing. I read a couple of books a week, and I own over 1,000, so I know of which I speak. There are tons of good books out there that are fun and enjoyable to read. This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride is another one of the recent bizarre books by Patterson on the bird kid theme.If you read \`When the Wind Blows' or \`The Lake House' and didn't like them, stay away from this book. It is more of the same goofy writing.Having really been a big fan of Mr. Patterson back when he was writing the Alex Cross novels, I am more than a bit disappointed with his writing as of late. This one is the worst of the lot in my opinion.For anyone who has missed the two books on this theme cited previously, they involve a group of \`bird children' who are the result of genetic experimentation that grafted avian DNA into that of humans. The resulting \`creations' are super strong humans with wings. They can fly, etc.In this story, the \`flock', as they call themselves, battle another group of mutants, created in the same lab, who are part wolf. The wolf men are constantly trying to thwart the bird kids, but are defeated in totally implausible ways.Some of the bird kids have now developed very unusual abilities: The leader, Max (Maximum Ride) hears a voice of someone communicating with her to save the world. One of the other ones can now breathe underwater and one can now \`see' things that have occurred in a place simply by touching objects.If Patterson is now trying to target the teen market, he should be advertising it that way. There are others who do much better in that area, however, such as C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling.If you are a Patterson fan from long ago, you might want to do yourself a favor and skip this one so you can remember him as the great writer that he once was."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I don't really know why this was so awful. It had an interesting premise and is the type of story I usually like. The author explained the plot and the characters and left me completely unmoved. It was like an essay and left me completely disconnected. Too bad."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The book was poorly written and too fast-paced. I also thought the story was dark, depressing, and I did not enjoy it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Writing a story that answers none of the questions it brings up is like buying a jig saw puzzle with half the pieces missing. You then discover you have to buy a new puzzle to continue, knowing that most likely that puzzle will be totally incomplete as well. The biggest mystery is how this became a best seller with lines that even the lamest of teenagers would be embarrassed to say. The boring non-stop action centers around birds constantly being attacked by and then, beating up wolves. Must be a lot of kids out there getting beaten up by bullies. Peter Pan, this is not!This one goes in the trash."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Apart from all the very good observations that others have noted about the unfinished nature of the novel, and it's narrative inconsistancies, nobody seems to have mentioned that much of the premise seems to have been cribbed directly from James Cameron's short-lived series Dark Angel, starring Jessica Alba (which, incidentally, has been accused of ripping off the earlier YA series Fearless, published under Francine Pascal's umbrella of writers). Both have main characters named Max that are running from the scientific program that created them. Both sets of characters have superstrength and animal genes and qualities. And both find a sympathetic character on the outside to deal with their injuries (in Patterson's Max's case, the kindly female vet). I'll resist further comparisons, but I challenge anyone that's seen the series to have a look and see if they agree with me. I wasn't expecting much from this, and in fact picked it up because the dust jacket blurb made it sound similar to Dark Angel. I just didn't realise how similar."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I am not a teen, or a tween, but I do enjoy a good well written adventure story and the plotline of this book sounded interesting. Genetically altered children with wings, in an age where parents are close to being able to assign attributes to future babies it seemed appropriate to write such a story. James Patterson, usually known for his murder mysteries tries and fails, in my opinion, to speak through an adolescent's point of view. It was an \\"almost\\" story; never quite reaching a \\"wow\\" factor, kept me interested just enough to finish it but not enough to read the next installment. The plot didn't flow; the characters were too one dimensional, with funny but ridiculous names and even more worse they were too generic to the Young Adult Genre. Pick up any book in that section and you will find that 90% of them have the A) angst ridden young girl who doesn't realize she is wonderful and B) the Boy she is close with but doesn't realize she loves him, and vice versa C) the characters spouting forth the idiom of the day and D) a plot with no flow only small surges that never reach a common stream of conscience. I would say this was less Maximum Ride and more like Miniscule Jaunt.*addendum to previous review.This is a review on the Audio CD for Maximum Ride the 1st book , I had read the book previously and didn't like it at all , but someone told me the Audio book was better.....it wasn't.1st it was read by my least favorite Audio CD reader, Nancy Wu, who I have sat through with grimacing displeasure while she read the \\"Undead and Unwed\\" Vampire Queen Betsy series. The woman seriously has the worst reading voice on the planet, she cannot realistically voice several characters much less one, they all end up sounding overy exaggerated and comical. Not the way the author intended.There is a second reader, which confused me because he just wasn't needed and he came in at the weirdest times. Really I would go through a disc or two without him, and bam, he was reading it, maybe Nancy was off that day?As I have said before James Pattersons venture into the Young Adult Genre is a laughable, ridiculous one. Mutant children with wings being chased by mutant wolf children who hate them. All of them are the result of some scientific experiment, either read the old fashioned way or read to you on CD, its just not an entertaining book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum ride started out somewhat interesting. After that, the book turns into one boring chunk of sensless action. Using tne pretext of a &#34;cliffhanger&#34; patterson was able to put absolutely no completed story or any information, trying to force the reader to read the second book. I did not like thos book at all."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I read both The Angel Experiment and School's Out Forever, Books 1 and 2 of the Maximum Ride Series, hoping that the series would improve although it didn't. The writer(s) -- whoever they are, though probably not Patterson, himself -- unsuccessfully try to write in the voice of both little kids and teens. Max alternately sounds like a middle-aged man's idea of how a 14-year-old girl thinks and talks, and then spits out dialogue like a 30-year-old. Angel, who is six, suffers a similar problem - she thinks like a 6-year-old one minute and like a 20-year-old the next. Overall, however, there just wasn't much of a difference developmentally between the 6- and 8-year-olds, and the 14-year-olds. Iggy, the token character with a disability, has magical blindness. Instead of being a kid who is believably blind, his disability superpower enables him to build explosive devices out of random things that happen to be around (or not) and set them off with perfect results. And he has super hearing. The dialogue is choppy, corny and unauthentic. There is practically no character development - to say that the characters are two-dimensional gives the writers too much credit. Events unfold in the most silly of ways. For example, at one point the kids print out some information they find on a computer. At another point, all of the print on the pages has disappeared except for numbers. Why? No one knows. The bad guys keep ink in their printer that causes letters to disappear?I didn't like the formatting of the books, either. They appear to be thick and lengthy. If you picked one up, you'd think you were in for a nice, long read but that's an illusion. The borders surrounding the text are quite large, so there's just not that much print on a page. Also, the chapters are generally 2 pages long (sometimes 3), and broken up in odd places. This is disconcerting in and of itself, but it also causes lots of extra white space at the ends of most chapters. While the first book is more interesting than the second, that's not saying much. Very little really happens. I suspect you'd probably get one full novel if you read three or four of these books."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"By my review title, you get the impression of a melding of modern writing cliches, but that is not what you have here. What you have here is more of a sci-fi centered Harry Potter without the English private school nostalgia. Sub in a strong female lead, and children of a wider variety of ages, and you have the gist. It really is a great book, when you consider the self imposed limitations (no romance/sex) which the author imposed (in my opinion) to keep the book centered on the pre-teen/teen market.++some spoilers++You could consider this a fantasy novel, which chooses to make it 'urban' and modern by using science fiction devices to give children \\"powers\\" which strongly resemble mythical fantasy beings. For example, \\"erasers\\" are basically werewolves, and the protagonist children are basically angels, or the hawkmen from Flash Gordon if you prefer. I don't particularly agree with calling it a fantasy novel, because it is presented more as science fiction with fantasy elements.Anyway, I found the plot exciting, if a bit violent, and I found the characterization adequate. There are times when the characters seem so real, and others when the feel very derived, but their overall affect is pleasant. The plot seemed a bit forced at times, but overall the pacing of it is unpredictable, and the overall resolution at the end of this first book may not satisfy some. I personally found the ending fine, resolving some mysteries, and leaving a lot unsaid. It certainly seems geared to sell more books, and that is a little frustrating, but understandable.The interaction of the protagonist children has its moments, and although I called it 'Harry Potter' earlier on, I certainly didn't mean to imply the kind of depth of relationships that were developed in that series. These are more superficial and predictable, but that is less distracting than it might seem, since the focus is on the first person perspective of the primary protagonist, Maximum Ride. I found the inner character development (especially of the lead) to be the forte of this book, rather than the interpersonal relations. This weakens the overall appeal and results in the lower rating.Despite this, I recommend this book. It has its charms..."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I feel like there's a good novel in here, waiting to be found. In fact, there are probably three good novels in here, and when Patterson finishes writing them, I'll come back and give them a good read. But right now this feels like an incomplete outline waiting for a less hasty author to finish writing the details.Fourteen-year-old Maximum ride (that's Max to you) has been mother to her five foster siblings for the last four years, ever since they fled the School. Genetically modified marvels with angel wings and a growing panoply of superpowers, these kids have plenty to fear from the outside world. But not as much,it turns out, as they have to fear from their double-dealing foster dad.This novel is pitched as a \\"young adult\\" book, and in fairness I can imagine some YA readers digging it for the same reason they like the X-Men and Ender's Game. It's about finding your identity, becoming a person you can be proud of, and why the things that make you feel weird may be the things that make you strong.But I don't think most kids, regardless of the rah-rah boosterism, would just accept a world of flat characters, plot-driven coincidences, or writing that lowballs the audience's literacy. When I was fourteen, my friends and I read writers like Lloyd Alexander and Robert Silverberg, authors who wrote dense, compelling novels which a teen could understand but which I can still read and enjoy over twenty years later. Will any teens today say the same about James Patterson and Maximum Ride when they reach my age?I doubt it.Teens aren't stupid. They know when adults are talking down to them. Patterson, who cranks out about ten potboilers per year, seems to have decided to crack the Harry Potter market by lowering his expectations and submitting a novel that reads like a half-finished treatment for a comic book series or a TV movie.You have a pretty good premise here, James. Now I look forward to seeing the novel in which you have an equally good product."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Once I started reading the book, I didn't want to put it down.

And they r on the run going to california all the way to new york city is just a great fun book to read.When i read it at first i was bored at the begining then it was very fast and fun.The Chapters are short like 1-5 pages long every chapter, which is actually something different.

It started us all on this amazing book series.I was fascinated by Max's character. She's scared, brave, tough, tender-hearted, has a will to survive that surpasses everything else, and a tendency to fight for the underdog.I fell in love with the Flock, funny Gazzy, brooding Fang, sarcastic Iggy, talkative Nudge, lovable Angel, and brave Max.I'm not going to tell you what the book's about, plenty of others have told you the whole plot. But I just want to tell you that it's worth the afternoon of reading to join the ride of Maximum Ride.There are many things I don't understand in the book. One, why didn't Max beat Jeb to a pulp after he let her out of her cage? Two, why didn't she even wonder what she was saving the world from or how, just thought she was doing to save the world? Three, why did she not try to ignore the Voice instead of blindly trusting it? It could be anyone talking to her. Four, why doesn't she just ignore the Voice until it answers her questions instead of keeping listening to it? Max is so stubborn I expected she would at least do that much and find out about her parents.Five, what about Ella's dad? Who is he? Why does Ella have her mother's last name instead of her dad's?Six, why is the town where they live not even mentioned? I'd be interested in that.Anyway, thank you James Patterson, for this great book, and please update us on the auditions for the movie and news about it.

They are exciting, action pack tales that are definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel ExperimentBy: James PattersonThe Angel Experiment is apart of a series called Maximum Ride. The Series was written by James Patterson. The whole series of Maximum Ride is fiction. The book is about a 14 year old girl named Max Ride (also known as Maximum Ride) and her \\"gang\\" consisting of Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel who is the youngest at 6 years old, who all are 98% human, and 2% bird, and that 2% bird is their wings. So they can fly!!! Well the story is about these six kids who are pretty normal in most ways, except that they grew up in a lab, living like rats in cages, but now they're free. Besides that they're being hunted down by Erasers (crazy wolf-like creatures with a taste for flying humans). The story takes you from Death Valley, California all the way to New York Cities sub ways. While on this long run from the Erasers they encounter many obstacles like when they have to rescue Angel from the Erasers after she was captured. They also try to track down the flocks missing parents. This book was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The reason why is how there was never a dull moment, something was always happening. I think that this book could be for anyone willing to read a couple pages of the book because after that you don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Maximum Ride Series is great. I have read all of them so far and I can't wait for the fourth one.If you want to you can check out Fang's Blog at www.maximumride.blogspot.com . My favorite character is Iggy. Even though he's blind he can still do some amazing things (like make bombs and stuff like that).I think that everyone should read this book. It really makes you think about a lot of stuff that could and might happen someday, if it hasn't already.Just read it. I think that it's better than Harry Potter. If you don't like it than don't read the rest of the books but I think that you should at least read the first one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was a really good book.

As soon as I started, my wife, who has read quite a few of his novels, told me that the chapters will really move along. And she wasn't kidding. Some \\"chapters\\" are all of a page (or less). Finishing up a few chapters, I decided that what I bought was geared more for the teen market than my demographic. But it was a good read, when put into that context.This is the story of Max and her charges. Max, a fourteen year old girl, has been genetically engineered, as has the other five main characters. Each of them have wings, due to the splicing of some avian DNA. They escape The School, with the help of one of the scientists, where they were subjected to all sorts of tests. Everything seems to be okay, until Erasers (children engineered with wolf DNA - think werewolves) show up and kidnap one of them. The next part of the book is how the \\"flock\\" attempts to rescue one of their own from The School. The remainder of the novel deals with the flock as they attempt to discover where they came from, their parents, and their role in the world. All of this leads to the discovery/infiltration of The Institute.There isn't a whole lot of character development and the story just kind of ends. But then, this may be fine for the teen set. There is no doubt, after getting to the last page, that Patterson wrote this to be a series. But it was a letdown to get to that point without some sort of closure. Yes, I will read the next novel in the series, if nothing more than to get the closure that I so desperately need. :-) Overall, however, it was a good read and I will be giving it to my kids to read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I purchased Maximum Ride for my son who has enjoyed other books in this series.

While most 14-year olds are worried about grades, clothes, dating and which clique to join, Max is the self-appointed leader of these junior X-Men. Until their escape 4 years ago, the six of them -- Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and Angel -- had grown up in lab cages at the School. While picking strawberries one day at their mountaintop hideaway, Angel is captured by Erasers, half-human half-wolf mutants spawned from the same lab. They return her to the mad scientists at the School where she is forced to endure torturous experiments. During her captivity, Angel finds out that they have real parents somewhere.Meanwhile Max leads the orphans' cross-country race against the Erasers to save their little sister. What begins as a rescue, morphs into a mission to seek the truth about their mysterious past. Spurred on by a voice in Max's head, their quest takes them on a daring adventure to New York City where they hide in subway tunnels, sleep in trees, go shopping, and get makeovers. Along the way they discover new powers but are photographed in flight as the dangers of the city and the relentless Erasers close in on them. In this episode the answers they learn lead to even more questions, leaving readers eagerly waiting more about these plucky misfits.\\"Maximum Ride\\" is an action-packed thrill-ride for all ages.

I don't really know if it's really good to write about that in this concentration for this age of readers.Other than that I can't really say more since this book was one of the first books I have read (yes I'm a new reader) so my taste wasn't really stable yet and I didn't have any strong basis to criticize very well."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read. The genre was quite different than most books I have read. The fact that it was set in modern times with modern kids really hooked me. Usually sci-fi books are based in the future and have futuristic characters that readers cannot completely relate to, where as these kids seem normal but are hiding a dark secret. I was impressed, to say the least, when I read this because I was expecting the typical futuristic drama or the slow pace book that is described as action packed but contains little or no conflict, that is not what was in this book. This book is a modern, fast paced and action filled book that is not 'overly dramatic.' Many books with a lot of action tend to border on over dramatic, but this book finds the balance between exciting/entertaining and the drama queen that is interesting at first but then goes stale. I would recommend this book to kids around the age of 10-16 and possibly even younger or older readers. It depends on the taste and ability of the reader and this book is great for kids and young adults. I may not be a famous, professional book reviewer, but the common reader isn't, so isn't that the opinion that people can understand and relate to? Well, despite what some people believe, I say 'Well done, James Patterson!'"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel Expiriment had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.

It's fast paced and a easy read. If you like Patterson style you will enjoy the book. I would definately recommend it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I understand that it is a serialized novel but the book really needs a beginning and episodic endpoint. I first read this almost by accident as I saw James Patterson's name on it and had at the time never heard of the series. I am a fan of Patterson's adult work so I decided to give it a go on an extended flight delay in New Orleans. The characters are original and Patterson doesn't disappoint. He uses the same aplomb he employs in His Women's Murder Club Books to create a believable tale of the matriarch of the winged mutant teen group. He briefly touches on ethics and throws some mystery (of Course) the readers way, but he stalls at any true revelation of the back-story and my criticism of this particular book is that it plays as a TV episode and not as a stand alone piece of literature."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I don't normally give anything a 5 star rating. Patterson is one of my favorite contemporary authors BUT this is one of his best compilations! I am hooked on this series & only hope the following books will keep up with this one....

They have wings, light bones, air sacks, and some weird special powers. They don't know who their parents are, our even their real names.They were made in a laboratory/prison they call the school. When Jeb Batchelder kidnapped, or in this case bird-kidnapped them and took them to a secret home. He then died and they lived on their own.

Something or someone keeps helping them; talks to the older girl in her head. Lots of unanswered questions as to what is going on and who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.The writing style is interesting; narration by the leading flyer.

I have not read it and enjoyed it. The description doesn't really explain too much about the books so I went into the story not knowing what to expect.The first book in the series goes into a little detail on the kids and their past. The story has 6 main characters that are children aged from 6-14 and have been genetically altered with bird DNA, they have wings, they eat tons, and they are faster and stronger than the average child. These children have spent a majority of their life living in an experimental institution.The story takes off after the kids were broken out of the institute by a scientist named Jeb, he has educated them, trained them, and taken care of them for a while. One day he disappears and shortly after the youngest of the \\"flock\\" is kidnapped. The majority of the book is from the point of view of 14 year old Max and is about her journey to find and rescue the missing 6 year old, Angel.I really like Max, she is very sarcastic, witty, and strong. (emotionally, mentally, and physically) She will do anything for her flock and takes care of them as if they belonged to her. She has very a very strong emotional bond with the only family she has ever had. She will not give up on the chance to give these kids a normal life. The flock consists of 14 year old Fang who is basically the second in command, 14 year old Iggy, 11 year old Nudge, 8 year old Gasman, and 6 year old Angel. They are all awesome in their own way. They all have big attitudes, snarky comments, and odd behaviors.The end of the book concluded for the most part but left me with some questions that encouraged me to read the next book. I will continue with the series and see where it leads me."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"OMG! I love this series! My friend suggested I read the book, & I did! From page one, I loved it. The Maximum Ride Books are a page turning series! This is about mutant bird kids who are 98% human and 2% bird. Scientists created them (Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Angel, and the Gasman) at a lab called The School. They are running (well, actually flying) away from the scientists, who want them back at the school. Maximum Ride ia action-packed and a great choise for teens.

Probably my favorite book by James Patterson."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I read the book maximum ride and I think other kids would enjoy this book because of how make believe it is for example how many books have you read that are about a 98 percent human and 2 percent bird creature. This book is defiantly a four and a half is because I don't like that it's a sires, but other than that its very well written and it gave me such a rush of emotions all at once take for example when I found out max was a girl. I was thinking about how she always has to be in control and reasonable not just for herself but also for the others that has 98 percent human and the other 2 bird. How else this amassing author got to me was when angle got taken and max automatically went to get angle even though I didn't work quit right. I was sad for angle but I was moved when max tried her hardest to get her back. Even though this is a made up I stilled believe every word like it was actually happening the charters had so many emotion that she didn't tell the reader but she showed the read I know that was how it was for me. The end of the book was good because it didn't show an illusion of a fairy tale ending but it wasn't a terrible ending were every one dies even though some of them are mean enough where they should but anyway I thought it was touching and anybody lucky enough to read it would think so to. My favorite part is when max goes and helps a poor girl that is getting bullied and then when she got shot and the nice girl took care of her."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This fast paced sci-fi adverture thriller has just about everything thrown in there. And it is thrown in with the expertise, only a professional like James Patterson can master.This book actually raises your heartbeat. Never a dull moment. Constant action with just enough character building to ensure a constant state of anxiety on behalf of our heroes. Short choppy structure and constant crisis keep you chomping on your nails.My only complaint is I felt I was missing something. I felt I was dropped into the story and it was never really explained as the book unfolded At the end of the novel I still felt a little dissatisfied with my grip on exactly what was going on. I understand that this is part of the ongoing mystery - but I have also read a couple of the sequels.Anywhoooo - Maximum ride is a hell of a ride and I would recommend it to anyone with a short attention span or is just way to busy to wait for the author to get the story moving."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was great! for the couple hours on which i was reading it, i couldn't get off. great plot"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I thought this book was awesome!

When they review it, the review will be sent through Amazon also."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I've never read James Patterson, but assumed that he was a good writer because he's published so much. I'm still going to give him the benefit of a doubt and say that he might be a good writer for adults, but this little trip into Young Adult fiction was a mistake. He can't write from the perspective of a 14 year-old girl. This was painfully obvious from the start. The whole time I had the feeling that he was writing down to the audience. It has the distinct vibe of \\"This is what the young people are saying these days, right?\\" The main character is what I'm guessing is supposed to be a strong female role model. She's annoyingly flawless. Seriously, no flaws, except maybe her uncontrollable urge to save people. She never had any real fear, doubt, insecurities. She never thinks about herself. She just beats up monsters and goes on and on about how much she loves her adopted siblings, whom she selflessly raises with no help. I consider myself a pretty empathetic reader, but I couldn't care about any of these characters. Flat. Predictable. Horribly named.I've heard the plot praised for being fast-paced, but it was choppy and unbelievably. Conflicts popped out of nowhere and then disappeared with the help of luck and random, previously undiscovered super powers. I like a good sci-fi or fantasy read. I'm pretty good at believing the unbelievable, but I couldn't get lost in this story. I was constantly jarred back to reality by the completely unreal characters."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Before I start, let me note that I'm writing this review primarily for parents, not the tweens/teens for whom Mr. Patterson has targeted this series of novels. While there is nothing in my review unsuitable for young readers, the tone and substance assumes a parental viewpoint.**************I picked up this paperback at my local grocery store, just in the mood for some relatively mindless pulp fiction reading, and this one looked intriguing. It wasn't until I was well into the book that I realized it was intended for a juvenile audience. In fact, for the teen or tween, Patterson has concocted a recipe they'll find almost irresistable: no parents, no rules, a diet consisting of almost continual junk food, adults who are always out to get them, and a mission to save the world (literally). Oh yeah, and the kids can fly...really. Got the picture? It's the stuff of every teen's fantasy life: the adults really ARE out to get me, I can eat/say/do whatever I want, I can raise myself without the need for parents, and I can fly.What's not to like? Well, plenty...if you're a parent. If books could be graded like movies, I'd definitely give this one a PG-13. But more on that in a moment.Essentially, this series of books is about kids who have been genetically engineered to have wings and other special super-powers (like reading minds, super-human strength, super-human endurance). By grafting avian DNA and human DNA, some renegade scientists have begun exploring a brave new world. While the majority of their experiments have turned out hideously deformed, the protagonists of our story turned out remarkably well (with the exception of Iggy...he's blind). They consist of half a dozen kids ranging in age from 6 years old to 17, led by our heroine, Miss Maximum (Max) Ride herself...the namesake of Patterson's series.In this book, the kids have \\"flown the coop\\" quite literally by escaping the lab (sarcastically called \\"The School\\") where they were created, forced to live in cages, and subjected to hideous experiments. One can't help but speculate that maybe Patterson has intentionally woven this into the plot to resonate with the juvenile angst of having to live under their parents' roof, submit to their rules, and go to school. Hmmm.The remainder of the book finds our protagonists running for their lives from those in The School who want to keep their dark secrets concealed at any cost. To accomplish this mission, The School has engineered some vicious little creations - part human, part wolf - that are aptly named \\"Erasers\\" since their mission is to snub out the lives of the escaped kids.Amidst breathless chases and narrow escapes, our protagonists muse about what life would be like with real parents, and express genuine longing for real families rather than the \\"family\\" they have formed amongst themselves.As the oldest, our heroine displays a number of admirable traits, most notably that she is selfless and makes sure the other members of her affectionately called \\"flock\\" are fed and taken care of before attending to her own needs. She genuinely loves her brood and it is clear that the weight of responsibility bears heavily upon her shoulders. She's a kid who never had a childhood, hoping desperately to compensate by giving some semblance of a childhood to the others in her rag tag flock.It is a fun, fanciful read, but while *intended* for young readers, I would suggest that it isn't necessarily *suitable* for young readers.As I noted above, what Patterson gives us is a group of kids that can do/say/eat whatever they want, living parent-less (admittedly, not by choice) as they rebel against some monstrous injustices in their lives. But in Patterson's world, the ensuing chase makes it OK for the kids to steal, swear, and generally bend the rules. In a later installment, it's even OK for them to have sex with one another. Now, I don't consider myself a prude, but that isn't generally the worldview that I trying to impart to my children.I know there will be some who say \\"lighten up...it's just a fantasy novel,\\" and frankly, after I finished reading the book I actually briefly considered reading it aloud to my son (he's 11). But then as I reflected over the various direct and indirect messages in the book, I decided against it. The characters do display some admirable qualities: loyalty, selflessness, courage, compassion, and tenacity. They genuinely pine for the sense of belonging and rootedness that can only come from a nuclear family. Our primary protagonist (Max) accepts responsibility not only for her brood, but for the much larger mission of saving the world. All good stuff.But for me, there were an equal number of problems introduced along the way: Situational ethics. Foul mouths. A strong rebellious undercurrent. And at least a few symbolic issues, one of which I addressed above, and that I doubt will escape most teens, at least at a subconscious level.Patterson had the opportunity to give us an outstanding and wholesome series of books that would appeal to teens without making parents have to think twice about the messages being conveyed. Unfortunately, in Patterson's attempt to be \\"hip\\" with his readers, he gave them a parent-unfriendly diet.As such, I'm afraid I just can't recommend these books for young readers. At minimum, if your tween/teen is going to read them, use them as an opportunity for a kid/parent discussion about the moral issues raised in the book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Get comfortable, grab a good, tight grip on this book, and prepare for an awesome adventure! At first glance Max might look like an average 14-year-old girl, but you'll quickly realize that she's anything but ordinary. Max has wings! And they aren't just for decoration either. Max can fly; she can soar high into the clear, blue sky like a bird! And Max can do this because she actually is part bird! Sounds pretty cool, eh? Well, not exactly.See, Max spends the first 10 years of her life locked in a tiny cage at a place called The School. There she suffers through test after horrid test from the scientists who created her by adding bird DNA to her own human DNA. While there, she meets five other winged kids, and with the help of a sympathetic scientist, the six of them manage to escape. This fantastic freedom becomes the happiest time in their lives, bonding Max, Fang, Iggy, the Gasman, Nudge and Angel into a family, the only family any of them has ever known.But then out of nowhere, their past catches up with them. The Erasers discover their hideout and snatch up six-year-old Angel! Another experiment of the school, Erasers are half-humans, half-wolves, and a whole lot of mean. Max and the others would rather die than have Angel back in the hands of the evil scientists, so they set out to rescue Angel, thus taking a flying leap into this fast-paced adventure that just doesn't stop, not even when the pages end. Along the way they uncover more and more questions that --- just maybe --- they don't really want to know the answers to, like the truth about their parents and the mysterious voice echoing instructions in Max's head.James Patterson is an amazing storyteller, grabbing the reader's attention on page one and holding on with color and humor all the way through the book. His characters are distinct, layered and very real, complete with hopes, fears and flaws. His vivid descriptions put the reader right up in the sky flying next to Max and the gang, feeling the wind ripple though their feathers and the emotions tear through their hearts. I'm very much looking forward to the sequel, which will be released in Spring 2006. Way to go, Mr. Patterson!--- Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman, author"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The book bounces around terribly at times. I understand following characters as they split up, but spending ten paragraphs with one character and another dozen with a second group then transitioning to an equal amount of time with yet a 3rd is very difficult for me as a reader. It's simply hard to get into the stories this way. The absolute worst part of the book is that it's only half there. I know the sequel is out now, but I simply don't feel like it's appropriate to award the author for simply splitting a story for what appears to be nothing more than a chance to reach into my wallet a second time."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The Angel Experiment (2005) is the first SF novel in the Maximum Ride series. It is set in the present and involves a secret science lab -- the School -- where human DNA is being manipulated. The mutated human stock are often tested to destruction.In this novel, Maximum Ride is a fourteen year old girl with wings. She and her friends can fly like birds. They all believe that they had been grown from in vitro embryos, although they dream of having parents somewhere.Fang is the next oldest within the flock. He is about six months younger than Max. He is rather close mouthed, usually speaking only when he has something significant to say.Iggy is about the same age. He is blind due to a failed operation on his eyes. He is very intelligent, the smartest in the flock.Nudge -- AKA Monique -- is the fourth oldest, probably around eleven years old. She is a motormouth, saying whatever pops up in her mind. She only quiets down when she is asleep.Gasman is about eight years old. He is the brother of Angel. Gazzie has a flatulence problem.Angel is about six years old. She can read minds.Jeb Batchelder was a lab technician at the School. He had stolen Max and her friends away about four years ago. He was the nearest thing to a father that they have ever had. Two years ago, Jeb disappeared and is presumed to be dead.In this story, the flock is attacked by Erasers -- bioengineered human stock with the ability to change to wolves -- and Angel is stolen. The flock counterattacks, but Angel is thrown into a helicopter and carried away. Max is stunned by the incident, but soon starts planning Angel's rescue.The flock figures that Angel is being taken back to the School. They dig out a map showing the location of the secret lab. Nudge also sees her name and notices the address of her parents.Max, Fang, and Nudge start flying toward the School. Iggy and Gasman are left behind. They are very upset, but then they find a way to keep busy while the others are gone.The boys start preparing defenses for the property. Their masterpiece is a time bomb, but they also rig traps on the roads coming into the area. Then they get to try out their devices.On the way to the School, Max diverts her flight to rescue a younger girl from three bullies. She quickly puts all three on the ground and sends Ella running home. Then one of the bullies picks up a shotgun and Max also runs away.The guy with the shotgun shots at Max and mostly misses her. But one shot injures her arm and wing. She gets away from them, but now needs medical attention. And then a hard rain begins to fall.Fang and Nudge wait for Max near Lake Meade, but Max never shows. Then they search for her and Nudge notices that she is near her hometown. She flies down to look for her family and almost gets caught by the Erasers.Meanwhile, Angel wakes to find herself within the School. The white coated technicians start testing her strength, agility, cognitive ability and other talents. She gets to run mazes, trying to avoid the hot wires and electric prods.This tale leaves Max lost and alone. Then she finds the house where Ella lives and is treated by Ella's mother, a veterinarian. If she didn't have to rescue Angel, Max could get use to living this way.According to the author, the idea for this novel comes fromWhen the Wind BlowsandThe Lake House. These works also feature a character named Max, who escapes from a School. But this novel is not otherwise related to these earlier works.The story has some fantastic elements. Thirteen foot wingspans are not likely to lift a teenager, even with thin and hollow bones, stronger muscles, and improved respiration. And then there is the mind reading ability.Still, the novel has much the same suspense as other works by this author. The next volume isSchool's Out - Forever. Read and enjoy!Recommended for Patterson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of mutated humans, evil scientists, and strong comradeship.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I fell in love with Maximum Ride:The Angel Experiment the moment I read the first line. It was epic, exciting, and it left me on the edge of my seat. I never wanted to put it down! I have read the whole series now and I'm waiting for the sixth one to come out. But, I would recommend the Maximum Ride series to anyone and everyone. It is absolutely amazing! You won't be able to put it down. Trust me."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I found Maximum Ride a lovely book with the perfect amount of darkness to it. I mean, really, who wants to read a story where everything's always hunky-dory and nothing ever goes wrong? That's what I thought.Anyway, Max, a fourteen year old self-proclaimed bird-girl (or Avian-American. Kind of an inside joke for people who've read Max Ride School's Out - Forever), and her winged, 2% bird Flock (all of whom are under fifteen yearsof age): Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman (Gazzy) and Angel are on the run from other mutants who want to capture them and bring them back to The School (The lab they were raised in, the School is located above the Badwater Basin in Death Valley). Max and her Flock have vowed never to go back to the School, but have no choice but to return when the youngest member of the Flock, six-year-old Angel, is kiddnapped by Erasers, half-wolf half-human mutants, who work as police, guards and exicutioners for the School, according to Maximum Ride herself.Jeb Batchelder is father to Ari, the leader of the Erasers (Max didn't know Ari had been 'Eraserfied' yet until he took Angel and she saw him morphed), and used to be a friend and father-like figure to Max, but then he 'died', two years before Max and her Flock returned to the School. Something happened to Jeb, but he's not actually dead. You really want to know? You really have to read the Angel Experiment, then. :)Max and Fang are close friends, and co-leaders, and they have many nightly talks about what to do with the Flock, and where to go next, and sometimes, just about anything. Max can find comfort in the black eyes of her right-hand man (Fang), even though she doesn't say it in so many words. One thing about them, is you're never quite sure about their relationship. Sometimes you might think they love each other, but then you turn around and they're fighting, or dating someone else, et cetera.Max has other problems, too, besides finding Angel, saving the world (I forgot to mention that, huh?), and keeping her Flock alive and well. She also has a criptic Voice inside her head that gives her worse-than-a-migrane headaches. Max can't tell if the Voice is either male of female, friend or foe (albeit it says it is her friend) and it almost never shows emotion. As you might imagine, it gets annoying at times.This book takes you into the action from the first chapter, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire read. I know. I started Maximum Ride, the Angel Experiment at midnight (I am a huge night-owl) and finished it four hours later.Now, nearly five months later, I have read and repeatedly re-read MR one and two, written some fan-fiction on it, gotten two albums from two bands [...](I'm sorry for the length of my review, but it is very hard for me to write a short review about my favorite book.)And needless to say, I give Maximum Ride (The Angel Experiment, and School's out - Forever) five stars.Cheers to James Patterson and his first teen novel!-DarkHawk09"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride... a fourteen year old mutant girl, with no known family and wings, the result of a science experiment conducted by \\"evil\\" whitecoats.

I had borrowed my friend's copy of The Angel Experiment and read it in one night. I eventually bought the following of the series, School's Out - Forever, and Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, and read through them just as quickly! I then decided that my \\"collection\\" of the series looked pretty sad without having purchased my own copy of The Angel Experiment, so I bought one (very cheap, compared to several nearby bookstores!) off of Amazon and loved it all over again!This series is about The Flock, which consists of Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. They're DNA experiments--98% human and 2% avian. Basically, you, as a reader, get to tag along with the Flock as they endure many exciting and thrilling adventures. I couldn't put the book down!

And some in the group have extra abilities that they're just discovering. Max and the rest of the flock are being chased and hunted down by the nefarious Erasers, genetically enhanced boys that can shift into wolf-like creatures. The Erasers work for the \\"white lab coats\\" and the school that the flock ran away from. When one of her flock gets captured, Max and the others form a rescue party. But nothing goes as planned.

Good plot and strong characters, some loveable, with others being equally hateful. Dialog is realistic, humorous at times, and easy to read. Overall, a fun book to read. Leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson's work over a decade ago stopped consistently being masterpiece after masterpiece and became very hit and miss with very average novels published throughout most of his recent career, with only the odd great read every now and then published, with readers just keep picking up each successive novel hoping the old quality will be back. Well I'm pleased to say, it is back with The Angel Experiment. I must admit I was very surprised as Patterson's last attempt at the children's market SantaKid, well as those of us unfortunate enough to have read it know, pitiful is being nice. With Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment, quality is achieved albeit for a much older children's market than SantaKid. Well actually I don't even know why the publishers say this is a kids book (young adult) as it is even more violent than the two adult novels in this series and although it has been a while since I read When the Wind Blows and The Lake House I didn't really notice any differences in the way they are written. Obviously it's just a marketing thing by the publishers to sell more books in this series. Although you could read this as a stand alone novel you really do need to have previously read the two adult novels before this as well to understand and enjoy this story to its full extent, so marketing this and the subsequent novels in this series as a younger age group doesn't make much sense but adults will love this book anyway.In Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment, Max and the five other kids with wings are back for the third instalment in the series. They are happily living in their secluded hide out which Jed, the good scientist from the School who unfortunately met his demise in the previous books set up for them. Their peaceful existence is smashed however when the youngest girl Angel is taken by Erasers (bad creations from the school). Max takes control and organises a rescue mission where the children all discover they have other powers they haven not tapped into yet. The mission will take them not only to the rural school but to New York and the answers to their past they so have longed for all their lives. Some unpleasant surprises are on the way for Max and the others that will repulse them beyond any level they've endured before!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I bought this because I love James Patterson's books.

She can't stop talking about this series and is living for the movie."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was in my eyesight for a long time. Since I likd sci-fi and suspense, it would have been the book for me. Still, though, I was hesitant on reading it. Once I was at the library looking for books and I saw my friend. She saw me with the book and was super positive about it. I stood there looking at it like an idiot. I didn't get it, though. A year or so later, I looked for new books on my Kindle when I saw that book. It suddenly looked appealing to me, so I bought it. When I cracked it open, I was taken away from reality into Max's nightmare. Patterson puts that little drop of dark suspense into the endings of each chapter, and it not only kept me on the edge of my seat, I couldn't tell you how many times I had to keep myself from toppling over.Where should we start? I'm trying to make this review so long. Oh well. I'll say as much as I want to say. You can't stop me.First, the suspense is spectacular. If this was based on archery, Patterson would have hit the bullseye so much Robin Hood would be jealous. The hint of dark suspense he sprinkles in every time mad me rethink putting it down for a few minutes. I always wanted to see what would happen next in the story. Their journey to resue Angel from the School is almost immaculate, I couldn't bear the suspense of the middle chapters. After they're in NYC trying to solve the problem THERE, I thought I wound NEVER stop shaking. The suspense is epic. No more questions asked.Second, the action. I've never read so much action since I cracked open Hunger Games. The fight scenes are played out with exceptional aspects of battle without the dinky swords. Should I even mention the description of pain in this book? I could not only put myself in the shoes of the charcters, but I was able to be Ari for a second and feel the bite pain radiating up my arm when Max bites him. I could also really pretend to reenact the fight scenes from the book. I heard a friend say that most of the fight scenes and wound scenes were too graphic- I mean, come on now. The figh scenes are a three on the gory meter. They barely describe a deep cut or gunshot wound. It's still a good book without the blood and gore.Lastly, the characters. I. Love. Those. Kids. Pattrson nails the points of these characters easily. I can totally relate to a lot of them, and to me they're just plain awesome. Ari. I would make an awesome Ari. He's one of the best villains Patterson ever included. Fang and Iggy are cool, too. I can feel how annoying Nudge can get sometimes. Every story needs good characters, or it's good to say the story has no plot or emphasis at all. I've read many books where I didn't care if they die or not. Others I WANTED the characters to perish. Not Maximum Rie. These characters are the heart of the story itsself. Read it for the characters.This book, as I explained, is the best thing that ever happened to the book world, no exceptions. I explained that there is something to read this book for. Even though there are one or two story relates flaws, they're too weak and couldn't take a star away for them. What are you waiting for, ten pounds of GUTS? Hop in. Buckle u. And hang on for the ENTIRE Ride! And tone it up... MAXIMUM!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Great book.

This book is one of the biggest page turner' s I know in fact I read this in one day. This book is very descriptive in fight scenes and adds an element that helps how intense it Is and once again you can never put it down. You really see the book in your mind.

The other character I was really blown away by was Angel. She seems like a sweet, charming little girl, but she can do some serious damage. Even her just being gone almost tore the flock apart.

You're thrown right into the action from the first page and it's hard to put down! Not only is it an epic, modern sci-fi adventure, but it also has some comedy mixed in. Even though it's violent and the idea of gentically engineering children can be scary, it truly does have positive messages. Max sometimes doesn't think before she acts, but she's a great leader and truly cares about everyone in her flock, which is dispayed throughout the engrossing story. I honestly have never met someone who read this book and didn't like it. This nonstop action, amusing novel is great for teens and adults."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I liked this book. I am not going to say it was great, because I have read better. Much better. I thought this book was going to be amazing from first page to the very end, but by the time I was half way through I was wanting to quit. I think part of the reason I didn't enjoy it is do to the length. This book was sooo long! I just kept guessing when it was going to end and when it finally did end I gave a huge sigh of relief! I also thought the plot was a bit dull... The book was an \\"adventure\\", but some things seemed like they repeated themselves. Over and over again. For example, the hunt for the Institute. It took up over half the book. I like things to go a little faster. At this point I am not sure if I will continue reading the books in the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"'Being a mutant isn't always easy. In fact, it's never easy. Maximum Ride and her friends - her family - are six mutants created by scientists at the School. They...well...they have wings. They can fly. Max, Fang, Iggy, the Gasman, Nudge, and Angel: a family, the best of friends, in hiding, freaks to the rest of the world, never completely safe. They are on their own, after their savior and father figure, Jeb, was killed.But when the youngest of their Flock, Angel, is kidnapped by the Erasers, creatures created by the School for evil purposes, Max and her friends will do anything and everything to get her back - and they might just discover some startling secrets and life-or-death obstacles along the way._________________________________________My thoughts -'This story is told from Max's perspective, and let me just say first off - Dang! That girl has one powerful, impressive, and strong voice. But more on that in a bit....This was one heck of a book. It was another \\"Well...I'm not sure if I'm going to like it\\" book. Another, \\"Holy crud I was sooooo wrong\\" book. I can't say enough good stuff about it - in fact, I'm lacking any sort of criticism...because there's nothing to criticise! James Patterson has all sorts of talent - in every area of writing/story-telling. It blew me out of the water.For a while I was like, \\"Wow, this book is really well-developed in the story factor!\\" Then, a bit later, I thoguht, \\"He really focuses on characters and making them real...I'm impressed!\\" Then, the same thing about the action. Then the writing. Then the emotion. I went on like this in dog-chasing-tail fashion before I realized: It isn't one of these aseptcs...it's all of it - the whole flipping package!Character notes -'From the very first pages, I felt like I knew Max already. She's strong, sweet, loving, and tough when she needs to be. When I think of Max, I think mature. She's had to go through so much, had to practically raise these kids on her own, and even through all the tough pockets of life, she loves them more than she loves herself. Her selflessness amazed me - as did the rest of the Flock's. All six of them were willing to give their lives for the others in a heartbeat.I loved the whole Flock. All of them, so so much. They all brought something to the table, something vital to the story. They were all alive - I can still picture them perfectly, as though I've known them all my life. It's a pretty neat feeling.(It's a difficult job, picking a favorite in a book that holds so many great characters, but Fang has got to be at the very top. He was wonderful the whole time. I love how his eyes and his fraction-of-a-second smiles convey his moods so perfectly, and all the while keep his character consistent and just awesome. And the sacrifices he makes for his \\"family\\"...man...I was so impressed - let's just say that!)Story notes -This is one of those books where everything bad that could possibly happens - happens. Like, there is no end to the amount of trouble, danger, and action. There are bombings, chase scenes, going under cover, fist fights, and lots and lots of secrets. Every chapter held a new dilemma, every chapter brought up some new disaster that kept the Flock from attaining their goal. This only worked to make this book even more genius than it already was.The actual story is super duper emotional. More so than I was expecting. On top of the action-packed scenes (which take up the majority of the book), I couldn't help but feel deeply...for the entire book. It was heart-breaking, pitiful, and just plain yucky-feeling that these kids have nowhere to go...that they are looked upon as freaks, cast-aways of society. Life will never be normal for them. And when they triumph over their enemies in scenes throughout the book, all I wanted to do was jump out of my seat and whoop for joy! James Patterson really use the characters and their sticky situation to tug at your heart and keep you sucked into the story until you've turned the last page. And even after, coming from my perspective.The writing is just as wonderful as the rest of this wonderful, awesome package of a story. It's simple, its own style, with a touch of humor and lots of really great dialogue to keep it flowing perfectly. Each character had his/her own way of speaking/expressing him/herself.Oh, and the irony of this story.... Geeeee it kept me on my toes. Max was often put in ironic situations that she couldn't get out of, or that reminded her of something terrible from her past, or both. And this leads me to...One word of phrase to sum it up (final thoughts) -Ironic. Seriously ironic. And of course, all the other words you can use to describe a wonderful, action-packed, emotional sci-fi adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end. Except, this isn't the end. There are six more books, and this is making me sooooo happy. I'm just dying for book #2 to come in at the library! (This is one of those series where I cease to care about all other books I have to read - I must...get...the...next...book!) Recommended to anyone and everyone...seriously. Don't hesitate to pick this up!This is a very clean book - I think good for ages 12 and up! :)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a great series but also works as a stand alone.It is fast paced and really makes you think.James Patterson is one of my favorite authors so I haveyet to read a book of his that I don't like!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a great science fiction/fantasy book for young adults and adults. The writing style is geared for teenagers, not talking down to them at all, the book is unique in it's terminology and style. One of the things I loved when I read it was that it didn't talk down to me or simplify, it was full-on, teen-orientated, sci-fi action.The characters are escapees from a government run facility, and have adjusted DNA that incoporates animal DNA in their genetics. Called the Angel experiment, these teenagers have bird DNA in them and big white wings they can fly with because of it. They're on the run with secret agencies chasing them and nowhere is safe, and that's just the beginning.The book is brimming with action and suspense and gives off a 'Dark Angel' feel. There's certainly a strong essence of a dystopian future in this novel and some great sci-fi moments.The story takes you on one hell of a joyride."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson is a master storyteller. He has a great ability to develop intrigue and anticipation via a cinematic approach and a building plot. His utilization of small chapters that jump between multiple characters and settings is very effective.However, James Patterson is not a master wordsmith. Even with interesting stories, I tend to find his writing somewhat elementary. In his books for the adult market, I can manage because the plot is engaging enough for me to disregard the language, but in Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment, Patterson's dumbing down of his already basic language made the text almost impossible for me to get through.I actually purchased this book years ago when it was originally released in 2004. I was a huge fan of When the Wind Blows and The Lake House so when I saw a Patterson book with a winged girl on the cover and \\"Maximum\\" in the title (the name of a main character in the former books), I immediately assumed it was the third of the series and bought it without question. It wasn't until I got home and started reading it that I realized it was merely Patterson's first attempt at entering the young adult book market using characters and concepts he developed for the earlier books. At the time, I was so disappointed that I shut the book and stuffed it on a shelf.In 2009, I picked it up again. This time I failed to complete the book because of the language. I managed to come to terms with it being a new series, but the colloquial language and the stereotypical \\"teen\\" ramblings was at the time impossible for me to deal with. As such, the book was closed again and stored on the shelf.Recently, I've been on another young adult fiction kick and I decided that I would get through the book, come hell or high water. As of last night, I have fulfilled my goal.My take on it. It was alright. Unlike the other Patterson works I have read (which is a small sample, granted) I found this one not nearly as developed. Many things involving the history of the characters and the company were nonexistent. I felt many times that I was filling in those gaps from the information I garnered from When the Wind Blows and The Lake House, but to young readers who haven't read them, I could see there being a wealth of unanswered questions once the book is finished.Also, Patterson attempted to create a very telling and revealing climactic conclusion to this first book, but I found the entire ending lackluster, with a measly chase and a brief fight.I wanted, and was hoping for more, but felt disappointed once I'd read the final page. Perhaps the story advances drastically in book 2, but I'm unsure if I want to spend another seven years reading another book in this series.This is definitely not one of Patterson's shining pieces of work.Rating C-/D+"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Well it starts off with Maximum(max) running away from the bad guys the ERASERS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Then I checked the reviews, and got the book.Frankly, I was expecting more of this book. It's ok, but not great. I'd say it may be a book for teenagers, but not for me or my young kids. The author comments were misleading.Furthermore, the book is obviously intended to create a series, with many questions being left without an answer. I finished the book, but I don't care about the characters at all. I did not get hooked."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This review is really for my daughter - who loved this book and the whole series.

I got this book cause it was a freebie and it helps me branch out and find new things I like when I don't have anything to read. From page one of this book I was hooked. It is very fast paced , you can't put it down. It's a root for the under dog kind of book. It's just creepy enough to make it very suspenseful but not really gory or graphic. There isn't really any lauguage or anything vulgar in it which is a rare find this day and age. I would happily let my 11 or 7 yr olds read this. I think it ios very entertaining.

The first book I read by James Patterson, and honestly I was expecting a lot worse. The only complaint I have is the first book being a lot easier to acquire than the others. My local public library only has the first, which I find hard to understand. Why have only the first book in a series?Anyway, back to the book. I found I could really relate to Max, as I am her age.

Nudge especially."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I got hooked into this from the first sentence.The plots and characters are amazing, the white coats creeped me out major time, and I've gotten into the main character (Max) a lot.I'm definitely going to read this.

If you are under the age of 13, the font, pacing and style will most likely appeal to you. If you are older 13 (or have a 7th grade+ reading level), it is quite possible you will read it through in a few hours. Because the chapters are so short, it also makes a great toilet read; most chapters are 3-4 pages -- some more, some less.The only infuriating aspect of the book is the writing. It is too informal at some points. Despite written in the perspective of a teenage girl (who lacks formal education), many times I found myself shaking my head at the end of the paragraph.Overall, a nice weekend read for a 5th grader."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is amazing! I don't like the cover as much but that is the least of my concerns. There was no marks on the book which I liked. overall this book was fabulous!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Boy, have I been chastised by everyone for simply saying I like the book. It's not a book that interested me. It's intense, and I love intense, but it just wasn't the right kind of intense. It also had promise and that is why I gave it three stars. I love all of the characters good or bad. James Patterson is brilliant at variety when it comes to characters. But I just couldn't get into the plot. It wasn't satisfying and didn't make me desperate to finish the book. But like I said, I'm going to give this book a chance and continue reading the series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I thought that this was a good first entry into this series. The pace moves quickly and there is more than enough mystery to keep you turning the pages looking for clues."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is freaking amazing! It is definitly going on my shelf next to Pride and Prejudice and Scorpia. I'm forcing myself to wait for book two to come out in papreback, but I'm not sure if I'm going to make it. It's so good though! and the really crazy thing is, most of the stuff Max does, I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME EXACT THING! right down to her sarcastic comments. It's freaky. Freaking amazing! All these people keep talking about how she sounds to old for her age but um, hello? Do you know any 14 year olds who take care of 4 other kids (like Fang is going to let her tale care of him). Buy it. Now. Or I will send the voice into your head. I'm not even kidding."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment is an awesome fantasy book written by James Patterson. Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman and Angel are all normal kid. Except for one thing. The are 2% bird with giant wings, raptor vision, and other avian powers. They had spent the first years of their lives locked up in cages and tested on like science experiments. But now they are free. When Angel is kidnapped by Erasers, just like them, but with wolf DNA, it is up to the rest of the flock to get her back. Oh yeah, they have to save the world too. If there is time...I highly recommend this book. I loved it. It kept me up at night unable to put it down. My favorite part in this book was when they did everyday things and thought it was amazing, such as going to the zoo, the beach, inside a car, or in a store. Since they have to stay hidden most of the time, they have never been anywhere. It's funny and interesting to watch them react to things I have seen and done thousands of times. This book really leaves you hanging, where are desperate for more. So I also recommend that you read the second one. Maximum Ride: Schools Out-Forever. It is a fabulous book an ties up a lot of loose ends. But not all of them.My favorite character is Max. She is so sarcastic and, since the story is told from her point of view, she talks to you. Like on page 186, she says-Note to self: Disable the air bags on the next car you steal. Yeah, this is after she smashed right into a sedan. I laughed out loud at this and many other parts.I recommend this book to anybody. It's fun, eventful, action-packed and is some places laugh-out-loud funny. There is a lot of fighting, so if you don't like kicking and punching, this might not be your type of book. It is a great read any time. It is now one of my favorite books. If I could, I would give it 6 out of 5 stars. After I read it, I had one question. \\"Is the whole flock ever going to find their real parents? Or were they made in test tubes?\\""},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book really takes you for a wild ride. I couldn't put it down. Fast moving."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was a quick read, but very exciting! I LOVED IT!!! I bought the soundtrack and read it in one sitting! I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Summer reading. Two words teens in high school usually hate seeing. I had the same feeling. I got the reading list and found \\"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment\\" on it and thought, \\"Hmm. Sounds interesting.\\" I went to the library and checked it out. From the moment I began reading it, I was hooked. I would sit for hours at a time, wondering what would happen next.\\"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment\\" is about a group of children, aged around the age of 8 to as old as 16. These kids have a special ability. Not only is their ability special, but it is somewhat frightening. MAx and the \\"flock\\" were born like any regular child, but were taken away from their parents to a place called \\"The School\\" where many different tests and experiments were performed on them. In this twisting adventure, \\"The School\\" is after Max and the \\"flock\\", determained to get them back. Follow MAx and the rest on a hair raising adventure in which they make friends, and enemies. Learn what happened to the \\"flock\\" and what is so special about them and what they are so determained about.Read \\"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment\\" today!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If you can get your age 11 or older child to read \\"Maximum Ride...\\", they will not be disappointed. This is the only book by Mr. Patterson that I have read but I was struck by his ability to craft a fast moving, very exciting tale. Others critique the weak characterizations and dialogue but if you have a child who loves adventure stories with a strong dose of fantasy this is the book that may launch them into being more avid readers. What isn't clear at present is if Mr. Patterson can sustain the core of this tale over several books in a series. We will have to wait and see."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"First off, I must say that while I was disappointed that this was not a continuation of The Lake House and When the Wind Blows series; it was a great book nonetheless. The flock is quick, entertaining and Max is extremely funny. I finished this book in two days time and that's only because I can only read during my commute to and from work, otherwise I would have finished the book much sooner.If in fact this is the beginning to a series for young readers, then I look foward to having my daughter read them as well."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I just brought this book. I just start reading it. The only problem that i'm having is that the characters aren't the same as they were in two other books (When the Wind Blows and The Lake House. The only character is the same is Max. I wish that James Patterson had the same characters because they were part of the other two books. That only problem that i had with the book. The book is really good through."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I haven't read the book but my 11 year old son has...HE LOVED IT! and wants to know when the sequels are coming!I don't believe that adults should be critcally assessing this book. It is written for pre-teens and young teens; they should be the judges. My son found it a GREAT read; he couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I read this really quickly, and that's not a good sign, like eating your veggies when you're a kid just to get it over with. I have a habit of having to finish the books I start even if they're bad. This is one of those books.The ideas in this book are interesting and even compelling; however, the writing is choppy and bland. It's driven by dialogue and not description or plot. I find Patterson's attempt at first-person writing from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl to be unconvincing. It's like he's really writing her as if she's a boy but he's just calling her a girl. Maybe he's trying to appeal to more people that way but I find it negatively affects the character.My husband bought this to read on a long flight and he quit because he couldn't stand the writing, and he's a fan of some of Patterson's other writing. I think all the hub-bub is just because Patterson is famous for adult fiction. He should stick with that. This foray into YA fiction was a disaster."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I just completed a recorded book narrated by Nancy Wu and Ed Sala. I read a few of the other reviews and tend to agree with the the fact that there was no closure or competion to the book at all. It just didn't answer anything. It left too many questions and too many open doors. I dont even think a single door was even attempted to be closed.I didn't find myself caring about the characters at all. They just weren't real compelling. I could care less if they ever find what they are looking for because it doesnt MEAN anything.I found certain things repeated over and over throughout the book. Its like Patterson ran out of sentences and started re-using them over and over again.There were too many stories started and none closed and too many to even keep track of.It just wasn't really anything that I would ever say to someone, \\"hey, you HAVE to read this book.\\"I gave it 2 stars solely on the fact that the premise itself was interesting. I think that a much better job could have been done with this."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Some young adult novels are good \\"cross-over\\" novels and have the ability to entertain and engross all ages (i.e. Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, Earthsea, etc.). This, unfortunately, isn't one of those novels. I can't even say that the writing would be a good \\"teen read.\\" In fact, I would place it in the \\"pre-teen\\" caetegory.The writing, per se, is not bad, but for an adult reader, not terribly engrossing. I liked the concept, but did not find it to be much of a page turner, perhaps because the characters were not depicted in depth enough early on to draw me in. A mediocre read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a very good read, and Mr. Patterson definitely keeps the reader engaged in the story from the first page. You quickly come to care about the human/avian children, and their fates. My only quibble with the book (keeping it from a five-star rating) is the lack of continuity between it and 'Lake House'. Going under the assumption that 'Max' here is the same young lady as in the previous two bird books, there is no explanation of what went on during the intervening four or so years, nor what happened to some major characters. On top of that, some of her backstory has changed. Please don't get me wrong--it's a good book and I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. However, a cleaner tie-in to the previous works would have made it even better."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"A big problem that I had with \\"When the Wind Blows\\" is how completely implausible it was. Kids with retractable wings? At least when Michael Crichton cloned dinosaurs he came up with a way to do it that made you believe it could be true. The realism in \\"Maximum Ride\\" is no better, in fact it seems even more unrealistic. I am willing to let it slide a little more this time because at least this book was written for kids.The story centers around fourteen-year-old Max, who serves as the narrator, and her flock of five other avian children. The book opens with the children living in a remote cabin under the leadership of Max. The children had previously been sprung from their imprisonment in genetics lab cages by scientist-turned-rescuer Jeb Batchelder. Jeb is now missing and presumed dead after going out one day and never coming back. The children are soon beset by the lab's other creation, the evil erasers: children who can morph between wolf and human form and act as the lab's gestapo police force. After young Angel is taken prisoner by the erasers the rest of the gang embarks on a rescue mission.The story here is okay, focusing mainly on Max and Angel, but the book feels very unfinished. This book was obviously written to be the first in a series, but it ends with so little resolution that it hardly feels like a stand-alone novel. The character development was minimal, with Max getting most of the attention, while Nudge, Iggy, and Gasman were just there to advance the story. I almost would suggest waiting for three or four of these to come out before you start reading them so that you are not left completely in the dark when you finish this one and have to wait a year for another to be published. This was a decent story but mow that it is over I don't feel any real compulsion to get the next one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"There aren't enough words in the thesaurus to describe exactly how bad this book is. Seriously.The Maximum Ride series has been lauded by readers and critics alike as the heir apparent poised to pick up the Young Adult superseries mantle now that blockbusters like Harry Potter and Twilight have concluded their stories. They couldn't be more wrong, and I couldn't be more disappointed after wasting my time on this book.The plot is promising: the title character, Max (aka Maximum Ride) is the result of genetic experimentation, and is 98% human and 2% avian. She and her five \\"family\\" members -- other bird kids who have escaped from the uber-bad evil scientist lair called The School -- can fly, are extremely strong and are living on the lamb. The kids, age 6 to 14, are being hunted by other experiments gone wrong, creatures that are part man and part wolf.Unfortunately, there are so many problems with this book, I hardly know where to begin. The writing is appaulingly bad. I think James Patterson's writing is choppy when he's writing his well-known murder mysteries. But in this series, he tries to adopt a young adult voice, and it's just painful and plodding. He uses the same words over and over, and his writing has no texture.The character development is practically non-existant. We're thrown this large cast of characters that the reader is supposed to care about instantly, but they hardly kept my interest. The chapters are illogically short -- sometimes only three pages -- and break at odd places. It feels like the book was written for reluctant teen readers that needed short chapters to give them a sense of accomplishment upon fishishing them. I just found it annoying.The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the subplot of Angel, the youngest of the clan that has been kidnapped at the beginning of the book by the School's scientists. I'm a mother of a five-year-old. I don't need to read about souless researchers keeping a preschooler in a cage and torturing her. The book has virtually no descriptions except for the pain and suffering Angel goes through. It was upsetting and further distanced me from the book. At the end, I just wanted to get through it so I could move on to something else.If you have a 10 to 15-year-old boy or girl in your life that doesn't like to read, this book might be a good introduction to longer novels. The language is simple, and the plot should be intriging for that age group. I, personally, would rather have dental surgery than pick up any of the last three books in the series, though."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"i am def a big fan of book series that have a lot of books in them i.e. harry potter. the big difference with harry potter is that each book is somewhat self contained. when read together it adds t the whole experience but each book has a beginning middle and end. this book is just the beginning of the whole story. there are a lot of interesting story ideas that literally go nowhere. it really is half of a book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is not good young adult fiction. It's simply dumbed down adult fiction. From the unbelievable premise to the concocted adversaries to the shameless plug for the next book, this is an exercise in merchandising more than literature. It doesn't even work as a beach read. Avoid it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My biggest disappointment with this book was that it wasn't about the original Max from \\"When the Wind Blows\\" or \\"Lake House,\\" but that was totally my fault in not reading the description more closely. Mr. Patterson clearly states that this is based on those characters, but that's where the similarity ends. That being said, I really enjoyed this book. Like \\"When The Wind Blows,\\" you're dealing with the winged children and evil plots. Part of the problem that I think people have with this new series is that the newness and surprise of the winged children isn't there...like someone told Mark Twain (I'm sumarizing here) \\"I hated reading Huckleberry Finn, because now I will never have the pleasure of reading it for the first time.\\" I'm still tearing through the books from the Maximum Ride series (I'm on #3 right now) and am really enjoying them - but I miss the old Max and wonder what she's up too! :) Read these...you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a really good book. There is a lot of action and suspense, and the chapters are short, so if you hate endlessly long chapters (Like me) then that's another reasong to read this. There were really only two things that annoyed me in this book:1. Things always seem to work out perfectly for Max and her friends. When they are out of money, POOF, there's a bank card right next to them. When Angel almost drowns, POOF, she can breathe under water. Fang gets beaten senseless, POOF, he's okay. It get's tiresome after a certain point.2. At the end (I'm not giving any major spoilers though), when Max and Ari are fighting, Ari says something about not trying to kill Max or something like that, I don't remember. Sorry Ari, seeing as you have been TRYING TO KILL MAX THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK, I can't believe you.Well, those were the only things that annoyed me. Other than that, this is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was the most exciting book i've read in a looooong time.

Whether they can trust this vioce their not sure, but whenever they don't listen to it they always run into an Eraser around the corner!Max is the narrator of her own story.

I was looking for a CD version of Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment to use in my classroom. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to find your place in the book and the chapters are not in order."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson, for better or worse, is one of the most prolific and bestselling authors of all time. Such a title doesn't come without its hard knocks. For instance, any rummaging through Amazon reviews will review that while there are those who love Patterson's work, there seem to be many who dislike it with a passion. I'd heard enough negative or mixed things that I'd shied away from Patterson's work (it's not like I didn't have other things to read), but through a free offer on Amazon's Kindle, I had a chance to read through Patterson's The Angel Experiment, the first book in the Maximum Ride series.Maximum Ride isn't your ordinary fourteen year old girl. First of all, she hangs out with some pretty weird people--Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel--not your typical crew. Even stranger, Max and crew aren't completely human. They have wings. Created by the School in experiments combining human and animal DNA, they are the successes. Well them and the half-wolf/half-humans called Erasers that do the School's dirty work.Several years ago, Max and her friends escaped from the School with one of the scientists, who they think of as their father. But he's been missing for a while now, and the group has been forced to cope on their own. But the School and the Erasers are closing in on them, with the result being a wild, frenzied chase with several interesting and unexpected twists.All in all, The Angel Experiment was enjoyable. Nice, mindless beach read, good for entertainment. The writing quality is mediocre at best, but the pace flows well and makes for an easily read, fast-paced story. The book's cliffhanger ending intrigued me, but not enough to where I want to go out and read the next book, at least not if I have to pay for it. For those interested in stories like this, I'd advocate reading Sigmund Brouwer's books Broken Angel and Flight of Shadows.Patterson's goal appears to be to just merely entertain, which is does well, and obviously it sells. But I think I'll be sticking to authors who give me a bit more meat with my literary feast."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"What turned me on to this book, was actually Patterson's other book Witch and Wizard. There was a free iPod app where you could get a free excerpt, that I began reading and liked (but didn't want to buy the book while it was only sold in hardcover since I didn't like it that much), so I decided to try out one of his other books instead (while I waited).Maximum Ride is sort of like James Cameron's Dark Angel (even has the same name for the main character!), if you remember that TV show. (Interestingly, Patterson says he actually took it from a different book he wrote with a main character named Max, though the two books are not related.) It follows a bunch of kids who were raised as test subjects in a lab. They were genetically engineered so that their DNA was combined with a bird's (unlike Max in DA, whose DNA was combined with a cat). One of the things this genetic combination does is provide main character Max, and her small \\"family\\" with wings that allows them to fly. They are also much stronger than the average adult, despite being kids. And, they have other, stranger abilities, such as mind reading and voice mimicry, among other things (there seems to be no rhyme or reason to who has what ability, but I suppose we learn more about that in later books. Book 1 of this series follows Max (the de facto leader) and her five mutant siblings as they try to hide from the people who created them, when the youngest, Angel, is captured by the Erasers (half-wolf, half-human mutants) and brought back to the lab, called the School. The rest of the flock is determined to rescue Angel and discover more about themselves, like if they had parents and where they are from and how long they can expect to survive. But some things they may not be ready to learn-like who betrayed them and Max's \\"destiny\\" to save the world.Patterson does an excellent job of mixing the child-like confusion and emotions of our heroes with strength and determination, making them kids we can't help but root for. Each of the kids has unique abilities and somewhat distinct personalities (though some more than others, which is not surprising when you have so many main characters) that are likable. You can't help but root for them. But he also does a good job of adding a spark of humanity into some of the villains, so that while you hope they lose, you also feel a little bit bad. (I would have appreciated a little more of an insight into Ari's character, but I'm glad we got a glimpse.)Perhaps my biggest complaint with the book would be its structure. Before the book begins, there is a letter addressed to the reader, written by Max, warning us about what we will read and how important she feels it is that we read it anyway. 85% of the book follows in first person fashion, from Max's perspective, but on occasion, the book jumps to third person to allow it to follow the characters who are not with Max at the moment. While I agree that those parts of the book are best included, I do not like the jump of perspective. I would prefer to simply follow the entire thing in third person or have him figure out a way to keep it first person throughout. As far as things go, it's a pretty small complaint because even though it bothered me intellectually, it didn't really ruin the flow of the book.From the segments I've read of Witch and Wizard, I find this to be the more compelling read and cannot wait to see where the adventure goes."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is the first book of the amazing Maximum Ride series.

I picked up this book from a friend when we were bowling. She, being the best friend ever, let me borrow it. I am so glad she did because Max and the flock went on to become my favorite book series ever. I find all the characters sympathetic and likeable, there is plenty of good action, and there is all these cliffhangers. I have a love/hate relationship with them, and whenever there is one in these books, I scream in exasperation while franticly trying to find out when the next book comes out.I don't know what the hype is with it being a continuation of another series, at the begining of every single novel saying that this is not the case.I find everything absoulutly, totally, freaking awsome.

She, along with her companions-Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman and Angel-are mostly normal. Except for the fact that they're ninety-eight percent human and two percent bird! All six children have wings and can fly! They grew up in a lab that they call \\"The School\\" and were broken out a few years before by an employee named Jeb, who has since disappeared. All six children live on their own in a secluded cabin until the day that the Erasers show up. Erasers are wicked wolf-like creatures that also grew up in the lab and were created to keep the children corralled. The children defeat the Erasers, but not before they take off with the youngest, six-year-old Angel. Angel is Max's favorite and she is determined to get her back!The story really \\"takes off\\" when they travel from Death Valley, California to the bowels of the New York City subway system. All the while, Max has started hearing a voice in her head that is giving her advice and telling her what to do. Who is this voice? Does it have to do with the chip she's found in her arm? Or is she just going crazy?I was excited to listen to an audio book by one of my favorite Authors, James Patterson. I was wondering how he would pull off a Young Adult novel! Need not worry! He not only pulled it off beautifully, but created a story that any age will love! Mr. Patterson blends the normal world with science fiction and Fantasy that will have readers young and old begging him to continue the series.Evan Rachel Wood did an excellent job narrating the book. The emotion and personalities of the characters really showed through her telling of the story. There were times during the reading that I almost jumped in my seat with the sound effects and music that were included in the presentation. Over all this was a very well-paced and fun book to listen to!I look forward to listening to the next installment in this captivating series!Armchair Interviews says: A 5-star listen for Young Adult."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My daughter loved this book.

Erasers are men who have also had been genetically mutated so they can turn into wolf men.For example, the action in this book really keeps you wanting to know what happens next, and if the Max, Angel, Nudge, The Gasman, and Iggy will get out to the situation alive. The Erasers have made the kids their prey or targets. The action plays an important part in this because it helps the book come alive.Another reason, I felt that I connected in some way to Iggy. I could feel the same way he felt during times. I can really relate to him because he is blind and I need glasses, so in the beginning of the book it said he walked into the kitchen and fell on the couch with perfect aim, I can do that too when I don't have my glasses on or when my are shut.

I seriously hope this gets made into a movie, because it would be AwEsOmE!!!!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is the first book by popular thriller writer James Patterson which is aimed primarily at young adults, and I must confess that when I first started reading it I thought it was kinda lame. It's a story about a bunch of winged kids living by themselves, led by a girl named Max, which at first seemed to be full of cliches: Angel, the blonde, sweet baby of the group; Fang, the strong, silent type; The Gasman, who is very protective of his sister, and who is well-loved dispite his odour problem; Iggy, smart but quite bitter; Nudge, a chatterbox who never stops talking; and finally Max, who despite her insecurities has learned to maintain an appearance of calm and contol for the sake of the 'flock'.But I kept reading and I'm glad I did - the characters evolved throughout the book and the plot was good, the pace was quite fast so there were no boring, laggy bits that I can recall. The only problems with this book were the kind of 'extreme' way in which it was written and endorsed (\\"Strap yourself in and enjoy the MAXIMUM RIDE\\", etc.) - even the girl's name, 'Maximum Ride' seemed to be part of a teen marketing campaign to get people to buy the book.The second problem was the inconclusive ending. I've read quite a lot of books like this, so it didn't really bother me, but it seems to be a problem for quite a few people. If this really bothers you, you should buy/borrow both this book and the sequel at the same time so you don't have to wait."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The story is very fast paced and fun. Only a few times does it slow down, but only for awhile. But the humor of the characters mainly Max's semi-sarcastic wit. All of the characters are well developed and deep, without trying to be. Even some of the not so action packed scenes are intriguing in there imagery and in some cases not pictures but sounds and smells. I had a hard time putting it down and finished it in about 4 days."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Thought this probably isn't the first review you've read, I'll give a brief summary. Kids, part bird, have been rescued by a kind scientist from the place that they were rescued from. (School). He went missing 2 years before the story starts. When the littlest one is kidnapped by wolf-mutants, more specifically the scientist's son, they go off on a mission to save her.Good: interesting storyBad: Patterson tried to write like a kid would; unfortunately too well. They story is woefully written and they're are many things that just happen that would never happen. the heroine is too predictable and the surprise at the end is not a surprise. Patterson ends upbruptly, as if he wrote a long book and just cut it in half, with no regard as to where he did it. They bizzarely just go to NY, where Max starts hearing voices in her head. They eventually lead them to another Institute. most of the book seems to jsut be strying to drag on. The Erasers are written like a second grader would. Poor choice of vocabulary and unoriginal dialogue. Don't read this unless you wish to read second one, there is no closure."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Wow! Another great novel by James Patterson, also one of my favorites being Lifeguard. This tells the story of Maximum Ride, a 14 year old girl that is 98% human, 2% bird.

I love this book because, well, first of all, I am 14, so it is really neat to connect with some of the characters and understand (well, not the bird thing, but) what they're experiencing. This is a real page turner, and I am sure that it will keep children and adults enthralled with the story."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is a very good book.

It had a lot of adventure and interesting plot twists. I can not wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I must admit, James Patterson gets a well round of applause on filling this book with high anticipation and major action. With that being said, I just couldn't get into it as much as I would've liked. Patterson has written a series that does seem hugely interesting, as you meet all of the family members that now live outside of the horrendous school they were once held captive in. Going along the Maximum Ride journey, you will eventually meet all of the characters individually which I love. The problem I had was that there was a little too much action. I love to see my characters at their best, at their worst, and everywhere in between. I felt like there was not a calm moment and I just wanted to see the characters a little more relaxed.We first get to meet Max. She is very compassionate about her younger siblings and guards them as if she is their mother. She would do anything for them, as long as they never return to that school. It's just plain cruel to implant aviary genes into a human mother, only to experiment with the outcome. Even if the outcome is a human. The majority of their DNA is human, with just a touch of bird-like features. That little bit is enough to keep them on the run forever. Max's family can never settle down and get too comfortable. Erasers are always on the lookout. Big, fur-like creatures that resemble werewolves if they choose to. Who couldn't be frightened by something like that?"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"very suspenseful. inticing. good start to the seiries. i love it so much.amzi g sci-fi book...great word choice. not too serious though."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"What is the book about?The first book to the Fugitives series, otherwise known as the Maximum Ride sereis.

You get Maximum Ride of course!! Maximum Ride, or Max as they call her in the books, is a successful DNA hybrid that grew up in a lab with several other mutants like herself. They are recombinant life forms, meaning they are cross-bred with some other DNA. In this case, as I said before, it is bird DNA. 98% human, 2% bird. This has had a huge impact on their lives. That 2% has given them the power of flight. They have wings, along with hollow bird bones. They are constantly in danger of getting caught by Erasers, which are human-wolf recombinants, and taken back to the dreadful lab they grew up in. The lab, A.K.A the School, would do almost anything to get them back. The flock, which is the group of bird-kids that are as the following: Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the Gasman, and Angel. That's all I'm telling you.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I read it and immediately went for the second one, which is School's Out Forever. (This was the first!) Max is a funny heroine, and I have a friend that is almost exactly like her. The details are great; I almost felt as if I was flying with them during the flying scenes. James Patterson has really outdone himself. With these books, you can't just read one and be done, you have to read all of them, or else you'll be kicking yourself for not reading the rest and finding out what the outcome is.For this book, you could come up with a thousand theme statements. But I think what James Patterson was really getting at was this- Never. Give. Up.

I thought I'd give it a try after getting interested in the plot and reading some reviews. I also thought it was interesting that Maximum Ride has been turned into a Japanese manga series and even has a pending movie deal -not bad for Patterson's first venture into the young adult universe.Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment is an action-packed young adult science fiction novel that keeps the reader flipping pages. It tells the story of six children who were genetically spliced with bird DNA. This left them with special abilities -basically, superpowers -and, most notably, wings. After being freed from the \\"School,\\" the laboratory where they were created, the \\"Flock\\" lives together for a time before the youngest member, Angel, is kidnapped by Erasers, genetically created half-wolf mutants that seem like terminator rip-offs. The Flock, led by the spunky heroine Max, sets out to save Angel and find out the secrets behind their origin.It's a high-energy thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat.This book, I must admit, isn't particularly amazing in any area, but the writing style makes you want to read more. It's made up of short, simple sentences combined into short paragraphs and short chapters. Even though this creates a lot of white space, it keeps the reader constantly moving, eliminates any extraneous items and requires the author to include just enough detail for the reader to get the picture.I also really liked Max's style of narration. Even though she talks to the reader more than she should, it just worked. It drew me into the story of these children and put me in the center of their struggle. However, there is a section near the beginning of the book where the narration jumps between first- and third-person before returning to first-person. It was a little annoying and didn't quite work with the short chapters, but thankfully it didn't stick around long enough to become unmanageable.I'm not entirely sure why, but I enjoyed this book. It's not one of the best things I've ever read, but it kept me engaged and gave me something to escape into. You don't have to think too hard to read this book. It's completely frivolous and fun...and a great stress reliever. Even though I don't always enjoy this type of literature, you sometimes need it to get through the day.While the characters are only partially developed and the plot is pretty linear, there was just enough excitement and uniqueness to draw me in. I enjoyed Max's witty comments and outrageous stories. Maximum Ride isn't great literature and it's not groundbreaking, but it's downright fun."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Ok my Expectations were way too high.......but after reading the book............oh it seemed TOOO SHORT...........thts a GOOD thing..........but well Patterson isnt convincing as a Teenage Writer.........trying to tell the story from a teeanger's view............sometimes it seems forced.........thought it is a Quick book.......and nothign really revealing took place in the book.........i only hope for things to get better in the second book.......JOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"awsome. superb. great. thrilling. exciting. wonderful. and every other word i cant think of right now."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a great book for both adults, teens, and pre-teens. (Age 10+)Original story unlike one I have read before. This is fiction, though, so you must keep an open mind when reading this book and the entire series. (For example, look at the cover and you will see that the girl has wings and is flying.)I had heard of this series since I have read other books by James Patterson.

The short chapters are very action packed which motivates you to go on the next one, and next one and...... Before the child knows it, they have read many chapters thus boosting motivation for reading. Mine have said to me, I read 20 chapters, WOW!Another factor that is to be considered that it has many topics that deal with Science, Geography and Social issues. This books lends itself to many discussions.So there you have it. If there is a child out there who does not like this book, there is a serious problem. This book would even bait, The Grinch from Dr. Seuss."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"As with most of James Patterson's work, this book is not the next contender for the Pulitzer, but it is a quick fun read, expecially for young adults seeking something outside of the Harry Potter urban fantasy vein that has taken over YA lit in the last few years.These characters are wise beyond their years from living on the lam for so long but they're written so that it's obvious that they're still kids rather than adults in little bodies. In a way, this is Cynthia Voight's Homecoming with an edge."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My nephew and sister in law were reading this and reccomended it.

It's a little bland for me but then Patterson's works often are... it's still not a bad read. What IS bad is the realization (upon finishing the book) that THERE IS NO ENDING!!!!! That's right folks, in little more than a mental mugging the writer attempts to force the reader into buying the sequel in the hope that maybe IT will have some sort of lucid conclusion. Now, I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I do have my good days. It's the old \\"fool me once\\" thing..... how apt do you think I am to actually buy the sequel and cross my fingers hoping that IT will not be an attempt to roll me over into yet a third outing?

But I have noticed that the last few books I've read have been slipping. Maximum Ride was no different. I loved the main character and how her personality was portrayed through the writing.

Be prepared for a plot revolving around six youths who are 98 percent human, 2 percent bird. Be prepared for a secret mission to locate a missing parent and save Angel from mutants. And be prepared for a series of sub-plots which assure the swift pace is unrelenting.

That might be so. But what about mutants? Well, more specifically, humans with avian DNA and wings? Pretty cool, huh? That is the treat you are in for if you read James Patterson's book, Maximum Ride Series.The story starts off with meeting the FabSix: Max, Fang, Nudge, Iggy, Gassy and Angel. These kids are from all different backgrounds and ethnicities but they all have one thing in common: wings. They are 98% human and only 2% bird. You would think that these kids would be all weird and have twisted features, but that is not the case. The 6 of them have the most wonderful time together despite the fact that they are on the run from some psychotic loons that want to track them down and force them to be lab rats. Er...birds, sorry.They spend all their time running, hiding and pretty much being kids, that is, when they aren't kicking some serious butt. You see, when you have these things, well, mutants after you called Erasers, you kind of get an urge to run. Tell me, if someone came running up to you, yelling that Erasers were after them, you would either think, \\"What a nut,\\" or you would want to help them. Its only logical.Anyways, throughout the book, (and the series) the six friends overcome obstacles, learn new fighting techniques, as well as run for their birdy lives. But despite all the drama and trauma, they still learn to love and work together as a family. Because otherwise, they get caught and made into soup. And who in the world would want that?GabbyFor the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"These books ae good. REALLY good. But if you start them, DO NOT go past the third book. All of them are out now, and the series sunk like the Titanic after he stopped writing and let his ghost writers take over. I can honestly say that if you start this series, and go on to read all of them, you may wish you never did. I do, and I LOVED the fist three.In short, if you must read them, stop at the third one and fill in the one blank he did not fill in it. If you are the kind of person who does not prefer to fill in his or her own blanks, that is fine. Don't bother with this series and do something worth more of your time. ANYTHING would be more more life fullfilling than reading how Patterson concluded this series.In fact, go to a Rest Home for the elderly, offer to clip their toenails, and save the clippings. THAT would even be worth more money than the last Maximum Ride installment.Don't want to take my word for it? Fine. Throw yourself into the black hole known as this series.

It wasn't quite what I expected because as of right now I'm fairly new to James Patterson. I got this book free for my Kindle a while ago when it was offered. It's definitely a 5 star rating for me except for a few small parts where I could barely stand to read what was happening to one of the main characters because I can't stand bad things happening to kids. I won't bore you with a summary of the book as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the genres of fantasy or urban fiction books. It has a few more surprises than I think a great many people would expect. Be prepared for an emotional and adventurous time. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a fun easy read that those young MG readers could appreciate as well as adults who just like a good adventure. In some ways the set up in this story reminded me of Dark Angel in where there are kids who \\"belong\\" to a lab and then fight their way to freedom and staying that way. After that, the resemblance ends. You then have a unique telling of mutants learning to navigate the world which they know won't accept them.The adventure these kids have is quite intense and you can't wait to find out all of the answers to the questions that form as they fight to save one of their own. Fight to save Angel, the littlest from a fate worse than death. Along the way they learn more about the world than they ever thought possible and find some unlikely help along the way. However, even while on the hot trail of learning more about their past and what they were told was true or not, they find that they can't trust anything or anyone outside of the flock.Although I liked all the main characters, my biggest complaint about this book is that it is hard to really connect on a deep level to the kids. It makes sense because their whole life is crises management and so little time is left for really knowing who they truly are. However, since this is only one book in a series, I feel that the connection will come and probably sooner than later. You can see things falling in place within this book for that to happen.I give this book 3 1/2 stars. I think it is a fast and fun book for the beginning to this series. I recommend it to those that enjoy UF and YA."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I couldn't put it down.Angel and Max keep you guessingas to what will happen next.What an imagination Mr. Patterson has in this book.Looking forward to book 2 in this series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This was a great book!

The kids run away from the bad guys a lot...and inexplicably they all get away, they all live. Why are the Erasers chasing them and beating them up all the time? It doesn't make sense at all how the flock always gets away, especially the scene on the beach when Jeb shows up. The next chapter offers no explanation on how the flock got off the beach without the Erasers stopping them.Obviously nothing happens because the author intended this to be a series from the get-go, but I won't be reading the rest.

It's so thrilling that you get to experience being genetically modified in such a way with this book, it's amazing how this story's put. The mutated life is outstanding, I love it."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I've read around fifteen of James Patterson's novels, and I've found nearly all of them to be entertaining. A lot of people criticise Patterson, but most of his thrillers are fast-paced, exciting, and easy to read.MAXIMUM RIDE is Patterson's attempt to write a YA novel, and it's just as enjoyable as his books for adults. The only difference is the age of the protagonists, who are fourteen and under. The plot of this novel sounds like science fiction (genetic engineering on kids who can fly) but the book is mostly just a long chase sequence, which is very exciting and fun to read. All six of the kid characters and likable and interesting.This is the first book in a multi-volume series, so this book ends with something of a cliffhanger. So if you're looking for an ending that achieves closure, you won't get it with this book. There is no sex or bad language in this novel, but there is quite a bit of violence and a little bit of crude humor (one of the characters passes gas a lot).In short, MAXIMUM RIDE is an enjoyable way to pass the time. If you're trying to get your kids to read something, this may be a good choice for them. Most of the chapters are under three pages long, and each chapter ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, so even a kid with a short attention span should have little problem getting through it.Worth a try, for adults and kids alike."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"11-16Maximum RideJames PattersonSueJack., Inc.The book, Maximum Ride, by James Patterson may sound like a story about Formula One Racing, however, it isn't. Maximum Ride is a name. You may be wondering how cruel her parents would have to be to brand their kid with a name like that. The answer would be that they didn't . She named herself. Herself may not be the right name either, because she is only ninety percent human. At birth, bird DNA was grafted onto her back by a team of geneticists called \\"the School\\", with the result that she has wings and can fly. Then she and five other mutant bird-child \\"Experiments\\" were kept in a lab in cages under appalling conditions for ten years until one of the researchers, Jeb Batchelder, rescued them. He hid and sheltered them for two years until he disappeared. The actual book starts later when erasers (wolf-human mutants who work for the School) kidnap one of the six, Angel. Hardly any time at all has passed, however, before the other five set out to rescue her. On their journey they encounter many mishaps, but eventually reach the School and immediately get captured by the erasers. But they use their superhuman strength to escape and rescue Angel. As well as being able to fly, Angel can read minds. While in captivity she heard people thinking two things that will shock the others. First, Jeb was working for the school all along. Second, the names and addresses of their long lost parents are in the Institute in New York. So they fly there, and, guided by a mysterious voice find the back door...The Narrator of the story, Maximum Ride, takes care of five other children, whose names are Angel, Gazzy, Nudge, Iggy, Fang. Not many 14 year olds could do that. She is tall with brown hair, dark eyes, and two six foot white wings. She is very compassionate and protective but is in no means perfect. Throughout the book, she rarely thinks through a decision and so makes many mistakes. Probably the most interesting character in the book is Angel. She is six years old, has blond hair, and blue eyes. As well as being able to fly, she can read minds and swim under water. She is a little bit devious, playing tricks and influencing people with her telepathy. The main antagonist, Jeb, is very dynamic. At the beginning he seems to be an almost angelic parental figure, but then you learn he is a bad guy, and, towards the end, you pick up hints that he might even be Max's dad.Maximum Ride is a thrilling book. There is hardly a page not packed with action and mystery that forces you to turn the page. Make sure your comfortable when you sit down because you'll be glued to the chair for a long time. So open this fast paced, easy to read book and strap yourself in for a truly \\"maximum ride\\"."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Ive read Maximum Ride, 3 times and Ive listen to the audio tapes 5 or 6 times. I have told all my friends about it, most of them read it and everyone who read it loved it. I am so exicted about the second one! Ive have also read Harry Potter and this blows it out of the park! This is hands down the best book ever!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The young adult section of the bookstore has become quite a diverse place nowdays. Sitting near books from Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter are now the Chronicles and Legends series of Dragonlance and the McCaffrey Dragonrider series. Not that there's anything wrong with any of those series, I loved them all, but that's a very diverse group for reading level/content. I am happy to see that such books have made reading (and fantasy) interesting to children again!But, with children enjoying the latter two series, as well as the ever darker Potter books, a book like this one seems out of place to me...I have never read any Patterson, so I cannot comment on his overall style. I read this book only to see if it was content appropriate for a friend's sister.This book was SO simple, both in its writing style and content, that I did not enjoy it at all, and believe it is also way too simplified and unremarkable for children who are reading longer and more complex books at earlier and earlier ages.The story itself is interesting: child experiments with bird DNA escaped from a lab and on the run. But that is ALL the story. It is a very basic story about some children, with wings, travelling from one place to the next (on a quest, of course) who run into the same group of baddies over and over again.There is way too much unbelievable coincidence in this novel, which otherwise tries to put the supernatural-esque characters into real life situations.There is just no character and plot development at all.I know this is supposed to be the first book of a series and all, so the unresolved ending is exusable... but the entire book is boring and written in a style that seems almost insulting even to its relatively young target audience. Again, I haven't read Patterson, but this whole book gives the impression of a typically adult author writing a young adult book, and ending up sounding condescendingly oversimplified...A decent idea for a series, but a very bland and unsatisfying first installment. I do not really recommend this even to younger audiences, when there is so much else out there that is much better."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment, is one of my absolute top books and is my favorite by James Patterson. The characters, though in an unrealistic situation, can be related to through some of their very realistic feelings and thoughts. The book is not as frightening and gruesome as many Patterson books, but more of a fantasy adventure. The book is a major cliffhanger and leaves many questions unanswered, but that only helps to build the suspense and longing for the next book. I would recommend this book to anyone Junior High school and up.

And yes, it is for children/young adults.But as for me, I really liked it. (And I'm hard to please, seeing as I read all of the older Sci-fi books.. Asimov.. Niven..)

In the book I read, Angel was held by scientists at the school, not by erasers. Also, Max was not a major player in the rescue. Other members of the flock and some new friends were the major players.My copy also explained why Max and Fang seem to talk like adults most of the time: a combination of their rapid growth and maturation (Max is 5ft 8in tall), and their having to care for the younger ones.I think this is a fun read, fast moving, and further developes characters from earlier works.

Left me looking forward to another along the same lines."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Before I get to the substance of this novel, a brief word: these are not the same characters from previous Patterson novels, despite similarities of name and plot. Think of it, if you're a nerd like me, as the difference between X-Men (the comic), X-Men (the movie) and Ultimate X-Men (the comic). All feature very similar characters, but all are entirely separate imaginings of those characters and the world around them. Way too many reviewers seemingly were PO'd that this wasn't a continuation and didn't share the continuity with the other novels. But if you stop to read the introductory message from the author, he's very clear that this isn't a sequel or possibly even related.That said...It was a fun read. Episodic, geared toward sequels, characters who act other than their staged ages...sure. But it also has a very cool premise, lots of hidden mystery, and enough angst mixed in with the character development to appeal to the target audience.

This is the first of Patterson's books I've encountered and I have to say that I'm very impressed. The book starts out with a good introduction of the characters and then the action starts and keeps on going. This book has a good amount of twists without overdoing it.The synopsis is that 6 kids, who all were raised in cages at \\"The School\\", live together hiding from the world and those at the School who wish to take them back. These kids were giving the power to fly (amongst other powers) by the School for some purpse unbeknownest to them. Max, a fourteen year old girl (don't make the mistake of thinking its a guy at the beginning like I did) acts as head of the household and a mother figure. During an afternoon activity the flock was attacked be Erasers, wolfman-like creatures also created in the School. The youngest of the group, Angel, is captured and taken back to the School. The remaining five set out to save Angel from the horrible things that \\"whitecoats\\" will do to her. That is just the BEGINNING of the wild adventure.This is a must read for teens and adults."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book is about 6 kids who have escaped from a place called \\"the school\\". The school is a lab where several experiments are taken on these kids along with other kids. These experiments included the theory of flight. Every one of these kids are gifted with flight. It sounds like \\"the school\\" is helping these kids but they run other tests that hurt and damage the kids. Also each one of these kids have special gifts such as telepathy or supersonic hearing. After escaping from this \\"school\\" one of the six kids are taken back by monsters called \\"erasers\\". The other 5 kids try to rescue the smallest of the flock from the greatly feared \\"school\\". They endure through a series of adventures that keep the pages turning.This book is an entertaining, thrilling rush. There was no point where I wanted to stop reading. It had constant action with its fast -paced battles and fights. The writing flowed from word to word and his imagery was profound.This book is not controversial and does not raise any issues with religion, color, or race. It is fun and family friendly and good fro all ages.This book gave me a view from the eyes of those who are different. It showed me what it might feel like to be outcast from society. It shows me what its like to be socially inept.Here is a short excerpt from my book, \\"There was no time to think. Jeb had trained us not to think-just to act. I launched myself at an Eraser, spinning and planting a hard, roundhouse kick in his barrel chest. His breath went oof, and the odor was just unbearable.This a great adventure and is good for all ages. It has a broad age target and has no inappropriate content. I give this book a 9 out of ten.

I would also like to recommend this to all my friends and family."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride, ok the name is a little wierd, but hey it works. Maximum Ride the angel experiment is based on 6 incredibly talented children and teens. They are farely normal, beside the whole having avian (bird-like) DNA in their blood. How many kids do you know that can fly? Ok so the wings probably do get in the way, but at least they don't have the whole beak thing goin on. Anyway... they are basically experiments, and aren't meant to be seen at all. Thats why they were kept in cages until Jeb, a scientist who studied them, released them. He took care of them in a remote part of death valley for quite a while, until he mysteriously disappeared, that is. The kids assumed he was dead so they started taking care of themselves.Max, a fourteen yr old girl, decicded to step up and take care of the three boys, iggy-fang-gasman, and the two other girls, nudge-angel. All of the kids are mostly the same, except for the fact that one of them can read minds----Angel, the 6yr old. In the beginning of the story angel is kidnapped so fang,nudge,and max set out to rescue her while gazzy and iggy (who is blind by the way) stay and protect their home from erasers( wolf-like creatures created by the \\"whitecoats\\" which were used to keep the \\"flock\\" from escaping and are now being used to capture them)Will Angel be rescued?

It talks about them trying to fit in the world, because they're a little \\"different\\". There's crushes, feuds, and comedy between the \\"family\\". So what's the big deal?Try the fact that this group is on the run from some evil scientists that raised them in little cages, doing all kinds of tests on them. Including giving them wings. But Max, Iggy, Fang, Angel, Nudge, and the Gasman aren't the only creations of the crazy scientists, and one type is being mass produced: The Erasers. They're half human, half wolf. And completely bloodthirsty. They can disguise themselves as kind human beings, but can become murderous in the blink of an eye.Now the flock is on the run, trying to avoid Erasers and trying to find out about their origins-Were they test tube made or were they born from real parents? Why didn't their parents keep them?I absolutely adore this book. It has all types of elements: sci-fi, drama, suspense, action, romance, and comedy. I love the part in the preview for the next book, School's Out-Forever, when Max says, \\"Flying Erasers.\\" The first thing that popped into my head was flying ACTUAL erasers, and the whole seriousness made it even funnier.

I'll be honest I only read about half of it because 1.) I was super bored and 2.) because I was bored I was flipping through it and realized the last page of the book was ripped out (it's a library book). However, if it wasn't ripped out I still wouldn't have finished it and if I did I would have had to force myself too.I love James Patterson, he writes amazing murder mysteries and there was nothing wrong with the writing in this book. It was definitely an easy read, predictable but entertaining. But like I said it was way to young for my taste. I think he established the characters well, they were all very diverse and original, and if they were older I probably would have enjoyed the book a whole lot more. I think Fang is the only that actually resembled an adult figure. I would like to know what happens, but do I care enough to keep reading? I think I already answered that! I'll just leave it at...if I was 10 I would enjoy this, it should be in the kids section."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"An interesting, if not totally novel concept - a group (or flock) of genetically modified kids have escaped their creators who had them imprisoned in a \\"school\\".

Fantastic author!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I love the Maximum Ride series, most of them at least, but this one is definitely the all time best one. If you like action, adventure, kick butt fight scenes that leave your heart beating, and a little sci fi mixed in you will definitely like this book. Max, 14, and her mish mash family of kids are running from a sinister group of scientists (with, of course, evil hulking bad guys doing their dirty work) who had experimented on them since they were babies. Now Max and her flock just want to be free and live without constantly being attacked. The book has fantastic characters, winding plot twists, and sets up perfectly for the sequel.Now do beware that the first 3 books of maximum ride are great, then book 4 is ok, book 5 is great, and then it kinda goes weird, why you ask, because James Patterson started using ghost writers and went a little crazy for the money and not for the books. Hopefully when the last one comes out he'll get his head back together but who knows :)I still highly recommend (most) this series because it really is fantastic when he does it right!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This review was also posted on [...]:Goodreads Summary:In James Patterson's blockbuster series, fourteen-year-old Maximum Ride, better known as Max, knows what it's like to soar above the world. She and all the members of the \\"flock\\"--Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman and Angel--are just like ordinary kids--only they have wings and can fly. It may seem like a dream come true to some, but their lives can morph into a living nightmare at any time...like when Angel, the youngest member of the flock, is kidnapped and taken back to the \\"School\\" where she and the others were experimented on by a crew of wack jobs. Her friends brave a journey to blazing hot Death Valley, CA, to save Angel, but soon enough, they find themselves in yet another nightmare--this one involving fighting off the half-human, half-wolf \\"Erasers\\" in New York City. Whether in the treetops of Central Park or in the bowels of the Manhattan subway system, Max and her adopted family take the ride of their lives. Along the way Max discovers from her old friend and father-figure Jeb--now her betrayed and greatest enemy--that her purpose is save the world--but can she?My Review:I really don't know why, but i bought this book from HPB two or three years ago, read the first part of it, hated it, and SOLD IT! I'm so stupid, because then a year later i checked it out of my school library and could NOT STOP READING IT!I'd already read Witch & Wizard by James Patterson before i finally worked up the courage (well, not really courage) to pick up the story about the bird kids once more. I remember thinking how weird the characters were, and then i didn't know if Max was a girl or a guy, which confused me.But by the second half of the story i knew James Patterson was amazing. He is my true inspiration for writing, i would not be writing if i had not picked up Witch & Wizard OR this book! He is truly one of the best thrill-writers of our time. The action in Maximum Ride is explained well, it is vivid because James does not use extremely huge and fancy words to say what Max is doing. His sentences are shot, some are long, and the varying lengths had me on the edge of my seat.Max is one of my favorite book protagonists. She is sarcastic, at times a bit snarky, and she is just a really caring person. I feel like the biggest book nerd when i talk about liking the characters like they're real people, but i thought Max was a believably nice book main character because she is NOT perfect at all. She doesn't always make the right decisions, she's a solid protagonist with an attitude.If you're looking for some horribly descriptive, thought-provoking book, don't read this. But let me tell you, if you want an unmatchable thrill ride full of twists and turns that will make you literally SCREAM, and if you want emotion that is vividly played out to bring you to TEARS, read this book. And read every other book in the series!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I picked up this book in my school library just for fun. I'm 11, and I LOVED this book! It wasn't too short or to long, and I loved the plot and characters. It's about 6 \\"bird kids\\", who were created in a lab called \\"the School\\". They have wings and a variety of other cool abilities that always make things more exciting! :P They range in age from 6 to 14, and most characters narrate at least a small part, so you can sorta hear how the ages/voices vary, though it is mostly written by 14-year-old-leader Max. It's a serious page-turner, as well as being mysterious and action-packed, so a whole bunch of genres are included. The plot is that the \\"wolf men\\" Erasers captured the youngest Flock member, Angel, so the others try to go save her. There are other sub-plots which are also really good.

The first book tells an excellant story in the style for which James Patteson is so famous. The characters capture your imagination and make you want to know them better.

Be warned, these books are a teaching tool for the global warming hoax."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I for 1 am not a big reader. I picked this book up cause the idea of flying kids sounded interesting. And boy was I right, from the first page the book literally grabs you.

As the curtains open in the beginning, we meet Max, Fang, Iggy, Gazzy, Angel, and Nudge, the stars of the show. Max, a sarcastic, bold, daring, and occasionally sharp-tongued girl at the age of 15, takes on the role as the leader of the family. Then comes Fang, the second-in-command, whose dark hair and mysterious, quiet personality make him difficult to predict and understand. Iggy, the next member of their family, loves all things explosive and, surprisingly due to his blindness, proved himself good at cooking. Gazzy, or \`Gasman', has an appropriate name, due to his volatile digestive system and the occasional release of something smelly. The psychic girl, Angel, looks cuter than she should be credited for, due to her occasional two-faced way of acting. Fashion magazines found in her hands, Nudge loves to read about looks in her free time; however, her toughness should not be doubted. All of these children seem rather normal, besides the fact that they live without a parental authority in their Colorado home....until you see their wings.Calling themselves the Flock, these children escaped from diabolical scientists in a lab they dubbed \`The School'. After years of imprisonment there, a helpful hand came to save them; Jeb. Jeb, a father to them for a while, helped them live on their own, supporting them like a father would. Suddenly, he disappeared one day, leaving the Flock to fend for themselves. Forced to fight for their freedom and survival from the very start, the Flock realizes that they haven't escaped the scientists' grip. With a bit of help they find along the way, our feathered friends make their way across the world in their constant battle for their lives against people and things of all shapes and sizes.I love the main characters, due to their depth and variety of actions. The story, never predictable, includes times when you just can't help but laugh. The very sarcasm that appears throughout the story lights it up, refusing to let the reader bore. I couldn't help but love their personalities, ranging from cheerful to dark, from cute to mysterious.As for the book itself, I thought it was wonderful. It hooked me from the very beginning and refused to let me go. The action-adventure combination made every turn of the page more and more exciting. The characters, lovable and amusing, help bring the story to life. Guaranteed, after you put the book down, you'll feel like you've just been flying along with them.I would recommend Maximum Ride to those teens who usually don't like reading, and to those who do. The first-person viewpoint from Max's eyes helps the reader understand, and just makes it easier to read. Anyone who likes action, adventure, and lots of sarcasm, make sure to read this book!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was one I got a while back but thought it might not be good. However, I was totally surprised. I fell right in line with it and soon found myself truly loving the story line. At first I wasn't sure that I liked how short the chapters were and that they usually meant a perspective change. However, that made the flow of the book work really well and I ended up loving it. There is happiness, sorrow, sarcasm, and humor in this great read.The story follows 6 kids (Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gazzy, and Angel) who are fighting for their lives and trying to find what the future holds for them. They start to get ahead and then something makes them pause. Through all the trials, you watch as some grow into new gifts and others find out more of themselves, while some still find out more of others. There are so many issues that these kids deal with that match normal things you easily can feel what any oneof them feels!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is supposedly aimed at a younger audience, but everyone can enjoy this. It is superbly written, a page turner that reads very well. Its central concept is intriguing. The plot is good. But what makes this stand out is the handling of the characters. They are not cardboard cut-outs who run through acrobatic stunts with thrills and spills. They are first and foremost kids. Scared kids. Orphans who at times have the same issues as any other orphan kids, any other abandoned kids, any other underprivileged kids. (E.g., Angel and Celeste; how easy is it to imagine Angel here as just any other poor kid enthralled by a first doll....) I've not yet read other books in the series, but I hope this is a start and we get to know these characters a lot better. It is, by the way, probably necessary to buy more books in the series. This is an episode rather than a book with a really defined ending, almost as if it were an old-fashioned cliffhanger serial. That didn't bother me as I can't wait, but be prepared to plow through some books, plural. ;)"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Angel has been kidnapped, and Max is going out to save her.

The chapters are like 2-4 pages long and always leave you suspenseful. The book itself is really good and I enjoyed every minute of it.It's about a group of genetically mutated kids with wings by scientists that the kids refer to as whitecoats. The whitecoats had performed experiments on the kids, leaving one, Iggy, permanently blind.The story starts off with the kids in a field, playing and enjoying themselves, when they are attacked by the Erasers. Erasers are also genetically mutated beings that the whitecoats had created. They were made for hunting and killing the people that escaped the School, which is where they perform all the experiments. Well, the Erasers take Angel, the youngest of the flock. Max is 14 years-old and the oldest and toughest out of the group decides to go on a mission to rescue Angel. Max makes Iggy, the blind 13 year-old, and the Gasman, an 8 year-old whose name describes him, stay behind. She uses the excuse that they needed to be there in case Angel escapes and comes back to their house. So, Max sets off to find Angel with the help of Fang, the second oldest out of the flock, and Nudge, a talkative 10 year-old. On the way to California, which is where the School is, Max sees a 12 year-old girl getting picked on by a bunch of older boys, so she goes to help her and ends up getting shot in the shoulder and wing. She goes to Ella, which is the girl she saved from the bullies and asks for help from her. She ends up getting a taste of a normal life for two days, before finally rejoining Fang and Nudge. The Gasman and Iggy had flown after them anyways after blowing up their house. So, the five of them go through a series of chase scenes before finally getting captured by the Erasers. They escape with the help of birds who tear at the whitecoats with their beaks. They go to New York to find a place called the Institute of Higher Living, where they find information about themselves. At the end she ends up breaking Ari, the main Eraser's, neck. Jeb, which is the person who helped Max escape four years earlier, ended up yelling \\"You just killed your brother!\\" That shocked Max a lot. As the book is ending, Max and the flock are flying towards Washington, D.C.I thought this book was really good, but it was also kind of annoying with all the chasing and escaping going on in the story. It was more for kids around the ages of 11-13 years-old."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment was a spectacular page-turning fiction book. When you read this book you will not to be able to put it down until you finish it. Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment is about a fourteen-year-old girl named Maximum Ride. This book is about how Max and her gang were injected with DNA from a type of animal that never existed. One day Angel gets captured by these erasers. (Erasers are these half-wolf, half-human mutants) Max has lots of missions she has to do during this book, like saving Angel. She always doubts herself that she can't save Angel before they do bad experiments on her.James Patterson is a very popular author. His Maximum Ride series was inspired by his best selling adult novels When the Wind Blows and The lake House. What I liked about the book was it has a lot of action and you can think about what Max is going through. The theme of this book is believe in oneself. You can always help each other out. I recommend that people should read this book. You will like this book so much."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"While I love the idea of Maximum Ride and her flock, there are moments in this book in which I question the choices Max makes. They seem slightly out of character, and a few feel slightly disruptive to the storyline to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and would recommend it as a fast-paced satisfying read, however, I wouldn't sell it as thought-provoking mind-challenging creation. The science/genetic engineering does provoke some questions, but overall this is more of a wild ride, enjoyable for the characters' adventures."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I enjoyed this book so much. James Patterson tells another great story.I recommend this trilogy about Max and her flock."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My [...] class read Maximum Ride and really enjoyed it. As a final test I had the students write a book review. Here are two.1. Jazz:Maximum Ride is a thrilling and entertaining book that makes you keep reading. It is fun to read and has great characters. You will love to read this book. It is appropriate for most kids. Younger kids might have trouble with the smaller print. It is a family-fun packed adventure that everyone will love. You will have fun reading it and won't want to put it down. The characters of Maximum Ride make the book fun and entertaining to read.The main characters are Max, Iggy, Fang, Nudge, Gasman, Angel, the Erasers (wolf-morphing men), and White Coats (scientists). It all started when the White Coats kept all the children in the Lab. In the Lab the white coats were mean to the kids. Jeb, one of the white coats, who was like a father to the kids, helped them escape the lab.Max, is the leader of the \\"flock\\". She is very brave and is thirteen years old. Gasman and Angel are the only two kids related. Angel is the youngest of the group and can also read minds. Erasers are after her and she is called Subject 11. You will have to read the book to find out what happens with that problem.Gasman has a weird obsession with bombs. He likes to make them and play with them. Iggy is blind, but has great hearing, especially when he is flying. Nudge will speak up when she has something to say and is always ready to go when she hears about a problem. Fang is quiet, but tells it like it is. All these characters have a big impact on the book. They make the book better and fun to read. I hope you read Maximum Ride and like it as much as I did.2. Haley:Imagine yourself running from your worst enemy, but instead of running you're soaring through the air. This a typical day in the life of Max. Max is one of six bird-like characters that makes James Patterson's Maximum Ride a thrilling, action-packed book for older children who love suspense and fiction. Each character in the book contributes to this phenomenal book. Max is the 14 year-old leader and caregiver of the flock. None of the children has family that they know of, expect Angel and Gasman, who are siblings. There is Iggy, the blind; Fang, the mystery; Nudge, the odd; Gasman, the exploder, and Angel, the youngest.These six unnatural children were genetically engineered with bird DNA. The know neither how they were made nor why. But all the answers to their questions begin to unravel when the Erasers, the wolf morphing men, take Angel. She is taken back to The School, where the kids are all considered experiments to the White Coats and the Erasers. Thus, the action begins when the flock, as they call themselves, must go back to the horrid School to save Angel. On their journey they have many run-ins with Erasers. They cause the exhilarating scenes throughout the book. While at The School, Max doesn't find out about her past, but instead about the future. She also makes a new friend this is somewhat helpful, but doesn't seem to want to leave Max alone.One never knows where the flock will run next to get away from the Erasers or to stay out of trouble. They could go through the subways of Manhattan, or hide in the trees of Central Park.When reading Maximum Ride you will never know what hit you. You many never want to put the book down for even a split second. The author, James Patterson, keeps the reader excited and guessing what will happen next. He makes the end of every chapter a cliffhanger. Maximum Ride is a great book for older children and young adults. It is suspenseful, surprising, full of wonder, and bends your mind in ways you didn't think were possible."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"It was different than the other books that I have read. It had a good storyline. The author placed you right in the middle of the action."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a poorly done ripoff of the TV series, Dark Angel. Fortunately I didn't spend any money on this book. Someone gave it to me. The book is not complete by itself and is obviously an attempt to start a series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Like others, I bought this book thinking it was part 3 of a series. I feel cheated that Patterson is using the same premise for a basically completely different book. Same bird kid thing with one named Maximum. He shouldn't have used any stuff from the first two books, and I wouldn't have felt like I wasted my money."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My GOD, this book was awful. A friend of mind told me that these books were being made into a movie and outlined the premise, and (ugh) it didn't sound so bad - I enjoy random \\"experiment/people escape from the lab, try to make it in the real world\\" random fiction. After reading 3/4 of the book, I have to wonder if James Patterson is even literate, much less capable of producing decent fiction. I hate buying books and not finishing them, but I can't even think of a REASON to care about making it to the end. The characters are all essentially the same (dull and undeveloped) person, with little nervous tics and random handicaps to intended to make them seem distinct - but instead, making the act of trying to empathize with them vaguely nauseating.NOT recommended under any circumstances, unless you're looking for something to just kill a couple of brain cells and punish you for your sins."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"My mistake was assuming this was an actual sci-fi novel, with a beginning, middle, and end, instead of a lousy teaser for more 'adventures' with the Flock, led by 14-year old Max.Patterson tries to keep the action SO fast and furious that we're not supposed to notice huge plot holes.Max is told by a friendly vet that she has a chip, JUST LIKE THOSE TO TRACK VALUABLE ANIMALS, imbedded in her arm. But because most of the 'suspense' and action comes from 'unexpected' attacks by the evil lycanthropes the Erasers (who seem to be able to find the Flock at will, big duh) it never occurs to Max to try to find a doctor to have this chip removed.Another unexplored arena is Angel's emerging psy-control powers. Though she can stun and maybe kill their eternal pursuers, it never occurs to any of them to use Angel's skills to solve some of their dilemmas - some self imposed, some external.Lots of cute kid-kid bonding going on, fairly well written.. however a novel is supposed to have an actual ending. This one, because it's a transparent starting place for a kid sci-fi series (and game, and alleged movie), dispenses with the ending in favor of yet another poorly conceived escape to yet another locale - even though Max KNOWS she has this tracking chip inside her.Another pain point is the emergence of Max' \\"voice\\" which she of course distrusts, utterly unexplained, etc. etc., which keeps telling her it's Her Job To Save The World. All the adults in this story (except one, immediately left behind) are untrustworthy.While this did move along okay, the deliberate oversights and transparent plot moves make it barely acceptable for teens. Adults are advised to look elsewhere for entertainment. This is the launch of a money making series and therefore common sense steps aside in the search for the almighty teen discretionary dollar.Pros:Adults are advised to look elsewhere for entertainment.Cons:I assumed this was an actual sci-fi novel, with a beginning, middle, and end.The Bottom Line:Barely competent pseudo sci-fi cynically designed to appeal to early teens. Dig that trendy blog! OMG!! That video game! The sequels! The (maybe) movie!Overall Product Rating: AVOID this one! If Amazon allowed ZERO stars I'd have put that in.."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Patterson fans expecting his usual enthralling work will be disappointed. This is NOT a sequel to The Lake House. Max in this book is not Max from the other bird children books. If you think you're going to read about Max and her babies, you're completely wrong. This book is also written from the point of view of a very young teen. While young adult books can be entertaining, unless that's what you're expecting to be reading you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If you've ever read any of my past reviews you'll know I've only reviewed movies I've seen in the past; and that the only time i write a review is when I'm either extremely pleased or disgusted beyond words. Thus for me to write my first book review you can believe my feelings are very strong.Ill first say i have loved Pattersons work for years, and have got some of my friends interested in his work; in all honesty i owe him a hearty thanks for helping me fall in love with reading again. I love the Cross and Women's Murder Club series and felt unlimited potential with the winged children series (even though Lake House got some pretty rough reviews by some).Sadly, in Max Ride i felt completely and utterly betrayed. This book felt like either Patterson didn't feel like putting thought into maintaining the continuity of the original story line, or he wanted simply to pander to a younger crowd (and younger dollars) and forfeit his older audience (possibly out of anger toward the harsh reviews on Lake House). What ever you remember in As The Wind Blows and The Lake House mean nothing in Max Ride. There is no Frannie, no Kit, no Ozzy, Max doesn't have eggs. Where the Winged kids knew their parents in Lake House, somehow they don't know who they are in Max Ride. And was i the only one who found it weird that in Max ride the kids wanted eggs for breakfast (kids that are part bird) its like me going to Denny's and saying hey can i have some ovaries and embryos with a side of bacon.This book was like finding out that in the new Cross novel Alex is a cowardly homosexual transvestite, and he has no Nana Mama and no kids. This book felt almost like the season of Dallas where you find out the whole past season was a dream. The ending has no closure, the moments of action were always the same (the Erasers beat up the Winged kids, same beating same way every 30 pages or so, nothing new, nothing fresh).I know Patterson loves to boast that people tell him to write faster and put his books out to the public at a quicker pace. But let me say that if Max Ride is the best you can do for the loyal fans that read your books religiously, let me be the first to say PLEASE TAKE YOUR FRIGGING TIME. The only reason this book gets one star is that i think it is a good book to help get a child or adolescent interested in reading, (its a good story about being different, being brave, and the value of family and love) and its the lowest rating i can give. But please Patterson, in the future if you are going to make a book and change the whole premise and storyline, please let the fans know ahead of time, before they spending their money on something that undermines what they wanted and expected."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"\\"I gotta say... the series starts out fun. James tricks you into his own agenda here... Why this series turns to Global Warming is a mystery in itself... My son read the first two... awesome he says... three is just getting too globally political... Hey James! Stop putting stupid thoughts into the heads of impressionable young adults. Don't use your publisher as a reason to preach! Get a T.V. job and stop writing opinion piecies. I loved \\"THE QUICKIE\\"... then again... I'm an adult.... your MAX RIDE stuff... it's way too transparent for the thinking individual. Cut it out before the thinking world finds out that you are just a wolf in kids novel clothing. Anyone who can write a novel with such explicit sex and adult content really needs to be policed a lot more closely anyway. Don't be a crossover novelist. It's almost too close to another crossover type of individual. I absolutly love alot of the Patterson novels... The Max Ride series really pisses me off.... It really goes way too far.....

Very disappointing!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Well, almost every penny. Since time is money, I did waste my time reading this book. It was a comic book without pictures. Simple plot, stupid (even for children) characters, nothing to keep my attention. I usually finish a book this size in about a day.

See, I'm one of those book nut who loves and books has tons of them but most of them are reference or non-fiction. I am an avid learner and therefore novels often fall by the wayside.My mother recommended this book to me and at first I replied, \\"Winged childred?\\" How is that gonna fly? (Excuse the pun) I started reading and wow, I fell in love with the characters and realized that the characters' authenticity and seeming simplicity refreshed me. I enjoyed getting lost in the book and their adventure; it was great break from the world of superficiality in which I and others live.I am looking forward to reading \\"School's Out...forever\\" and subsequent volumes in the series!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have to preface my review by pointing out a two facts -1) I don't think I've ever read any of James Patterson's books before (and I read A LOT),2) Sci-Fi is not really my genre, I tend to stay away from it because I don't appreciate all the jargon involved (just me!),Okay. Now I have to say how much I absolutely LOVED this book. I know it is being marketed to teens but I'm 21 (and a good reader) and I thought it was on my level. I like reading thriller/suspense novels so it takes a lot to really get me hooked. I was hooked from the first page and I couldn't put it down for more than a few hours! I finished the book in a day and a half.It really is a shame that this book is being marketed to teens, because it will limit the number of other people who will read it. Don't let it stop you! Pick the book up and start your summer flying!I'm already marking the next book, School's Out Forever, on my list to read as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The title defiantly fits the book! I enjoyed reading this book so much that I couldn't put it down and I was up until 3 o'clock in the morning, trying to reach the end. The beginning of the book is a real grabber! The fact that it starts out with Max running, from the evil erasers, is defiantly a good way to start out. The action and suspense will make any reader want to keep going to the next page!Just the thought of the youngest member of the flock to be in the dreaded school makes you want to read until you find out how Max, Iggy, Fang, Gazzy, and Nudge will save her. Even as you get to the end of the book, more and more surprises jump out at any given moment! Those surprises were only a couple of the factors that made me turn the page!There was really only one bad thing about this book. It was that the end was blunt and Left you hungry for more information on what happens to the flock. Ever since I read \\"Maximum Ride: The angel Experiment\\" I have been eagerly awaiting the next book, which I have heard is coming out soon!If you are bored on a vacation, or just any old time, I suggest picking up this book and reading the first part. I bet, that with in the first couple of minutes, you will be thirsty for more information!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is an amazing book about a fourteen-year-old girl who has to live with having wings in the real wold. Her name is Maximum Ride (Max) and she has to take care of five other kids like her. Their names are Fang and Iggy, both boys and are both also fourteen, Gasman (Gazzy) who's eight, Nudge who's ten, and Angel who's six. Max treats them like she would her own kids and asks like they are too.All of them were created into human-avian hybrids (kid-bird freaks or just mutant freaks) by people who they call the whitecoats, or sceintists, in a lab that Max and her flock of kids call the School. When Angel gets kidnapped by Erasers (human-lupine hybrids or human people who can morph into wolves), Max leaves Iggy and Gazzy behind because Iggy is blind and she thinks Gazzy,even though he is Angel's real sister, is to small. on their trip back to California, Max helps a girl who is being bullied by guys and ends up getting shot. The girl who she helped lets her stay with her and her mother, who is a doctor. As soon as she can fly again, Max leaves them behind and goes in search for Fang and Nudge. They free Angel, after running into Iggy and Gazzy who say that there are to many Erasers up at there home to stay.They end up on the run, while looking for the Institute, a building that has information about the flock and their parents, in New York. On their journey Max finds out that she has a voice in her head that isn't her own and it causes really bad headaches, so bad Fang has to carry her while they fly sometimes. They find the Institute and right after they get their info from it, they are discovered by Ari, an Eraser, and some of his gang. The flock run into a secret room, only to find more muntant freaks. They release all of them and make them run away. Max brings up the rear of the group and as they are about to escape the place, Max finds herself fighting with Ari. During the fight, Max brakes Ari's neck, killing him. As she is flying away, Max hears Jeb Batchelder (the man who saved her and the flock from the School, disappeared a couple of years later, discoved by Angel that he betray the flock and was working for the whitecoats, and he was Ari's father)scream after her, \\"You killed your own brother!\\" As she reaches her flock again she finds that all of the other mutant freaks were gone except for a dog that Angel wanted to keep.This is a wonderfull book that leads into many surpises and fights that could kill the flock. I highly recomend this to anyone who loves adventure, fantsy, and mysteries all in the same book."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I'm fifteen and I personally enjoy a good book. I heard about Maximum Ride and decided to get it. Got it. Loved it.I couldn't put it down till I was finished. I found Max to be a very empowering charater because she fights for what she believes in. She and her flock are strong, smart and have unique abilities. This book is a great book and is certainly one of a kind."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"If, as an adult, you read Where the Wind Blows and The Lake House, you might enjoy a different twist on the \\"Maximum\\" tale. As in the adult version, the kids or flock, have escaped from the \\"School.\\" Max is oldest at 14 with Fang, a boy, just 4 months younger and Iggy, new name but still blind is 13 also. There is Nudge, an 11 year old non-stop talking girl and Gasman (Gazzy) and Angel, brother and sister, 8 and 6 years old respectively. They were helped in their escape by Jeb, a \\"white coat\\" who said he felt sorry for them, helped them learn how to take care of themselves and fly and found them a retreat in the mountains of Colorado where they have lived for four years, the last two years without Jeb who disappeared and is presumed dead.There is another group of genetically enhanced humanoids called Erasers who morph into wolf-like creatures. The \\"School\\" sends the Erasers after the youngest, Angel, and are able to capture her and injure the others. Max knows they cannot allow Angel to be at the School long due to the horrible experiments they will make her perform so Max, Fang and Nudge find out the School's location and head off. Iggy and Gazzy stay at at the home in the mountains but are not idle and start making bombs and other defensive/offensive weapons with which to defend themselves.In them meantime, as Max, Fang and Nudge get close to Nevada, Max sees a young girl in trouble and is unable to resist helping her. Max is very softhearted to both her own good and downfall. The adventures these special children have and the various other talents they have that become known were a great read to my 12 year old son who enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.He also was puzzled by the true motives of the Erasers, especially Ari, Max's child-hood friend, and by the scientist at the School. He looks forward and so do I to the continuing adventures.Again, very different than the adult books but still fascinating."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I love this book so much that im enceraging my friends to read it. its about a flock of kids with wings. its funny and sad, which i love about books. but the sad part is that it leaves all these questions untold. and the worst part is that i have to wait till may 2006 for the next book. if you like fiction books with adventure, sadness, funnyness, and a little bit of fantesy this book is totaly for you. and before this book i hated fantesy. this book showed me how wonderfull fantesy can be. u readers that hate fantesy give this book a chance.p.s there's a tiny bit of romance in one of the pages between 300 and 400, enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Part of my class listened to this book on tape. Although it was a shortened version, I thought it was fantastic! It was suspensful, which was very good. At first people were hesitant to listen but after the first few minutes, we couldn't wait to hear more! I'm planning on reading the book soon to learn what was left out in the shorter version. I am also praying that Mr. Patterson is working on a sequel to the book so that I can find out what happens next!!ps. Read it! you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This book was OK. It did not end, and was very predictable, but still, if you have nothing better to read you might as well. I agree with many of the adult reaviews, that it was half fantasy and half real. It had little of anything memorable, but it is deffinatly a book for teens. I can not think of anyone else who would find it remotle interesting."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"This is a very good read, and Mr. Patterson definitely keeps the reader engaged in the story from the first page. You quickly come to care about the human/avian children, and their fates. My only quibble with the book (keeping it from a five-star rating) is the lack of continuity between it and 'Lake House'. Going under the assumption that 'Max' here is the same young lady as in the previous two bird books, there is no explanation of what went on during the intervening four or so years, nor what happened to some major characters. On top of that, some of her backstory has changed. Please don't get me wrong--it's a good book and I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. However, a cleaner tie-in to the previous works would have made it even better."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I have never felt so cheated by a \\"novel\\". The story is just unfolding when suddenly I am reading an epilogue! I was beginning to wonder why the 35% to 40% white space and all of the extra verbiage when the book suddenly ends. There was no warning that this was just the start of a series, but even so I see no reason why it could not have stood on its own feet as, for instance, the Harry Potter stories do. I should have sensed the movie plan and foreseen the hacking that I've come to expect from Patterson in later years. Still I resent the waste of time. One star for the movie action potential."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title. Do not be fooled by the \\"Young Adult\\" category; this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read. Though a little adolescent at times, this novel is still excellent, and I recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"When I first got this book, I read the jacket and read the summary. It sounded like a very interesting and enjoyable book. But when I opened the book, I read the introduction, and I felt a sense of corniness. If you get the book, you'll see what I mean.Anyway, I read this book despite the fact, and, halfway through, I found myself a bit bored. I mean, the things in the book were interesting, but half the time the storyline was dragged out a bit and the other half they were shortened to the point where I had to reread the chapter to understand what was happening.This book was written well overall, I guess, and even though I am a fifteen-year-old teenager, I found some elements of the book to be a bit juvenile. Many things were very overdramatized. Another gripe I had was that some scenes were truly absurd (I mean, without even looking at the fact that there are winged children in the book!).Finally, I got to the ending. I read the last scenes... and I was very confused. \\"Is this the end of the book?\\" I thought aloud. Alas, it was. I know it was meant to be part of a series, but it should at least give me a sense of closure... but it doesn't. For that reason alone, this book loses one star.Overall, this book was a good way to pass the time, but it isn't perfect."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"The author's intention here was for the readers to go and grab the next book in the series. But honestly, it didn't work for me. I actually felt annoyed that I had to endure an entire book with every scene essentially the same with the others."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"James Patterson enters the young adult fiction arena with a whimper, with this far-fetched sci-fi saga which borrows heavily from the recycle bin of Dean Koontz. The titular character (Yep, \\"Maximum Ride\\" is a character in the book) is the leader of a group of six children who call themselves \\"The Flock\\". Each child has been subjected to genetic experimentation at a place called \\"The School\\", where evil scientists have \\"improved\\" them with avian DNA. This has resulted in each child growing a pair of wings large enough to take flight, as well as a number of other \\"side effects\\" which the children are now discovering.Max is fourteen years old, and can fly at supersonic speed using her thirteen foot wingspan. Amazingly, she can fold away her wings somewhere in the framework of her 5' 8\\" body so that she appears to the world as a normal teenaged girl wearing a hoodie.Fang is the tall, dark and handsome one who is amazingly strong and resilient.Iggy is blind, due to the scientists' failed attempts to improve his night vision. His talents include making explosive devices and cooking. His other senses have been sharpened to compensate for his lack of vision.Nudge is the talkative one, and also a computer hacker with developing psychic powers.The Gasman a.k.a. Gazzy is a flatulent eight year old, best friend and co-conspirator to Iggy and the biological brother of Angel.Angel is the baby at age six, with eight foot wide white wings. She can read and manipulate people's minds, and we learn that she can also breathe underwater using invisible gills.The school has also produced another species called \\"The Erasers\\", who are children who have been \\"enhanced\\" with wolf DNA. This is a handsome species, until they start morphing into super strong werewolf-like beings. The Erasers are the security force for The School and are licensed to kill if necessary.Anyway, after you've swallowed all the above, I won't burden you much longer except to say that Max and rest of the Flock originally escaped The School thanks to a scientist named Jeb, who set them up with a safe house and lived with them for a while before he disappeared. Their happy home is thrown into disarray when Angel is kidnapped by the Erasers, and the Flock heads out into the world on a search and recovery mission. This leads to a quest for the meaning of life, and ultimately to New York City, where Max begins hearing voices.Having plowed through more than 450 pages of this kind of fluff, the reader should logically expect a conclusion, but Patterson fails to deliver even this, leaving ends dangling untidily all over the place, with no ending in sight.I had a hard time with this one, and if your teenager has an enquiring mind I'd advise them to look elsewhere for their Sci-Fi / Fantasy needs.Amanda Richards, October 6, 2006"},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"After a yaer of many different friends saying that I should read this book, I felt ,as a 13 year old, I should read it. After the read, I was insulted. The authoer of this book, James Patterson, who really is an adult level author attempted to write books for younger children or young adult. But he sure blew it. It was very clean and edited. It felt as though I were a 5 year old reading this book. Also, it was incredibly unrealistic, to violent, and to dumb. This is a book that can NEVER be made into a movie, and if it was made into one, i and several other friends would not go. Although the author was simply trying to do something different, I give him the credit of at least trying it. I mean, it was not great, not good, below ok, but not bad. So my grade stands, but if you are a teenager, do not read."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"First of all, can I say AWESOME opening? Too bad it turned [SPOILER]. Guess you'll just have to find out yourself. Okay... seriously, the review.Some interesting things about this book. The Angel Experiment is told from several viewpoints, but mostly Max's. Not strange in itself, but Max's (point of view) POV is told in first person while the other characters are told in third person. Kind of neat. I rather liked it.The chapters are short-short. We're talking 2-3 pages, 4 pages MAX per chapter. The thing with the short chapters is they're almost exactly the way I read. I'm the type of gal who'll stop in the middle of a scene, which is what the chapters often did. Then when I come back to a work, I have to find where I left off. The chapters are so short, I have no problem making it to the next chapter. I think I might have stopped in the middle of a chapter once.In terms of the writing, I think this work could have been a bit shorter. I know, I know... last week I was talking about lengthening Spiderwork... I just can't be pleased. Mr. Patterson seemed quite fond of repeating himself. Yes, I know Max has a 13-foot wingspan. Yes, Iggy is blind. Fang is the silent one. Angel is her baby.Nudge, by the way, is black. I thought I'd mention this because I don't think Mr. Patterson comes out and says it until the second book. Here she's called tanned... just clarifying an issue. That was one tidbit Mr. Patterson didn't reiterate 30 times. Anyway, I'm just saying my attention span isn't so short I'd have difficulty remembering something three pages back.Enough of that. I truly enjoyed The Angel Experiment. I'm already in book 3... so that says a lot. The only reason I'm not reading Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports right now is because I'm afraid the story lines will blend into one another. So why did I like this one, you ask?Plotwise: The story kept me engaged. Even when I hit part 6 (last part) and thought how much I was tired of the cat and mouse games, I still had my nose in the book, wondering what's next. The entire story was pretty much about when the bad guys (Erasers) would show up and how Max and her flock would escape.Characters: Each one was unique in their behavior, personality, and motivation. Funny thing about the thoughts and speech of the characters... they seemed a bit... not modern. Cause really, how many kids know who Judy Garland is? It'll be interesting to see what my daughter says about it. I'll have to ask my oldest if some of these things were over her head. Being not so young, the analogies worked for me. I chalked off their cultural knowledge and references to being isolated from civilization for most of their lives.I know this review is rather sparse, but really there wasn't much to the book. The Erasers came, the flock fought, the flock fled. Rinse and repeat.Anyway, I leave you with my favorite line from the book (page 150):\\"You think you need all your stuff, your favorite cup, your best blanket, soap, your parents - and then you realize that all you really need is to be where the Erasers can't get you.\\"I swear, that line pretty much summed up the entire book.By the way, if you stop with this book, you'll be lacking the entire story. This definitely ends in a \\"What's Next?\\"Stay tuned for my upcoming reviews of the Maximum Ride series."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"Patterson has discovered the unfortunate truth that quantity can be more profitable than quality. This is a dreadful book. Of course, every Patterson book I have ever slogged through was also dreadful, so. . .Patterson seems to believe that pyrotechnics can replace any sort of plot or character development. He is sadly mistaken. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I thought the book was a page turner with plenty of action. The writing was fair but not anything to brag about. A book like this is more about the story and less about the art of writing. Now the most annoying thing I find with this book is that it doesn't have an ending. I think all books should have an ending. Since this one just drops the reader off in nowhere land, I am not inclined to read anymore about this story in the numerous sequels since it is clear to me the book is about commercialism and the story is secondary."},{"Title":"Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment","review":"I hate giving away too many spoilers. I'll start by saying that I first read The Angel Experiment way, way back when it was first released a few years ago. I totally fell head-over-heels in love with the book. Now, I was a huge James Patterson fan long before The Angel Experiment or any of the other Maximum Ride books were written and published. I had come to expect quality work from Mr. Patterson, so I had a feeling I wouldn't be let down. I hadn't read the first book in this series in maybe a year or two, so I did a quick re-read before sitting down to write this review.The Maximum Ride series is great for just about any age. Yes, it is geared towards teens and younger readers, but as an adult, I still enjoyed it. There is some violence and fighting in The Angel Experiment, but it isn't anything too over the top or gory and definitely nothing nearly as bad as what most teens already see on television. This book has so much action that it is easy to get wrapped up into the story and time just kind of slips away. It's well over four hundred pages, but it didn't feel like it was that long.This dialog is a bit basic, which makes it great for a younger teen, but it didn't lack in complexity one bit. You definitely have to have an open mind, be adventurous, and have an imagination when you are reading this book, as well as all of the other books in the series. The main story line revolves around six teens that were all born with different supernatural talents, the gift of wings and flight being a large quality and talent, kind of like what Marvel does with Spiderman or Superman. They were all created and raised at place called School that is super-secretive. The kids are kept at School as experiment subjects, but are set free by a scientist named Jeb.One of the teens are kidnapped, the youngest of the six who is a girl named Angel. Her kidnappers are the Erasers, who were also created at School. It's up to Max at first to go and try to save Angel, but something bad goes down and Max is shot through her wing and the tracer that is lodged in her cannot be taken out.Determined to help Angel, the rest of the flock (what the teens refer to themselves as) attempts to go back to School with Max, but most of them are kidnapped by the elusive Erasers. Max uncovers a secret from Jeb at School. She has to save the whole world and that is what she was created for. But how? And where are everyone's parents? Basically, the entire first book is spent trying to rescue Angel, rescue themselves, and find out where the School might be keeping the parents.When I first read The Angel Experiment, I couldn't believe how much was left out of it. It's a great introduction to the series, but there are so many cliffhangers and the ending frustrated the heck out of me. There is some character development, but other plot points were skimmed over and were just hinted at. For example, there was no thorough explanation to Max about her saving the world. We aren't given the whole story in this book. It's not a negative thing, but I remember having to wait forever for the next book.Luckily for the people who haven't read any of the books yet, every single one will be available by August of this year! Altogether, I really loved The Angel Experiment. It was so clever and the writing was well done."},{"Title":"How To Choose A Bible Version (revised)","review":"Robert L. Thomas comes across as having a sincere desire to help those in search of the \\"best bible\\". I agree with his literal approach to translation, as well as his conservative theological views.I found the first version of this book (2000) on a discount rack at a book store and devoured it. As another reviewer mentioned, it makes a great reference book to access from time to time.I received this revised version yesterday afternoon and have already enjoyed reading it \\"again\\".A couple of points:a.

He is simply about the facts as he sees them; which is almost always correct. I do have one example that stands out as ironic and put a smile on my face as I read it. On page 103-104, he writes (concerning theological bias in translations):\\"Four methods of detecting theological bias present themselves. First, the theological view points of the translators may be a matter of general knowledge. A translation sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church would reflect the views of that church body as the New World Translation support those of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. . . . .\\"Now, this chapter as I said is dealing with theological bias in Bible Translations. Why did Dr. Robert Thomas not take his comment to also include his conservative Evangelical translators. Why did it not continue . . . \\"as well as,\\" or \\"even those of the Evangelical stripe have also been convicted of theological bias in their translations.\\" Would it be bias on his part, for him to leave his group unmentioned. I would certainly say so. The irony is that only three paragraphs into a chapter on theological bias, we find the very author having trouble avoiding the bug. Bias is a disease that no one is exempt from. Only our love for God and his Word can help us to control its influence, but never 100 percent."},{"Title":"Poems That Live Forever","review":"I discovered a number of wonderful poems that I was not familiar with, as well as some old favorites.

I was attracted to Rao's book because much of the presentation is similar to Vierck. After using this text for one semester, I was not satisfied. I was particularly concerned by Chapter 2 where the fundamentals of damped single degree of freedom systems are covered. This Chapter is critical to building the foundation of Vibration Theory and I was disturbed to find that two critical plots, the time history comparison of responses with various damping levels and the phase plane plot for the same cases were seriously incorrect. While errors always can be found in texts, these plots were so obviously wrong at first glance that I wondered how a book with 29 reviewers (as listed in the Acknowledgements) has such glaring errors. As I progressed through the text I found a number of other errors including incorrect equations in some places. I also found that some material, emphasized in Vierck, that I consider important was buried in the worked examples rather than being emphasized as part of the book's text. While the book does present a lot of material and gives some interesting problems, I found that I was not comfortable with the text at the end of the course. I have since decided to drop this book from consideration as our text."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"This book in my opinion is not the one to enjoy the beauty of the subject and mechanics in general. There is a vast amount of material amassed but the structure of the book is poor.It seems being overburden with details and particulars and lacking unified clear consistent approach. In addition some mistakes are just plain annoying. If one wants to be serious about vibrations - do not sweat over this book. It can be just another somewhat usefull reference book to find some particular solution to for some particular problem.Instead one can study mechanics with beautifully written classical L.Meirovitch, &quot;Fundamentals of Vibrations&quot; which is much more original, rigorous, clear, usefull and serious book to have."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"I used this textbook for my Mechanical Vibrations course and was very displeased with it. My biggest gripe is the lack of examples in each chapter. There are an abundance of homework problems at the end of each chapter, but the vast majority of them are not illustrated at all in example problems. I noticed this immediately in Chapter 1 when attempting to solve several of the problems. The text also develops equations and formulas without detail and explanation. Luckily my teacher developed the eqations in class lecture and provided the majority of information for the course. While working out homework and test problems that were assigned, the book was of little use for me. I think the clarity of writing could be better, as well. By the way, I got an A in the course and still found the book to be poor."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"I found this book to be very hard to understand, and not very systematic. in some of the examples it is assumed that you know how to do all the math, or you understand entirely the thought process. Maybe there is not a better text, but compared to my other engineering text books, I would say this is one of the worst that i have used. It seems that it would be better for those who have a strong understanding of dynamics. Not introductory courses to the subject.And again one of the largest drawbacks that i found was it did not have great examples, some were good, some were ok, but they did not cover the sections well in my opinion.Also one of the most annoying things is a formula that we used extensively for 3 weeks was found in an example, not in the text where it should have been for those who don't fully examine the examples."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"On the surface, this text seems to cover everything and seems well-organized. However, further examination will reveal that it is often unclear and seems to skip or briefly mention many important subjects. Further, there are not nearly enough examples to convey the subject matter to the average undergraduate engineering student. Unfortunately, it has been my experience (after 6 years as a mechanical engineering student) that there are hardly any well-written texts on the subject of mechanical vibrations. This one only reinforces that notion."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"This text was used during my senior year for two consecutive mechanical engineering courses I had at Penn State. I found the presentation of the material very thorough and logically ordered. My only issue with the book was when we dug into the first chapter. I was a bit overwhelmed because, although the first chapter is just an overview of vibration, it is very broad, yet detailed. All subsequent chapters were very well focused, easy to follow, and illustrative of important concepts.I put the book away after graduation, but soon got it out again, finding that it is a wonderful tool in the field... definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Mechanical Vibrations","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. Although it seems well structured and covers many materials, the overall content just overwhelms the undergraduate student will many details and forces them to lose the whole point.

Example problems are completely worthless as Rao often skips dozens of steps at once, assuming the reader is already a pro at modeling complex physical systems. To make matters worse, there seems to be a distinct lack of explanations and plain definitions for many terms that are randomly introduced into the topic. Modal shapes, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, etc. are all introduced with little to no background information.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I could potentially see the book's value as a review text or reference, but as the main text for an introductory course on vibrations...

There is no other book that explains very complicated subject of Mechanical Vibrations as well as this Book By Singiresu Rao. He is an excellent author coming from Purdue university. His book has been used in academic field since its first edition in 1986. He uses delightful examples to simplify the subject. I also find his biography of various scientist whom contributed to the field of vibrations fascinating. He also gives out FORTRAN computer codes which stimulate students learning.

This book was written by an obviously highly educated 21 year old young man from England who vividly described his experiences during his travels across the new country of the United States of America in 1796. Particularly compelling are his observations of everyday life in the cities of early America and his travels through the frontiers of Ohio and Kentucky. His account includes such memorable events as the use of slavery for sugar production in the Caribbean, social aspects of New York and various other American cities, the early founding of the area of Miami in Ohio, ice jams on the Ohio River during one of the coldest winters on record, the hunting of deer and bear, construction of a boat, log cabins, overnight stays in various frontier dwellings, encounters with and observations of the native inhabitants, comments on ancient native burial mounds, the manufacture of sugar from sugar maple trees, and discussions regarding the cost and availability of food. Not only is this journal interesting to those students of history who enjoy learning about this period in the life of America, but it also provides an interesting commentary on the author. He is keenly aware of his own national identification as being from England (a fact that may have caused him to be somewhat defensive considering the conflict between England and America during the Revolution). His passionate accounts also reflect his own youth and background, as a young person who grew up in a structured and rigid environment focused on education and social distinctions. It is particularly interesting that the author finds it distasteful to engage in manual labor or other labors he finds more suitable for others. His reflections also reflect his perspective of early America as a land of opportunity, inhabited by a freedom loving and independent people."},{"Title":"The Norman Rockwell album","review":"This is a large, \\"coffee table\\" type book with hundreds of beautiful paintings / works by Norman Rockwell, many in color.

A personal exploration of familial generational issues around pregnancy, childbirth and maternal death presents a disturbing pattern. When the writer's daughter has multiple physical problems during her pregnancies and childbirth, the familial archetype raises its ugly head. Struggling to find an approach which would interrupt the disturbing historical family pattern in pregnancy, childbirth and maternal death, becomes a complex journey for mother and daughter. When the daughter begins to experience the troubling symptoms, so prevalent in this family, the author, finds the interventions of the scientific community are ineffective. As the journey unfolds the disturbing model from the intergenerational history becomes the compelling force to seek support from traditional healing. Here the mother and daughter experience caring, sympathetic and knowledgeable support in traditinal healing practices. Written in a clear and concise manner this wrok describes the trial of a mother and daughter as the family pattern of maternal death is confronted. Likewise, the tension and support of traditional and scientific medicine are shared from both personal and family perspectives."},{"Title":"Mother, Heal My Self: An Intergenerational Healing Journey Between Two Worlds","review":"This is a must read not only for nurses, healthcare providers, or women.

Wanigi Waci offered classes to the hospital staff in cultural sensitivity, to help the conventional medical personnel appreciate the traditional ways of healing of his people.Koerner's daughter, Kristi, nearly died in birthing her first child, requiring an emergency caesarian section. Her son nearly died of an infection due to the prolonged labor. He had repeated hospitalizations for respiratory infections during his first six months. Kristi's second pregnancy was marked by diabetes, hypertension, toxemia and preeclampsia. In both childbirths, Wanigi Waci was present, unbidden, and enormously helpful with his Native American healing treatments.Koerner went on to study and participate in the healing ceremonies of the Sioux. She shares from her many lessons of the heart and spirit, in a book that is hard to put down.Koerner is clearly gifted as a nurse and as a teacher of the essence of nursing. She shares many insights around conventional and Native American healing.Koerner's integrity as a healer who walks her talk is evident in the stories she shares about her healing journeys. What she writes of others is also true of herself.Hopefully, Koerner's pioneering work with Wanigi Waci will open more nurses and hospitals to healing collaborations and spiritual lessons."},{"Title":"Mother, Heal My Self: An Intergenerational Healing Journey Between Two Worlds","review":"This outstanding book should push back the horizon for every nurse dealing with persons of differing faiths, healing modalities and cultures.

It's formatted with dozens of interviews with just about everybody who's ever worked on Teen Titans, The New Teen Titans, Tales of the Teen Titans, New Titans, Team Titans, and whatever other incarnation the teams had. Cadigan has taken the liberty of breaking up certain interviews (Wolfman and Perez come to mind) chronologically, which allows you take in the Titans one era at a time. Reading from start to finish, it's amazing to witness the transformation from a team of four sidekicks trying to bridge the generation gaps to a horde of dysfunctional, de-aged, gritty warriors.If you're hoping for a comic-by-comic guide of what happened with the team, stick to the internet. I was able to piece most of it together, but there were bits and pieces I needed some more help on.The book has TONS of b&w; artwork, either reproduced panels or convention sketches--they're fantastic!As somebody who's never read much DC at all, let alone Titans, I learned that Wondergirl was originally just Wonderwoman at a younger age (ie, not Wonderwoman's sidekick). When she showed up in Teen Titans, all of a sudden an origin had to follow, and it's followed poor Donna Troy ever since! Deathstroke the Terminator, and Vigilante both sprung from the pages of New Teen Titans. Speedy's little heroin addiction apparently never came up in the Titans! And that there were a lot of character's I'd never heard of who've joined the Titans over the years, including the Joker's daughter, who was actually Two-Face's daughter, who called herself Duella Dent and fought as Harlequin (not the Batman:The Animated Series one), and who according to Len Wein in a lettercol of DC's Who's Who #15 \\"show's up at Donna Troy's wedding and Dick Grayson accusing (sic) her of lying. She admitted to the deception and points to her recent addition of 50 pounds, keeping her out of crime-fighting. Since she was never a major character, nor did she ever have her own series or origin, it was decided to omit her reference (from Who's Who) since she will not be seen again.\\"Suffice it to say, I'm now dying to find a Titans issue with Duella as an active crimefighter in it, to see how the writer's played it.

The only Teen Titans I'd ever read was \\"the Judas Contract\\".This book takes the reader chronologically through the evolution of the Teen Titans, from the time when it was basically \\"the Justice League's sidekicks\\" to it's present day incarnation. We take this journey via interviews with or articles on just about every creator involved with Titans. Every page has great artwork, and most of it is previously unpublished commissions to fans (a TwoMorrows hallmark).While I think the book is designed for somebody who's a Teen Titans fanatic, it was detailed enough that I could follow along, and most of the plot points were articulated well-enough in the interviews that I didn't have to have read every issue of Teen Titans. That said, there were some moments when I scratched my head and thought \\"what's a baxter-series?\\" or something like that? Most of these were quickly rememedied with google or yahoo's help. In fact, here's my recommendation: Do an online search of Teen Titans, and read through the issue summaries--yup, they're out there. If it sounds interesting to you at all, pick up the book. That should be enough info that you're never left scratching your head, and it's also a good litmus test of your Titans fever. I know I've already started plunging through the quarter bins for the wolfman/perez stuff that hasn't been collected in trades yet!A great book that any comic fan will love!"},{"Title":"The Titans Companion","review":"I stumbled on this book almost by accident. It contains numerous interviews of the Titans creators, allowing the reader to get an inside look at the group from the 60s to the mid 90s. The emphasis is naturally on the most successful run of their history-the Wolfman/Perez years of the 80s. Anyone looking for a synoposis of each issue will be disappointed, as this is not the book's focus."},{"Title":"The Titans Companion","review":"As the other reviewers have said, this is an amazing book that covers so much of the behind the scenes with not only the original series of Teen Titans (including the story that got Marv Wolfman and Len Wein blacklisted from DC for a couple of years), but the 70's revival and the glory days of Wolfman/Perez, going up to the end of The New Titans with issue 130. There is also a couple of excellent creator interviews with the writers/artists of Team Titans, and it annoys me that we never got to see those stories because of the Zero Hour garbage.Anyway, it's a great book and I'm very glad that I purchased it."},{"Title":"The Titans Companion","review":"What can I say? Lots of P&eacute;rez art, lots of information, lots of behind-the-stage information about various Titans series throughout the years. Recommended for all fans.I'm eagerly waiting for Volume 2!!"},{"Title":"The Titans Companion","review":"Top notch retrospective of the early Titans eras. Not quite as good as the All-Star Companion, but enjoyable nonetheless. It's definitely a must-own for Titans fans!"},{"Title":"Flight (A Terra Magica book)","review":"There are still some of us who marvel at the magic of flight; back in the 1960s, this magic was conveyed to the growing number of people who could afford air travel in a genre of artistic photographic books. This volume is part of a genre that included \\"The Magic of Flight,\\" by Hans Burgunder and \\"Aircraft: The New Vision,\\" by Le Corbusier. These older books consist of what a modern audience would consider grainy black-and-white photographs - the graininess (\\"noise\\" in the parlance of digital photography) was meant to add texture. These older books, therefore, are meant for those of us who admire old monochrome photography; persons seeking sparkling, crisp (technically perfect) color pictures will be disappointed.Unlike the other two volumes, this one pays more tribute to birds in flight as it does aircraft. Then, by comparing avian with human flight, the author creates an artistic synthesis. For example, the skeletons of birds and bats are contrasted with the wing spars of early fabric-covered aircraft, the high aspect ratio wings of storks and albatrosses are compared with sailplanes, the folding wings of a tern with the folding wings of a squadron of Royal Navy Armstrong-Whitworth Sea Hawks, the V-shaped wings of dragonflies with the V-tails of Fouga Magisters, and the texture of a butterfly wing with the many rivets of the wing of a C-47 or DC-3. Quotes by poets and ancient writers supplement the text. If you enjoy interesting, artistic aviation photography (not just photographs of aircraft), then give this book (along with the others mentioned) a try."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"I found the recipes easy to follow and the results were absolutly delicious.

I love the collection of stories because it gave you a recollection on Sylvia's family history and an insight on the importance of this cookbook. The recipes are just outstanding!!!

She is a very warm, loving and down to earth person. We talked for quite a while and she made my visit a very special one. The food at Ms. Sylvia's restaurant is absolutely devine.

She even has several more health conscious recipes for those who must have them (Southern and healthy are not synonymous).I've prepared many of her recipes with great success. The tuna croquettes are easy and yummy! You probably already have all the ingredients in your cupboards. The smothered pork chops are to die for, and I finally can make a gravy my grand mother would be proud of! There are a few recipes I simple will not try. I wouldn't as a kid and I'm not starting now!

I think that we all have to remember that soul food is that it is very much like jazz -- there is a basic formula, but improvisation is key. With that said, I think there are few soul food books that give the definitive recipe for a dish. While good, I think they are meant to be a starting point for our imagination and experimentation. With that said, this book has the only recipe I use for red velvet cake.Soul food was a cuisine born out of creativity; don't expect one book to capture it all."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"Hi everyone, I'm a sophomore living away from home for college and the first thing I missed was my mother's home cooking. I decided to buy Sylvia's Family cookbook it's the best thing that happened to me so far this school year. Just follow the instructions and you can without a doubt create delicious meals. I couldn't cook to save my life now, I can invite my friends over to my dorm for dinner and they never know that I got all my recipes from a cookbook. Hopefully, I can impress my mom with my new skills when I go back home....."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"I happen to be in the food industry. And from time to time I like to experiment with various recipes (after all you can never be too good). So I purchased this book to add to the others I have in my collection. Well...after trying some of the recipes in this book I came to the conclusion that if a person is not able to cook or is not familiar with a particular recipe before hand, then this book will not teach you to be the wonderful cook you had hoped for. These recipes must be tweeked in order to be successful. I grew up with soul food, all of my relatives cook soul food and I know of some very good soul food restaurants here in Chicago. But after cooking with these recipes, my 14 year old son asked me to not use this book again and to continue cooking the way I had been...without Sylvia's help (this sentiment was echoed by my boyfriend and my brother). I don't believe these are the same exact recipes that are used in her restaurant, after all why give up your secrets if it's been profitable this long. But I also don't think that people should be fooled into thinking these recipes alone will turn them into soul food experts."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"I loved this cookbook for both the incredible food and the history. You will not only learn about serious soul food but you'll learn about life (good and bad) in segregation era South Carolina. I actually stayed up until well past midnight reading Slyvia's cookbook.

I've tried many of the recipes in her book, and have been immensely pleased. Other reviewers have all said it as well or better than I could, but I have to add the fact that, when we're trying to come up with an idea for something for dinner, my husband has developed a habit of grabbing the book from its home on the counter between the refrigerator and microwave and saying, \\"well, let's see what Sylvia recommends today.\\"I don't know about her other cookbook, but this one is definitely a keeper.Edited 10-12-2003: we tried the chicken perlow from this book tonight, essentially a one-pot dish featuring highly seasoned chicken and rice with a bit of bacon and onion.

I got the recipe from the Food Network website, and choose this one because I did not want to replicate Cakeman Raven's cake. I am happy with my choice (i used it to make cupcakes). The cake was soft and moist on the inside with a slighty chewy outside. I followed the advice of one of the other posters and used 2 tablespoons of the cocoa powder. When I tasted the raw batter, it had a pleasant chocolate taste, but when I tasted the final cake, it was a little more subtle. Another adjustment that I made was to increase the amount of sugar in the recipe; I added an additional 1/2 c of sugar which bought out the chocolate flavor. I did not make the frosting because I already had a recipe that my friends and family liked.Once I tasted the cake I came on Amazon and purchased the book."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"I purchased this book and used many of the recipes for Thanksgiving dinner.

My Mother-in-law is like that - man, that woman can cook and she has a lot of good, simple recipes. This book gives you those types of recipes, and along with them, you get the stories of her family connected with the recipes. Every recipe I have cooked from this book has been good - they are simple recipes and they are some goo-oood eatin!

Clearly, Sylvia's Restaurant in Harlem, along with her Atlanta branch and her line of soul food products, is serious business.But hers is also an inspiring American success story, as hard work (and a healthy dash of hot sauce) propels Woods from rural poverty to celebrity-chef status. Woods tells the story of her extended and close-knit family and shares such fiery recipes as her Chopped Barbecued Pork and Herbert's &quot;Hot As You Like It&quot; Fried Corn, perfected by her husband of 55 years.Even if you are not hungry--this cookbook fills your soul."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"I had high hopes for this book as I'm collecting old fashioned cookbooks, but what a disappointment.

The mac and cheese was decent, but not mouth watering.I was ashamed to serve this crap to my southern-bred boyfriend.

She relates rich experiences of growing up in the Hemminway S.C. community where people basically raised collected, slaughtered, canned and froze almost everything they ate.My memories of summers in the south as a child, eating packed sandwiches in the car on the way back north and going to the community freezer locker, came flooding back. And the recipes themselves, provide an accurate taste of many of the old southern favorites. For those not privileged to have connections in the south, it may have been hard to come by some of the recipes and Ms Woods has taken the time to chronicle the old classic southern dishes that were typically learned from grandmothers and mothers. But it's not just the food, it's the &quot;soul&quot; that's connected to the preparation. How many of us pass down great experiences connected to the fast food and pizza that we so often eat?Try some of my favorites: Frances's Lily White Biscuits, Nan's Extra-Special Marinated Spareribs and Peach Cobbler, put some soul into it and create lasting memories of your own."},{"Title":"Sylvia's Family Soul Food Cookbook : From Hemingway, South Carolina, To Harlem","review":"When I first received Sylvia's book I thought it was just going to be another cookbook where the pictures look good but the flavor never turns out...,Well not this book.

In a few recipes, like the &quot;Wednesday Night Special Meat Loaf&quot;, cooking took noticeably longer than specified. I know all ovens are different but when the recipe says bake for 1 hour and it took almost 2, that's a big difference. Still, the meat loaf was delicious and worth the wait.Along with some great recipes, if you enjoy reading your cookbooks, you'll spend lots of engrossed in this one.

Any time a family unites for a meal, there is a great deal more going on than fulfilling that need to kill the hunger. Good food is the only recipe for the soul. Sylvia has included many recipes in this book that my family has enjoyed for many, many years. I may be a bit biased in rating this book because there are some included by my aunt, Neomia Brown, and grandmother, Annie Frazier (who passed a year ago this December). Bless your heart Sylvia and to all of you who enjoy the recipes throughout the book!

Sylvia collects recipes from friends, family and neighbors, and writes nostalgically about picnics, church events and fun serving soul food.Sylvia founded a wonderful restaurant business in Harlem, NY and in Atlanta, Georgia. She reveals some of her secrets to soul food here. But the recipes are deceptively simple and unless you grew up on great soul food (I did not) you might have trouble to reproduce the complexity of flavor. Like Cajun cooking, soul food seems to be based on experience and a honed sense of taste for seasonings that defies documentation.But you can try, and this is a fine book for recipes, especially for chicken and for vegetables like limas and greens.

After reading her book, I'd love to drive to Harlem and meet her! As a white Southerner I am grateful to her for her documentation of our recipes. These were common to both black and white Southern people who farmed and wasted NOTHING. Thank you, Sylvia, and the best of continued success to you and your family!"},{"Title":"Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism, Volume 149 (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","review":"This is a superbly written, fascinating, greatly informative book.I have used it primarily as an introduction to lambda calculus andintuitionistic logic in its BHK, natural deduction, and sequent calculusforms, not to mention the comparative treatment of those with theirclassical counterparts. In these regards, it is clear and concise whilenonetheless being thorough and presenting a full spectrum of interesting results,i.e., all the highpoints and more. It also explains the history and motivationand offers hundreds of useful references. It also has chapters onsecond-order logic and polymorphism. I say all this having readperhaps 1/15th of the material; I'm very happy I bought it.And of course, it has a lot to say about their main topic, the Curry-Howardisomorphism, which I am now finding I need to understand as well.Good thing I have this book.

Of course, we have all heard this argument so many times before--- one that often falls on deaf ears because federal policy, urban political priorities, and powerful development interests work against it. With this hard reality in mind, the major contribution of this work is that the authors suggest that preservation is not only about saving historic architecture and historic places, it is also about restoring and rebuilding our nation's shattered urban communities. As they state it so well, &quot;(p)reservation is the business of saving special places and the quality of life they support. It has to do with more than bricks, balustrades, columns, and cobblestones. It has to do with the way individuals, families, and communities come together in good environments&quot; (p. 240).Beyond the planni! ! ng rhetoric, the authors provide a number of detailed case studies of New Orleans, Memphis, Pittsburg, and snapshots of other towns both big and small that illustrate well exactly how this connection between historic preservation and community can be made. With all of the current attention on &quot;community&quot; as the critical factor in restoring a hospitable environment in urban America, this book necessarily becomes very relevant and useful.This book is so well written and interesting! I do not hesitate to recommended it to all audiences."},{"Title":"Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl","review":"Moe and Wilkie describe what has gone wrong with the planning of urban and suburban America, and discuss their solution: a combination of historic preservation, community activism, and more intelligent zoning regulations. Their book is very much in the spirit of New Urbanism - that cities should be looking backward to traditional planning approaches that served us so well before World War II. Memphis gets the most attention in this book, as both a positive and negative example; the authors also focus on New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Denver, St. Paul, Portland (Ore.), and several small towns that revitalized their main streets. Moe and Wilkie write with a journalistic balance that I found refreshing, in contrast to the rabid ranting of certain other books. Even when describing Disney's failed effort to build a theme park in northern Virginia, the authors resist the trap of making Disney sound like the heart of evil, and allow the reader to understand the situation from Disney's perspective. The only drawback is that even though the book is about historic preservation and urban planning, there are only 20 illustrations."},{"Title":"Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl","review":"Another book on urban sprawl can understandably be met with diminished expectations. But don't allow your expectations to languish when you pick up Changing Places. Get ready for the passion of two preservationists. And no one is exempt from their stern gaze; not the press, not the politicians, not the professional planners, not the building industry, and not even you and me. Richard Moe has been the president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation since 1992. His attention to detail conspires with his affinity for root causes in the aptly titled Changing Places. Carter Wilkie was a White House speech writer. Moe and Wilkie observe we have abandoned the art of place making. As we are products of our created settings, the disintegration of historic communities leaves us with a loss of identity as a people. We become historically illiterate. This book isn't for everyone. If you have never walked into a traditional urban setting and asked yourself: &quot;How in the world did they ever let this happen?&quot; then you'll find this book unsatisfying. If you've never wondered how to restore the historic, civic, cultural and economic center of a community, then you'll be mystified by the authors' flair for detail in successful plans for reclamation. If you've never sensed the hopelessness in the eyes of our children in urban settings, then you'll have little use for the authors' thoughtful choice of words in defining our loss. If, on the other hand, you perceive the loss and think there is still something worth preserving, something to salvage, then this is a must-read. John F.

For its contemporary readers, EAST LYNNE was one of the exemplars of that emerging genre, the sensation novel: its plot incorporates, among other things, murder, mistaken identity, bigamy, and adultery. Sitting awkwardly in this wild stew of criminal activity are the narrator's pious moral observations and the novel's didactic (and sometimes ponderously satirical) pronouncements on contemporary mores. The characters are mainly cardboard, with the possible exception of the termagant Cornelia Carlyle. The story remains highly readable, largely because the plot moves at a reasonably fast pace, but no-one should approach this book looking for high literature. Mrs. Wood wrote plain--some might say \\"simplistic\\"--prose with a minimum of stylistic embellishment, but most readers should find her writing tolerable. In other words, this novel exists in the upper reaches of Danielle Steele-land. It is, nevertheless, an essential text for understanding trends in Victorian popular culture during the 1860s and after.This new edition, probably intended to replace the poorly edited Everyman version, contains a number of \\"extras.\\" These include letters from Mrs. Wood, the report from publisher's reader Geraldine Jewsbury (herself a popular novelist), data on the novel's publication and serialization, contemporary reviews, contextual material, and selections from one of the many theatrical adaptations of the novel. Like most Broadview publications, this edition is obviously designed for classroom use, although casual readers should also find the additional material helpful.Unfortunately, this edition has something in common with the Everyman version: the editing and proofreading. The text is rife with bizarre word substitutions, as if the MS had been run through a spellchecker without a second reading; typos; and improper accidentals (e.g., semi-colons for apostrophes and commas for periods). The often scattershot footnotes did not help: they were sometimes repetitive (e.g., annotating \\"Turk\\" more than once) and often too terse to be of much use. Many notes glossed old sayings whose meanings remain obvious even to today's students. To make matters worse, my own copy was badly printed. Instructors may want to keep these problems in mind."},{"Title":"East Lynne","review":"I loved the novel \\"East Lynne\\" and am now reading it for the 2nd time. I could not put the book down and kept reading and reading. I recommended it to my mother and she also read it and loved it. It is Mrs. Henry Wood's greatest triumph. The reader feels so greatly for Lady Isabel, one wishes the ending were happier for her. The deaths of little William and finally Lady Isabel bring many tears. No wonder it was such a success in the Victorian era and it should be printed again in this time, to counter so much trash and vulgarity that is written.I certainly can believe how successful it must have been when it was first printed in 1861. I also believe anyone who reads it wishes Lady Isabel back in her ex-husband's life and Barbara Hare out! Wonderful!!"},{"Title":"East Lynne","review":"I read the free public domain version of this book.Its strength is its storyline. For modern readers, you may feel its weakness is in the context of its Victorian era, with the way it characterizes the actions, looks, and language of the people in it.Children who say \\"hark\\", women who are constantly turning as pale as their clothes, men who shiver in horror, etc.If you can get beyond this, you will find an enjoyable book with a fairly complex number of main characters with an increasingly twisty plot that solves a murder and at the same time adds a tale of love gone upside down. Mistaken identities, facts, motivations rule the plots.A man is shot inside his house. The apparent murderer says he didn't do it but the one he accuses seems innocent, mostly because he couldn't be placed at the scene. On another front, a man and woman marry and start a family in happy circumstances. Then the man appears to fall for another woman, putting the wife in deep despair. She goes off with another man, later to regret abandoning her husband and children.

But don't let that worry you too much, I didn't realize that until after I read the book, and I don't think it effected the story at all (although who knows what I'd think if I had read the first book). Regardless, it was complete on its own and a decent read.Charley LeBlanc decides to return back to Virginia to the place of his birth. Along with his girlfriend Blackie, they arrive only to find that a beloved person from his past has been found dead and perhaps murdered. Doing some sleuthing of his own, Charley turns up some inconsistencies in the case, the foremost being that a local wild woman named Esmeralda is the main suspect and the murdered woman her only friend. Knowing some other secrets about Esmeralda, Charley knows that she couldn't have committed the crime. But the more evidence he tries to turn up, the deeper in he gets himself.Blackie was probably the best character in this book. Even though I didn't particularly like her, she was well written and her character very complete. She felt as if she could be real and had very real emotions. Charley was ok in comparison. Sure he had his shadows in the past as well, but his personality was all over the place. We were told he was a certain way, only to have him do something against that told nature and it didn't make sense sometimes. And even though he was the main character, I never really felt attached to him in any way. All the side characters had a little bit of depth to them, you knew who the good and bad guys were (for the most part) and they all had their little quirks to them. Even though we never actually meet the dead woman, we known enough about her from the stories from other characters and Charley's remembrances that she actually is one of the better characters in the book.The book started out a little slow at first and I was almost dreading continuing with it. But it did get better and by the end I was glad I had finished it. It may not be the best book I've read in awhile, but it had decently written characters and a unique tone brought on by the dialect of the area. There are some hard themes throughout the book, like murder, rape, violence and of course coarse language. It serves to make the book realistic though and along with the tone of the book, it does seem as if you could be somewhere in Appalachia witnessing everything that has happened. Sure there are some unbelievable aspects (like Esmeralda's story)but even that has some realm of possibility, just a very high odds one. And I was a bit disappointed with the ending, I had expected something quite different than what happened.I would probably go back and read the first book in this series. And even the third one that there seems to be a setup for. It's just nothing that I will be rushing to get my hands on.Wild ThornCopyright 2002293 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"I'm hesitating between 4 and 5 stars but I'll give it five because it's a story and writing style that you don't get enough of nowadays. I'll also give it five because it's obviously not a mainstream book and I'm glad to have picked it up at a used bookstore. It's not a feel good book, not a typical murder mystery, not historical fiction and not a romance novel. Yet, it seems to have a bit of all of those in it. Charley is a guy who is hard to like - yet you do. Yes, his Unabomber lifestyle is a bit troubling, but you get the sense that he knows right from wrong (except for his little...uh...sexual transgression - which some might say only makes him human). The writing is very good - you can picture yourself being in this beautiful yet beaten down area of the country. And, the story will keep you reading. What more do you want from a book?"},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"This is my first book by William Hoffman and I almost did not read it. But I started and when I read his first paragraph, it was written so well that I read on. You could actually feel as if you could see what he was describing. I had not read such in colorful and in-depth narrative on the scenery for quite a while.This book is centered on a Vietnam veteran called Charley LeBlanc who is from a very prominent family. Yet we learn right away that he is the black sheep of the family and has a tough girlfriend he calls Blackie who lost an eye in a bar fight. They both have a criminal background and this helps to form their strong relationship with one another. They live in isolation in Montana when they decide to go visit Aunt Jessie Arbuckle in West Virginia. Though everyone calls her Aunt she is of no relation to anyone in the book. And when they arrive they find here dead under mysteries circumstances.A wild hermit named Esmeralda has been taken into custody because of this suspected murder. The authorities allude both that she is a suspect and also that they have taken her into custody for her own safety. Charley decides he has to do all he can for this poor woman and look into this murder that no one seems to want to talk about. The path he follows takes us on a slightly twisting path. The authors writing conjures up such vivid images that you read on. This is a good book to check out from your library."},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"William Hoffman has been publishing since the 1950s. His protagonist, Charles LeBlanc, is the black sheep of a wealthy family who has fled to Montana and now returned to West Virginia to butt heads with the local sheriff among others. This is the third Hoffman novel I've read and I liked the same protagonist in the earlier books. Hoffman's writing style is also strong and spare, what appeals to me."},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"I just love William Hoffman's work. He writes mysteries that feel real. The plot isn't some intricate conspiracy that has to be unraveled. It's a loose connection of facts that have to be worked and reworked for the protagonist to make progress. One small shred of evidence leads to the next until he builds a case. People lie to him and he sometimes gets distracted, pretty much like the real world.Hoffman has brought back Charley LeBlanc, the flawed but fascinating main character from his Hammett Award winning Tidewater Blood. Charley is a former Viet Nam vet and convict. He definitely has flaws but to me that's what makes him fascinating. I think the best mysteries are the ones where the detective isn't a cop.Hoffman clearly knows the mountains of West Virginia. Whether it's his vivid description of the land and wildlife, his depictions of the people who inhabit the abandoned coal mine towns or the history of the region, you'll feel you've been there when you finish the book."},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"William Hoffman has again written a book replete with strong characters and a complex plot. Hoffman is a genuine southern writer of the old school, with a sense of place imbuing everything that happens, and all that his people think and do. His prose is tight and at the same time graceful, and there are always fine, spare descriptive passages that ask to be reread just to savor the choice of words.While you may not be crazy about some parts of the personality of Charley LeBlanc, you understand him and share his sense that right should be done. There is a lot to right in this story, and Charley's fundamental beliefs are surprisingly sound and surprisingly effective.It would have been nice to see more of attorney Walter Frampton, a recurring Hoffman character, but the addition of Blackie to his cast almost makes up for it. Blackie is Charley's love interest, and gives him the chance to show some extra dimension. The reader leaves them hoping it will all work out for them, long-term, and delighted with the wry humor Hoffman applies to the man-woman relationship."},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"Charley LeBlanc comes from a rich and powerful Tidewater, Virginia family, but that doesn't mean he had an easy life. His father was a drunken abusive person so Charley left home to join the army and served in Vietnam. He was dishonorably discharged and did hard time in Leavenworth. He finally has his act together living with his lover Mildred \\"Blackie' Spurlock in an isolated area of Montana.He and Blackie return to Cliffside in Shawnee County, West Virginia to check up on Aunt Jessie Arbuckle, a woman who befriended him when many others turned their backs on him. He arrives to find Aunt Jessie dead and Esmeralda, a homeless woman who depended on the charity of Shawnee County to feed and clothe her, charged with her murder. Charley knows through the ties that bind him to Esmeralda that the wrong person is locked away and he intends to find the real perpetrator.William Hoffman uses words to convey colorful images in the mind's eye so that the reader senses the environment that the flawed protagonist struggles to adapt to so he can have a peaceful life. Charley is an anti-hero who makes very serious mistakes but is likable because of the tenderness he shows to those few people that he cares about. The story line is beautiful in its simplicity but the author writes about complex people who are put in difficult situations and that makes this novel a fabulous read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wild Thorn","review":"One cannot dispute the writing skills of William Hoffman; he has a stunning sense of character, place and time. Unfortunately, his laconic, laid back style hinders the suspense in this novel. Charley's back (from &quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;), and his character is not one of my favorites. Although he was done wrong in the first book by his own family, his retreat into a fantasy, anchorite's world only makes him irritating. His desire to leave the world behind, live in the wild and avoid people may be idealistic but still unrealistic, too. He's hooked up with Blackie, a woman with a criminal record, and his relationship with her forms a strong foundation for what drives a lot of the story. The mystery surrounding the mysterious death of Aunt Jessie takes a back seat to Charley's own obstinance and lack of perception. His sudden act of infidelity only shows how shallow he can be, and his decision to keep it from Blackie leads to the inevitable dissolution of their relationship. It doesn't take long to figure out the culprits in this one.Although not an exceptional book, Hoffman's skills make it one worth reading; let's hope he picks up the pace in future novels."},{"Title":"Rhyolite: The True Story of a Ghost Town","review":"This is an interesting, well written, rhyming story about the formation and demise of a town in Neveda in 1904 in response to a gold rush.

The exceptional woodcuts by David Frampton evoke the beginning of the 20th century in a Nevada boom town; the coyotes, emblematic of the natural world that cannot be kept at bay by this unnatural town, weave in and out of the story like the haunting refrain of a ballad.Unlike another reviewer, I found the couplets charming, witty, and not tedious at all. The internal rhymes, alliteration and striking similies (rooms/...like open, sunlit tombs) made the story exceedingly memorable."},{"Title":"Rhyolite: The True Story of a Ghost Town","review":"What a beautiful book, both in the rhymes that tell a story and in the woodcuts that capture the remains of the Old West: 1904, to be exact, when two miners struck gold and the boomtown of Rhyolite, Nevada, sprang up. Four years later, 10,000 people with all their accoutrements deserted the town in a matter of weeks. Banks failed, businesses went bust, and the desert began its work . . . as the coyotes sensed it would. This is a book worth reading aloud, worth studying for meaning and illustrations.

Chesterton makes his case clear. Blake's obscurity rivals the alchemists. Both were British. Both, I think, were geniuses. And Chesterton would be the first to admit that Blake's genius was at a level worth writing books about.Chesterton's views about Blake have been neglected for their audacity and controversy, ironic since Blake was neglected for the same reasons. But after having trudged through Blake scholarship for several years, I just ordered this book and read it twice through and marked it up constantly. Chesterton is a show-off with his cleverness, but he's a very good show-off, and he overflows with insight even if he can outrage with his assertions. So you may find this book maddening, or refreshing. But if you can follow his train of thought and precise-but-highly-developed vocabulary, you'll never find it boring. And I found it the most eye-opening of everything I've read on Blake so far, and by far.Chesterton had what one of my students called a \\"healthy dose of common sense\\" and that when you read him \\"you're constantly replying, 'Oh, of course!'\\" Considering that Blake is on the opposite extreme and can confuse his most devoted readers, Chesterton bridges a gap. He also entertains and challenges. So if you care to hear an alternative view, this book is the alternative view worth hearing."},{"Title":"William Blake, (The Popular library of art)","review":"I wish Amazon would let you know if a particular book is a print-on-demand edition; this one is. The body of the text was scanned from an older edition and run through a word-recognition program, never edited by a human eye. You end up trying to figure out what the sentence is actually supposed to be (which is hard with Chesterton's strong but 100-year-old Britishy grammar): when it says \\"riot\\" you should read \\"not,\\" for instance.It's also clear that the \\"real\\" edition of this book was well illustrated. If you want to know what drawings and engravings Chesterton is referring to, the few random images pasted into the middle of the book aren't very helpful. Crack open your other Blake books or fire up Google Image Search for reference.Anyway, the content itself is awesome -- I've never really seen Blake so plainly as I have since reading Chesterton's review of the man and his work. I'm giving this edition four stars, only because there doesn't seem to be a superior edition in print to compare it to."},{"Title":"William Blake, (The Popular library of art)","review":"Well, it's funny, despite it's being a short book, it was too long.It was very much like Mark Twain's joke about the sermon: he was listening to a sermon and thinking this is great, I'm going to give five dollars when the collection plate comes around. After a while, he thinks, well, maybe I'll just give a dollar. The sermon goes on longer. Finally, when the collection plate goes by, Twain steals a dollar out of it.Chesterton starts off brilliantly, illuminating Blake - his poetic/artistic genius as well as his madness, seeming to capture the essence of the man in a few well constructed paragraphs. He had that extraordinary talent of being able to put into words sentiments you have never been quite able to articulate. But then he goes on. Inevitably, we must hear about the Catholic Church. And Western civilization generally. And oddly enough that discussion of where Blake is in relation to all that marginalized him. From that point of view, from a contribution to civilization point of view, Blake is no where. Fortunately, civilization is not a road we are paving with paving blocks consisting of people's life work. So, you may continue to admire him and love him, if you do.It's certainly worth reading. As always, there is as much Chesterton as there is biographical subject. But this can be a relief after all the virtual non-entities who write so much biography and art history, prolific non-entities on all subjects! Still, he always gets tiresome, sooner or later.Years ago I read his book on Dickens, which is superb. I wish that were re-published."},{"Title":"The Asian Mind Game: Unlocking the Hidden Agenda of the Asian Business Culture - A Westerner's Survival Manual","review":"Yes, the book is unsubtle, as some reviewers have complained. And the stereotypes are exaggerated. They're also a bit dated, since the book was written in 1991 -- before China's private economy had blossomed, before Taiwan and Korea had become such important high-tech centers, and before Japan went bust.The book also sensationalizes the degree to which people may be trying to deceive you, and the degree to which this deceit is based on your being a Westerner. Often the deceit, when it happens, is just a cultural way of dealing with embarrassment.But when I was a beginner with Asia, I found this book a helpful eye-opener. I'd never heard of \\"The 36 Stratagems\\", which another reviewer calls tedious (this was before Asian video games based on Chinese military classics became popular here). It turned out that just about all educated East Asian people I met, men and women, knew them to some degree. The book also describes some relevant differences among East Asian cultures - a cure for the usual Western point of view that lumps Japanese, Koreans, Chinese and others all into one \\"Asian\\" category.By now, most of my time in the past 9-10 years has been spent involved with East Asia and East Asian people. This has been at both a business and personal level, including through marriage and working for a Japanese company. From that perspective, I can also say the book's lack of political correctness and its hype about military strategy are kind of virtues.How? On its surface, the book is about Asian-Western interactions. But underneath, the book illustrates a lot about how people from different Asian cultures regard each other, both cross-culturally and intraculturally.Chairman Mao may have used the phrase \\"politically correct\\" from time to time, but in its current form it's a Western concept, and a recent one at that. It's also something that comes easier to the lips than to the heart or mind. My friends from Asian countries are usually more direct -- they often express quite stereotypical (and negative) views about people from neighboring countries, even when they make exceptions for individuals. More than once has some really balanced or sweet person mentioned to me after a pause, \\"But you know, I really can't stand people from X.\\"Business practices and politics often can be pretty manipulative even against colleagues within the same company. (Watch just about any Japanese TV drama about office life, if you don't have a chance to experience the real thing.) And I've run into plenty of East Asian managers and executives who think they're great strategists in the style of the Chinese classics, even though in fact they're about as clumsy as you or I would be.Read this book with a grain of salt.

For 15 years now I have consulted for US companies entering the Japanese market. So naturally I paid close attention to the chapters on Japan. They were very entertaining. They read like the script from a Mr Bad Guy in a 007 movie... Check out the prose, too: &quot;A Japanese samurai worker produces in one day what it takes an American worker two days to produce. To the western world the Japanese stress the importance of free trade because they know that the western worker is no match for the Japanese samurai worker&quot; (p. 125). .. The final section contains precious specific advice such as &quot;respect local culture&quot; and &quot;develop long term objectives&quot;. One of the deepest pieces of timeless advise is that &quot;if you drop your chopstick in Asia it means good luck&quot;.

END"},{"Title":"The Asian Mind Game: Unlocking the Hidden Agenda of the Asian Business Culture - A Westerner's Survival Manual","review":"With books like this purporting to explain Asia and its people, it is little wonder that the average Westerner is still so misinformed on the subject. Contrary to what the title says, she is not &quot;unlocking any hidden agenda&quot;. The fact is, this is well-charted territory, much of which is covered in books millenia-old (Art of War). Another problem with the title is that she is not providing any &quot;survival&quot; advice. She simply shows how Asians operate and negotiate without showing the best way to counter their tactics. Reading this book to learn how to deal with Asians is like studying martial arts to learn how to get beat up. But perhaps the worst quality of the book is the way she imbues each passage with the sense that Westerners shouldn't even bother trying to understand Asia. (Certianly they shouldn't bother learning from her.) In one section she even states explicitly that there are two types of Westerner in Asia -- 1) the Asia-phile who thinks he knows alot but doesn't and 2) the novice who realizes that he knows nothing. But hey, here is the real &quot;secret agenda&quot; of some Asians: when a teacher tells her students that they are still ignorant, the students exalt her as one of the few enlightened ones to whom they can turn. They become dependent on the teacher for her pearls of &quot;wisdom&quot;, each one poisoned with the idea that student is ignorant."},{"Title":"The Asian Mind Game: Unlocking the Hidden Agenda of the Asian Business Culture - A Westerner's Survival Manual","review":"I just got back from China as an English teacher, granted I taught in a small city which automatically gave me the celebrity status, but after reading this book all I can say is I wish I picked this up before I went to China in the first place.For those who want to understand the \\"Art of War\\" and the \\"36 Strategies\\" this is a good book to learn how it applies not only to war and business, but also to other aspects of working in China. It explained many inner workings about how things are done.As for the \\"stereotypes\\", of course they are not 100% true. But it's a good idea to read her views on the Chinese mind set to understand some of the cultural and historical influences that are shaping China of today. Being there, I met many people older than me who still have been influenced by the Cold War and Mao's \\"anti-imperialist\\" propoganda. Many of the youths I met still hate the Japanese with a passion.Of course, I've only read the 1988 publication of the book, so it doesn't factor in many huge changes in Chinese hisotry, such as the reutrn of Hong Kong and Macau to China or even the alliance with the Communist party and the Nationalist party in Taiwan. You will find no references to the 50 year plan of one country, two systems they use to ease Hong Kong and Macau back into Mainland territory.My only problem with this book is that even though she writes about the many cultural problems that Westerners will face going in these countries, she doesn't give many good suggestions as to how to surmount them. To tell you the truth, if I ever go back to China, this book does sometimes make me feel paranoid not knowing who is friend or foe."},{"Title":"The Asian Mind Game: Unlocking the Hidden Agenda of the Asian Business Culture - A Westerner's Survival Manual","review":"I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes.

Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize.

First, don't treat them like they are idiots. A lack of native English does not mean they are stupid. How good is YOUR Chinese, or Korean? Second, understand that they are motivated by many things, JUST LIKE YOU. The key is what do they want - short-term profits in foreign currency? Long term business contacts for down the line when they expand to a foreign branch? Maybe Tech transfer?

Mr. Burrows has written a detailed account of United States Air Force, Navy and CIA airborne electronic and photographic reconnaissance efforts from the end of WWII through the US Navy's P3 incident on Hainan in 2001. The development of specialized aircraft (U-2, SR-71), electronics and camera equipment as well as modification of ordinary aircraft (B-29, B-47, C-130, etc) for reconnaissance missions is covered in sufficient detail to satisfy everyone expect hardcore technical buffs.Besides detailed descriptions of 16 Cold War shootdowns that involved US deaths - many of which did not become widely known until recently - Mr. Burrows presents evidence to support the premise that many crewmen initially survived shootdowns only to be murdered or die in Soviet prisons. There are also many tales of crews that returned with damaged aircraft, and sometimes wounded men, to their home base or after a period of Soviet incarceration. The efforts of families of lost crewmen to find out what happened to their relatives, despite stonewalling by both the US and foreign governments, add a deeply human touch to what would otherwise be a recitation of interesting facts and scary war stories.There are lots of footnotes supporting the events described and a number of photographs of lost aircrews and some of the aircraft they flew. The lack of chronological order throughout the chapters, and frequent flashforwards and flashbacks, make some of the incidents hard to follow or recall. I would also like to see pictures of each major aircraft mentioned and a summary of all the non-fatal shootdown and attack incidents. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"At the beginning of this book, it quotes Teller as saying at least the Cold War did not cost any lives. Burrows points out in this book that the Cold War did cost lives. At least 15 planes were shot down, and close to a hundred Air Force and Navy airmen were killed. The U.S. Government hid the fact that many flights were ferreting radar information and bombing sights in case of offensive nuclear war. The Soviets and Chinese did the same thing, even if their propaganda said otherwise. The real losers in this conflict were the families of those airmen who were lost. The government lied to them to cover their activities.This book was released after the Navy ferret airplane collided with the Chinese jet off Hainen. This incident was also described. However shootdowns of U.S. aircraft took place as far back as 1948. Some of these shootdowns were over international airspace. All participants in this conflict were not innocent. The U.S. needed information and these flights provided them this information. The end of the air duels happened in 1970 when satellites took over the intelligence gathering over sensitive Cold War targets.This is a nice informative read about a little known conflict in the Cold War. I was surprised about the detail the author put into the air clashes. He also told the human story of the losses on the families. A good read."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"&quot;By Any Means Necessary,&quot; William E. Burrows'new book about the men who flew secret reconnaissance missions for the United States along the rim of the Communist Bloc a half century ago, is an all-too-rare and refreshing event. It is fashioned with the care and even-handedness of the historian, to be sure, but it is also rendered with the graceful sentences and humanist instincts of the accomplished journalist. It avoids the impersonal tone and great distance that so many academic historians put between their subjects and the rest of us. It does not paint the Big Picture at the expense of the individuals who were caught up in the Cold War's nastiness. For Burrows, individuals are the story. He goes to great lengths to reveal the names and chronicle the activities of the people we never knew and, using his reportorial resourcefulness, even identifies their Soviet pursuers. Then he swiftly relates what they all went through. It is a great read; a welcome addition tot he literature of military history."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"I am the author, and what I tried to do was write a &quot;people&quot; book, not one strictly about machines and missions. The response by the men who flew all the secret missions with no public recognition, and the widows of some of the more than 130 who never made it back, has been incredible. The vets are deeply gratified that their story has finally been told -- they're buying the book for their grandchildren as a written record of their heroism -- and the widows tell me they finally understand the big picture of what was happening. Very gratifying for me, too. I have made many real friends while researching this incredible story"},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"I find that memories of the Cold War are fast fading, and not even direct experiences of a growing part of our population. This is why it seems now so easy for politicians to \\"rewrite\\" history to their own agendas, including phases such as Vietnam specifically and the Cold War generally. Fewer and fewer know how it even came about--how one of our staunchest Allies agains the Third Reich could so quickly become our primary nemesis in the seeming battle for world domination and influence--or as I was taught--hegemony.Burrows focuses on the brave soldiers who were on the front lines of intelligence gathering. These were the men who \\"accidentally\\" flew over Soviet air space, to get a glimpse of weapons systems, troop movements, and the military-industrial complex of the U.S.S.R. This work is well-documented and fascinating. The great human toll of this work is clear with a section before the endnotes, with names of those deceased in this important work.These silent and shadow missions went on continually, punctuated only by foreign touting of a plane shot down, a flier captured. Such was our fear of \\"re-education\\" that the film the Manchurian Candidate could not be shown for decades, fear that our government might be infiltrated by \\"turned\\" Americans.That was not fantasy, however, for there were plenty of \\"turncoats\\" to go around, as we now know so well---turncoats purchase with easy money and the desire for conspicuous wealth. HOwever, the silent observers of the aerial intelligence war could not dream of such rewards, only of carrying out their duties in the name of freedom. As such, this book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who takes the great conflicts of the 20th century seriously, for they are prologue to the murkier conflicts of the 21st. Will these tactics only be frozen in time, abandoned as surely as the Napoleonic tactics of the early 19th century? The short history of the 21st century, thus far, does not provide the answer. However, as is so often said, those who do not learn from history may be condemned to repeat it. To the extent the post-WWII period truly differed from present day, we can and should learn from it. In that effort, this book provides a truly valuable reference of tactics and tenacity."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"William Burrows' effort here is very successful. The sacrifices made by intelligence gathering personnel, mostly military, in the early stages of the cold war is not well known. The US government went to great pains to insure that being the case. As Burrows recounts, these missions to snoop imperative targeting data, along with the offensive and defensive capabilities of the Soviet Union, China and other potential adversaries, wasn't the cold part of the cold war--it was the dangerous, tedious, frightening and secret part. The bravery and accomplishments of those who served in this manner, living and dying under the prohibitive stress of secrecy, deserves the attention finally coming to light. While Burrows' story is more one of hardware than people, we do get a sense of the personal sacrifice for both those who served and their families. For readers unfamiliar with these operations, Burrows provides an extensive overview. The numbers of aircraft shot down or lost, American captives enslaved and beaten to death without chance of reparation, and the danger in each mission is sobering. These men could reveal none of this to friends or family. We get details of the progression of aircraft and sensor capability that is engaging. Aircraft like the B-50, B-45, B-47, P2V and so on aren't nearly as well known as those types made famous by open combat. As in his This New Ocean, a very good portrayal of the US/Soviet space programs, Burrows makes use of declassified and Russian information. I wonder, however, about the description of the Powers U-2 shoot down. It varies greatly from other accounts. Rather than SAMs launched like bottle rockets and scores of MiGs flailing desperately, we're told this brand-new weapon system fires just three missiles in salvo. Two misfire but the other scores the hit. In addition, only three MiGs scramble. One, an unarmed MiG-19 with a pilot ordered to ram the target, easily climbs to the U-2's altitude, but fails to make visual contact. After Powers is down, two other interceptors reach the area. One turns back low on fuel. Thinking the lone remaining fighter is the U-2, a different SAM site launches a single SA-2 and brings it down. I don't know how a reader can simply accept this account. As thoroughly footnoted as is this book, no footnotes address this episode. To borrow a line from Dr. Strangelove, it sounds like a bunch of Commie bull. (I've always felt, by the way, that the overflight by Powers on May 1, crossing central Russia from Turkey to Norway, was an overt attempt by the CIA to humiliate the Russians that backfired.) The continuing cover up of the fate of American prisoners at the hands of their captors is troubling. A cover up, Burrows states, that is an ongoing joint arrangement for the sake of diplomacy. Burrows confuses the reader from time to time but jumbling the chronology of events (we get the Cuban Missile Crisis before the Powers story, for example). But still its a good, detailed book that I recommend and will probably re-read again some day. For a more first-hand, although less detailed account of cold war air operations, see Paul Lashmar's Spy Flights of the Cold War. Its quite good, too."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"I remember reading stories of Americans, mainly servicemen, who disappeared behind the Iron Curtain following World War II. To the everlasting shame of every single President from Truman to the current occupant of the White House, we have never demanded a full accounting of their fates, not even from so-called \\"Democratic\\" Russia.Burrows story is a sad, despairing one, of brave men who flew their reconnaisance aircraft over hostile, yes, enemy airspace without fighter jet protection, and often encountered Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean MiG fighters. He writes of that very first aircrew shot down over the Baltic in April 1950, roughly two months before the Korean War. Harry Truman, revered by so many, did absolutely nothing about it even though US Navy life rafts, filled with machine gun holes, were seen drifting off the Swedish coasts.When the Korean War broke out, Truman refused to bomb the Chinese Army that massed along the Yalu but continued to send these unarmed planes deep into Chinese and Russian Far East airspace. The pilots who did come back would talk about flying over those eerie mountains and crystal blue lakes of Manchuria and Siberia, always on the lookout for enemy jets, and fearfully knowing that if met, they didn't stand a chance. Even if the planes were close to Japanese airspace that didn't stop the Soviets from blasting them out of the sky. One such flight was blasted out of the sky in 1952, just off the coast of Northern Japan. But instead of U.S. jets scrambling to help the crew, or U.S. Navy ships at full speed trying to rescue them - there were destroyers of the Soviet navy on-hand. Some of the American airmen seen parachuting into the sea were believed to have been picked up by these Russian ships, never to be seen again.Most of these flights ended with the advent of satellites and the downing of Gary Powers' U-2 in May 1960. But Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon (although he did try to get a full accounting of missing U.S. personnel in Vietnam), Ford, Carter, Reagan, and even Bush and Clinton after the Soviet empire finally collapsed never even bothered to get a full accounting of what happened to these men. Only after former Soviet officers presented the widows, sons and daughters with personal items of men shot down off the Soviet coast did some word of these secret missions and the fate of these men come out - and not for all.When a \\"friend\\" of the United States like Boris Yeltsin can rewarded a savage American traitor and Fascist like the late spy Morris Cohen with the Hero of Russia award, then it is time that we press our elected officials to demand a full accounting - and if any might still be alive a release of these American servicemen who gave their all for this country. Otherwise, what are we doing rescuing their sailors?"},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"Bottom Line - This is an excellent book. Buy it, read it, give it to a friend.If you are in the business of Intelligence, you owe it to those who preceded you to hear their story. This book should be required reading for every prospective intelligence officer. It lets you know what the standard is.If you are an American who values your freedom, you should read this to understand what the price of that freedom is. In these days when people openly talk about and debate the value of the billions spend on intelligence it is even more important to know what the non dollar cost is and what all of those billions buys us.Most of the players in the decades long game with the Soviets and Chinese were never talked about in the glowing terms of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" yet they sacrificed as much if not more than those before them. Their battle was unknown to the outside world and often even to them. Their families were denied any comfort that is gained from explanation and recognition. Because the war was \\"Cold\\" few knew or admitted that lives were being lost. Burrows provides long overdue recognition for their sacrifice.A cannot recomend enought buying this book."},{"Title":"By Any Means Necessary : America's Secret Air War in the Cold War","review":"At the end of World War II we found ourselves faced with a new enemy, the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, we knew little about them and they made every effort to close their borders. When Russia obtained nuclear weapons, America and Russia scrambled to create strategic forces to assure annihilation of their enemy if they should be so stupid as to attack The Strategic Air Command (SAC) was formed for America's deterrent force (the first leg of the triad which later included land based ICBMs and Navy ballistic missile submarines). But SAC was faced with a real problem: what and where are the targets? We knew where the major cities were, but we did not want to attack the civilian population. Thus America began a series of bold incursions into Russia to find strategic targets. The British also contributed with some daring flights over Russia and Eastern Europe. The early spy planes were converted World War II prop driven relics that were easy prey for Mig-15 and Mig-17 fighters and several were lost with their crews. America replaced the aging prop planes with Boeing's RB-47, Martin's RB-57 and the famous U-2. Several of these planes were shot down, some over international waters. The spy missions later expanded to include radar mapping and gathering of electronic intelligence. We needed to know where radar sites were and what frequencies they were operating at in order for out bombers to penetrate. Many missions were also carried out against North Korea and China. Intelligence gathering flights continue today, but satellites now do much of the job. The most recent incident is the collision of a Navy intelligence plane and a Chinese fighter in early 2001. The author also covers the distress of the families of the missing men and the Governments continued veil of secrecy surrounding the loss of aircraft and crew. I had no idea that we had lost dozens of aircraft and hundreds of crewmen.

And any scene with Old Whibley the owl fills me with pleasure -- sometimes, I sneak the book off the shelf after Morris is asleep just to reread a choice passage. The books are dated in some ways -- though not THAT much, and some of it adds color (a scrap-iron drive for the war effort is a major subplot of this one).

The snooty Mrs. Underdunk has foreclosed on Mr. Dimsey and installed her nephew Mr. Garble in his place. Needless to say, Mr. Garble does not like animals. He likes them even less when the enterprising Freddy collaborates with Mr. Dimsey to start up the Bean Home News. In no time at all Freddy has captured a large readership and Mr. Garble is losing business. When Mrs. Underdunk runs into Freddy on the sidewalk, and claims pig violence, war is declared. The two newspapers start making allegations about the opponents and the stage is set for a political struggle that is more than faintly reminiscent of today's campaigns.This high flown adventure story has Freddy hiding in jail to avoid being arrested, Hank the horse disguised as a deer on Mrs' Underdunk's lawn, and a newspaper where the chief society reporter is a chicken. Plus, we are treated to the regular antics of the Bean Farm crew. As usual Mrs. Wiggens the Cow laughs too much. Charles the Rooster gets so good at pretending he had a cold that he actually catches one and loses a chance to make a speech. Jinx the cat collects iron by singing for it, and Old Whibley the owl wins a court case and engineers a revolution.This is one of Walter Brooks best plots. It is well paced and cannot fail to keep up the reader's interest right to the end. Kurt Weise's illustrations are numerous and perfect. As is often in the case, the lesson being taught is &quot;have fun, care for your country, have fun, support your friends, have fun, stand up for what's right.&quot; Did I forget to mention &quot;have fun?&quot; I think I like the Freddy the Pig books now more than I did as a child. Then, innocence kept the lessons from being as meaningful as they are to me as an adult. Now they are treasures."},{"Title":"Freddy and the Bean Home News","review":"This is one of the really great Freddy books, ocurring in the middle of Brooks' career. Written during the Second World War, there are mentions of rationing and scrap iron drives, but most children won't find these a distraction. This seems to be the first appearance of Freddy's nemesis, Herbert Garble, and there are the usual --unpreachy-- lessons, such as not to take onesself too seriously, and plenty of excitement. This is one of the many Freddy books that adults will enjoy as well. Gives one a great excuse to read to your child."},{"Title":"Freddy and the Bean Home News","review":"This is the tenth book in the Freddy the Pig series, and it is classic Walter Brooks, fun and insightful. Two animal adventures are interwoven in this book. One is, of course, the start-up of the barnyard newspaper, and the other is a scrap metal drive. The scrap drive puts into perspective the time line for the book; the metal will be \\"shipped off to make guns and ships to help our fighting men win the war.\\" The publication date was 1943. In the process, the young mind will learn that spinach is good for you, that only bad people throw stones at animals, and that the Constitution guarantees \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" [Actually, that was the Declaration of Independence, but let's forgive Brooks for this slight confusion.] We also learn that an editor must have clean windows, \\"so he knows what's going on in the outside world.\\" One interesting thing I noticed in this book for the first time is that the animals always speak very educated English, whereas several of the human characters use bad English, as when one of the bad guys says \\"watch out he don't slip past you.\\" And I smiled to learn that the Centerboro jail has a music room."},{"Title":"Freddy and the Bean Home News","review":"My almost six year old is a big fan of Freddy books. He likes me to read them to him as his bedtime story. I love that the language is slightly challenging, so he has been learning lots of new words. There are a couple themes that are a bit too strong for us, so I skipped a few sentences (like threatening to shoot Freddy and other animals). However, with those exceptions this is a great story. Love the book, love the message, and love the ending.This story is a great way to introduce children to the complicated world of politics (especially since we are heading into a heavy political season), but in a kid friendly way that will allow lots of discussion between parents and children.Wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Freddy and the Bean Home News","review":"Walter Brooks stories are fun to read and usually have a great moral or lesson. The bean home news discusses the trials and tribulations of a news reporter. This book discusses the importance of getting your facts straight as well as the consequences if you don't. It emphasizes sharing the truth even when there are some who will go to great lengths to hide it. This book shares the lessons of journalism in a fun and delightful way. The animals on the farm that are the characters in the story will remind you of characters in your own life. It is a fun, light, engaging story."},{"Title":"Mary Kay","review":"If you are looking for a book to inspire you and help you to set your priorities for life, this is the book for you.

I read the book in no time and couldn't wait to get back to it if I had to put it down even momentarily.However, I would give it 4.5 stars because the relationship seemed rushed in a few spots. ** Possible spoilers: It really needed more build-up of the couple's attraction to one another because their relationship seemed to go from \\"Hey, I'm attracted to you\\" to \\"Let's get married\\" with very little in between except one weekend. I know they were supposed to have been friends at work, but I just felt something was missing there. I understand this to have originally been a Harlequin publication, so the abbreviated length probably accounts for this lack since it's not something I've noticed in Ms. Thompson's longer novels.

I make this comment because my own daughter, age 26, was suddenly &quot;locked-in&quot; two years ago due to a stroke from birth control pills. Her condition mirrors the author's. I used his spelling method and shocked the doctors with her communication abilities. (They had told me she was vegetative.) Bauby's little book has changed our lives. I was deeply saddened by his death from a heart attack. He was beginning to do a great wonder for the unfortunate people with this rare syndrome by starting a newsletter and being the subject of a documentary. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a clever account of what it's like to be locked-in and a combination of some personal slices of life which ironically relate to the author's terrifying condition."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"In December of 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, 43 year old editor in chief of Elle magazine in France, suffered a stroke which severely damaged his brain stem. After several weeks in a coma, he woke to find that he was one of the rare victims of a condition called &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot; or LIS, which had left his mind functioning but his body almost completely paralyzed. In a perverse sense he actually got fairly lucky because, unlike most victims, he was still able to move one eyelid. This allowed him to work out, with a speech therapist, a system of communication which entailed winking as someone slowly read through the alphabet. By using this code, he could painstakingly spell out words, sentences, paragraphs and, finally, this memoir.The title of the book refers to the metaphors he uses to describe his situation. The physical paralysis leaves him feeling as if he was trapped within a diving bell, as if there is constant pressure pinning his body into immobility. However, at the same time, his mind remains as free as a butterfly and it's flights are as random. In fact, he calls the chapters of this book his &quot;bedridden travel notes&quot; and, indeed, they eloquently relate his journey through memory.Although Bauby's situation is obviously unique, this book has universal resonance because his condition is itself an apt metaphor for the human condition. It is the essence of Man's dilemma that our infinitely perfectible minds are trapped within such weak containers of flesh and blood. For most of us, at most times, this frustrating dichotomy, between that which makes us godlike and that which makes us mortal, lurks in the background; but the author has it thrust rudely into the foreground, where it necessarily dominates his existence. This makes it all the more remarkable that Bauby is able to &quot;write&quot; about his life with such great humor and generosity of spirit and with so little bitterness.Public opinion surveys reveal an interesting contrast in modern opinions on the &quot;right to die.&quot; Contrary to the accepted wisdom, the so-called right is favored by those who are young and healthy, but opposed by those who are old and sick. The very premise which underlies such a right is the belief that the quality of life experienced by the aged and the ill is so inadequate that they would willingly choose death instead. In fact, the evidence suggests that--despite the anecdotal horror stories with which all of us are familiar--people generally cling to life even in the face of suffering which seems unendurable to the well.Bauby's book, for all the horror that we naturally feel at his status, is wonderfully optimistic and life affirming. Sure, there are a few moments of well earned self pity, but they are almost completely drowned out by the author's enduring hopes and dreams and memories. Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after this book was published, but in it's pages, he left behind one of the great testament's to the splendor and majesty of the human spirit. In these times when people tend to complain about the pettiest matters, he reminds us that even when life is genuinely difficult, it is still quite beautiful and invaluable and well worth living.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby was a vigorous man of 43 when he suddenly had a massive stroke that left him in a coma for twenty days. When he awoke, Bauby found himself a victim of \\"locked-in syndrome,\\" a state of paralysis in which a person's mind functions while his body is frozen.Bauby was the father of two young children and the editor-in-chief of a major magazine. He had traveled extensively and was blessed with many friends. After the stroke, his active and exciting life was no more. As a quadriplegic, Bauby had to be bathed, fed by a gastric tube, and moved by nurses and attendants. He could not speak at all. What was there left to live for?It turns out that Bauby's mind provided him with the spiritual and emotional fuel to keep him from falling into despair. He did not become bitter or cantankerous, and he never lost his humor, imagination, or the wonderful memories that he cherished. Finally, he began to compose this book in his head, and through a system in which blinks of an eye indicated letters of the alphabet, he \\"dictated\\" this book to his secretary.\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is witty, lyrical, and poignant. Bauby notes that since he could no longer eat in the normal way, he had to dine in his head, imagining himself enjoying beef bourguignon, apricot pie, or even a simple soft-boiled egg. Since he could not speak to his ninety-three year old father, Jean-Dominique's father called him on the phone and spoke to him. When he was finally able to sit in a wheelchair, Bauby was taken to the sea where he admired the colorful umbrellas, the beautiful seascape, and the lovely sailboats. He was destined to live the remainder of his life one step removed from reality, but, in his mind, this was better than not living life at all. Jean-Dominique Bauby lived to see his book published before he died in 1997. \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is an inspiring testament to the indomitable spirit of a very remarkable man."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Wow. This book is beautiful and haunting. You begin the book with the knowledge of Mssr. Bauby's fate. He proceeds to share with us his eloquent and striking observations post-accident. This book is beautifully and concisely written - it's as tight as a drum - and that is a testament more to Bauby's journalistic talents than his impaired condition. An intellectual with a love for opera, music, writing, and food, he comes to life in these pages despite the brevity of the book. We get a decent sense of him prior to his stroke: a man with a full appetite for life. At times, I had to suck in my breath and set the book down to pause, it was so profoundly heartbreaking. He shares with us his deepest, raw thoughts about his daily life, his former lifestyle, his children, the blessings he misses and the pleasures he now looks forward to, as well as the torment he cannot control. A key point, I think, is that throughout the book he sprinkles his persistent sense of humor, and a feeling of hope. It's amazing considering that he is experiencing something we all agree is our worst nightmare. There is no bitterness on these pages, it's more of an honest wistfulness. Like when he says he would have cheerfully killed one of his caretakers for the neglect he suffered at his hands. I will never forget the irony of the photograph from his childhood sent to him by his father; the description of his last day of normal life; the story of Mithra-Grandchamp; the bleakness of his Sundays and how they lend perspective to his other days (and ours); and his trip to smell the French fries. The meaningfulness and importance of the small, everyday events, abilities, and choices we make are cast in a new light after reading this book. But the experience is like having someone open you up and rip out your heart, such is the sympathy we feel for Bauby. In fact, I will likely be haunted by his descriptions of life, both breathtakingly beautiful and immensely sad. What a man. What a book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"That's the one word that came to mind after reading Jean-Dominique Bauby's, emotionally uplifting memoir. At the age of forty three he suffered a massive stroke that led to his paralysis, a victim of &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot;. That is he was perfectly cognizant, but unable to move any part of his body except his left eyelid. Two days after the book was published in France, he died.The book is truly a testament to the human spirit, and the healing powers of the mind. Far from being a &quot;woe-is-me&quot; feel sorry for myself biography, Bauby rises above that to embrace the life he remembers. A life that sometimes took for granted the simplist of tasks such as shaving, eating, or merely forming a word.Obviously no one lives their life aware of every minute detail as it passes by (except maybe poets), and in fact it's not until something's taken away that we really appreciate it. However, Bauby's book made me grateful and appreciate what I have, and even if just for a little while forget about what I don't."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I have cared for several &quot;locked-in&quot; patients in my career. I have only barely imagined the inner life of these poor unfortunates. I was fascinated by the author's observations of the medical staff at his hospital, and I can clearly see that they are authentic. Sensitive staff members can feel his pain. Others are detached and even uncaring.What is remarkable about this man is the life he was capable both before and during his illness. His strength, his humor, and his insight. His book gives us an insight not only into his particular illness, but into the isolation of any serious illness. He describes the fears and frustrations, the loneliness, and the need for inner strength.I haver recommended this book to all the neurologists I know, and to patients and hospital staff. I feel this book teaches us about being human. You cannot but gain by reading it."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (New York, 1997: Knopf) probes the delicate, sometimes permeable, line between a meaningful life and the meaning of life. Author Jean-Dominique Bauby, whose brain survived a cerebrovascular accident--a massive stroke--dictates the story to his amanuensis six months after the catastrophe.In the blink of an eye, he lost the life he knew and loved; in thousands of blinks of his left eye-the only part of his body that still functions normally-he reclaims the beauty of his life and of life itself. By blinking, Bauby indicates the letters that make up the words that make up the story that describes the meaning of a meaningful life.Bauby communicates in this way because he suffers from locked-in syndrome, the result of a rare stroke to the brainstem. After 20 days in a coma following the stroke, Bauby awoke to find that his rich mind, his wit, and his passion for life survived intact inside an immobilized body-a diving bell or carcass, by his own account.He is fed by a feeding tube and lives at the mercy of the hospital staff and the attention of loved ones and friends who make their way to Berck, a seaside town disconnected from the highway system to Paris.He is isolated in many ways, but he knows how to isolate himself even further. When his emotions overcome him, he can disguise the tears that flow as a mere watering of the eye. On one day, a small reminder of his life before the stroke can bring him to tears, but on another, he could laugh at it. His emotions are as distorted as his perceptions sometimes. The mere scrape of a shoe on the floor in the corridor can be deafening to him, but who can know that? The sight of his disfigured face reflected in window glass can horrify him, but who can know that? The indignity of being jostled about like a side-show freak for a quick sponge batch can depress him, but who can know that?The editor-turned-author introduces the reader to his passion for life early in the book when he describes each new day: \\"My diving bell becomes less oppressive, and my mind takes flight like a butterfly. There is so much to do. You can wander off in space or in time, set off for Tierra del Fuego, or for King Midas Court.\\"Bauby,44, had been the well-traveled editor-in-chief of the French edition of the international fashion magazine Elle when he suffered the stroke in December 1995. More than that, he had been the father of a 10-year-old Theophile and 8-year-old Celeste, the connoisseur of fine food and high-end automobiles, the son of an adoring elderly father.For all that, though, much of Bauby's story--what he calls \\"bedridden travel notes\\"--reminds the reader that ordinary things make life meaningful: loved ones' patient attendance to our needs, the respect of the people around us, a change of scenery now and again, a trip to the beach, the opportunity to read a good book, the smell of French Fries. Life is in many ways an illusion--or a sequence of illusions.The Diving Bell is a sequence of 28 vignettes that capture Bauby's frustration with his condition and weave in details of his life before the stroke. He was about to have a \\"man-to-man\\" talk with Theophile about his moving out of the family home, to help the child understand the brokenness of their familylife, but then he suffered the stroke. In this moment Bauby brings the reader face-to-face with the unfinished business of his life--unresolved hurts, misunderstandings, confusion, dreams. reflections, memories. He is aware these things will stay in the amber with him.The reader sees, too, that life is in the hospital, the wheelchair, and nowhere else, as Bauby points out in the final chapter. There is no indication of the lithe, dark-haired woman's being present in his life, though she occupies pride of place in the prologue. There is the hope, though, that friends returning from vacation will return to him with stories or send him letters. That his place in the world he knew is somehow still there. He holds onto that hope despite his awareness that his life is now the hospital and the strangers who work there and who may or may not attend to his needs depending on the degree to which his condition makes them uncomfortable.This is perhaps one of the hardest truths of his experience, a truth that drives home the agony of his achievement with the speech therapist--his ability to grunt out the lines of a nonsense rhyme about a kangaroo. A miracle on one level, yes. On another, it is absurd, struggling to say words that bear no relationship to the truth of a complex and beautiful soul.Bauby died two days after the French publication of The Diving Bell in 1997. Perhaps there was no more to say."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I compare this book, in terms of what it took to write it (memorizing entire texts and then blinking the individual letters out, with each letter taking 2 minutes) to great physical achievements (the Tour de France, Navy Seal training, climbing Everest, etc.). What an accomplishment ! The moral courage of this author, and the honesty is searing. One of the things I took away from this book is that no situation is hopeless. Also: moments count. The imagination is key. There were small moments, like the man turning off the soccer game, and Bauby not being able to tell him he wanted to still watch it, which really drove me to tears. These are moments in life that are human moments. One \\"take-away\\" (I hate that word because it sounds like management-speak) is that each moment, we can choose to treat others well or poorly. Each moment counts. We can take small \\"vacations\\" in our own minds. In one sense, we are all condemned to live in this \\"diving bell\\" we call a body. As in Platonic philosophy, our soul (the butterfly) is locked in this shell. It is the ghost in the machine. We all can relate to Bauby because we are all human and have the experience of being locked into our (aging, frail) bodies, to a larger or lesser extent. There are multiple lessons in this book. Another lesson is how short life is. There is a sentence in the book that really drove me to tears because it is so sad, but also tells us so much what life is about and how little time we have. The author was talking about a horse that was being bet on. The line goes like this: \\"the horse represents all the women we never loved, all the risks we will never take\\". Wow. That hit me like a two-by-four.I will re-read this book many times. I will take it with me on my journey, in my own \\"diving bell\\". Bauby will live on forever."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This memoir is a tale of charm, wit, and beauty. The passions expressed were poignant, with the author's mind reliving his past in order to contain his sanity in the present. His descriptives were superb - his strength inspiring. To have the world in the palm of your hand on one day and the next day, you are virtually a prisoner, locked inside your own body. His despair was masked with humor and wit and never once did he feel sorry for himself to the point of anguish. Would I have been as courageous as he in the same situation?This is quick read, divided into numerous chapters, each a little tale in its own. You will laugh and you will cry - to realize that life as you know it can be taken from you in a heartbeat and you will be forever changed. His beauty expresses itself through his prose as the reader can see his mind is totally intact, alas, it is his body that binds him. One's compassion is elevated as his sensitivity shines though as well, masking the sadness of the knowledge of death slowly making its way to his door.An excellent book that will tug at your heart. It will also heighten your sensitivity to the fact that despite his disabilities, he still needed the comfort and love of friends and family. The realization that some &quot;friends&quot; could not accept his condition and chose not to visit touched me deeply. He needed love around him more than ever."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"A little mini-book from Knopf by the editor of Elle magazine who became a victim of the &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot; after a stroke left him paralyzed except for one eye. You can read it in an hour and yet you might be transformed. This is Johnny Got His Gun for real. Touchingly and beautifully rendered if you can stand it, the poor guy just lying there unable to even scratch an itch...And yet, and yet, he wrote this book. Of course it is heroic, and of course he does not invite pity or tell his tale to seem heroic. Rather Bauby just wants us to know what it's like being in his position. Since this is who he has become, this is his job, to inform us. He's still working. He's still got something to give to this world.What we can gain from this is a realization that there are all sorts of levels of existence, and who are we to complain?Beautifully translated from the French by Jeremy Leggatt."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This book moved me so deeply that I actually feel that my life may be more complete for having read it."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This book was inspiring and stimulating.

If someonehad only known to equip him with an eye-operated computer ! If he lived, he might conceivably have joined us on the internet.Lack of assistive devices do not diminish his achievement.

The book itself, as well as its matter, is both heroic and discomfiting -- and it's written with a grace and an understanding that will make you change your life"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I wrote a glowing review of this book a few years back,so I hope the full text of that is still buried in here somewhere.However,I'd like to add one more thing:how sad I find it that Mr.Igoe can call Mr.Bauby's book the work \\"of an ugly mind\\".My viewpoint of Mr. Bauby was just the opposite-that his was truly a voice of great beauty,complexity,courage & humour.Yes,to be sure he was a deeply flawed man-(aren't we all?)at the time of his stroke he was separated from his wife,had a somewhat laissez-faire attitude to his girlfriend,exhibited a deeply hedonistic streak,& scattered through his prose are touches of a certain dismissive Gallic arrogance towards those who irritate him.But the point is,in spite of these deeply human frailties,Bauby acquits himself more than honorably in the wake of the catastrophic stroke that would leave him locked inside his frozen corpus.That he could in fact,create an inner life of Imagination,of Art,of Memory,and still contribute to an outside world(through his newsletter and Foundation) that had largely forgotten him after his fall from grace is testament to the potential and potency of every spirit.Bauby's flaws become even more poignant as his situation forces him to evaluate what really matters in the making of A Life.As butterflies undergo metamorphosis while in a cocoon,so did Bauby's plodding caterpillar of a character metamorphose and transcend the imposed limits of his own prison.I would add that this unflattering picture is painted by Bauby himself: at no times does he try to sugarcoat his own failings.And when your work has been dictated through nothing but blinks,I imagines a certain amount of niceties of structure go out the window.I can only guess that Mr. Igoe's barrier to seeing the beauty of Bauby's soul is largely a cultural one.To be sure,it is hard to imagine an Englishman writing in such a curt fashion,and I'm sure in some parts French original loses something in English translation.Are we so used to many so-called 'heroes' in popular culture being so thoroughly sanitized & semi-deified in their presentation in order to 'inspire' us,(from the puffery of Tom Cruise to Dickie Attenborough's OTT,yet oddly colorless portrait of Gandhi) we have no desire to hear a message from a fractured mortal like Bauby?In doing so we forget the real miracle of heroism is that it usually springs not from saints or supermen but from quite ordinary folk with bellies & bad tempers,men who at the end of the day took a painful journey to overcome their failings in order to understand the true essence of being a Human Being.Bauby is one such Broken Angel.His book is one of the few to have a profound effect on my life and I am indebted to him for it.Having read both the book and seen the documentary,I see a film has been made to great critical acclaim.Apparently it is quite faithful to the source.My sincere hope is that those who failed to connect with the message of the book will be persuaded when its many beautiful images are presented visually on screen.As the book enriched and shook my world,I wish the same experience for them."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"At the age of 43, Jean-Dominique Bauby (former editor-in-chief of the French magazine &quot;Elle&quot;) suffered a massive stroke that left him almost completely paralyzed. His mind, however, remained intact. A victim of &quot;locked-in syndrome,&quot; the only part of his body that he could still move was his left eyelid. Unable to communicate in any other way, he and his therapists devised a system whereby Bauby could blink out what he wanted to say, letter by letter. In this way, he managed to compose his memoir, with his speech therapist carefully transcribing Bauby's coded blinks. The book was published just two days before Bauby's death in 1996.I became aware of this book when I learned that Johnny Depp will star in a movie of &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; in 2006 (playing Bauby himself). Intrigued, I decided to read up beforehand. What I discovered was a poignant and inspirational expression of a man with an incredibly strong spirit. Though he expresses frustration and sadness at his condition, Bauby does not wallow in the trap of self-pity. His observations of the world are sharpened and given new perspective as he is forced to deal with paralysis. Bauby is even able to look at elements of his predicament with a wry sense of humor, as in the time a nurse woke him up to ask if he wanted a sleeping pill.The book is not written as a linear story - in fact, we don't read about the day of Bauby's stroke until near the end - but rather it is a collection of vignettes. In some he offers insights and observations of his daily life in the hospital. In others he reflects on various memories, with both fondness and, at times, regret for missed opportunities. And in still other chapters he shares with us the dreams he has had since his stroke. He also reflects on his last day as a normally functioning person, and on some of the plans he had in his life before - plans that he never got to fulfill. Bauby has dedicated the book to his children, and it is clear that he misses being a regular father.&quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; is a very easy read, and well worth the time. It is only 132 pages in length, but I can't help imagining just how tedious it must have been for Bauby to blink out even one page, let alone over one hundred. That, and the amazingly beautiful, fluent language in which the book is written has given me an overwhelming respect for this remarkable man. We have here a window into a soul that refused to die, even while trapped within a body that could no longer move. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone, as it sparks in the reader a more complete awareness of the world and a fuller appreciation for the little things in life."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This is a most powerful, beautiful book that will affect your perception of life, of your life and of the phenomenon of death. This true story touches on many day to day issues and emotions from a new perspective and through its reading we are reminded that life is for living. Seriously. This is not a miserable self-pitying book about death, but an uplifting read-in-one type of book. You feel for the man and his dreadful predicament and you rejoice in your own relative well being.

You are lucky, it is less costly at Amazon.com. I still am glad I own this book. At twice the price, it's worth it. I loaned it out to book club friends and they raved: Bravo!

The book describes his experiences of going from a high-powered editor of an international fashion magazine, living what seems was a charmed and glamourous life to being paralalyzed vegetable. Its an insightful look at just how life can change in the blink of an eye. The author dictated the book using a series of twitches and blinking his left eye as a form of communication. Its a quick read and the author spares you of self pity or self defeat. He speaks rather matter-of-factly about what he lost, yet still trying to make the best of his situation. I think this book is a great, quick read."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I have only come across this book recently,June 2009. I stumbled onto it by what I feel to be only described as divine intervention as my husband has recently passed from MSA (Multiple System Atrophy), a rare neurological disorder. Similarly to Monsieur Bauby, my late husband, James, lost his mobility, was unable to communicate except with his eyes and needed complete care. We did have a short period where he could talk and swallow with a PMV (Passy-Muir Tracheostomy Valve). However, it was all too short lived as the disease progressed and ultimately, as expected would silence him completely. Similarly, to Monsieur Bauby my husband passed away due to complications breathing. He was bedridden and it was sudden. We tried to live everyday as if it was his last and when the end came there was such a peace for him, myself and the family. The suffering was over and now only the memories of our journey remain. The book (and movie) helped me to feel a stronger sense of acceptance and to realize that no matter what occurs to the flesh, the brain and spirit are the stronger as long as the will to live exists as well. Such was the case with Monsieur Bauby and my husband, James. It was so wonderful for me to discover Monsieur Bauby's Memoir by chance or as I like to believe, by \\"divine intervention\\" and to discover that there was another man, a kindred spirit of sorts, who fought a battle similar to my husband. I know one thing for sure now--as long as we have a sense of gratitude, acceptance and love--in any battle, especially the fight to live, we will win and the journey is worth it. Things will come full circle. God Speed or as the Universe so orders it. I pray every day for a cure to all neurological disorders and again am eternally grateful to have read Monsieur Bauby's Memoir as it truly helped restore and reassure my belief, that despite our struggles to live with a progressive neurological disorder, my husband, was always \\"present\\" and will live on in those whose lives he touched before and after he was stricken. His journey, like Monsieur Bauby's was significant and I was blessed to have him as my husband. Thank you for allowing me to review this book here and to share my personal experience. It is my hope that perhaps it will reach someone like me, someone in mourning and/or caregivers dealing with people who have neurological disorders and/or any chronic, progressive disorder. Rest in peace my beloved. You are not alone. Rest in Peace. Always yours.

This is one mans story; his triumph of spirit and his courage despite all odds. That a man in his prime, powerful and respected, could be brought so low by a rare condition known as locked-in syndrome; it is almost to horrible to contemplate. This story is a quick read and has a distinct, flowing plot. I was really fascinated by Jean's indomitable spirit and his sardonic wit. There were many times when I smiled at Jean's comments and thoughts, delighting in his zest for life while in a near vegetative state. The beautiful writing was so vivid and detailed that I could almost see through his one, good eye. His absolute determination, to share his story with the world leaves us forever in his debt.

At age 43 he was the editor of Elle magazine, cynical, and a stranger to failure. Then he had a massive stroke that left him in a coma for three weeks. When he awoke, he suffered from a rare neurological disorder called \\"locked in syndrome.\\" He could hear a little and his brain worked fine, but he was totally paralyzed and couldn't speak. He could blink with his left eye. With his one good eye Bauby dictated this remarkable memoir, letter by letter, to his amanuensis. A speech therapist devised a chart with the letters of the alphabet arranged by frequency of use. As she spoke the letters Bauby would blink for the letter he wanted. Though locked in the heavy \\"diving bell\\" of his useless body, Bauby's imagination soared as playfully as \\"the butterflies that flutter inside my head.\\"Bauby's book consists of what he calls his \\"bedridden travel notes.\\" He lost sixty-six pounds in twenty weeks. When a fly landed on his nose, he wiggled his nose to no avail, only to conclude that \\"Olympic wrestling is child's play compared to this.\\" Taking a bath sometimes brought elation and at other times depression. Sundays were the worst, when hospital staff and visitors were at a minimum. Bauby relates some of his dreams, memories like a trip to Lourdes and the last time that he saw his father, and cherished visits from his daughter Celeste, age eight, and son Theophile, age ten. His description of their visit to the beach on Father's Day is wrenching: \\"Grief surges over me. . . There are no words to express it. My condition is monstrous, iniquitous, revolting, horrible. Suddenly I can take no more. Tears well and my throat emits a hoarse rattle that startles Theophile. Don't be scared, little man. I love you.\\"Bauby's public updates, and eventually this book, belied the rumors swirling around Paris that the famous editor was \\"only a vegetable.\\" Mail poured in to him and he hoarded the letters like little treasures. In 2007 a film by the same title told his story, earning four Academy Award nominations. Bauby died in 1997 just days after the publication of his book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This is a wonderful book. Very quick read.

Then, along comes The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Our protagonist, Frenchman Jean-Dominique Bauby, 43, was in the prime of life, editor of Elle, with a sports car, three adoring children, a mistress, and the world by the proverbial tail. In one instant, he suffers a stroke and is submerged in a world where he can understand but not communicate, a victim of \\"locked-in syndrome\\" -- as the author states, \\"a hellish trap as likely as being caught in as winning the lottery.\\"He says he would be the happiest man if all he could do was swallow. But he can't.So -- with an active mind that is disconnected from his entire bodily function with the exception that he can blink his left eye -- what does he do? He honors his contract to write a book the only way he can.By blinking his left eye.A translator painstakingly repeats letters of the alphabet in order of most frequent use. When the letter he wants comes up, Jean-Do blinks. And so goes the \\"dictation.\\" And so through this tiny, pinprick-sized hole, his imagination can pour forth -- one letter at a time. his essays on life in the hospital in his new condition, imaginings of his children, gourmet food, events of his past life. Regarding the latter, forever gone in physical reality, but persistently alive in his spirit.This story is all at once horrifying, uplifting, numbing, life affirming. And finally, heroic. Bauby died just 10 days after his book was published -- it was his mission to communicate, to affirm life itself, that kept him going.Made into a film by artist and now director Julian Schnabel. Not for the squeamish, but also, not to miss."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Although the author had been an editor in his previous life, not all editors can write a thoughtful,well written expose on life in the diving bell(he uses this symbolism to express what his life has become after a stroke left him only able to blink his eye).The book is an unbelievably joyous romp through his trials and tribulations since life dealt him a heavy blow. He does not want sympathy just your attention as you constantly wait for him to break down, which he doesn't do.This book was an odd choice for me but one that I'm finding I have no trouble recommending.

Great book that shows you the otherside of a wall in which nobody has ever crossed.

It is the story of a neurologically handicapped boy who turns to writing once he is given the correct medication, to allow himself to touch the keys of a typewriter with a stick.The difference for me in the two memoirs is that Bauby was a good wrtiter but Nolan is a gifted writer. Nolan was able to keep inside himself, prior to his release post medication, an enormous wealth of lyrical prose. Nolan is Irish and the text is truely musical in quality. The boy's upbringing is remarkable and his family is likewise admirable and courageous.Nolan's book is one of the best books I have ever read. The musical quality of the text is similar to Cry the Beloved Country by Patton. Other books that deal with neurologically impaired but gifted people are An Anthropologist on Mars and The Man who MIstook his Hat for his wife, by OLiver Sachs."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I was recommended this book by my English teacher, who found it the most inspiring book that she's ever read. So I bought it and managed to get through it in two days. The true story of Jean-Dominique Bauby and his struggle to cope with a rare disease known as locked-in syndrome is certainly horrific beyond belief. This book tells of the last months of this amazing man's life, amazing because he not only had to cope with this disease but also managed to write this book using only his eyelid.However, despite that I didn't find the book to be as inspiring as my teacher had described. Don't get me wrong, I truly admire this remarkable man and find it to a terribly upsetting story. Yet the book mostly seems to describe the events of his life rather than the effects of his illness and there's an awful lot of narrative but not a great deal of emotion. Therein, perhaps lies Bauby's dignity and certainly his life should not merely consist of his illness, yet I did find the book to be rather uninvolving.As a story this is both inspiring and sad, yet it doesn't work as a book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"the book was in the condition described (good to new) and arrived promptly. great transaction! would definitely do business with this seller again."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Everyone else has said it all.

On one hand, it is insightful and inspiring to read the true story of the editor of Elle Magazine who had a stroke, became unable to movie anything except for his left eye, and still managed to write this book. Some parts of the book may move you to tears if you're able to connect with the author's own anguish.On the other hand, the book as a whole seems rather bland and seems to be missing the spark that so many people said the movie had. It is a quick read, and if you keep in mind that the book was written by a completely immobile person, it serves as a powerful inspiration that we truly are much more than our bodies.

Very moving, candid story about a guy my age who had a stroke and then locked-in-syndrome: his only way to communicate with others was by blinking an eye. Even in that state, he wrote this remarkable book. Read it to find out how he did it. Others would have called him a \\"vegetable\\" and allowed him to die.G_d bless Pope John Paul II for the remarkable work he commissioned on Ethics and the care for the elderly and sick, which goes beyond mere Catholicism or even Christianity into the realm of Humane caring. It is sad and scary to see somebody die very slowly, in terms of days and weeks, if not given the basic nutrition and care they otherwise aren't able to give themselves. It brings back the Terry Schiavo story and current Euthenasia tendencies of the world we live.If you're in the medical profession and/or medical care of very frail individuals, please buy and read this book before you return to work.

Bauby writes with a humour that belies the turmoil he is going through and his eloquence brings you fully into his mindset and also marvelling at some of the language he uses.I have read numerous memoirs about neurological conditions and whilst others have resonated with me more (like Michael J Fox's memoir, Kirk Douglas' autobiography or Christopher Reeves' autobiography) this book still manages to leave you in awe at Bauby's tenacity and his strength of character.

So does the nurse who leaves the TV blaring. So does the fly crawling on his nose. The doctor who sews his right eye shut without explaining why. Friends who read the special alphabet (his only means of communication) so fast they end up with gibberish.Jean Dominique Bauby apparently hadn't spent much time on spiritual development in his first 43 years. But he discovers rich inner resources in the diving bell, his mind escaping to intense memories, sensual pleasures, and imaginary places, conversations, and meals. He loves to be wheeled to the end of the beach near the hospital, where he can inhale the aroma of the sizzling French fries he will never again taste.I wish the publisher had included a photo of Bauby before his stroke and a close-up of him locked in. We get 1 grainy black and white shot of him in his wheel chair, on the balcony of the hospital looking out to sea on a cold, bleak day. That picture is more depressing than anything the author writes about his tragic situation.I'm glad this little gem, published just 2 days before Bauby's death, has been made into a movie.

The most incredible thing about this spare French memoir is that it was blinked by a former editor who had a stroke and became \\"locked-in.\\" Even holding the book up to your eyes, free at all times to get up and look out the window or scratch your foot, produces a powerful swirl of emotions: awe at being alive at all, gratitude for not being \\"locked-in,\\" compassion for this intelligent man imprisoned in a worst-nightmare scenario, guilt at not having done more with one's own healthy life. In this respect the book is not to be missed. The book cleans out the cobwebs of routine, allowing for a crisp new persepctive on reality.As far as the story goes, the chapters unfold in two or three pages and mostly chronicle life at the Brittany hospital where the author finds himself after the stroke. There are also a few flashbacks to life before the stroke. The book, surprisingly, is almost totally devoid of self pity and the prose is taut (as expected) and well structured. It's about a two hour read and well worth your time.I came to this book via the 2007 film. I was so moved by the film that I went out and read the book the following weekend. The merits of the film are well documented. Sort of a side note, one way the film diverges from the memoir is in the sexualization of the female characters, ie nurses, ex-wife, lovers. So much of the film is spent on lusty shots that I was surprised upon reading the book that it contains almost none of that. That's film for you."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"After reading the book and seeing the movie. My life has changed.

What is amazing is that he wrote this book by blinking his left eyelid. In a completely paralyzed state he relies on his memory for entertainment and recounts interesting dreams and vivid experiences. His keen sense of observation takes in all the details others may ordinarily miss.The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is truly a unique look at what it means to be permanently paralyzed and barely able to communicate. This book is a testament to the indomitable human spirit. 132 pages make this a quick read but one that may affect you profoundly.

Life got you down? Read this. In 1992, the author was the 43 year old editor of the French Elle.

This book was written by Bauby blinking as a reader read a special alphabet aloud. Blink= Write that LETTER. The book was written like that, letter by letter. It's short. Depressing? No. Lovely. A lovely, moving, haunting memoir of a man who used his mind to entertain and delight himself when that's all he had. He tells of the hard parts: His children's visits.

I laughed when he described his day trip out to the beach, just so he could smell the french fries, but mostly I stood back and admired this man who's body had been so cruely ravaged by a stroke, but who's mind remained alert.This book serves as a testament that we should live life a day at a time, because you never know what is around the corner.Teresa Mitchell (teresa.mitchell@britcoun.org"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I was disappointed in this book. A much better book on the same subject is \\"Look Up For Yes\\" by Julia Tavalaro. Her story started in 1966 when awareness of locked-in syndrome was much less known, and technology to help was not available but had to be invented and improvised for her. She wasn't even recognized as being anything other than brain dead for 6 years, but she was very aware of everything and tells us of the treatment she received and the remarkable story of her progress once this was discovered. She was 31 when she went into a coma for 7 months as a result of two strokes. She lived until she was 68."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Quadriplegia a horrible fate, to be physically confined to a wheel chair and to even lose the ability to move one's arms! [Christopher Reeves is indelibly etched in my mind]. So you can imagine how much worst, confining and monstrous a fate is \\"locked-in-syndrome.\\" This is caused by the destruction of the brainstem, either by accident or severe stroke [as in the author's case]. The brainstem sends messages to the muscles. Those unfortunate enough to be afflicted with this malady can't even speak. They are completely entombed in their own body and can only comunicate with the wink of one eye. It's like being trapped in a cadaver. Imagine to not even have the ability to satisfy an itch, squat a fly from your face, position yourself in such a way that relieves the discomfort of a sore arm, tell someone that you're in pain, that you've wet yourself, or to return a love one's affectionate hug, kiss or smile. Imagine knowing that your situation is as bad as it gets. All that is life as we know it and take for granted has changed and will never, ever come back.The sheer horror of Jean Dominique Bauby's tragedy--a victim of \\"locked-in-syndrome-- is beyond words, yet, this book is inspiring and has the power to teach the reader a valuable lesson. It has taught me to be grateful to God, to enjoy life's little pleasures and to live the moment. It has taught me patience and not to worry so much about life's little setbacks.I'm very sad for Bauby, but grateful to him for leaving us this wonderful celebration of life. Mr. Bauby's martyrdom has resulted in a beautifully written, inspiring and powerful book that we should all read. I'm, also, grateful to Julian Schnabel for turning this gem into a movie. Schnabel has the ability to turn wonderful books into great motion pictures. He did so in 2000 with Reinaldo Arenas's \\"Before Night Falls\\" and did it again this year with Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"More than anything, this is the story of the survival of the self. After suffering a 'massive stoke', Jean-Dominique Bauby can only move his left eye (called 'locked-in syndrome'). Using a 'volume loaded' alphabet (based on usage) he is able to 'speak' about his life and situation. He describes his situation as being in a 'diving bell (or suit)' floating in water with no control of his movements.But he has taught himself to be a 'butterfly' and travel all over the world. He can revisit with old friends and remember the pleasures of a life well-spent. Though the movie is remarkable, the texture of the stories, really comes through in his own words. Though he died just after the publication of the book (in 1997), he left a testament to the power of thought and the will to survive."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Bauby's life as he knew it and many more promising years were suddenly taken away by the stroke. Yet he did not succumb. There was not that much self-pity in this book, and even more, no talks about euthanasia. He shared with us his memories and thoughts. I think the last chapter is the best one and it is a powerful one - a day that started like any other...The writing itself is dry, but I give this book four stars due to the incredible feat of \\"writing\\" the book and the spirit of the book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a memorable tale of Jean-Dominique Bauby living with locked-in syndrome. The book itself is short making a person at first believe there could not be anything worth noting in such a small space. There is a reason it is such a small book. The entire thing was dictated by blinking his left eye, the only part of his body in which he still had control of. Little does one know that the insights this man offered to the world reveals that no matter the situation a person may live in, good can come from bad, and life can come from nothing. At the same time, this is by no means a feel good book that picks you up when you are down. Rather, Bauby gives his views on how his life functions. Some being awful, and others hopeful.A diving bell is a chamber in which people can go underwater without special tools to help them breathe. A butterfly is an insect whom one sees flying about all around them. Why did Bauby choose these two words as the title for his book? We could think of it this way, which from what I've read in the book, certainly works. Bauby, felt almost as if his physical body was trapped inside a diving bell, meaning he had no room to move, and could not leave. This situation makes up about fifty percent of his stories, most of which unsurprisingly are the ones that tend to elicit pity from his readers. While they may do that, I never believed it was his mission to dishearten people. Rather they were accounts of his everyday life and how he felt about it. The only emotions being his own.The butterfly however makes up the other half of the book. Here it shows just how free his mind still was. Throughout the book, Bauby would make snide and often comical remarks about the people around him, showing how he still was who he used to be. Bauby would recall past events in his life with such clarity that at times one has to remember that the author of the book was completely paralyzed. With stories of his days at the horse track to seemingly inexplicable dreams, Bauby's ability to tell stories would keep readers captivated no matter the subject.So, in reality, the reasoning behind this book's title was because Bauby felt as if he/his mind were a butterfly. Free and majestic, willing to go anywhere at any time. But, this butterfly was trapped in his useless body. His diving bell. Unable to escape and so confined to explore every nook and cranny of their imprisonment. This book was not only to tell the world about locked-in syndrome, but it was his way of finally communicating to the outside world.This book shows us to appreciate life, which is a lesson most people need to constantly be reminded of. Appreciate everything one has, because before you know it, it all could be taken away."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is perhaps one of the most unique memoirs ever written. After suffering a massive stroke, Bauby was left with locked-in syndrome, losing control of all faculties save for his left eye. Utilizing a revised French alphabet, Bauby and his transcriber literally composed the book one letter at a time. While this rare perspective will spark many readers' curiosity, the work itself has far more to offer than simply a unique point of view. Certainly, those who are looking for an analytical articulation of what is like to be trapped inside one's mind will be disappointed; however, the vast majority of readers will no doubt find some of the most poignant, substantial literature ever squeezed into a mere 130 pages.Before I go off on a tangent regarding the book's literary merit, I should enumerate some its flaws, primarily the nebulous narrative. While the descriptive quality is impeccable throughout the memoir, much of the account is haphazard; there seems to be a serious lack of cohesion. Many of the chapters blend together, or worse, are memorable not for their content as much as their composition. At times, Buaby tends to rely upon his condition too heavily in order to bridge the gap between chapters containing meaningful plot or introspection. While these scenes are incredibly well written, they add very little to the key story arcs or general progression of the narrative. For example, there is a short chapter relating to his bath regimen. Although his recounting is creative and well articulated, it does very little to advance the book's substance; in the end, chapters such as these seem rather trifle.That being said, the composition in and of itself makes up for any holistic inconsistencies. Every word, every sentence, every literary device, is so expertly crafted. At one point, he describes himself as \\"the greatest director of all time\\", but in truth, he is perhaps the most skilled wordsmith of all time. Due to the circumstances, Bauby would naturally attempt to eliminate excess fluff, but not only has he succeeded in consolidating his thoughts, he has composed them with such perfection, that there were times when I would reread sentences simply to re-assimilate his specific amalgamation of words in forming a thought. One of my favorite examples of his stylistic pathos persists in his presentation of the dichotomy between the stagnant, restrictive \\"diving bell\\" he is trapped within and the dynamic, butterfly-esque activity of his mind:\\"Far from such din, when blessed silence returns, I can listen to the butterflies that flutter inside my head. To hear them, one must be calm and pay close attention, for their wing beats are barely audible. Loud breathing is enough to drown them out. This is astonishing: my hearing does not improve, yet I hear them better and better. I must have butterfly hearing.\\" (Page 97)Perhaps I am deriving significance from what others consider very run of the mill writing, but nevertheless, I find this passage to typify the phrase \\"eloquent in its brevity\\". He is capable of articulating so much in so few sentences. Throughout the memoir there are passages such as these that serve to plant a seed of thought that festers, yet seems to leave the reader only asymptotically close to any semblance of conclusion.In the end, Bauby's memoir will appeal to any reader ready to grapple with many of life's most elusive questions. Although he strikes a balance between cynical humor and a somber tone, the tale is inherently tragic. On the whole, Bauby's circumstances are enough to warrant the small investment of time it takes to tackle this short book; however, I would expect most readers would do everything possible to linger for longer behind the left eye of Jean-Dominique Bauby, for his observations are nothing short of captivating."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"It started with a stroke in the back seat of a car. This catastrophic event presented the curse of Locked-In Syndrome upon Jean-Dominique Bauby, the former editor of Elle magazine. With only the capability of blinking his left eye, Bauby took the challenge of writing down his harrowing experience of having a sound mind in a devastated body.Bauby's attempt, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, is less of a novel and more a loosely connected series of vignettes that beautifully details the struggles, hardships, and changes that he encounters while he is locked-in. It is a fine balance, between deriving pleasure from his attractive doctors and the horrifying pain of losing the simple things, like eating. At its heart, however, the book is about the power of the human mind and the overwhelming urge to hold on to life, no matter how pitiful.The novel alternates between his experiences with Locked-In Syndrome, for example being dressed, and pieces from his earlier life, like where his love of sausage came from. Although some of the short \\"vignette\\" chapters don't seem to fit together, the book as a whole comes together brilliantly fleshing out this truly powerful person who has the tenacity to attempt this brutal example of almost being dead, yet struggling to hold on to this ugly existence.Although the premise of the book may seem both unique and hard to comprehend, Bauby handles both hurdles with amazing grace. He easily mirrors his situation with his own father's, who is contained in his own apartment due to old age, a common problem among many people. Bauby, however, never expects anyone to understand the plight that overcame him and instead of trying to hide this fact, he brings it to the forefront of his novel in a few chapters. He presents the reaction of fellow patients, the different reactions of doctor, and even the strained relationship of his family to the reader for the purpose of showing the truth of isolated his situation.Bauby tries to portray through the novel the difficulty with his own reaction to his predicament, yet it is never put better than in the book's tenth chapter. With the continuation of his life's work and the limited connection that he has with the outside world his last line of hope seems to be his speech therapist Sandrine. She is his last hope for trying to communicate with the outside world properly, and yet it is her that causes Bauby to question if he is still fully alive, or if he just a shell of his former self.Even in its lowest moments The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is one of the most powerful books that I have ever read. It is both heart warming and devastatingly harsh in the most delicious combinations possible, and although the outcome is unavoidable you find yourself flipping the pages faster hoping for a Shyamalan twist that gives you the happy ending you prayed for from the beginning. However, if there is one thing that the book is, it is honest. Honest to the point of frustration, honest to the point of tears, and honest to the point that you smile. But when it all comes down in the end, you thank him for it."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly has a powerful story and it was written in an incredible way. Jean- Dominique Bauby had everything; a loving family, money, and a happy life. However all of that changed when he became paralyzed due to a massive stroke. Bauby was only able to blink his eyes but using this last glimmer of humanity, he found a way to communicate. This was done by somebody reading off letters and Bauby would blink to alert the writer what letter needed to be used.Beyond the incredible method of writing the memoir, it has incredible diction and a moving story. Bauby uses beautifully descripitive language, which can be seen to its greatest extent in the chapter titled The Sausage, which describes his recollection of the tastes and smells of food. Bauby spends his days unable to do any sort of activity. But through this he makes great strides towards improvement and even eventually becomes more accepting of his state while he remains committed to overcoming his condition. Bauby even learns to move his head and grunt. Even when paralyzed, Bauby retains a sense of hope that is astounding. This memoir contains the most overwhelming odds a reader will see, but Bauby will amaze the reader even in such a terrible situation.Bauby uses many flashbacks that help show how his life has changed. Though some seem almost unimportant, they beautifully illustrate how his life was and how his attitude has changed through this situation. Every scene has at least a little purpose and every scene is extremely interesting. The stories are thrown together randomly which is the biggest drawback to the memoir. It is unorganized but Bauby did have to memorize what he was going to say and wrote it in his head so it's a bit understandable.There are however problems with this memoir. Sometimes he does ramble, however it doesn't really take anything away from the novel and his rants are interesting. It is also shorter than I would have liked it to be. But considering he wrote it by blinking, its understandable that it was so short. These small problems do not hurt the memoir nearly enough for it to be bad. All in all the memoir is extremely sound and is very interesting.The book contains many greatly moving scenes. The most heartwarming of these scenes is when he spends Father's Day with his Wife and children, but is unable to show any affection or even speak to them. The pain he suffers makes the reader feel his pain to a certain extent. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, is an incredible literary masterpiece that can make even the worst person feel sympathy for Bauby. This is one of the most interesting and most moving books I have ever read. This book even made me like a book from a genre I normally would not like. Even with the unorganized chapters, this book delivers on what any good memoir should do; include a great story that places the reader in the author's shoes. This book is extremely well written and contains an incredible story. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Upon reading the first few pages of Jean-Dominique's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, you know that you're reading something like you've never picked up before. This is true almost by default since Bauby mentions that the only other locked-in case mentioned in literature is Noirtier from Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, a character with whom his conditions creates a connection. Although the fact alone that The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a moving memoir that a man wrote with only his right eye makes it a fascinating story, there is much more behind this bizarre premise. Laden with every type of irony and writing that causes emotional and sensory overloads, Bauby's memoir can make you laugh, possibly make you cry with its moving scenes, and surely, stun you with its beautiful descriptions. Through inspecting his experiences at the hospital as a man who was once in the prime of his life but now suffers from locked-in syndrome, Bauby gives readers reasons to appreciate life. Then reflecting on his life prior to that condition, he demonstrates the importance of holding onto memories, for they might be all you have at some point.That Bauby wrote an award-winning memoir using this system is nothing short of amazing; it took me about five minutes to communicate three words to a friend with his technique of blinking when the stenographer says the letter he wants to use. Yet the memoir's merits aren't only from shock value or cries of \\"woe is me.\\" Without pitying himself too much, Bauby delicately encourages readers to sympathize with him and take their blessings into account. Taking advantage of his technically still open contract with a publisher, he shows an inspiring, enduring spirit by writing the memoir instead of resigning to a vegetable status. Many modern memoirs such as Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild or Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha are somewhat depressing and don't necessarily end \\"happily ever after.\\" On the other hand, Bauby doesn't deny his critical condition, but he still manages to make progress physically and emotionally during the memoir. By the memoir's end Bauby is singing a simple song, whereas he could barely move his tongue in the beginning of the novel. He writes, \\"On my birthday, Sandrine [a speech therapist that he calls his guardian angel] managed to get me to pronounce the whole alphabet more or less intelligibly. I could not have had a better present. It was as if those twenty-six letters had been wrenched from the void.\\" Coming to peace with his condition, he shows readers that no matter what situation you're in, you can make something of it. For Bauby, his escape from his gruesome reality is replaying fond memories or letting his imagination take him away. Through narrating experiences ranging from the mundane to the day he had his stroke, Bauby teaches readers the importance of savoring memories. He writes, \\"Once, I was a master at recycling leftovers. Now, I cultivate the art of simmering memories.\\"From lightening a grave situation to narrating a bizarre turn of evens, Bauby enriches his memoir with all types of irony. For example, in some ways Bauby experiences life more fully when he's locked-in than when he was mobile. In recounting a heart wrenching Father's Day at the hospital, he observes, \\"Until my stroke, we had felt no need to fit this made-up holiday into our emotional calendar. But today we spend the whole of the symbolic day together, affirming that even a rough sketch, a shadow, a tiny fragment of a dad is still a dad.\\" On the other hand, perhaps to cope with his condition, Bauby downplays serious situations and humorously over-emphasizes seemingly trivial matters. Instead of writing further on the intimacy of his Father's Day, Bauby mentions that, \\"In the commotion of departure [of his children], I forgot to signal for the curtains to be drawn. A nurse will be in before the world comes to an end.\\"Along with his humor for situations both profund and typical, Bauby brings awesome sensory descriptions and imagery to his narrations. For example, he devotes an entire comical chapter to food memories. Relating stories of habitual trips to his grandfather's, he confesses that he remembered the taste of the sausage that his grandfather would give him more than the face of his generous grandfather. However, with his mouthwatering descriptions, you almost cannot blame Bauby. His mental escapes can teach readers a valuable lesson: never underestimate the worth of a memory because you never know when you'll lose the ability to relive one like it again."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"- As an RN(and potential patient, as we all are), this book affected me greatly!!

Not depressing at all, deeply moving and so real because it could be anybody! What a triumph of human determination to dictate the book at all and share his incredibly moving and, I'm sure incredibly frustrating, experience. His selflessnes to tell his tale is extremely moving.

I am very glad that I read it. In spite of his condition, the author's intelligence and even a dry sense of humor about the turn his life has taken comes through clearly. He must have been quite an intriguing and vibrant man, the kind of person you would have liked to invite to dinner if you could only choose three people. Not only is the book interesting to read from an ethical perspective, as several other reviewers have commented, but it also is interesting from a medical and scientific perspective. It is much more common to see neurology patients who are more or less physically intact but have become demented or vegetative. This man had the opposite problem: his intellect and cognitive abilities were intact, but his brain could no longer communicate with his body. The location of the stroke was absolutely crucial. If his lesion had been just a bit lower, it could have affected the part of the brainstem that controls consciousness. He would have been in a coma, and never have written this extraordinary book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"After reading this, it helps put in perspective just how much time you waste.

A friend lent me her copy of &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,&quot; praising it as one of the most inspiring books she ever read. I have to admit I was halfway through the book before I overcame my horror at his predicament, and my fear of the same thing happening to me: Bauby was 43--four years younger than I am now--when he suffered his catastrophic stroke, and 45 when he died, his sophisticated, gracious mind still locked in his useless body. But by the end I was moved to tears of gratitude to see what a man could achieve when left nothing but his mind and one eyelid. Imprisoned in the wheelchair with Bauby, suffering every agony and indignity he does, we travel with him across continents, reviewing his rich and eventful life, ennobled by his determination to enjoy whatever life he has left to him, no matter what the circumstances. &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; is a remarkable testament to the primacy of the human mind."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"you how when you write stories about yourself, it almost always goes into the past historic tense... i did this, she did that.... well this book is very very present tense... this is how i'm feeling right now... this is what i am thinking about... and the thoughts are entirely beautiful... a dying man, he is focusing on the beautiful things... a book that make you look at the small things again, and notice the beauty that is in everything."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"You will read this in one sitting.

The only things he can move are his neck (about 90 degrees) and his left eyelid. Using his eyelid, a computer device and an assistant, he dictates this entire memoir, that talks about how he misses simple things, like being able to stroke his son's hair, or the taste of a meal that he's cooked for himself. He has to mentally go to the various places he travelled to before the syndrome, in order to keep from going crazy, a working brain locked in an inactive body. While the book is depressing, it's surprising how uplifting it is, in a way. Makes you realize how much about life you take for granted."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book. Perhaps that was a mistake, but I loved the movie so much that after seeing it three times, I wanted more. So I read the book and wish I hadn't. Julian Schnabel's version of this story is filled with agony but also with light and beauty. The actors are so accomplished and moving (particularly Max von Sidow) that the story becomes human and uplifting, in spite of its tragic ending, and like all great art it affirms the worthwhileness of life, even in its diminished but heroic manifestation. In the book, Bauby--understandably--writes in a self-centered and superficial way. I feel guilty even saying it, because, of course, he was in an unimaginably difficult situation. But Schnabel had a deeper and more insightful vision. Schnabel portrays a man who indeed was selfish and vain at the beginning of his hellish journey, but who is able to turn to imagination and writing as a way of transcending the pettiness, wildness, and meaningless of his former life.This change is indicated in several ways. First, when he learns to communicate, Bauby tells his speech therapist that he wants to die. (This does not appear in the book.) She is very upset and reproaches him for his despair. Then she comes back to apologize for stepping out of line. This human interaction of caring and anguish affects the protagonist who decides a short time later to stop feeling sorry for himself and, instead, to use his imagination and memory in order to write down his thoughts and thus defy, in the only way available to him, his diving bell. This decision, probably thought out by the director or the actor (because it is not mentioned in the book) also leads him to reflections of remorse for the way he had been treating his wife and a wish, clearly articulated, to make amends. There is no remorse in the book; instead, Bauby remembers a horrendous fight with his wife, which does not flatter either of them, and conveys little insight into the nature of his toxic relationship with her. His hostility toward her, in the book, is still simmering, even in his paralysis. A Greek philosopher said that suffering leads to wisdom. And that's what great art gives us as a gift nonpareil. I didn't see wisdom in the book, but I did see it in the movie.Furthermore, the book skips his meetings with his wife and his girlfriend, meetings which the movie presents in rich and poignant abandon. In the book, Bauby's relationship with his father is summarized, in a paragraph, rather than experienced. In the movie the acting of both von Sidow (as the father) and the actor who plays Bauby is magnificent. The relationship between father and son becomes a profound and moving experience. Schnabel, no doubt, turned a mediocre book into a great work of art. And if he gave the real Bauby a depth he didn't, in reality, have--so be it."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I needed to read a nonfiction book about someone with a terminal illness for a class - I wasn't excited about it, because we all know how that book is going to end. I sat down outside in the shade with a cup of coffee and some Post-It flags to mark quotes to use in my paper and finished the book with a cold cup of coffee, twenty-five flags sticking out from the side, and the beginning of a sunburn because I hadn't moved while the sun had.Then I read it again from start to finish.I won't bother to summarize it; many people already have. I'll just say that Jean-Dominique Bauby had a gift for making even the simplest things swell with emotion with just a few words. I rarely cry and spent all 132 pages on the brink of tears. Even when his words were joyful, knowledge of his condition made them bittersweet, though still so beautiful. If you think this book doesn't pertain to your life, it does - everyone needs to be reminded of the amazing beauty possible in everyday life and how easily it can slip away from you."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"A prisoner in one's body. Only one eye functioning. Only one ear. Able to turn one's head from side to side, but totally paralyzed otherwise. Unable to communicate except through the blink of one eye. The view limited largely to the four walls. And no hope of recovery. To exist in such a condition -- a fully-functioning mind trapped within a nonfunctional body -- is extraordinary. To want to write a book while in this condition, and then to do so, one letter at a time through the help of a very patient assistant, is even more remarkable.This is a small book, understandably so. In short chapters, Jean-Dominique Bauby, a former high-powered editor-in-chief, describes the world as he came to experience it after his stroke in 1995 at the young age of 43. He writes, \\"There are no words to express it. My condition is monstrous, iniquitous, revolting, horrible.\\" Yet the book displays little in the way of complaints.The fact that someone should have to endure such a condition haunts me. According to some of the reviewers of the movie version of this book (which I haven't seen), Bauby comes across as selfish and self-centered. I have no reason to question this portrayal, but it's not one the book presents. And I'd be no less haunted even if it did. This book deserves five stars, if not for the content, then for the effort it took to write it. Bauby died just months after the French publication of the book. I don't know if that's terribly sad or a blessing. Maybe both. But we can all benefit from his tragic situation by appreciating what we have while we have it."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The book that spawned the wonderful film of the same name deserves to be read in its own right. Jean-Dominique Bauby's painstakingly \\"written\\" memoir (he blinked it out a letter at a time) is lyrical, gallicly witty and exquisitly written. The book only hints at the life that made the film so captivating. But Bauby, ever circumspect about revaling his personal life, gives us a startling portait of being \\"locked in\\" to one's own inert body, all the while possessing a mind capable of wit and close analysis, but never regret. This is not a memoir of finding one's true self after a crisis. It is not an inspirational story of triumph against long odds. It is simply the memoir of a man who, after a devastating accident, is much like the one before. Bauby yearns to caress his children, is indifferent to their mother, unimpressed by religion, irritated at the oaf who shut off his TV in the middle of a great soccer match, and intrigued by the circumstances that drew and redrew him to his final destination -- Berck-sur-Mer on France's Britanny coast.I found this book to be the perfect companion to the film.The film fleshes out the hints of Bauby's life; the book gives us the man in his own words, wit and warmth."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The first time I read this book it flew by lightly and quickly, like the passage of a butterfly. When I was finished I just sat there, stunned by the last line. Actually, I was stunned by the whole thing. How, I thought, does a man who has been completely paralyzed by a stroke manage to write a book?Jean-Dominique Bauby's feat was quite literally death-defying. It was accomplished by blinking his left eyelid, the only part of his body which remained mobile, to choose letters of the alphabet which his scribe read aloud. It took two minutes for him to compose a single word. There was no editing, no rethinking, no discussion. Every word, every thought, every memory, every image had to be chosen with exquisite care, memorized, and then kept intact in his mind while he painstakingly conveyed them to the outside world.So, I read the book again, this time entering the diving bell. I read it slowly and conscientiously, like a poem, realizing that each word was a precious commodity, each sentence an act of faith, each image a microcosm of the universe. And I was rewarded. While the beauty of Bauby's writing and the strength of his character impressed me on the first reading, the second reading transported me into another plane of existence.Do we take talking, and eating, and moving our limbs for granted? Yes, we do. Do we take our pleasures, and our passions, our loves and those who love us for granted? Yes, we do. Do I have the patience, the will power, the love of life, and the indomitable spirit of Jean-Dominique Bauby? No, I don't. But, even though his plight was the most frightening thing I can imagine, I am so very grateful that Jean-Dominique made the superhuman effort he did, and that I entered the diving bell with him--ever so briefly."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"From the back cover:After suffering a massive stroke, Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor-in-chief of French &lt;em>Elle&lt;/em> and the father of two young children, found himself completely paralysed and speechless. Able only to move one eyelid, he 'dictated' this remarkable book. &lt;em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&lt;/em> records Bauby's lonely existence, but also the ability to invent a life for oneself in the most appalling of circumstances. It is a remarkable book about the triumph of the human spirit.Review:I first read this book a couple of years ago, at a time in my life when I was very busy and had little time for reading (a dark state of affairs I must say), and I borrowed a copy from a friend and zoomed through its 139 pages in a series of short bursts of reading. I confess I paid scant attention to what I was reading, but by the end I had a feeling I had not given it the proper attention and time it deserved. But, being in the busy state I was in I returned the book to my friend and left it at that. Then, it was my book club's pick for this month and I was determined this time around to give it the time it deserved.This time, I read it slowly, deliberately, and savoured every word. It deserves this kind of reading. Jean-Dominique Bauby spent much of his time, trapped inside his own body (the diving bell), carefully constructing the sentences of this book, selecting each word specifically, and waiting until such time as he could dictate them by painstakingly spelling them out one letter at a time. I came away from reading this in awe of the kind of remarkable mind that could achieve this feat.Sadly, the author died shortly after the first publication, but the mark he has left, and the benefit of his achievement for other sufferers of 'locked-in syndrome' can not be underestimated."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Synopsis: In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, the 43-year-old editor-in-chief of Elle magazine in France, suffered from a stroke. When he woke up from a coma, he discovers he has a rare condition called \\"locked-in syndrome,\\" which completely paralyzes the body. The mind, however, is left functioning normally. Still, he urges himself to move on with his life. With the help of a speech therapist, he decides to account his thoughts, feelings, and dreams in little fragments, using only his eyelid -- his only remaining functioning body part -- to express himself and tell his story. Through this heart wrenching and unbelievable challenge he knew he had to face, he came up with this memoir.Review: This is a unique and extremely contemplative and insightful account, of a disturbing and an uncomfortable topic. The author of this memoir \\"wrote\\" the book by blinking his eyes to spell the alphabet. He first had to learn how to do this, and practiced it for a while, before starting this.Though it is a heart breaking situation, it is not a sad story. In fact, it was actually uplifting, knowing that despite the horrible circumstances he was forced to face, he still found a way to persevere and overcome them, in his own ways.That having said, I highly recommend this book. Forget for a moment the technicalities of how a book should be, because this memoir is all about the story itself. It is simply, about a man and his courage, despite the odds. This will definitely linger in my mind for a long time."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"After seeing the movie version, I HAD to read the book. I couldn't put it down. The author tells his story in a way that will both break your heart and have you literally laughing out loud at his use of irony and sarcasm.I've read some of the more negative reviews, and my only response to their criticism is that Jean Do was only a man....not a saint...not a fictional hero...just a human being who was struck by a disability that disconnected him from the world he'd known, and made him reflect on his past joys, AND his past failures.This book is very well written, and the translation is seamless. More importantly though, the story provides insights into the identity issues, the sense of isolation, and the tendency towards escapism into one's imagination that many people with disabilities face on a daily basis.Those with physical disabilities may find a kindred spirit in Jean Do, and those without disabilities may learn to see those with disabilities in a more compassionate and thoughtful way."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Many life lessons may be distilled from this book. However, one of the most powerful is the degree of control our minds exert over feelings of fulfillment and life meaning. If we increase our attention to everyday details and our reflection on memories, we can have minds as free as butterflies, even when confined to the diving bell of normal life.Plot SummaryIn his previous life, Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor in chief of Elle magazine in France. His was always quick-witted and expressed a zeal for life's luxuries and an appetite for new experiences. When he was 43 years old, this all was abruptly arrested by a massive stroke. After two weeks spent in a coma, he awoke to his new life as a victim of \\"locked-in syndrome;\\" an individual in this condition is still fully cognizant, yet unable to accomplish any volitional movement. By an arguably cruel twist of fate, Bauby was still in control of the muscles in his left eyelid. Using this limited capability, he was able to blink his selection of letters to his infinitely patient speech therapist as she repeatedly read him the alphabet. Through this painstakingly slow method of communication, Bauby was not only able to compose correspondence to his friends and family, but also wrote this eloquent and surprisingly cheerful memoir.Confined, yet FreeBecause it is written by a man condemned to a fate many would consider worse than death, the jovial topics addressed in most of the anecdotes which comprise this book come as a surprise. Even his occasional lapses into self-pity are expressed in such a mercurial manner that the reader's pity is offset by admiration of his enduring mirth. His body, whose constant immobile state is conferred by what Bauby lovingly dubs an invisible diving bell, exercises no constraint on his mind. In fact, Bauby's situation, which would conventionally be bemoaned as extremely unfortunate, seems to actually yield a degree of freedom neither experienced nor contemplated by physiologically normal individuals. Like a butterfly, Bauby's mind is free to roam, distracted neither by movement nor responsibility. Atention previously preoccupied by these is redirected towards the minutia of everyday experience and towards memory.Benefits of AttentionAlthough most people would never wish locked-in syndrome on their worst enemies, the whole of humanity would benefit from the resulting redirection of attention which Bauby so eloquently recounts. Because of the repetitious nature of everyday events, our appreciation for them is often muted, if not altogether absent. Bauby's nostalgic description of the mundane tasks of his previous life-such as shaving and dressing himself-cast them in such a tragically positive light that the reader is prompted to stop and appreciate similar events in his/her own life. Even in his paralyzed state, Bauby is careful to note the comfort of his weekly bath and the colors cast on the wall of his hospital room at sunset. With this book, Bauby extends an invitation for the reader to join him in his diving bell, even though it promises to take them into unexplored territory; he invites us to abandon our focus on the stresses which seem so important and pressing at any given moment, in favor of the quite pleasures that are all too often overlooked. If we were to allow ourselves to learn from his experience and afford a heightened level of acknowledgement to simple details of our experience, our lives would undoubtedly be richer and more fulfilling than achieved with our current benumbed attention.Power of MemoryThe majority of the anecdotes offered in this book are written as a stream of consciousness-Bauby relates memories as they come back to him. The fact that his memories are, in effect, his only remaining connection to normalcy reflects the importance of memory to all of humanity. We all rely on memories to ground us to our past and form educated judgments of future actions. He relies on them not just for this sense of identity, but for improving his quality of life; even though his only form of nourishment enters his body via an IV, Bauby mentally treats himself to the tastes and scents of memories of gourmet meals. If taking the time to appreciate his past had such a profoundly calming and life-affirming effect on Bauby during the bleakest times of his bedridden life, one can only imagine the positive ramifications such appreciation would produce in our own lives.Brain PlasticityAlthough his brain and spinal cord suffered catastrophic damage during the stroke, Bauby was able, by the time of completion of this memoir, to \`grunt the little song about the kangaroo.' He also regains his ability to shake his head and even muster a loud grunt. The recitation of this French children's rhyme and reacquisition of limited movement serve as testimonies to his brain's ability to reorganize itself. As popularized by current theories on the subject, brain plasticity can result in drastic changes, so long as therapy is repeated and afforded absolute attention by the patient. This is yet another display of the importance of attention-if we are to make any meaningful change to our own bodies or lives, we must increase the attention we pay to efforts towards that end.Words to Potential ReadersThe structure of this memoir lends itself to quick reading, but its content demands the attention which can only be given during slow consideration. Do not be deceived by its short length-for what it lacks in page numbers, the book overcompensates with its emotionally charged and witty content. I have read each anecdote several times, every time extracting more subtle, exquisite nuances unnoticed during previous readings. Bauby's wit, along with his unabashed optimism, is at once awe-inspiring and life-affirming. It shows that, even though we are all confined to a certain extent by the diving bell of responsibility and the limitations of our bodies, we can maintain minds as free as butterflies by being selective with our attention to our surroundings and appreciation of our past.This was an absolutely wonderful book which I would recommend to any reader with an open mind. You shouldn't read it unless you are ready to shed some tears and have your life views radically challenged. It is not sad, but instead poignant- a powerful testament to the durability of the human spirit. Be prepared to want to read it multiple times."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Read this story to get into the skin of somebody who woke up one day all transformed.

However, it deals with reality and ultimately reality is what will bring anybody up. As we accept life as it comes to us, we are able to cope with it and make sure our positives are more than the negatives in life. To that extent the book does exactly that.

In the authors words he was only \\"a mind in a jar\\". At the age of 43, Bauby, the editor in chief of the famed French fashion magazine\\"Elle\\", was struck down with a rare kind of massive stroke to the brain stem. His body allowed only the control and movement of one eye lid, yet this extraordinary man grasped this opportunity, blinking out, letter by letter, this remarkable communique.This extraordinary book is filled with raw courage, a love of life and insight that details the world anew. Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the publication of this book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby's \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is a truly moving and inspirational memoir by a man rendered incapable of any communication except for the blinking of his left eye and very slight head movement. Bauby had suffered from a stroke, which led to what is so aptly known as \`locked-in-syndrome'.Bauby, a distinguished journalist who had been editor-in-chief at Elle, famously used his one book contract with a publisher (signed before the stroke) to write this memoir by recounting his story through blinking his left eye to spell out every letter of every single word to an interpreter/assistant who would recite a special frequency arranged alphabet to Jean-Do.This fascinating and unbelievable pretext sticks with the reader throughout the memoir, with it so often seeming amazing that such lucid and vivid metaphors and accounts of life could be communicated by a man in such an imprisoned state.From his refusal to pity himself or lament his situation, to his heart-wrenching yet moving description of his plight as that of being trapped in a \\"cocoon\\", with his inability to move any part of his body being likened to being forever imprisoned by an old-fashioned diving suit, Bauby constantly moves the reader with his courage and heightened state of awareness. By declaring his situation as not a burden, but instead an opportunity to free his mind and let it take \\"flight like a butterfly\\", Bauby delivers a memoir that is so precious for demonstrating a man's noble minded acceptance of fate, and embracement of opportunity.Jean-Do's memoir recounts his time at the hospital in France where he is left to try and rehabilitate following his stroke. There is a constant strong sense of humour evident from the author, with Jean-Do wittily noting that seeing as his original idea for a novel (conceived prior to the stroke) had coincidentally involved a victim of locked-in-sydrome, he had considered making the new hero of his book \\"not a paralytic but a runner\\" in the hope of achieving another coincidental turn of events. This sense of humour and ability to look at the bright side of things underlines Bauby's ability to connect with the reader, putting them at ease whilst at the same time discarding the possible misconception that a person in his state would be incapable of retaining their wit, or any sort of personality.Throughout the book, it is Bauby's amazing strength of will and spirit that remains at the forefront of the readers mind. Despite the tragic and disheartening situation that he remains in, Bauby shows no hesitance in opening up a new chapter in his life. Despite such huge emotional challenges like being unable to hug his own child, or shake a fly off his nose, Jean-Do finds a way to live his life in a fulfilling way, avoiding the depression and grief that would be so tempting to succumb to.What makes this memoir so great is that it provides an example for all of us to follow. The inspirational message underpinning Bauby's work is inescapable, and leaves the reader with a far greater appreciation of their life, reminding them to enjoy the numerous simple, yet joyful pleasures we so often take for granted."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I am usually a connoisseur of fine fiction, but I found this little biography to be quite compelling. I was directed to this book after I saw a preview for the movie. While the writing and imagery of \\"the Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is straightforward and simplistic, it truly is the story behind the writing that makes this book captivating. Bauby doesn't have to reach out with his written words and shake the reader into thoughts of \\"the meaning of life\\" and \\"seizing the day\\". It is the reader who becomes engrossed in the history and genius behind Bauby's elegant simplistic prose that finds the true treasure of Bauby's gift. What would you want to say to the world if you were in his position? Read it and appreciate."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The situation is unimaginable: waking from a coma to find yourself trapped in your own body, able to think clearly and understand what is going on around you, but unable to partake in any of what transpires. It's called \\"locked in syndrome,\\" and Jean-Dominique Bauby finds himself a victim of it when he awakes from a coma following a serious stroke that damaged his brain stem and left him almost totally paralyzed; he has only limited facial movements, slight control over his neck, and use of only one eye. It is with this single good eye that Bauby is able to communicate with the world, using an excruciatingly slow code of blinking that requires time, energy, and a great deal of attention and patience. And it is also thanks to this one eye that we have this first-hand account, dictated by Bauby from his hospital bed, recounting the details of his life in the wake of tragedy.Far from being restricted by his condition, Bauby unleashes the full force of his literary capabilities (which were quite estimable, considering that he was the editor of French Elle), leaving us with a wry, touching, and deeply affecting memoir that shines with descriptive flourishes and deep insights. His perspective in the wake of tragedy is awe-inspiring and leaves the reader with a deep respect for his fortitude; truly, this is a man I would have loved to have had an opportunity to have a conversation with, just to try and absorb a small degree of his wisdom and experience. \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" has moments of regret, frustration, sadness and aching loneliness, but curiously absent are anger and self-righteousness. Bauby never curses his misfortune but focuses on getting by with the hand he was dealt. To read his memoir is to get to know a truly extraordinary man whose spirit refused to be crushed and whose mind and imagination allowed him to survive in the most constrained of circumstances. To say that \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is about the triumph of the human spirit is a sorry understatement, and does little to pay tribute to an amazing man.\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is a slight volume, to be sure, but it feels wrong to criticize it for that when one considers the conditions under which it was composed. And considering that Bauby packs a hefty punch in such a short page count, it is well worth the experience.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Reviewed by Andrea Stuckey(First international version published July 1998, and now translated from French to English by Jeremy Leggatt.)Some people select Billy Graham as the most inspirationally motivational Christian in history, or John Gardner in the economical world, for overcoming so much in his life to become a successful business man. If there is one person in history to model the saying \\"You can do anything if you put your mind to it,\\" especially when unable to physically move a single limb, Jean-Dominique Bauby was that man.Plagued by a stroke in his mid forties, the extremely successful French \\"Elle\\" editor found himself literally trapped in his own body, unable to communicate with the outside world, except for a code his occupational therapist had remedied. The only problem was, Bauby had no control over any part of his body, except his left eye, which he used in blinking fashion to communicate with the \\"outside world.\\"People and family he'd previously spoken with so easily were so far away from him, without this code, that every dream and waking moment flowed together. Bauby presents the reader with this emotion extremely well with the short chapters, styling each just a bit differently, depending on the emotions he was experiencing during each episode. There were humorous bits where Bauby paints a scene he experiences inside his head, a daydream of sorts, as well as darker pieces of reality, where his existence felt to him as more of a burden than anything.If writing a lyrically beautiful memoir isn't enough, the fact that Bauby literally wrote this book through his left eye leaves the reader absolutely stunned afterward. Bauby's intuit into different characteristics people possess is incredible, and it will push the reader to remember there is a soul inside everyone, even if we cannot physically see it move.Armchair Interviews says: A stunning memoir to move any reader."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Although the Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a quick read, from cover-to-cover, each word should be savored. Mr. Bauby beautifully describes the horror of his situation as he draws the reader deeper and deeper into his world . . . his memories . . . and the reality of his \\"locked in\\" life.

This success of this book is obviously a godsend for family left behind in this terribly moving, tragic story. Thank God for that. But I found myself feeling at once manipulated and guilty for feeling that way. How dare I look at someone else's tragedy so coldly! Well, I'm going to stand out here in the cold, because this is a manipulation of the highest order, and most of the people I know who read the book feel the same way.

I definitely feel compassion for Bauby. I think it is absolutely amazing he was able to dictate a book in this condition. I am not familiar with \\"locked in syndrome\\" and I admire Bauby for his determination under these dire circumstances. However, I am not a big fan of a book where the focus is more on metaphors and writing style. I think it takes away from the emotion that can be projected to the reader. It is a possibility Bauby hid behind the words and phrases and I do not blame him for this. This book just wasn't able to leave that big of an impression on me. I feel bad about that but not guilty."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" is terribly overhyped. Naturally it is a phenomenal undertaking for a disabled Jean-Dominique Bauby, but it is far from a quality literary work. It reads more like a moneymaking venture if it was intended to be published; or marketing it as a literary work was the moneymaking venture. I will see the movie though in the hope that it is different from the book. This book certainly would not lift up the spirits of a convalescing disabled person."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Dear sir:My girl friend send back this book(The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (Vintage International) to amazon I wont send back my mony to my creditcard.Thanks"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"A marvelous book in which a man tells his personal experiences and thoughts in dealing with a stroke that left him completely paralysed,speechless and able only to move one eyelid. It is amazing that he found a way to tell his story and it will show the reader what a slender thread it is by which we all cling on to life. It is a wonderful moving read and will surely leave one with much to think about. I also read many of the very personal reviews that customers have written.When I finished reading this book,I was surprised that the author never mentioned whether or not he had any faith or belief system. He seemed to face all his rials,tribulations,and future prospects alone and without any support and comfort from a faith of any kind. To people of faith, their faith becomes very important at times like this; and they would find such an experience many times more difficult and hopeless without it. I was further surprised not to find this mentioned in any of the reviews.The following shows how a faith is so powerful in dealing with the things we are faced with in our journey through life.Footprints in the SandOne night a man had a dream.He dreamed he was walking along the beach with theLORDAcross the sky flashed scenes from his life.To each scene,he noticed two sets of footprints in thesand:One belonging to him and the other to the LORDWhen the last scene of his life flashed before himhe looked back,at the footprints in the sand.He noticed that many times along the path of his lifethere was only one set of footprints.He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest andsaddest times of his life.This really bothered him and he questioned the LORDabout it:\\"LORD\\", you said that once I decided to follow youyou'd walk with me all the way,But I noticed that during the most troublesometimes in my lifethere was only one set of footprintsI don't onderstand why when I needed you most youwould leave me.\\"The LORD replied.\\"My son, My precious child,I love you and I wouldnever leave you,During your times of trial and sufferingwhen you see only one set of footprints,it was there thatI carried you\\"."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This book was like being underwater.... with no life support.

I decided immediately that I have to read his book. I expected that I should be able to learn some lessons from someone who is approaching a final stage in his life. Lessons on what I should do or prepare when I still can. In this respect, the book disappoints me. There are very few lessons covered which we can learn from. What Mr. Bauby is trying to tell us is that the Butterfly (i.e. the mind) can still fly freely unrestricted by the paralyzed body. Except for some chapters, this book is just an ordinary book written by an ordinary writer who is in a perfect health.

His only means of communication -- his left eyelid. Bauby spent weeks painstakingly dictating this memoir -- letter by letter.I read this book in one sitting, it was that captivating. Through short vignettes, Bauby manages to describe the minute intimacies of his life in astonishing detail. From his first experience in a wheelchair, to bath-time, and finally through the development of his communication 'code' - Bauby's emotions touch on both anger and sadness without becomings desperate or hopeless.There are also times of hope and, ultimately, love -- when he describes the visits of his children or memories of this father. Throughout the book, I was struck by Bauby's ability to be thankful for small things -- the ability to move his limbs a fraction of an inch, sitting in the Cinecitta, and the the ability of his mind to fly away like a butterfly.It is not until the end of the book that Bauby describes his last day as a 'perfectly functioning earthling.' This most important day in his life is detailed with very little emotion. This makes the catastrophic details all the more haunting.This is one the most poignant memoirs that I have ever read, and one of my favorite books of 2008."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Absolutely amazing.

This book was written by a stroke victim who was paralized except for one eye-lid. He laboriously wrote the book with the help of a therapist who kept reading the alphabet and the author would blink his eye when she came to the right letter. In this way, he is probably the only completely paralized stroke victim who could transmit his feelings and memories. Since his brain and senses functioned perfectly, he was able to do this. If you think that this is a depressing book, you are wrong - it is really uplifting.

It is a an easy read, but I am reminded of the great effort it took to write it. God's mercy gave him strength to blink the book and his own grit gave him the spirit to finish it.

Cant help but wonder how the author is now."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This review is to allow the reader to gain their own information to help them decide if they want to read the book. I liked this book because my grandmother had a stroke a while ago and this helped me understand the life hardships are a stroke. In December 1995, Forty-Three year old Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor in chief of Elle and vigorous bon vivant tells the tale of his like after his stroke. The story comes after twenty days in a deep coma that he gradually regained consciousness from. This rare coma is called \\"locked-in syndrome\\" (LIS), a complication of a cerebrovascular accident in the base of the pons, a part of the brain stem. Although the patients' minds are alert and fully conscious, they are also quadriplegic, with lower-cranial-nerve palsies. Only vertical movements of the eyes and blinking are possible. His right eyelid was sutured shut to prevent corneal ulcerations, he was fed through a gastric tube, he drooled uncontrollably, he breathed through a tracheostomy tube, his urine drained from a catheter, and his bottom was wiped by others. One could say he was actually fairly lucky because, unlike most victims, he was still able to move one eyelid. It was able for him to work out a system of communication through winking and reading the alphabet at his own pace with a speech therapist. By using this cypher, he could meticulously spell out words, sentences, paragraphs and, finally, this memoir.He felt as if he was \\"trapped in a diving bell, but his mind was free as a butterfly\\". The amazing part of how this book was written is that Bauby wrote The Diving Bell and the Butterfly solely by blinking his left eye in response to the reading of an alphabet, arranged according to the frequency with which each letter occurs in French (E, S, A, R, I, . . . W). A friend read off the letters, pausing when Bauby blinked. Letters laboriously became words, and then sentences. In a seaside hospital, Bauby, \\"imprisoned in his paralyzed body\\", recounts his days. He notes that a stroke such as his is usually fatal, but \\"improved resuscitation techniques have prolonged and refined the agony\\".Now, instead of directing one of France's leading fashion magazines, he is strapped in a wheelchair, completely dependent on others for the simplest demands of life: \\"hut the door, roll me over, fluff up a pillow. He writes \\"A domestic event as commonplace as washing can trigger the most varied emotions.\\" And then there was the boor who, with a conclusive \\"Good night,\\" turned off the Bordeaux-Munich soccer game at halftime and left. Bauby's attendants dressed him not in hospital garb, but in his own clothes (\\"Good for the morale,\\" according to the neurologist). Bauby comments, \\"If I must drool, I may as well drool on cashmere.\\" He is, as he says, \\"a voiceless parrot who has made his nest in a dead-end corridor of the neurology department\\". When the stretcher-bearer who returns him to his room leaves with a hearty \\"Bon app&eacute;tit!\\" the effect on Bauby is the same as \\"saying \`Merry Christmas' on August 15.\\"Fed by two or three bags of brownish fluid instilled into a gastric tube, Bauby recalls his culinary skills -- boeuf en gel&eacute;e and homemade sausage -- and melon, red fruit, and oysters, but above all, sausage. He imagines spending a day with his children, lying in bed beside his lover, and flying to Hong Kong, and he dreams that Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, is performing a tracheotomy on him. In the Caf&eacute; de Flore, noxious gossip from the lower depths of Parisian snobbery poisons the air: \\"Did you know that Bauby is now a total vegetable?\\" Bauby, \\"to prove that my IQ was still higher than a turnip's,\\" begins a remarkable correspondence, not by pen but by blinks. \\"The arrival of the mail [had] the character of a hushed and holy ceremony.\\" Every sentence of this arduously written book is a jewel burnished by a rare disease and still rarer intelligence.The book's title mentions the comparisons he uses to define his position. The physical paralysis leaves him feeling as if he was \\"trapped within a diving bell, as if there is constant pressure pinning his body into immobility\\". Yet, at the same time, his cognizance remains as free as a butterfly and its voyages are as unsystematic. In fact, he names the chapters of this book his \\"bedridden travel notes\\" and, certainly, they expressively narrate his expedition through recollection.Although Bauby's condition is clearly inimitable, this book has widespread quality because his situation is itself a suitable image for the human condition. It is the quintessence of Man's predicament that our extremely perfectible thoughts are imprisoned inside such frail vessels of flesh and blood. For most of us, at most times, this annoying opposition, between that which makes us superhuman and that which makes us finite, waits in the contextual. The author has it driven crudely into the forefront, where it unavoidably controls his reality. This makes it all the more extraordinary that Bauby is talented enough to transcribe about his life with such countless comicality and kindness of soul with so minute resentment.Dominique Bauby croaked two days his book was published in France. The pages he left behind are one of the great testimonies to the glory and illustriousness of the human spirit. It annoys me when people tend to whine about the smallest things, he reminds us that even when life is frankly difficult, it is still quite gorgeous, helpful and well worth living. Bauby's book, for all the awfulness that we certainly sense at his position, is brilliantly positive and life affirming. Sure, there are a few instants of merited unhappiness, but they are almost entirely sheltered out by the author's lasting optimisms, imaginings and memories.I downloaded this book for a reading assignment for a neuroscience class because it was short. It turned out to be better than I thought and I learned about a new neurological case. The book is was very fascinating and well written on life without a working bod. The depressing and tumultuous locked-in syndrome once again shows how most of us need to go to these scary situations that threaten our lives to actually value the love, friendship and even simple things like the sun or sky. This book warns us about living life complacently and self-deluding ourselves about the important things all the while reminding people about thoughts in case they get out of these situations alive. Reading this gave me insight of how my grandmother's lifestyle after her stroke changed significantly. This is a book that will inspire any physician, medical student, nurse, or patient. In his own way he provides no self-pity or thought of physician-assisted suicide. The tone is as satirical and uneventful as the French tend to be."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I enjoyed this book. There were parts that were boring but just the small things were so effective in this book that it makes you realize what you take for granted. I really wished Mr. Bauby made it to the publication of his book."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This was an amazing book about loving life and accepting the circumstances one finds oneself in. Gently written story about paralyzed Jean-Dominique Bauby's new life as a prisoner in a \\"frozen\\" body. He was only able to move one eyelid and with the help of friends, wrote this book. It is funny, moving, and realistic all at once. I am keeping this one in my library to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This book read for me like a film, though not one of those fast-paced Hollywood ones fraught with frenetic camera work and the palpitating extremes of romance, nonstop action and the like. Rather, it read like a film with long and probing takes, where people and places are studied, lingered upon, absorbed.Jean-Dominique Bauby, once editor of the French fashion magazine Elle, has written a precious memoir in the Diving Bell and the Butterfly. This book is a reminder that those we often whisk past, prone on beds or cramped in wheelchairs, are indeed more aware and there and contemplative than we'd foolishly assume. Bauby mentions a few therapists (speech and physical) in chapters here and there, and they are thankfully portrayed as ones who are sensitive to the wit, the fury, the yearning that sings and seethes within his otherwise unmoving exterior. May all of us-- hospital staff or visitors, friends or family-- be ever reminded of the sanctity of life that strives forth in the most bleak of circumstances.jeremy Leggatt did a commendable job conveying the obvious humor and perspicacity of the French journalist and editor. Many clever turns of phrases had me chuckling out loud even as I shook my head in commiseration, was it?-- Talking about the word on the street of his \\"vegetable\\" status, for example, Bauby jokes that: \\"The word 'vegetable' must have tasted sweet on the know-it-all's tongue, for it came up several times between mouthfuls of Welsh rabbit.\\"Those looking to learn more about locked-in syndrome, which Bauby suffered from post-stroke, would do better to read a textbook; this memoir won't teach you about the medical details of or therapeutic techniques for the condition, but it will teach you to slow down and consider the angle of your lover's jaw, the flecks in your child's eye, the lazy dance of shadows across your walls."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell & the Butterfly{Book) This book was written by a comatose man who communicated by one eye!

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a must read kind of book. Its author did not write it in a conventional way. Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43 year old French man, who was the editor chief of Elle magazine in France, wrote this book with his eye lid. He suffered a stroke that caused him to lose the ability to control or move his entire body but one eye lid. His intellect was intact, and he could hear and see well. This condition is called locked-in syndrome, because the person is literally locked inside of his own body. A French phonoaudiologist taught Bauby how to \\"talk\\" using his eye lid, so he could communicate with the health team that was trying to help him. His close friends and family also learned how to understand this new way of talking. Bauby went on to dictate this book with his eye lid while one of his therapists wrote it down on paper. It is a beautiful story of how amazing the human mind is. How hard it is to have a perfect intelligent mind imprisoned in a broken body. Above all, it teaches us a lesson of how friendship and companionship are much more important than we seem to treat it. It taught me not to take life for granted."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I loved every page of this beautifully written, moving read.

Jean-Dominique Bauby provides a literal example of the figurative cage we all find ourselves trapped in at times. Though a prisoner of his own body he leads a life in his mind far more fulfilling than many could ever hope to, proving that the little things may perhaps be most important; the taste of a good wine, the feel of a warm bath, the ability to stroll a dim park in twilight, all things taken for granted fail to escape Bauby's fond recollection.His recounting of his past blends flawlessly with the reality of his present and serves to both contrast his life before and after his accident as well as iterate his unwillingness to surrender his hope facing a seemingly insurmountable tragedy.For those who fail to remember why life is worth living, for those who wish they could do more with what they have, this book is a vital source of reassurance and comfort that within us all is a world of wonder and a life unimaginably rich should we only chose to see it that way."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I learned for some men passion and lust is more important than love no matter how painful."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Its one of the few times that the movie adds to the book, both should be experienced and are inspirational"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This book is excellent in every way.

On the one hand, the chapter in the life of Jean-Do Bauby that this autobiographical piece captures is one which no decent person would wish on another human-being. Let alone imagine themselves having to live out. In this regard, this is a hero story of epic proportions.But as an author, and as the protagonist of the stories he chose to share, the Jean Bauby of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is something else entirely.I began the book with infinite amounts of sympathy for the man and his plight. By the end of the book I felt I had just finished reading some of the lower-rated sections of the Michelin Travel Guide.And this is the troubling part - is a person who reads this book and is left feeling less-than-inspired heartless and unfeeling? Or is the rave reviews of the book more because of the feat and life lived to create it and less because of the book itself?In the end I was left with the impression that the Jean Bauby as presented in the book was a difficult man to sympathize with. I am not a fan of the Randian hero, so perhaps this flavors my feelings, but I came to feel that the diving bell was no new feature in his life. It just affected his ability to connect and relate to others before it came to afflict his entire body.Ultimately, as a book, it was disappointing. And as a window into his diving bell, I can only hope or assume that there was more to the man than came through.For those who knew him, I'm sure it was a gift. But for the rest of us, I think that the emperor is naked."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I was so inspired by the premise, and I wondered what beautiful prose a man \\"locked in\\" would produce. Unfortunately, I found it average. The most inspirational part of the book was his willpower to write it, in his condition. It is also valuable to note how much he could think under the circumstances.His situation however, was not unique, though his case was more extreme than most.His life was not particularly inspirational - he seemed to live for fine cars and fine food and travel. A nice book, but probably more meaningful to his family and friends than the population at large.Look elsewhere for inspiration."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"To save you the time of reading this whole review, this book is definitely worth reading, but only as long as you are one who can handle the almost ADD writing style, which in my case, and the cases of several others, held my attention throughout and made this a very enjoyable read.This book, at least not to me, is not a book for those of you who want totally coherent plot throughout with a lot of deep meaning, but more of simply the memoirs of a man with \\"Locked in Syndrome\\", with him only being able to communicate with flickers of the eyelid and occasional guttural noises. Without giving anything away, it really emphasizes the fact that once some of your senses go, your other ones get stronger. In this case, he was unable to move or do anything physical, so what was coming back was his memories, extremely vivid memories, with a vividness far beyond what most people could describe yesterday's meal with. Even with all of this rich detail of memories, and the slow, slight recovery of Jean Dominique, the main character, it is far from being an inspirational storyline.Jean Dominique, or Jean Do, had a lackadaisical view on his condition, just going with the motions and not expressing much of either anger or sadness towards his condition, but at the same time, the book doesn't have much of a motivational point, it also doesn't have much of a somber tone to it either. Besides the obvious sadness that he was a quadriplegic who had children he left behind, he seemed to throw on no extra baggage throughout the story to throw a pity party for himself. He instead simply explains, making this, in a way a first person narrated documentary, simply explaining the process of what it is like to be locked in, without showing the feelings associated with a 1st person omniscient story.For the non-ADD readers, there are a few faults you may find in this book, many of these faults will be embraced by the highly ADD readers such as myself, jumping around in the story quite a bit. At some parts of the book, it was hard to tell what exactly was going on, jumping from the hospital to memories and other occurrences. Another fault you may find in this book is that it wasn't highly poetic and didn't require much interpretation of symbolism, a fault that again, someone with my attention span embraces. That is probably mostly due to the fact that he was blinking the entire novel in code, or it was the fact that he simply wanted his story heard. The Biggest fault though, one that I can't blame on Jean-Do, is the ending. Without spoiling it, it seems to be a fairly nonchalant ending to a lackadaisical book, evoking no form of an uplifting sensation nor very profound sadness upon the reader.All in all, a book for the easily distracted. One that, for those of you who enjoy short chapters with short attention spans, this book is for you. For those looking for a deep, meaningful, thought provoking inspirational book, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"bought this for my graduate independent media arts course and although i haven't read it yet, it seems worth reading. i hear the film is great."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Readers with souls will fully appreciate the gift that this author generously devoted his remaining time on earth to share with us. Without self pity or bitterness, Jean-Dominique Bauby courageously and vividly expresses his cherished identities (as writer/editor/father/husband/lover/ bon vivant) and eschews his forced exile as a paralyzed inmate in a special French hospital. This small book provides a useful and thought-provoking lesson for those too taken up with satisfying their own creature comforts to experience the richness of life that is passing them by. Read it and weep. Read it and learn. But most importantly, read it and celebrate life."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor of the French Elle magazine. Imagine what his life was; to be an arbiter of style, of what is chic, in that most glittering of cities, Paris. He consorted with the innest of the in crowd. He was one of the fates chosen ones. At the age of 43 he suffered a massive stroke that wiped out the abilities of his brain stem. He became of victim of \\"locked-in syndrome\\", where his mind continued to function as well as ever, but his only bodily ability was to blink his left eyelid and rotate his head slightly. He wrote this book after his stroke had robbed him of his former life. He names his mind \\"the butterfly\\" since it can still fly to exotic places, enjoy friends, remember sumptuous meals, and reflect on his current life which he calls, \\"the diving bell\\". The mechanics of writing this slim book are a testament to his determination. The French alphabet was arranged in order of frequency of usage. An assistant would read the alphabet to him. When the correct letter was reached, Bauby would blink his left eye. Painstaking letter by letter this book grew to document his thoughts on his life in the diving bell. Because the writing is so laborious, Bauby was forced to be economical with his words, yet his mind still wants to communicate so badly, \\"I need to feel strongly, to love and to admire, just as desperately as I need to breathe.\\"Bauby was never a saint, but robbed of everything, he is nothing more than a human trying to survive a horrible situation. Cut off from almost everyone and everything, he still manages to craft a life. One day, he inadvertently catches sight of his reflection in a window pane, \\"I saw the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde. His mouth was twisted, his nose damaged, his hair tousled, his gaze full of fear. One eye was sewn shut, the other goggled liked the doomed eye of Cain. For a moment I started at that dilated pupil, before I realized it was only mine. Whereupon a strange euphoria came over me. Not only was I exiled, paralyzed, mute, half deaf, deprived of all pleasures, and reduced to the existence of a jellyfish, but I was also horrible to behold.\\" Yet he allows us to fly with the butterfly as well. Even though the only way he can take nourishment is through a tube in his stomach, he sits down to the most wonderful meals. Since he is the cook, the food is always prepared perfectly. At the beginning of his enforced fast, he was gluttonous. He conjured up food all the time indiscriminately. Soon he learned to savor his pleasures though, imagining strawberries only in the early summer, celebrating autumn with oysters. The butterfly brings him not just food, but books, art, theatre, friends, family, hopes and desires. This book is such a quick read, but I think it is better read slowly, a few pages at a time. There are no great philosophical discussions to ponder in the book, only the most profound questions of all. What makes a human human? What makes a life worthwhile?"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Ok, so you've had a \\"hard day\\". Your car wouldn't start this morning, your wife or husband ignored you and didn't say \\"goodbye\\" or \\"hello\\" let alone \\"I love you\\", your kids demanded candy and toys and cried \\"I hate you\\" when you didn't give in to them, your job is boring, your life is boring, no one likes you let alone loves you, your paycheck was deducted for a traffic ticket and you received 10 utility bills today in the mail, your credit card debt is going up and up every month...and you feel \\"sorry for yourself\\"...\\"Oh, what a hard life I have!\\" Then, read this book! The writer of the book suffered a massive stroke to his \\"brain stem\\" which took away ALL movement except for the ability to wink ONE eye! He can't stand up, he can't move ANY part of his body except for the one eye, he can't speak, his hearing is impaired allowing him to understand voices that are close by while all other noises are distorted and torture him by being too loud, and the list goes on. Sundays are his worst days because no doctors or physical therapists or anyone else visits him so he's basically alone in a hospital bed all day with nothing to do but think about the past, and so forth. So, you THINK you had a \\"bad day\\"!!! But, he copes. He can write using his ONE eyelid by blinking when someone says the letters of a word he wants to write. He wrote this book to tell us all what it is like to experience \\"locked-in syndrome\\". And it \\"aint\\" fun! But, he copes. And he thinks and he remembers and his MIND is like a butterfly that can fly to anywhere he wants it to go! So, he finds solace and \\"meaning\\" in his \\"hospital bed locked- in life\\". So, you think, \\"if there's hope for this guy to have a life, what about me who can use all my faculties, am surrounded by interesting things to do and places to go, and can enjoy talking with people and eat ice-cream and do all type of things that this other \\"locked in\\" guy can't do.\\" So, you put the book down, you stop feeling sorry for yourself, and you are happier from reading his book!

Three weeks later he re-surfaced in a hospital bed in northern France locked within a body rendered immobile, save for the left eyelid. But despite the horror of his condition, he was determined to communicate his story and to dispel the irritating rumours circulating Paris that he had become a &quot;vegetable&quot;. He set about &quot;dictating&quot; tracts of text pre-written in his head by blinking through each letter of the alphabet. Three arduous months later, The Diving Bell And The Butterfly was complete.The book is a stunningly lucid collection of reminiscences, yearnings and descriptions made all the more moving by the knowledge that, a matter of days after it was published, Bauby died.Although he lived his last year in a phantom-like state, a fly on the wall of his own shattered life, he did not descend into maudlin self-pity. Far from it. During his ordeal, he could not even reach out and touch his children or engage friends in conversation (&quot;...my communication system disqualifies repartee: the keenest rapier grows dull and falls flat when it takes several minutes to thrust it home.&quot;) but his writings are more illuminating than depressing, more analytical than self serving.With almost unearthly clarity he captures, as concisely as anyone before him, the true essence of life. The irrevocable confines of his near-useless body induce in him a heightened awareness of what it means to love, a tormented longing to perform the most simple physical acts and a continuous series of sanity-preserving flights of fancy.&quot;I am fading away. Slowly but surely. Like the sailor who watches his home shore gradually disappear, I watch my past recede. My old life still burns within me, but more and more of it is reduced to the ashes of memory.&quot;Despite the tragedy of his story, Bauby has left something beautiful behind. We all have something to learn."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" would be one of literature's achievements if only for how it came to life. Former Elle editor Jean-Dominique Bauby dictated it letter by letter to his assistant Claude using an alphabet variation he describes (and one hard to master as Bauby acknowledges in one vignette.) Its 129 pages consist of one to two page episodes describing piece by piece how \\"locked-in\\" syndrome, caused by a brain stem accident, transformed Elle editor Bauby's cosmopolitan life to one of memories and fantasies within the \\"diving bell\\" of his body.Within that \\"diving bell,\\" Bauby holds the irony and humor of any sophisticate or executive. His stories are never cloying or mawkish even when telling of his heartbreaking day at the beach with his children or his dread of Sundays without visitors or even staff. Rather, his sardonic humor allows him to see personal and professional foibles (staff members striking Elvis poses, nurses waking him for a sleeping bill, colleagues finding it hard to see him as he is now) in a new light.But the book is best when Bauby's mind travels the world above his bed to fantasies and an outside life slipping from him. He races Formula One cars, recreates scenes from the \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" and other books and films, savors his remaining senses to smell and taste foods he loves even while fed through a tube. (Sounds aren't lost to him either; his daughter's singing and even classic Beatles tunes play heavily into Bauby's memories and new life.)\\"The Diver Bell and the Butterfly\\" is as powerful a pro-life argument as has been written. It examines the frustration and resilience of any one who lost their ability to command their bodies. Enthusiastically recommended, but I'd also welcome an expanded version with those knowing and working closely with Bauby until his death."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby, the late editor of French Elle Magazine, suffered a catastrophic stroke leaving him with \\"shut in\\" syndrome. This tragic syndrome leaves the mind intact but renders the body immoveable. Bauby, using a symbol system with his eyelid, was able to dictate this memoir. The book discusses his ideas of his illness experience as well as the way his body interacted with the world around him. The title offers a metaphor for his condition, while the body is trapped, submerged by illness, the mind remains able to sail free.I think that many readers will find this book astonishing. Some will find it an inspiration. My critique of it might be that Bauby explores his memories, his dreams, and his relationships but excludes more philosophical reflections on the sudden and largely permanent absence of the body itself."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean Dominque Bauby's book was phenmonal. I have never read a book like it. It taught me not to take life for granted and take time to awknowledge the little things. This was a masterpiece of a book. It was a quick, good read. It took me an hour to read it. I couldn't put it down. I have recommended this book to all of my friends. Bauby's kids and wife should be extremely proud of him to take the courage and determination to tell his story to the world. I'm sorry that Mr. Bauby has passed away, but the world will awknowledge him, and maybe his message about life will leave a lasting impression."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Weary of the in-house feuding, preciousness, and self-absorption of so many \\"professional\\" book reviewers, I quit reading literary magazines some years ago. For the most part, I don't regret my decision. But one of its costs is that I sometimes discover gems later than I otherwise might've. One of those gems, which just came my way, is Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.Bauby's memoir has so many dimensions. It's an eloquent testimony to human endurance and heroism. It's a meditation on the relationship between mind and body. It's a real-life exercise in Proustian memory. It's a heartbreaker, but it's also genuinely funny in places.But what fascinates me most about this incredible book is Bauby's reflections on what it means to have a self. So much of who we are is wrapped up in our body-awareness (just as so much of what we think we know about others comes from our awareness of their bodies). When the body becomes a diving bell, a prison over which we have no control and to which we feel (quite literally) no connection, what does it do to our sense of personal identity? The Cartesians among us who think that we're essentially mind may not feel as if the self is compromised when the body is locked down. But Bauby (and I) doubt it. We're not disincarnate spirits. We're enfleshed creatures, and when we lose our embodiment--our ability to eat, to feel wetness or softness, to experience physical intimacy with the beloved, to \\"own\\" our bodies--we lose something essential. Acquiring \\"butterfly hearing\\" (p. 97), an enhanced sensitivity to one's memories and thoughts that allows one to temporarily transcend paralysis, is fortunate. But it is, after all, compensatory.At one point, someone who's telephones Bauby anxiously asks him: \\"Are you there, Jean-Do?\\" Bauby's internal response: \\"I have to admit that at times I do not know anymore.\\" (p. 42)Highly recommended. Readers might also want to take a look at Richard Cohen's just-published Strong at the Broken Places: Voices of Illness, A Chorus of Hope."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The ONLY problem with this book is... that's too short. I could read more and more."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"When I bought my copy of The Diving Bell And The Butterfly it was for research purposes. I intended to write about (and am writing about) someone with locked-in syndrome.To help me decide that this was the book for me, the publishers had generously placed on the cover the recommendation from someone at the FT who had said it was 'one of the great books of the century'.It's certainly a very moving book and, should you want to dig into what is said, a profound one. Reading about someone who can't move their body, has hearing issues and can only use one eye (for seeing and for blinking out the story) it's difficult not to think about life and it's many facets.The story is a surprisingly light read in many ways, a very easy and gentle passage from beginning to end. The style is descriptive and personal, yet slightly removed from real anguish and joy. Hard not to be impressed by Bauby's philosophical stance.Here's a quote about when he first sees his reflection after the massive stroke that left him in his condition:'Not only was I exiled, paralysed, mute, half deaf, deprived of all pleasures and reduced to a jelly-fish existence, but I was also horrible to behold.'There's a rather dry humour in the statement and it's a humour than runs right through the piece.My favourite chapter is about Bauby and a colleague of his who spend a day at the races. The newspaper they run has a sports reporter who knows his horses and the whole of the office is relying on the duo to get their bets down for the big event. The section tells a lot about who Bauby was before the stroke as well as much about how he was afterwards.I was struck by the tenderness and also by the absolute frustration of a man who has young children and how the love they share is tested and stretched. Not to mention that he knows he shan't see his father again - young Bauby is in his prison and his dad is too frail to leave his apartment.There's a reminder right through this that whoever we may be, it's likely that there'll be a time when all our memories are distilled into short measures. The people we have been will have faded and we'll have to manage to make the most of what we are left with and what we remember. It's a reminder that when a person is wheeled passed us that however misshapen or twisted the body might be, the mind might be sharp and active on the inside. And if we need to treat the most vulnerable members of our world with respect, shouldn't we also try and apply such principles to everyone?I work in a school with an 'Exceptional Needs' unit and try to be smiley and positive every time I see the kids there. What I feel I need to do from now is to take that a little further in terms of the communications I offer.Another thing occurred to me as I was reading. It provided an excellent mirror to hold up to Stona Fitch's excellent 'Senseless', highlighting just what a well-written tale that is.It took only a couple of hours to complete and is broken into very neat chapters (I guess the act of blinking out a story is exhausting), but I'd recommend it to anyone who's feeling a little sorry for themselves, anyone who likes descriptions that border on the poetic and anyone who has ever wondered just how bad a Sunday can get.It's not even close to being the greatest book of the century. Maybe not even that close to being the best book of its year, or even month. Still, I think you might benefit from a read of it. Digest it and go out there and try and make the most of your day. I for one will be trying."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Just a quick note to say that Jeremy Leggatt, the marvellous, witty and erudite award-winning translation of this book, died recently in Texas (a long way from Cornwall).

You will not put down the book and think, \\"Wow, it blew my mind.\\" It's not the I Ching, for Pete's sake. It's a book 'dictated' by a man who could only blink one eye to a transcriber who went over the alphabet letter by letter a gajillion times until his work was done. What comes to life in the pages is the deep and stoic spirit of a man who had until recently held a position that dripped with superficiality and BS as the editor of Elle, a magazine devoted to the world of the frivolous. But there are no reminiscences of models or late-night parties here. Instead, there are stories of his children, friends who love him yet fear the newly silent person they see before them, stories of a day spent at the seaside sucking in the scent of french fries. I was charmed by M. Bauby and am thankful the book was put into the hands of such a skilled translator. French is a quick, lyrical language, and the English version appears to retain the scent of the original. When I turned the last page I was lying in bed at night and couldn't stop myself from crying, something I didn't feel at all during the movie. So much lost to him.

With the help of a caring nurse he looks back at a life of materialism, adultery and shallow values overall.For years, Bauby was the editor of 'Elle', the French equivalent to 'Vogue Magazine'. Now, with scarcely a visitor and left to his own thoughts and feelings, he becomes more alive than when he went busily from thing to thing following the money, the beautiful people and never a thought of values or personal integrity.This book is an homage to resiliency and, as Roethke says, \\"nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance\\"."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This is a very inspiring and amazing book.

Bauby's efforts provide helpful information to health care providers as well as to those with loved ones who are caught in the throes of locked-in syndrome which may be experienced by some stroke victims.

I watchedthe moviebefore reading the book.Fool.Problem is, I preferred the film. By quite some distance.The mere existence of the The Diving-bell and the Butterfly is, of course, remarkable. As you no doubt know Jean-Dominique Bauby 'dictated' the whole thing by winking - the rest of his body paralysed by locked-in syndrome. It became an international bestseller.As an account of this rare condition, as a memoir of a man mentally alert and eloquent but physically inert, it is fascinating. It is slight, for obvious reasons, but the short episodic chapters work well. The author manages to weave in just enough back story (the before) for us to better appreciate the impact of the syndrome (the after) but you can't get away from the fact that there isn't a great deal here.The film makers clearly agreed and added a fair amount of, perhaps fabricated (?), material to flesh out the story. Which brings me back to my initial problem. The best bits of the movie - the tension between his wife and his lover, the imposition of a religious doctor - are not in the book at all.If I have approached these two versions the other way round I may have felt differently. But I didn't. So I find myself impressed, but slightly short changed."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"A whopping five stars for Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, his story was legitimately inspiring and moving. Bauby is the last person you would think to be an author, considering his condition, but he pulls the role off well, using clever humor, deep metaphors and thoughtful irony. The story makes you think about everything that we take for granted on a day to day basis, the right to rustle our kids' hair, kiss our loved ones, and chew our food.Bauby was a French editor for a magazine, until he had a stroke at 44, paralyzing him completely, except for his left eye. He was one of few people to ever suffer from locked in syndrome, a case in which the victim is conscious and aware of his surroundings, but unable to move. Bauby expresses his syndrome, with the metaphor of a diving bell, which is his body, his trap, his casket, and a butterfly, which expresses his freedom of thought, and expression through speech therapy, his hope and dream that one day like a butterfly he will break out of his cocoon.Bauby used his eyes to write the book, thinking the thoughts and blinking them to a translator who wrote them down, even in his state he found the will power to write a book, express his thoughts and feelings. The book is full of humor which is unexpected coming from a paraplegic. It has moments of self pity which is completely understandable and expectable, but the self pity is not so overwhelming that it becomes the focus.The story teaches us to live in the moment, with no regrets, not taking each breath for granted, because life can be taken from you in the blink of an eye. It allows us to wonder exactly how helpful new technologies are, prolonging life, but a life with agony. If you are looking for a book full of good times that is completely uplifting this is not it, however this story is brutally honest, at parts depressing, but extremely moving, and well written. Once you start you are hooked, and pages just keep turning. It packs the biggest punch for a piece of writing its size that I have ever seen, for that it Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly gets five stars."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This man surely lived his destiny, be it a sad one. Without Jeremy Leggatt's accident and subsequent experiences we would not have the insight of living the life he did and be poorer for it.

For Bauby, all those outlets were cut off in a blink of an eye by a cataclysmic stroke; only through his ability to blink one eye did he retain one tenuous line of communication with the world around him. I understand why Bauby wrote this book, why he needed so badly to communicate with us. I marvel at the tenacity and focus and spirit that allowed him to do it. If you have any doubts about this book, give it a try: it's a short read and, in my opinion, it will make you appreciate the little things in your life all that much more."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I am a victim of a severe traumatic brain injury and a series of strokes. I identified with Bauby. I did not have a brain stem stroke like he had, but, I have a lot of the same symptoms because of the numerous brain lesions I do have. I thought his accounts of pain and his feelings of great loss were eloquently expressed. I became choked up several times, but I know that is not what he would have wanted. I never once felt sympathy for him, I only felt glad I was able to share some small space of humanity with him for a few moments.

My husband picked this book up and couldn't read it because he thought it would be depressing. My parents lent us this book to share their excitement over being inspired by this man, this author. It is with caution that I picked up this book as I was not in a mood to cry.I didn't cry. But it did leave a lasting impression on me though. A man who is alive, perhaps more alive than most of us are, trapped in his body that he called like living under a diving bell, manages to create a lasting beautiful memoir of a man deeply alive till his last moments. It doesn't matter that he couldn't get up nor talk. He still feeled and ached in his mind and he was truly a human being though his body failed him. By this, I mean, he refused to allow despair to overtake him and rob him of the joys of living his last days. He chose to find beauty in the simplest things. He chose to remember his life and created new stories to amuse himself and possibly others. Not till the end, did he mention how it all happened.This is truly an inspiring little gem of a book. I didn't take it as a political book but as a reminder that life is indeed fragile and fleeting. It is possible to live to the fullest in spite of pain and grief and being locked down in one's body. Beauty isn't necessarily physical but it is spiritual. And this is a very spiritual book where it celebrates life.2/17/08"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"To quote the New York TImes: \\"A wistful, poetic, ironic and whimsically affirmative testament by a man who refused to die in spirit.\\" If you have ever thought that your life was a shambles, that you had a physical infirmity that totally depressed you - read this book.

I ran across this 1998 or '99 and read it faster than I read most books. I was enthralled and engaged fully by Bauby's vivid imagination. I wound up raving about this book for years to anyone who would listen.When all you left is imagination and you are gifted with the ability to describe your visions and dreams, you wind up 'writing' a book like this. The kinds of dreams, hopes and emotions Bauby experiences is so incredibly deep, honest and telling. The gift he leaves the reader is their ability to genuinely feel the alienation and abandonment of the world all while feeling at one with body, mind, earth, life, love and death. The thing that you walk away from, after reading this book, is nothing short of an amazing epiphany.UPDATE: I saw that Universal announced they will make this into a movie. To top it off, Johnny Depp will be Bauby. It won't be coming out for two years or so, but it will be worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"Jean-Dominique Bauby has a sense of humor far greater then any other author I have read, taken from the events that have happened in his life the good, bad, and the hard times.

While I read this book I get a sense of what his life was like, the pain he went through, and the joy he experienced.

With the use of this one small link to the outside world and his determination to continue living a full life, if only in his mind, he sets out to write this memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, one letter at a time.

How this man decides to write a book while he is sick, and provide a rare insite into his condition. Amazingly the writer decides against portraying a sad picture of his condition(though at times he can't help it) and entertains by making the narration funny, just for the sake of his readers.Reading this book has been a very humbling experience and I would suggest this to everyone I know. Hats off to the spirit of the writer.

My amazement quickly overcame my curiosity as I immediately became entranced by the elegance and simplicity with which Mssr. Bauby described his plight and daily life. It is obvious that his curiousity and zest for life was not diminished by his physical condition. I was left with an extraordinary sense of hopefulness, and my only regret was that the book was not 5 times longer.

I tried to imagine what this would be like, but until I read his heart-rendering story I couldnt contemplate the nightmare in which he was living.The book, although very short, held me in its grasp, I cried when I read the passage where he talked about playing hangman with his son, and how angry and sad he was that his condition had taken away his right to touch his own sons face. I laughed when he described his day trip out to the beach, just so he could smell the french fries, but mostly I stood back and admired this man who's body had been so cruely ravaged by a stroke, but who's mind remained alert.This book serves as a testament that we should live life a day at a time, because you never know what is around the corner.Teresa Mitchell (teresa.mitchell@britcoun.org"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"This is a book about the essential, perceived in a world of silence and motion-less. A book about ourselves and the ultimate values. A book about love and life when they became memories"},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"On December 8th, 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, the forty-three-year-old editor-in-chief of the French Elle, suffered a massive stroke that damaged his brain stem and left him a quadriplegic. Bauby could no longer speak, but his intellect remained intact, trapped inside the \\"diving bell\\" of his body. He could shake his head and blink his left eye, and he was able to spell out complex thoughts by blinking when an interlocutor, running a finger across an alphabet board, pointed to the correct letter. During the summer of 1996 Bauby wrote a memoir of his incapacitation, \\"dictating\\" by eye blink, letter by letter, the prose he had composed mentally. Bauby writes about his life as a quadriplegic: the searing moment when he realized what everyone else around him already knew, that he wasn't going to regain his speech or mobility; his stints in physical therapy and speech therapy; the indignations of being helpless. He is not self-pitying, but very much aware of the horror of his situation and of what is going on around him.\\"And then one afternoon...an unknown face interposed itself between us. Reflected in the glass I saw the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde. His mouth was twisted, his nose damaged, his hair tousled, his gaze full of fear. One eye was sewn shut, the other goggled like the doomed eye of Cain. For a moment I stared at that dilated pupil, before I realized it was only mine.\\"Whereupon a strange euphoria came over me. Not only was I exiled, paralyzed, mute, half deaf, deprived of all pleasures, and reduced to the existence of a jellyfish, but I was also horrible to behold. There comes a time when the heaping up of calamities brings on uncontrollable nervous laughter--when, after a final blow from fate, we decide to treat it all as a joke.\\"Bauby juxtaposes reminiscences from his previous life--much of it spent traveling the world--with descriptions of the hospital, Berck-sur-Mer, which has become his universe. And he describes the phone calls he receives from friends and family--his ninety-two year old father, whose voice quivers on the phone, his eight-year-old daughter telling him about her pony. He can't respond. Of course, it's his interactions with his two children that are most heart-breaking:\\"As soon as we slow down, C&eacute;leste cradles my head in her bare arms, covers my forehead with noisy kisses, and says over and over, 'You're my dad, you're my dad,' as if in incantation.\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a short book which, for all its author's labors in dictating it, won't take you more than a couple hours to read.

However, it took an extraordinary effort to write it. Reading it is a humbling and insightful experience. We read of how a man lost all function, except one eyelid. And despite being seemingly imprisoned in a paralyzed body, he still had an active and free mind. Most of the book tells of how he escaped the drudgery of his overall condition and daily routine by traveling the highways of memories within his mind. He not only reflected on life, but continued to live as best as he could. I am thankful that Mr. Bauby shared his experience w/ others. I found it to be humbling, uplifting and humorous reading."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a testament to the power of the human imagination, which, after a stroke that leaves him completely paralyzed, is all the author has left. Bauby records his thoughts and dreams in little vignettes, each one a clever little slice of his daily life. Despite the depressing nature of his locked-in syndrome, Bauby is surprisingly funny (I laughed aloud several times), and his prose is light and jaunty. The book skips along at a brisk pace and can be read in one or two sittings. One comes away from the book admiring a man with such courage and mourning the fact that he is no longer with us."},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"It is impossible for me to separate out the content of this book from the manner in which it was written - dictated one letter at a time by blinking after a massive stroke. It is a book both triumphant and acutely sad, and although a quick read in real time, the narrative plays on the theme of time itself, forcing you to slow down for the duration of the read and consider the implications of being trapped by your own body and stripped of both movement and a spontaneous voice - a prospect any sane mind, mine included, instinctively shies away from. It is not a comfortable read - it is too sobering for that - but it a contemplative one.

I did not finish it feeling inspired though. What I did walk away with, was a big question of \`why.' Dictating this book letter-by-painful-letter, why did he chose the topics he did?

He had a life of such exquisite privilege before his stroke -- even the stroke itself took place in a brand new BMW.

He uses this book to express his feelings after suffering a stroke. This book will make you create in your mind a real meaning of the most simple things and events that every human being goes through in their lives, helping you to understand the continuation of freedom and life without the use of our bodies.In his memoirs, Bauby describes how his concept of life, family, friends, work, and religion changed after his stoke, when he became a victim of locked- in syndrome. In December 1995 the former editor of the magazine Elle suffered a stroke and became paralyzed. The only way of communication with the exterior world, was his left eye. Based on the life of Stephen Hawking and the way he communicated, Bauby found his way to express himself through the blink of his left eye to let the world know that although he was paralyzed and became \\"exiled, paralyzed, mute, half deaf, deprived of all pleasures, and reduced to the existence of a jellyfish,\\" inside of his mind he was still free.Bauby found a poetic, humorous, and honest way to express his feeling and his new life.His attitude was sometimes positive, sentimental and full of imagination, but also changed drastically into an ironic and sarcastic way of narrating his daily routine. He laughs at himself and what people around him think the real meaning of life is \\"Some of them are serious in tone, discussing the meaning of life, invoking the supremacy of the soul, the mystery of every existence. And by a curious reversal, the people who focus most closely on these fundamental questions tend to be people I had known only superficially.\\""},{"Title":"The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death","review":"I have a friend who contracted botulism.

From the description of how he wrote the book (selecting one letter at a time by blinking once a nurse touches the right letter on a board) to the travels with his family in the French countryside, the author gives us an elegant exclamation that even imperfect lives can be filled with beauty, awe, and adventure.

She meets the son of the owner and breaks all the rules, and a simple, boring assignment turns into an investigation of murder, possible terrorism, and leads her to a man who can understand and help her heal.The story is dense, emotional, and exciting--all things I've come to expect from this author."},{"Title":"Dead Heat (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Of the three former FBI Agents who formed Partners in Crime, Daphne Donovan is the most reluctant as she holds herself culpable for what happened in New York on 9/11.

Her current assignment is to investigate Nicole Solem, the fianc&eacute;e of Naples, Florida banker Keith Melman who was burned once by a cheating spouse.However, Daphne is not the only one observing Nicole. Former chemist Jenna Marisol blames Nicole's father for the deaths of her spouse, two children, and her mother though she dispatched the latter.

I was taking a law class on disability law, and the second footnote in the required text was on this book. That intrigued me, and when I read the reviews about the book, I was even more intrigued. This book is a must-read for anyone who might or does work with the disabled. We no longer want the pity, the institutions, and the exclusion from society. We want to be viewed as normal except with one part or a few parts that may not function as some would consider normal. We want an equal education, equal opportunity to jobs, equal opportunities to participate in society. And everyone will be the better for it. Mr Shapiro as a non-disabled person, wrote a book that was compassionate but strived hard to see things from our point of view. This ability probably stands him in good stead as a journalist. He even taught me things I didn't know about other disabilities. Educators, lawyers, politicians, parents, social workers, and health care professionals need to get off their duff and read this book. They can no longer turn a blind eye or claim ignorance as an excuse to not allowing those of us with differences our rights under the law."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"In regards to the review by Cindy Heilman below, it is apparent that you missed a major point of this book. When you state that \\"Neither the disabled, homosexuals, nor adoptees are the target of lynching, Jim Crow laws, fire engine hosing, or vicious police dogs.\\"You must have missed the disability history about Nazi death camps, false imprisonments in institutions, forced sterilization, abuse by caregivers, death by neglect, murder of those with mental disabilities thought to be under demonic controls, murder of disabled children in underdeveloped countries, the list goes on and on. I'm not an expert on the experiences of gays and adoptees, but as far as gays...it seems they face some of the most violent crimes that helped institute hate crime statutes. The history of African-Americans has been tragic and an embarrassment for our country, but they are certainly not alone in facing hatred and violent discrimination.As for your statement regarding the difference in abilities justifies unequal treatment, you are missing the point that we all have differing abilities and must find ways to use our assets to contribute to society and accommodate our weaknesses. This holds true for any college student who has picked a major that accommodates their strengths while downplaying their weaknesses or any member of any sports team who picks the position that will give the team the best advantage. Disabled people are not asking for unfair advantages, they are asking for equal access. A level playing field. The same opportunities to build on their strengths and contribute to the society that has blocked them out. Even under horrendous Jim Crow Laws, African-Americans were sometimes allowed to go into the back of a restuarant and be served. People with disabilities aren't even allowed to the resturant door sometimes. Although their is a uniqueness to some of the issues surrounding disability, the civil rights aspect of amicus and access are exactly the same.Read \\"Make them go away\\" by Mary Johnson for a more straightforward, updated essay on this situation if you still don't understand."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"Four years ago this book was part of a class taught by James McLeskey that changed my life. Because this book is so well written, and because it time after time moved me into zones of cognitive dissonance about what I knew and about what I believed, it had the effect of making me incredibly uncomfortable about my own unrecognized prejuidaces concerning folks with disabilities. As Shapiro says, it is the only minority group which we can join at any time, and the older we live, the more likely we are to acquire disabilities. I currently teach classes about inclusion of students with special needs in general education classrooms, and this book has received rave reviews from many students and made many others angry. As a teacher hoping to open space for questioning, that's exactly what I want in a book."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"My perception has changed in ways immeasurable in regards to people with disabilities.

The 1994 book covers history, policies, and the interdependence we have together.Judy Heumann and Evan Kemp recommended this to me in 1990's, and my eyes were opened wide after I read it. Ch. 1 and Tinytimism (as I call it)applies to many groups. Some call it 'Uncle Tom','assimilationist', or other. 'No Pity' describes why the charity model is fatalistic and damaging. You can see this played out in the Congress about 'welfare', 'healthcare', Clint Eastwood's attack on the ADA, and 'special needs'.Sorry folks - we just want what you think we have, but we don't really have it: civil, legal, accessible, culturally affirming human rights.Even if you have a disability, it is vital to read the sections that you think you know- and definately read the ones you don't know. Anyone working in health care, Addiction, Mental Health, VA, CILS, advocacy for any disability related group should read this first.My only regret was I didn't read it sooner.Access is a civil right and an attitude, not just a ramp (TM)!"},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"Its important for anyone who wants to read about the disability rights movement that this is first book to read, even if one has a negative impression of it. The goal of the independent living movement as identified in the book is for full community integration for people with disabilities and complete civil rights and equal rights. Unfortunately when one reads about the disability rights movement, there is talk about \\"politically correct language\\", \\"burdensome lawsuits\\" and the like and I can't deny that these things happen (as with any movement there are extremists and people who focus on surface issues) but \\"No Pity\\" details the independent living movement starting with Ed Roberts (who had been paralyzed to the point where he required a respirator, then called an iron lung, his whole life) who founded the independent living movement from scratch and from there, there were networks of these centers and now they are a vital resource. And its not just linguistics but the thinking behind them, empowerment, integration and the idea that disability is ultimately a universal experience. And the important thing is for every negative experience you hear about you can read about workable constructive solutions, many of which save taxpayer's money and put people to work and most importantly people with disabilities being thought of not as \\"the other\\" but as people in general. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you have a negative impression of the disability rights movement why not read through \\"No Pity\\" and then post a review after as you'll have a fuller understanding. And as a disability rights activist myself and someone who has pushed for the Olmstead Decision, Mental Health Parity and the upcoming Community Choice Act whom many of the people discussed in here initiated (you can look up these terms for more information) you can see that the end goal is yet another civil rights movement with equality and social justice as the end goal and a community that people often eventually become a part of as disability is a universal experience. So take a fresh mindset, read this and know that much has been achieved and much remains to but often the first steps towards understanding people with disabilities must come from self acceptance and a willingness to understand new ideas. This primer will give you some key ideas and if you are a person with a disability yourself, in understanding the term \\"no pity\\" you may understand the essential empowering nature of the ever expanding freedoms that are part of America and want in whatever way you can contribute.

I found this a fascinating read. I have yet to find a well rounded, well written, history book about people with special needs, and this book delivers. Although it took me a long time to process and read through the abundance of information Shapiro provided, it was interesting and complete for the time it was written. I would love to read an updated version of this book or a continuation of this book because it was dated. The book was written in 1993, just a short time after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There have been so many new developments and new policies since 1993 that this book contains a huge gap in its all important story. Many of the references and issues Shapiro brought up are obsolete now in 2008, and I don't know which issues. I also know there are many new issues and laws that have drastically changed the lives of many people with special needs and I would love to find a resource as well written as No Pity that would explain the impact of these new developments."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"This book was introduced during Disability Awareness Month by my employer, an international bank. I myself have a hearing impairment and use hearing aids. Since I am not deaf but I am not all-hearing, people don't understand the levels of hearing or how the hearing impaired hear. Even I myself have experienced ignorance by others lack of understanding and knowledge. I had so many aha moments while reading this book. I also learned a great deal about other disabilities that I just had no idea and could not even conceive the struggles. The double amputee being thrown on a baggage dollie, like a sack of potatoes, the poster children being used to show a camparison, the wheel chair population being stranded without public access were all stories that I had just not thought about. Unlike one of the previous reviews, who didn't like the comparison to other groups who experienced discrimation, I thought Mr Shapiro did a great job. Since our American society is more sensitive to the struggles of the African American commnunity.......... and ignorant to disability discrimination, it helps the reader to look inside and see ones own lack of understanding and short comings. I find it interesting that people with disabilities all seem to have positive comments regarding this book (that being us who live it) and others who are not disabled critizise. And to the reviewer who was offended by the comparison..........really? Why is it that you can not find compassion for people with disabilities? Can't you offer to this group, \\"I understand your struggle\\"? The book was not about showing who had it the worst (feel sorry for me). After all, it's perfect title is \\"No Pity\\". It's about acceptance. My son had a sitter when he was an infant who is blind. She was very capable of providing love and care for my infant son. I have experienced discrimination at school and at work, and even our management team and HR turned a blind eye. If I was being discriminated for other reasons under ADA, there would be no or less hesitation. But that's my road to travel. I have a sister who was born deaf, my sibling's brother was born with mental retardation and lived in an institution all his short life. I am also the daughter of murderer, a unwed/single mother of a bi-racial son, and a birth mom, all of which I have been treated differently and looked upon with unacceptance so I understand judging people.

I am reading this as one of my main textbooks for a course I am taking about Disabilities in America. It is the correct and appropriate text for the course."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"No Pity is a difficult book to discuss or review briefly. Joseph Shapiro, a journalist who has written extensively on the disability rights movement, gives us a sweeping look at the changes people with disabilities have experienced over the last several decades, both in terms of legal rights and the perceptions of others. Although much has changed since No Pity was published in 1993, Shapiro captures the biggest changes of the 20th century, especially leading up to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.One of the major themes of the book, whether Shapiro is talking about people with blindness, deafness, paraplegia, or other disabilities, is disability as identity. As the title implies, the disabled rights movement is a movement away from pity. The poster children of telethons, the sad fund-raising appeals, the billboards of some charities, all send the message that a disability is something to be cured, to be overcome. People with disabilities object to a message that they are less than whole, that they need fixing. To them, their disability is what makes them who they are.Feelings run quite strong with many. Some object to efforts toward a cure. For instance, \\"many deaf people abhor [cochlear implants] as suggesting that deafness is a pathology, something to be corrected or eliminated.\\" They view it as cultural murder, even genocide, of deaf culture. Some disability rights activists are even critical of injury prevention research, saying that \\"to prevent disability is to suggest there is something pejorative about it.\\" Others object to very expensive technological means to assist in mobility, citing the low success rates in healing spinal cord injury and arguing that such expenditures should be used for the vast majority who can't be helped by advanced technology.This perspective leaves me in a quandary. Like Shapiro and the subjects of his book, I want people with disabilities to be involved in society, to work, and to have opportunities to engage others, disabled or not. But is there not an objective sense in which to see is better than not to see? To hear is better than not to hear? To walk is better than not to be able to walk? I don't mean to imply that one who can see, hear, or walk is better than one who can't. But if I were to lose my sight or hearing, I would certainly like to regain it. On a personal level, my daughter has an array of disabilities, including difficulty walking, inability to speak, etc. I know, as many individuals with disabilities would agree, that her disabilities have made her who she is, and I do love who she is. But wouldn't it be great if she could sing, talk to her friends, eat normal food, and run around and play like her peers do? Shapiro quotes people who say something like, If you could wave a magic wand and take away my disability, I would refuse that, because this is who I am. But if I could wave a magic wand and take away my daughter's disabilities, I would do it. Again, don't get me wrong. I don't love her less, or think she's less of a person. I simply acknowledge that she has barriers in her life; if I could remove those barriers, I would.As I mentioned, Shapiro covers the disability rights movement up to and including the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Many people who have grown up seeing curb cuts, wheelchair ramps, kneeling buses, and other accommodations don't realize the extent to which the ADA changed the way disabled people are treated and viewed in the U.S. There's still room for improvement, to be sure, even 20 years after its passage, but the ADA has done much to improve life for people with disabilities. I do have to admit the libertarian in me and the parent of a disabled child in me have argued about the application of the ADA. One doesn't have to look far for seemingly silly applications of the law, and in many cases a conflict between property rights and disability rights comes into play. Unlike the Civil Rights Act, to which ADA is compared, property owners seeking to fulfill ADA requirements often must incur a material expense. In some cases, it's quite small, but in plenty of cases the costs for a restaurant, retail store, or office can be substantial. On this, the struggle between the rights of the disabled and the rights of property owners, I am torn.The stories of the movements and individuals in No Pity will move you, inform you, and inspire you to look at the world through the eyes of people with disabilities. Shapiro does not hold back from making the reader uncomfortable, yet fills each chapter with hope and optimism by showing how far we as a society have come.Shortly after I finished reading No Pity, I saw an inspiring article in the Star-Telegram by Sean Pevsner, a disability rights lawyer with severe cerebral palsy. His attitude exemplifies Shapiro's perspective: \\"Disabilities are not something that people should fight to overcome, but a part of what makes them who they are. Our minds are the only things that limit us.\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 3/5/12."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"No Pity made me cry, scream, smile and laugh as well as get on the phone to my legislator's.

I did buy Used. Other than that I can not complain."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"I read No Pity when it was first released..No Pity is American as apple pie. The disability related material was well presented in terms of individual stories and examples of predjudice, struggle etc.. I found the analysis of the disability movement and the use of the African-American civil rights struggle for equality as a parallell struggle with which to compare the struggle by the disabled was handled without real exploration into the implication of that comparison. Basically I was annoyed by the lack of qualifiers regarding how the movements were so radically different and also how minorities are not really that visible in the disabled activist movement as a whole. For a better worded deeper insight into this common mistake by white (my assumption) authors regarding using the African presence to make a point read Toni Morrisons &quot;Playing in the Dark&quot;. Note Morrison's own oversight of issues relating to how disability is used by authors to qualify their characters nature. In closing I suggest to read No Pity its ok.. check out how it employs the African American struggle when convenient but the fails to dig deeper. Thats its flaw. Peace.. One Love."},{"Title":"No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement","review":"Having done my undergraduate work in English, criticism of printed material has become similar to breathing. I've written countless papers condemning authors for their various shortcomings, all the while never having myself written anything approaching art. The hypocrisy of my position as a self righteous reader, condemning the efforts of those I'd be hard pressed to emulate, has often occupied my curiosity.This same quandary reasserts itself after reading Joseph P Shapiro's No Pity, a compelling account of society's misperceptions and remedial efforts regarding the thirty-five to forty three million Americans with disabilities. Shapiro's work uncovers a sometimes forgotten struggle by providing a compelling journalistic account of both legal history and the personal struggles of individuals who must confront disabilities. The result is a more enlightened reader. Yet, however successful Shapiro may be at removing the blinders from the eyes of his readers, one can, like a sanctimonious student of literature, find several flaws within the text. One is compelled to reach the conclusion that No Pity is both insightful, but terribly short-sighted.First, Shapiro uncritically parallels the struggle for disability rights with the legislative and judicial victories associated with African-American civil rights. For instance, Chapter 2 begins, \\"In the fall of 1962, James Meredith, escorted to class by U.S. marshals, integrated the University of Mississippi. The same school season, a postpolio quadriplegic named Ed Roberts entered the University of California at Berkeley. Just as surely as Meredith ushered in an era of access to higher education for blacks and a new chapter in the civil rights movement, Roberts was more quietly opening a civil rights movement that would remake the world for disabled people.\\" By associating the disabled rights movement with the efforts of African-Americans to obtain civil rights, Shapiro casts greater legitimacy upon the former by its association with a movement for which most Americans, through the value of hindsight, have a great deal of sympathy. However, such exploitation of an altogether different subject is neither original nor fair. For instance, other civil rights movements have also attempted to co-op the racial struggle for civil rights into their own movements. Locally, Hands Off Washington, a political group fighting a proposed ban on any minority set-asides for homosexuals, and nationally, Bastard Nation, an extreme adoptee rights advocate group, have both attempted to cast their own particular struggles as being the logical and inevitable conclusions of broader classifications of civil rights begun by African-Americans. Yet by doing so, both Shapiro and these other movements minimize the particularized oppression that gave rise to the earlier movement. Neither the disabled, homosexuals, nor adoptees are the target of lynching, Jim Crow laws, fire engine hosing, or vicious police dogs. Nor has the color of ones skin any relation to ones abilities to function in a majoritarian community; thus, segregation and unequal legal status in relation to race has no justifiable characteristic. On the other hand, people with disabilities cannot always function in ways similar to the majority; thus, inequality in law can, to some extent, be justified in relation to the disabled. Unfortunately, Shapiro refuses to explore the implications and complications of correlating the plight of the disabled with that of African-Americans.Next, Shapiro's editorial approach seems confused. On one hand, Shapiro adopts the didactic nature of an advocate. For instance, in Chapter Ten, when telling the personal story of Jim, an institutionalized developmentally disabled adult, Shapiro's scorn at those who would keep Jim confined from the community is unmistakable. In addition, Shapiro briefly discusses his own attempts to emancipate Jim from his surroundings. On the other hand, Shapiro often changes his tone and persona; becoming the detached, objective journalist he credits himself being. Specifically, Shapiro recounts the deaf separatist movement at Gallaudet University in a positive but objective tone, yet later describes the offense many people with disabilities have for the Special Olympics due to the separatist nature of the events. The reader is left confused, wondering what exactly should their response be to these to contradictory sentiments. Meanwhile, Shapiro has no suggestions, and any attempt to suggest that his silence is due to journalistic objectivity has been illegitimated by his earlier didacticism. Shapiro seems to provide normative prescriptions only when they are easy and convenient, while the reader is left searching for an appropriate response to the conflicts Shapiro describes.Yet, reading provides a number of benefits. Just as people venture to a movie for different reasons, such as escapism, drama, artistic appreciation, or terror, readers need not be moved to read by any particular motivation. A poorly crafted read may be entirely worthy of one's time for considerations beyond the ascetic quality of the work. Such is the case with No Pity, a poorly crafted, by eye opening account of the struggles of the disabled which has made me question my own tacit understandings of society in general."},{"Title":"Elena's Secrets of Mexican Cooking","review":"Sorry to hear that this book is not currently available!

When you're on the road one might think you'd be limited as to what you can prepare. One might think you'd be dining in restaurants, or much worse, eating frozen meals done in motel microwaves. One would be wrong if one thought that of me. I brought along a cooler full of stuff I might need. A chef on the road is still a chef.I checked out the Salsa Luisa on page 170 and since both Sophie and I are wannabe vegetarians, we fall off the wagon quite a bit, especially me, I decided to go shopping for the ingredients as Ms Zelayeta said her mother invented the sauce and that it was perfect to pour over vegetables. It was. It is. We had steamed cauliflower, broccoli and brussel sprouts and the sauce really set them off. Then next night I did the Pollo en Jugo de Naranja (Chicken in Orange Sauce).

Recently, CMT aired specials on the 40 Greatest Men and 40 Greatest Women of Country Music that certainly stirred up some discussions. Now there's a new book Heartaches By The Number that is bound to create even more heated deliberations.Using Dave Marsh's The Heart Of Rock And Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made as a model, music critics David Cantwell and Bill Friskics-Warren selected what they felt were the 500 most important country singles. In the introduction, these writers point out that their love affair with music began during the &quot;crossover years&quot; of 1967 to 1973. This helps to explain the hefty numbers of selections from this period, starting with their number one ranked single Sammi Smith's rendition of &quot;Help Me Make It Through The Night&quot;: a 1971 country hit that also crossed over to the pop top 10.Country superstars of the '60s and '70s show up a lot of this list, George Jones with twelve entries and Loretta Lynn with nine, for instance. Of course, Jones and Lynn would undoubtedly be featured a lot in this type of book regardless of who wrote it. But Glen Campbell meriting four entries, Sammi Smith three, and Charlie Rich a staggering six (including the non-hit remake of Sinatra's jazzy &quot;Nice 'n' Easy&quot;) while two of the most acclaimed artists in modern country Vince Gill and Mary Chapin Carpenter received none is clearly biased.The crossover period of country music also seems to have influenced the authors to stretch the boundaries in order to classify different types of popular music as country. Gladys Knight and the Pips' &quot;Midnight Train To Georgia,&quot; Joe Simon's &quot;The Chokin' Kind,&quot; and Otis Redding's &quot;Sittin' On the Dock Of The Bay&quot; are some soulful numbers whose country setting helps to make their selection somewhat plausible. But the Monkees &quot;Last Train To Clarksville&quot; and the Rolling Stones &quot;Honky Tonk Woman?&quot; To quote Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life: &quot;you're screwy!&quot;There are only 16 recordings selected from the 1990s and merely one (Lee Ann Womack's &quot;I Hope You Dance&quot;) since 2000. Responsible at least in part for this dearth is the authors' decision to omit recordings not released commercially as singles. In recent years, most singles have been marketed only to radio to promote an album and are not available in stores. But since the average country listener isn't aware if their favorite radio hit by, say, Tim McGraw or Toby Keith was available as a commercial single, they don't know if it was snubbed by the authors or omitted on the technicality.Okay, I've been pretty picky. This book does actually have a lot going for it. The entries are informative, concise, and well-written. The selections from the '20s through the early '40s are particularly interesting to read about and it is hard to find fault with the authors' choices from this era (including The Carter Family's &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken&quot; and &quot;Wildwood Rose,&quot; Jimmie Rodgers &quot;T For Texas&quot; and &quot;Waitin' On A Train,&quot; Patsy Montana's &quot;I Want To Be A Cowboy's Sweetheart&quot; and Lead Belly's &quot;Midnight Special&quot; - the latter a landmark fusion of country with the blues).Ultimately, the book provides plenty of material to debate and teaches the reader a lot about music (not just country) history. This alone makes it a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"Although its subtitle (\\"Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles\\") presents this book as a list of great recordings, it's only nominally a countdown. Grumbling that your favorite single didn't crack their Top 200, while always entertaining, is largely beside the point. These two authors even admit in their introduction that they have bigger fish to fry here. Heartaches By The Number wants to define, offer a history of, illustrate the influence of, and revel in the pure sonic joys of country music. The amazing thing is that David Cantwell and Bill Friskics-Warren manage to do all of these simultaneously--and do them well.There's lots to learn here. The two authors are obviously well-versed in country's history--equally comfortable discussing Dock Boggs' 1927 \\"Country Blues\\" or Lee Ann Womack's \\"I Hope You Dance\\"--and are able to share their knowledge, when appropriate, without slipping into a textbook-style lecture. And that's good because more than explaining history, this book slowly begins to reveal and argue for an aesthetic, a conception of what country music is and why it has a place in the lives of its listeners.This aesthetic is going to trouble and confuse some listeners, downright anger others. Cantwell and Friskics-Warren conceive of a country music that includes The Stones and Dusty Springfield as well as Hank and Lefty. Why, in their Top 10, Elvis is flanked by Ray Price and The Carter Family. But it's this broad definition that provides much of the fun and the challenge here. How do these two have the gall to even call the Monkees country music, let alone include them among the creators of its greatest singles? Since when has Chuck Berry (or Otis Redding, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, or Fats Domino, or CCR--all here) been redesignated \\"Country\\"? It's exactly this default categorization that the authors want to challenge. Much of their discussion attempts to show how fluid the boundaries are between country and almost every other style of music.And that's what it finally comes down to in this book: the music, what's actually down there in the grooves, or in the binary code. As much as anything, Cantwell and Friskics-Warren are great listeners, and they share a rare knack for translating the experience of listening into words. In a stunning discussion of Dolly Parton's \\"Coat of Many Colors,\\" Cantwell reveals himself as a guy who has listened to this song enough times to identify with the singer AND with the song's narrator (he distinguishes between the two) from the inside. Vulnerable but not maudlin (just as the song is), he refuses to slip into cheap emotionalism, but shares a clearly heartfelt love and appreciation for the entire experience of this single--singer and song, meaning and music. Likewise, Friskics-Warren, in a tour-de-force discussion of three singles--G.B. Grayson's \\"Ommie Wise (1927), The Blue Sky Boys' \\"Banks of the Ohio\\" (1936), and The Louvin Brothers' \\"Knoxville Girl\\" (1959)--sees thematic and musical traditions stretching from 18th Century English ballads right up to rapper Eminem. Not surprisingly, the entry appears amid a stretch of several, all addressing themes of murder and prison (\\"Pistol Packin' Mama,\\" \\"Life To Go,\\" \\"Green Green Grass of Home,\\" \\"Sing Me Back Home\\"). Theirs is a world of connection, not dissection.This impulse for connection is seen most vividly in the context the authors create for their discussions throughout. They encourage readers to listen to, and think about, this music here in the real world, a world that includes Betty Friedan and Horatio Alger, Harlan County USA and The Daily Worker, LBJ and V-E Day and POW's and TM, Dorothy Allison and Carson McCullers, Jim Crow and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., The Beatles and the Buddha and Bonanza, Times Square and Teamster Strikes, Designing Women and Smokey & the Bandit. For Cantwell and Friskics-Warren, music, like the rest of the world, affects our hearts AND our minds, our outer lives AND our inner lives. Great singles allow us a glimpse at what Friskics-Warren describes as \\"the point at which the personal and the political converge.\\"And lest this all sound a bit too heavy, let me assure you that Heartaches By The Number is a FUN read as well. The counting format offers bite-size portions that read well on their own (sort of intellectual bathroom reading) but are always part of the larger discussion. And these guys can be FUNNY (and cynical), too. Complimenting the musicians backing Tennessee Ernie Ford on \\"Shot Gun Boogie,\\" Cantwell notes, \\"Then again, Henry Ford could swing with this group behind him!\\" And introducing Glen Campbell's signature single, Friskics-Warren asks, \\"'Gentle On My Mind' might have played well during the Summer of Love, but was its load of bull for real?\\" Like many of their musical heroes here, these two are straight-shooters.About the best compliment I can pay this book is that it makes you want to go back and listen to the recordings. The authors encourage us to return to these singles--sometimes songs you didn't think you liked, songs you didn't even think were country--and listen again. They encourage us to really open our ears--and as a result, our hearts and minds.My biggest problem with Heartaches By The Number: I don't own all of these records. Next step: the Time/Life Heartaches By The Number companion box set. Bear Family Records, are you listening?"},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"Several things you need to know first: If you're looking for a \\"countdown\\", that's not what Cantwell and Friskics-Warren were after here. In fact they state \\"The choices we've made aren't necessarily the country singles we believe are the 'best' (that would've made for a very different book-TWO very different books, in fact), though of course we're convinced that every record included here is emotionally powerful, musically compelling, or both.\\" They even go so far as to say if they couldn't say something NEW about a single..no matter how good it was...it didn't make the list.The authors used Dave Marsh's \\"Heart of Rock and Soul\\" as the template for their book so it tries to be readable as a BOOK..entries aren't RANKED so much as ordered. For example, thematically linked 'cheating' songs \\"Back Street Affair\\" by Webb Pierce, Leroy Van Dyke's \\"Walk on By\\", \\"slipping Around\\" from Floyd Tillman and Randy Travis' more recent \\"On the Other Hand\\" (a rejection of adultery) all sit akimbo at positions 154-157 respectively. They also place songs together that they argue advance a narrative as in the argument for Cajun influence in country music for \\"Fais Pas Ca\\" by the Hackberry Ramblers at #235 and \\"One Step des Chameaux\\" next door to it.There's a good reason to go for a more song-based approach: country tends to not 'play well' in album form. For every truly \\"great\\" country album there are probably 5 others that, though popular and high-selling, constitute little more than 1 or 2 indelible singles, a few pieces of decent filler, and perhaps a song or two of festering hackwork. (Much like your average pop or R&B; album...lest you think I single country out.)Since these are all \\"singles\\", keep in mind many great album tracks..or even songs that were never put out as 45's even if they were heavily played on radio..won't be here.STRENGTHS:In arguing for a more inclusive country definition, Friskics-Warren and Cantwell recognize both the streams that helped feed into country like Cajun, blues, bluegrass, and Southern gospel, but also the branches it led to such as rock and roll and R&B.;The entries written are usually enlightening, mostly entertaining, and will probably help the average reader get a better understanding of country music even if they don't agree with all the choices.WEAKNESSES:In some ways the desire for inclusiveness weakens the book: I love the Monkees' \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\" and might even argue it would belong among a list of 500 or 1000 greatest singles, but I can't really think of it as \\"country\\". Same goes for Chuck Berry and \\"Maybellene\\" though I believe it's unquestionably one of the greatest songs ever recorded.Also, several more modern numbers chosen are iffy at best: Mark Chesnutt's \\"Bubba Shot the Jukebox\\" might fit Friskics-Warren and Cantwell's aesthetic but it's gonna be hard for me to agree that it's \\"emotionally powerful, musically compelling, or both.\\" Likewise, Faith Hill's frothy \\"This Kiss\\". If they needed to place more songs from the 90s and later on there, I'm sure they could have found weightier tunes, perhaps by considering \\"alt-country\\" folks like the Jayhawks who don't have enough of a presence here. (Only Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle are here from the alt-country movement.)BOTTOM LINE:If you have any interest in country music, this is worth your time and money. I'm using it as a list of 'suggested listening' to widen my country vistas a bit..particularly for pre-1950 material."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"I'm a huge fan of classic country and I purchased this book and read it as soon as it came out. I found both authors to be highly qualified for the daunting task of picking the top 500 country singles of all time. Their comments are insightful and always interesting. My main complaint was that the majority of the singles they chose are from the very early years of country music - 1920 to 1940. I'd never heard any of them (although I had heard of many of them) and so it sort of felt like a museum exercise to read entry after entry about songs I'd never heard. And there are very few songs from the 1991-1996 period, when I feel country music made a huge comeback in terms of quality. It's still an interesting read, but it might have been even more effective if they had been able to include a CD or two of the songs they chose so you could actually hear why some of their early choices are so important."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"Nashville's schtick is to put some gorgeous babe (male or female) in a hat and boots, have him or her sing some souped-up arrangment, and voila...a \\"country\\" hit. Never mind that Nashville's idea of a \\"country\\" hit is not far removed from any other top forty hit cluttering up the Clear Channel airwaves. Never mind that in 3 years nobody, except the most hard core trivia hounds, will even remember the tune. Never mind that it just ain't country!Which is not to say that each and every one of the 500 singles outlined in this book is in fact \\"country.\\" Many of them aren't (at least not how I'd catalogue 'em). But each and every one of these tunes is in fact \\"great\\" and has its place in whatever bin is labeled \\"country\\" at the local Wal-Mart.Any collection like this is going to be highly subjective and is bound to create arguments over inclusions and exclusions. Hell, I think that the Rolling Stones' \\"Exile On Main Street\\" is one of the greatest country albums ever reduced to vinyl. I'm sure not everyone is gonna agree with me. the point is that this book is not a compendium of the 500 Best Acts....so whoever it was whining that a single from that hack band Alabama wasn't included, please....re-read the damn thing.Besides, even if this book was supposed to serve as some country music survey, Alabama would barely rate a footnote.So, having said that, is this book any good?Actually, it is very good. There is a lot of very good, insightful writing here. What Cantwell and Friskics have done is essentially survey popular country music, in virtually all of its permutations. In constructing this survey, the authors, under the guise of critiquing each selected tune, present an idisyncratic critical theory of country music which holds up very well to scrutiny. And they've done it without academic jargon.This book is going to an essential component in any country music fan's library.Now, can anyone explain to me why there isn't a single version of \\"Dark As A Dungeon\\" included here?"},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"It seems unfortunate to me that there are reviews in this forum that judge this book negatively because the reviewers happen to disagree with the authors' choices. Of course you're not going to agree with all the choices (or even most of them), but even if you don't, the simple fact is that Cantwell and Friskics-Warren have crafted a beautifully-written, well-argued text that will start conversations and promote deep and appreciative listening of one of America's finest musical forms. Bravo."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"This book came to me in excellent condition. I was very pleased with it, but gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the book should list ONLY country music. About 20 of the songs listed are NOT country, some are gospel and some are rock! The gospel belongs in a book about gospel, the rock songs belong in a book of rock music. If you are a TRUE country music fan, you know that the Rolling Stones are certainly not country! Otherwise, the book is great, and it lists several songs that were well-known from the 1920s and 1930s."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"If you want to include the following records in a list of Country Music's 500 greatest singles:Atlantic city by Bruce SpringsteenHonky Tonk Women by the Rolling StonesQueen of Hearts by Juice Newtonand various other songs listed by Bing Crosby, the Monkees,Los Lobos,Merilee Rush and other \\"pop\\" singers, then this is the book for you. Otherwise I don't think the authors have a clue about \\"real country music\\". Texas musicians and records are virtually non-existant in this book and the authors like to \\"sound\\" politically correct on every review (who cares if a Jimmie Rodgers song was racist?).This book is full of \\"fake\\" country records and the reviews are weak.

Obviously, it is the author's opinion and certainly not definitive. But I think I would agree more often than not, that the songs covered in this book are among the best. The author gives a little background information on each song, and gives his reason for including it in the book. I think country music fans would like this book a lot."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"I found this a really poorly done vanity project of the authors. They frankly write like a individual fan would, not like historians. I mean really THREE Sammi Smith records in the top 500?? That very talented lady only had THREE top ten hits period!! Some of the selections (MANY of the selections) seem deliberately chosen to provoke rather than being there for being truly outstanding recordings.The fact that this listing is not a serious attempt to acknowledge ground-breaking or important recordings can be judged by the fact that so many recordings are grouped together in entries with their neighboring song on the list (ie: two Merle Haggard songs ranked side by side or Dolly Parton &amp; Norma Jean's &quot;working girl&quot; songs ranked consecutively). This even goes on into the &quot;alternate 100&quot; list with three completely forgettable different songs called &quot;The Other Woman&quot; ranked side by side. The research here isn't very good either, most country music buffs won't learn a thing here. Sometimes it doesn't even appear the authors even really LISTENED to the record! For example discussing Norma Jean's record HEAVEN HELP THE WORKING GIRL they quote the line &quot;we'd both be sorry if I did go home to your wife and your kids&quot; as if some guy trying to pick Norma Jean up was inviting her home for supper!! Norma Jean actually sings &quot;We'd both be sorry if I did, (pleading) GO home to your wife and your kids&quot; ie: a man has propositioned her and she is pointedly reminding him of his family at home. How could they not understand that?? Similarly, they ludriciously compare Dottie West's A LESSON IN LEAVIN' to Aretha Franklin records, it has about as much in common with a Franklin disc as it does with A Beverly Sills' one.And the authors make one of the most offensive (if unintentional) slams I've ever read on a country songwriter in their comments on Merle Haggard's recording &quot;I'm A Lonesome Fugitive&quot; (written by Liz Anderson with some assistance from her husband Casey) stating it was a song Haggard himself could have wrote. Well, dear authors, Mr. Haggard DID NOT write it, he had written almost nothing at this early point in his career and in fact his later songwriting was clearly inspired by the bitter and lonesome themes in the Liz Anderson songs he rode to fame with such as &quot;Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Strangers&quot;. THAT would have been a more appropiate comment. Country songwriters are usually highly praised within the industry so it's strange to read comments in a book belittling their actual contribution.I suspect the authors knocked this book out in a couple weeks. At least that's how it looks."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"Not just a list of 500 of the greatest country singles (that's singles, the authors take pains to stress, as opposed to songs) but a series of almost 500 mini-essays which provide a new way of looking at the history of country music. Yes, it's very much the authors' personal selection and a great many of the singles are from that period which the authors term the \\"crossover years\\" of 1967-1973 but they make this clear from the start, setting out their stall in a masterly introduction which is more or less a manifesto for re-listening to country music. Cantwell and Friskics-Warren touch on much that has shaped and continues to shape country music including the increasingly homogenised state of US radio (which, sadly, sounds very similar to the condition of radio in the UK today). If this makes the book sound dry and academic, let me assure you that it isn't: it's intelligently written without being pretentious and the authors never lose sight of the fact that this music comes from the heart. This is a book that can be dipped-in to but it's best read sequentially as each essay forms part of a non-chronological history of country - as the authors state: the entries are ordered, not ranked. Some of the choices may well inspire puzzlement and debate (every time I've heard Otis Redding's \\"Dock of the Bay\\" - and that's many, many times - I've never EVER considered it a country single!) but it's a fascinating volume and anyone interested in the history of American popular music should own a copy."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"I've always been skeptical of musical \\"best of\\" publications such as Rolling Stone Magazine's \\"500 Best Albums\\" and \\"100 Best Beatles Songs\\". And this, \\"Country Music's 500 Greatest Songs\\". These compilations are, of course, reflections of the authors' musical tastes; however, one hopes the authors have researched their selections to the extent that they may have something interesting to tell us about the artists, the stories behind the songs, or insights into the recordings and production. Unfortunately, none of that comes through in this book. The authors offer long-winded, personal \\"analyses\\" of the songs, but add nothing of particular interest or enlightenment. After reading several dozen entries, the reader can almost predict how the next few hundred entries are going to read. In short, the reader will gain nothing here that can't be gained by simply listening to the songs.The song selection here is a bit bizarre. For example, the authors list several songs for Charlie Rich, but they're obscure, little known, and certainly lesser quality songs... all the while ignoring Rich's biggest single of all, \\"Behind Closed Doors\\". While (rightfully) including entries for greats like Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Merle Haggard, the credibility of the project suffers with drivel such as Deana Carter's \\"Did I Shave My Legs For This\\", \\"This Kiss\\" by Faith Hill, and other \\"neo-country\\" songs that have helped bastardize the genre.Musical taste is, of course, subjective. Many of the songs listed, to my taste, belong here. But honestly, I bought the book hoping to gain insight into the songs, the artists, and the eras. After reading a considerable way into the book, I realized this was not to be the case."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"Thought this book had music and the words to many songs.

Following the intentions stated by the authors in their introduction, I have listened to many of these selections with &quot;new ears&quot; and come away with new appreciation. Their #1 pick Sammi Smith's version of &quot;Help Me Make It through the Night&quot; is a good example but I'm sticking with their #2 &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is the all time greatest. The one thing that really confounds me and led to my reduction in rating is how in the world could they have ignored Johnny Cash's version of &quot;Sunday Morning Coming Down&quot; not only from the 500 greatest but the alternate 100. John R. is well represented here as he should be but &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; was a landmark in his ongoing transformation to American Music God as well as serving as a breakthrough in the country musicworld for songwriter Kristofferson."},{"Title":"Heartaches by the Number: Country Music's 500 Greatest Singles","review":"If you're going to name the 500 best singles....you might want to include at least one from Alabama.

On the plus side, the deserving songs they did include are well-profiled. It's just too bad some editor with a clue didn't stop these guys before they went careening out of control...with some truly bizarre picks.

We are given a sense of his work through four of the major times and places during his life: his photographic apprenticeship in New York during the late 1910's, a sampling of his work done under commission in Mexico, his well known work in New England, and finally, images taken after his emigration to France, in 1950. A brief biography precedes the photographs that follow, and we are left to consider the images free from further didactic comment.At first sight, one senses immediately the charm this man might have possessed in his relationships with both himself and those people and things surrounding his life. This sense is borne out in the wry humor of &quot;Town Hall&quot;, with its off kilter framing, which we instantly recognize as Paul Strand. Ironically, a closer study of his personal life indicates Mr. Strand could be a difficult man. The well-known &quot;Wall Street&quot;, an earlier piece of darkly shadowed monstrous windows overpowering passers by, is as close to the foggy pictorialist sense Strand will get, and the rest of the images show him breaking away from that style, and moving head first into the previsualized and almost straight photographic style that he was to help break ground for.In this collection, several of the photographs stand out; but many seem rather innocuous, specifically the portraits of those he knew personally, and those he didn't - none seem to capture the viewers imagination like those of Mr. Strands' contemporaries might, Edward Weston for one. Instead, they seem unimaginative and emotionless. Furthermore, it doesn't help that, lacking that content, it may be that his reputation as an innovative technician in the darkroom goes unnoticed here, seeing these images only on the page (in small 7 inch by 6 inch reprint).On the other hand, we are shown some photographs which show how powerful a view of quiet solitude can be. Of particular note,&quot;Tir a'Mhurain&quot; stands alone. A wide view of the silence surrounding three horses watering in the bay, and in the very left foreground, they are being watched from far above by a lone white horse. The leading of the three animals has turned its mane toward, and is eyeing the lone horse. The silvery water of the bay reflects the stand of horses, and more strongly, that of an immense and clouded sky, suggesting a powerful solemnity. Faintly, in mid-ground, wood buildings of a fishing village are left powerless in front of only a small mountain range. Taken in 1954, an American living in France (but not able to speak the language), Mr. Strand might have felt himself the lone horse. The obtrusive sky begging for silence. The artist contemplating his subject from afar.&quot;Driveway&quot; was taken late in his life (in fact, three years prior to his death) where he lived in France. This poetic view leads us through an overgrowth, tunnel-like, of bare tree limbs and branches. Beneath this dark surrounding of hibernating growth, two parallel white cobblestone paths. Our eyes search the dark, shadowed background to where we are being lead; almost imperceptible, at the end of the driveway, we make out a decrepit structure: a country cottage, seemingly empty and abandoned. One cannot help but feel the author's probable recognition of the path of his own life, and the awful truth of life: of autumn, the oncoming winter, the drawing to a close, and of coming home to a place unknown.In this collection, these are his strongest images, these landscapes. - whether &quot;Fox River&quot;, from his acclaimed book &quot;Time in New England&quot;, or the handful of New York cityscapes, or the country landscapes and village life scenes, such as &quot;Marketplace&quot;, taken in Italy. Robert Adams has suggested that Mr. Strands work went into decline following his emigration to France in 1950 (1). In actuality, it is these images we wish for more of. Mr. Strand's capacity was not limited by time and place, but by subject and content. Seeing the images borne from his emigrated life, one is left wanting less of his still life's and portraits, and more of what showed a more genuine side of Mr. Strand through symbolic form. Not the modernist machine pictures like &quot;Oil Refinery&quot;, or &quot;Akeley Motion Picture Camera&quot;, but more of &quot;Landscape, Sicily, Italy&quot;, with its bare, white birch trees having cloistered the villager's in their quiet homes.However, in this book, as a simple compendium of Mr. Strand's oeuvre, the viewer is at least left with a closer understanding of a part of what this celebrated photographer was seeing throughout the varied stages and places, both known and foreign, of his life.1.

It consists of 365 poems, mainly &quot;Petrarchan&quot; or Italian sonnets. In this edition, the original Italian poems appear side-by-side with an excellent verse translation by James Wyatt Cook. This is one of my favorite translations of the poems; Mark Musa's is more prosaic, Morris Bishop's is good, but hard to find.If you want to find out what an obsessive love is truly like - here's the place to go. Petrarch fell in love with Laura on April 6, 1327 and obsesses about her for about fifty years. She was a married woman, living in the Avignon of the Popes. Her death, of the plague on April 6 (note the coincidence), 1348 did not end the fountain of poetry; Petrarch continued with the poems after her death.This songbook is the source of the famed Petrarchan conceit, the farfetched comparison - for instance, that the beloved's eyes are like suns, dispensing warmth upon the lover (or cold when she is chilly). Later, the Elizabethan poets imitated these conceits. Even Shakespeare has a go at satirizing them.Enjoy this fabulous poetry."},{"Title":"Petrarch's Songbook: Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta : A Verse Translation (Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies)","review":"This book, Petrarch's Songbook, is a bilingual edition of the songs and sonnets, originally titled Canzoniere, of Francesco Petrarch - a 14th-century Italian.

If you don't have the mental advantage, or the Mental Edge, you will lose to someone who does.Step-by-step instruction makes Ken Baum's program easy to understand, and easy to apply.

I haven't even implemented all of his techniques yet, and already my success rate has increased from less than 25% to over 75% over the last several competitions. I've set goals, implemented a plan to achieve them, and am truly enjoying all my competitions, win or lose. I'm sure my dog has picked up on my attitude shift, and is performing better because of it.

When I found this book I immediately decided to pitch a feature story on these techniques because they are DIFFERENT. There is so much out there on mental training that basically says, &quot;Strive for excellence.&quot; Yawn! HOW? This book shows how. It covers a couple of basic concepts, visualization and positive self-talk, but delves into other techniques even I had not heard of. And I've interviewed many other trainers, coaches, etc. like Ken Baum. I think that's why such a top athlete like Karch Kiraly subscribed to these methods. The author's ideas called &quot;Success History Search&quot; and &quot;Performance Cues&quot; have been extremely helpful to me in the gym.

He ended the season with a .455 batting average and had the most RBI's on his team. I even had parents ask me what happened because he looked so much more confident.

His clients have included players from the Seattle Supersonics to the U.S. World Cup soccer team.\\"The Mental Edge\\" presents a program you can use to maximize your sports performance. Kenneth Baum shows why seemingly average athletes can excel at their sport while athletes with great potential will at time never reach their goals. This step-by-step program is designed to improve your game.Whether you want to meet your workout goals or you are a professional athlete, Kenneth can guide you past your frustration and into the next level, a place where you can improve your performance by up to 40 percent.\\"The Mental Edge\\" is filled with examples of how this program has worked for athletes who were able to shed their self-defeating beliefs.By Chapter Three I was quite inquisitive and could not wait to hear what I could do to improve my own workouts.Kenneth Baum presents ideas that made absolute sense. One of his first ideas included an analysis of what you have been doing that caused defeat and once I figured out that I was not making my workouts a priority, I was able to be more consistent and started to see some results I had not seen in 8 weeks! In one week, by the sheer consistency of my workouts, I had lost inches, finally! I know this seems logical, but I had been working out for months and nothing was happening. By putting aside my disappointment and visualizing a new me, I started to change into the new me. You might also want to post the \\"10 Perception Stretchers\\" on your wall because they are inspirational.\\"I don't like the results I'm getting. What do I need to do differently?\\" ~Kenneth BaumThere is an area in this book where you can \\"Create An Action Plan.\\" The \\"Power Talk\\" is an interesting way to promote \\"belief in yourself.\\" There is also a section on how to defeat the \\"Mental Saboteurs of Your Game.\\"This book also has information on the \\"Performance Zone Nutrition Program\\" which can be designed for your unique metabolism and sport.The ideas in \\"The Mental Edge\\" are working for me and have worked for professional athletes. No matter what your level is now, you can move to a higher level of performance. It could really just depend on how you think! \\"The Mental Edge\\" will take you to peak performance and beyond.

We will never be rid of it or its degeneracy now."},{"Title":"The ice box poems","review":"This modest chap-book is a gem in the rough. A rough little gem, to be precise. I hear there are still a few copies in the possession of the bookmaker and the author that could be purchased for a pretty penny. Furthermore, I have it from reliable sources that volume 2 of the Ice Box Poems is in the offing. It could be weeks, it could be months, it could be years. The bookmaker and the author are notoriously capricious towards the publishing industry, so there is no way of knowing when their latest literary marvel will materialize."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a treatise on management techniques, not process improvement. The first two chapters detail the decision of which projects to speed up, implying that a manager can only speed up a project by overstaffing it and clearing its path of the usual bureaucracy. Therefore, there is no permanent process gain to be had. But it is a great guide for decision makers looking to cut some time off any (or every) project. The fundamental tenets are these:1) Make the decision to develop a new product idea quickly.2) Staff all functions to the project immediately and keep them on throughout (no ramp-up, no handoffs)3) Specify it simply and quickly and do not change the spec (3 days, 3 pages).4) Spend a little time on the product architecture, designing for modularity and quick development.5) User overlapping development techniques (work on multiple modules simultaneously)6) Make a successful transition to manufacturing to complete the project.You can halve the development time of most projects just by changing the way you manage your projects, without doing a lot of overtime or increasing the cost of development. Many of the answers are in this book. Again, this is a must read book for all development managers."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"I found that this book was packed full of common sense, which is rare in a development management book. Although it has a lot of examples of manufacturing of phsyical goods, I found it great as a software manager. There aren't many spare words in this book, either -- it's terse and well edited, so you get the raw facts and the necessary stories to back them up, but not a lot (or any, really) fluff.I am putting it on my bookshelf for software engineers, right next to Writing Solid Code and Debugging the Development Process, two classics for software engineers and team leads, respectively."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"While the first edition was a bit dry to read in the first four chapters, the second edition is more fun. The value of the content has not been reduced with rev 2.0, on the contrary.The book is full of sound business theory which is well explained and put into real life context to help the non-MBA to transfer the message to their respective challenges.Also invaluable are the hints towards common pitfalls. They show that the authors have really applied the theory and are aware of the human factor in change processes.I read rev 1.0 and 2.0 and will probably buy 3.0 as well.Keep going!"},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"Absolutely the best book there is on the subject of new product development. Of particular import is the discussion on market and pricing dynamics, which may be new to technical-types. Choosing the right product to develop is critical to avoid &quot;The Innovators Dilemma&quot;. The book however needs to add more to the discussion of the importance (and risk) of rapid return of (partial) information to the team during the development cycle, as well as human (team) dynamics. I would therefore recommend &quot;The Team Handbook&quot; as a necessary adjunct."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"Over 14 years of software experience confirmed alot of what this book offered. It's well written, chalked full of great facts and gives you a perspective on the possibilities for software development. Let's face-it, software development has almost zero manufacturing issues. So, if your looking for the real reason to implement processes and methodolgies into your development processes, this book will take you there."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"\\"Developing products in half the time\\" is a collection of tools and practices that can be used to speed up the release of your new products. The book provides a well-balanced view on how to cut the development time and especially what the trade-off is that you will probably make. Many of the tools and practice are only touched upon and would require a book on its own.Preston Smith and Donald Reinertsen start the book by tackling some important misconceptions about fast development. Their opinion is that it's not per definition good and you really need to have a good reason to speed up the development. They continue this theme in their second chapter which gives a basic financial model that they will use during the rest of the book. It explains what trade-off will be made when saving time in a particular way. The rest of the book provides practices to save development time: starting with \\"the fuzzy front end\\". In power of incremental innovation they argue that most products can probably be developed incrementally, which reduces development time and risk a lot.Chapter 7 and 8 are key to the book, they provide motivation for using cross-functional development teams. How to create these, how do they fit within the organization and where should you locate them. This concept is repeated probably most throughout the book.Developing in half time is an excellent read. It's full of small ideas which can help your development process to deliver faster and explains the trade-offs well. The only criticism to this book would be that all topics are discussed only shortly. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"This book explains some of the critical terms if you are going to work on the rapid prototyping line, and it does it in such a clear way that it was a breeze to read it.

I am very happy i have chosen this book."},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"This book giver clear insights about product development in general. What amazed me when I read the first edition is that agile software development methodologies are clearly aligned with these book findings. Preston Smith and Reinertsen did an excellent job and succeded to create a better book in this new edition!Keep an eye open specially to the tools listed below(number is the corresponding chapter) and watch the link with agile processes:2. Putting a Price Tag on Time --> how to convince upper management to do small releases and work in an iterative and incremental mindset.4. The Power and Pitfalls of Incremental Innovation --> Why to be agile and how to mitigate risks described in the disadvantages section.5. Capturing Customer Needs --> Why to work jointly with all stakeholders and stay focused in minimal and iterative specifications.6. Using System Design to Compress Schedules --> Why software architecture is an important activity and why projects must be planned based on architecture.8. Organizing for Communication --> Why Co-location brings benefits most of the times.10. Controlling the Process --> why insitute essential metrics and which are these. Aligned with information radiators practice of agile software development teams.11. Preventing Overloads --> One of the best in the set. With great empirical evidence the authors explain why most managers do the wrong thing and try to mantain 100% people allocation. In this chapter he gives light to why is not a good thing to split people between various projects and what to do: control the project list religiously! The agile methodologies also say: Control the feature list of each project religiously :-) !Read this book, if you want to understand why agile and iterative development processes are the way to build most software products out there!"},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","review":"A comprehensive approach to Product development and lot of advices that can be used also in a Service Environment like my own; the best book on the subject of speed to market.

The book is a fairly dense academic treatise on the interplay between art, environmentalism and a personal journey whereby the main character eventually pushes himself to the extreme in his life's journey to the point of simply disappearing on the mountain. This book represents a first attempt at Tobias's trademark interweaving of fiction together with densely packed historical references. The book represents a tapestry woven from an historical perspective on art, environmentalism, humanism and a personal physical journey of the individual who pushes himself/herself to their personal limits. Over the years, Tobias has refined his artistic methods so as to make his works more accessible than is this early work. However, as a cornerstone to the meteoric career of this prolific author / film maker, D'haulagirideon provides an important comparator as one maps the artistic process. Do not buy this book as light reading but as a collector of an author's personal artistic journey.This book was limited to 100 copies. It was published by a homespun publishing company dubbed the \\"International Mountaineering Arts Journal,\\" a journal run out of Yellow Springs, Ohio. This soft cover book was printed by the Antioch Book Plate Company and then hand stitched and hand bound in 1973. The book is embellished with a series of photographs, printed separately and individually mounted into the book. Michael Tobias obtained his Ph.D. in the History of Consciousness from the University of California-Santa Cruz. Tobias has lectured widely. He was an Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies & Adjunct Assistant Professor of English and the Humanities at Dartmouth College, an Associate Professor of Humanities at California State University-Northridge, the Garrey Carruthers Chair of Honors and Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of New Mexico-Albuquerque, and a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Environmental Studies, and Regents' Lecturer, at the University of California-Santa Barbara.Tobias is the author of 35 books (both fiction and non-fiction as well as several edited anthologies). Some of his better-known works include: World War III - Population and the Biosphere at the End of the Millennium, Preface by Jane Goodall, A Vision of Nature -Traces of the Original World, Nature's Keepers - On the Frontlines of the Fight to Save Wildlife in America, A Day in the Life of India, Voices From the Underground - For the Love of Animals, Environmental Meditation, Life Force - The World of Jainism, Voice of the Planet, Kinship With Animals (co-edited), The Soul of Nature (co-edited) and A Parliament of Science -Science For the 21st Century (co-edited). In addition Tobias has written, directed, produced, executive produced or co-executive produced well over 100 films - TV series, documentaries and dramas, most pertaining to environmental, cultural, social or scientific issues. Some of those works include the 15-part series, A Parliament of Minds, the 28-part series, A Parliament of Souls, the ten-hour dramatic miniseries, Voice of the Planet, and such other works as Ahimsa -Non-Violence, Black Tide, Antarctica: The Last Continent, A Day in the Life of India, A Day in the Life of Ireland, World War III, The Sky's On Fire, River of Love, America's Great Parks, Element One, The Hydrogen Age, The Cost of Cool, Mad Cowboy and No Vacancy.Tobias' research has taken him to some 60 countries where he has specialized in an interdisciplinary approach to environmental history, scientific, ethical and philosophical frameworks for policy research, strategies and documentation, demographic analysis, ecological anthropology, biodiversity conservation, and non-violence activism. In 1996, Tobias received the \\"Courage of Conscience Award\\" for his commitment to animals, he has won several Emmies, and most recently, Tobias was the recipient of the 2004 Parabola Focus Award for his lifetime body of work.Books by Michael TobiasNon-FictionDonkey: The Mystique of Equus asinus (with Jane Morrison)Life and Death in New Zealand - The Ethics, Economics, and Biology of Nations (forthcoming)Sanctuary (with Jane Morrison, forthcoming)A Vision of Nature - Traces of the Original WorldWar III - Population and the Biosphere at the End of the MillenniumNature's Keepers: On the Frontlines of the Fight to Save Wildlife in AmericaMountain People (ed.)Life Force - The World of JainismEnvironmental MeditationA Parliament of Souls - In Search of Global Spirituality (ed. with Jane Morrison and B.

I've read a lot of the Mallory novels, and really liked Stone Angel. This one has great depth, as do most, and allows the reader to know Mallory on a more personal level.

It also makes me want to go back and re-read some of the others."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I loved \\"Find me.\\" Listened to it in 35-minute sessions while commuting to and from work. Often found it hard to turn off the audio and leave the car!Just a warning... I was driving along as usual while the audiobook was winding up, and got blindsided by the astonishing wrap-up.Tears sprang to my eyes. I kept wiping them away, but the next instant--more tears! A totally worthwhile book that nearly had me driving off the road, overwhelmed with emotion!"},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I've been working my way through the entire Kathy Mallory series after a recommendation, and have to admit that I enjoy them because the characters are so interesting; the mysteries to me are secondary. That said, I am getting a little tired of stories that open somewhere in the middle with characters gradually dropping details throughout the book to flesh out the essential background- it is very frustrating feeling like everyone else knows something you don't (and I don't mean in terms of the clues to solve the mystery, I mean like why Mallory is on Route 66 in a new car being tracked by her partner in the opening paragraphs). Perhaps if I wasn't reading them all so close together, this annoying characteristic of these novels wouldn't be so obvious, but I am so it is.Still, this is a complex and layered mystery that reveals a lot of interesting details about Mallory's past that help inform her current behaviors, and hold out a hope that there might be shifts coming in her psyche as some old wounds are healed. In the end, I was satisfied with the story and the character development, but all through the read, I was battling irritation at the piecemeal revelation of crucial facts. 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I love the Mallory series and although the sociopathic personality sometimes wears thin, the story always deliver.This was a great ride through 2 separate stories that intertwined perfectly. Could not put it down."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I read \\"Find me\\" quite recently, since I was not sure if I want to know how the \\"Mallory\\" series ends. In fact, I thought already once that it's over, when I read \\"Stone angel\\" and it was difficult to rediscover Mallory again. Now I know that there is a new Carol O'Connell's \\"Mallory\\" book and I'm quite confused.This is because I came to terms with the fact that I will no longer meet Mallory again. I do not want to spoil the lecture for future readers, but \\"Find me\\" is in a sense a perfect finale to the series. In a double track of this novel, Mallory solves the last mystery of her past and meets an ultimate monster. She seems to be resigned to the fact that once these tasks are done, her life is no longer relevant. And then...I am sure I will come back many times to this book. However, I do not know how I will dare to start reading \\"The chalk girl\\". Any ideas?"},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"As always Carol O'Connell is a top notch author of \\"edge of your seat\\" mysteries. Her charactersare well defined and ever loyal to \\"Mallory.\\" Savor each page as before you know it you are readingthe last page and awaiting O'Connell's next offering. NO HIGHER PRAISE A.W."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"The first Mallory book I read was \\"Stone Angel\\" because I did not realize that this was one book of a series. After that I started reading all the Mallory books. You really do need to start with the very first book about Mallory, \\"The Mallory Oracles\\" so that you will get a better understanding of Mallory and why she is the way that she is.To me \\"Find Me\\" was the very best of the Mallory series. In this book you start to see a little more human side of Mallory than you do in the other books- for instance, you see at times that she is not always so neat-compulsive and this is just not Mallory at all. In the end is when you really see a human side of Mallory that you would not have thought possible after reading all her other books. To me the end was very climatic and I had no idea which way it would go when she found her father.I only have 2 complaints about this book. One, it was a little confusing about why the state trooper gave Riker the evidence, and two, it was never explained in the book how Mallory found out what her father's name was at age 14 so that she could go look for him. From the beginning of the book you are led with the impression she never knew his name until she obtained some letters that he wrote years ago.Others seem to think that this will be the end of the Mallory series--I hope not! And others seem to think that even if the series goes on that Mallory will be completely changed and will no longer be the character we have grown to know. I don't see that happening. I think that if the series goes on, she will basically still be the person she always has been, but her character will just grow with some added features due to the relationship with her father--features that she didn't know she possessed--making her a little more human.I noticed by the inside of my book that it says this book was published in 2006, which makes me wonder if Carrol O'Connell is just being slow about writing another book about Mallory or if she really is finished writing about her."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"Of the nine Mallory books this is my favorite.

I can't wait for another Kathy Mallory book."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I wish I could give a straightforward loved it or hated it about this Mallory book. I adored Mallory from page one of Mallory's Oracle and would go nuts waiting for O'Connell's next one (c'mon, wasn't she slooooow?!). I know it's selfish of me, but in a lot of ways, I didn't want Mallory to find her family. All of the things that made Mallory Mallory were linked to her coming from nothing, to making herself what she was, that feral quality. Finding her parents made her human, and as weird as it sounds, loses for me that creepy Mallory quality that I just found delicious about her.Anyway, the storyline of this book was typically bizarro Mallory, which was comforting enough and explained enough here by other talented reviewers. I found most of the caravan scenes sort of boring, being more interested in the Riker/Charles stuff, as well as Mallory's strange unraveling.I think unlike others, I have a harder time seeing where Mallory goes from here. The last paragraph, her reaction, is so UN-Mallory, added in with the chipped nail polish, her left-behind laptop, no car..all the other stuff that I won't spoil. It made me sad for future books, which probably says something bad about me, lol. Mallory's turning into a domesticated Eve Dallas, which I couldn't bear. I hope this wasn't a swan song. I noted O'Connell's next is a stand-alone, which she's done before, so I don't know if anyone's got inside info on the Mallory series, but I'm just ambivalent about the future of it.As I said, I am conflicted. Even so, the book gets a solid four stars for O'Connell's superb storytelling, consistently brilliant, compelling characters and for making me continue to buy the books even when I know she's going to drive me nuts with them."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"Another reader complained that it took them a week to read this one instead of a day or two like the others. Me too. And that was great. Some of the later books in the series have been real pager turners--just slightly better-than-average routine pot-boilers. This one is a return to the strangeness and tension of the earliest Mallory novels. I had trouble reading more than two pages at a time. It was just too intense. I had to stop and let my own reaction to what I was reading settle down. My only problem was the beetle convertible hot-rod. 220 mph?!? No way! it would be airborne long before that speed.This not a typical police procedural, murder mystery, or even as the jacket calls it, a psychological thriller. If you are looking for one of those, it will be a disappointment. It rewards the reader in an entirely different way.But it was a most satisfactory read."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"The latest Mallory novel is generating some controversy. Does the plot signal an end to the series? Is the story too disjointed, too confusing? Myself, I enjoyed the book, though my patience wore thin sometimes as the cross-country exploration of Route 66 began to feel repetitious. In some ways, Find Me is a mirror/opposite of Stone Angel, Mallory's other venture from New York into her own history. Where Stone Angel is so rich and entertaining that we don't much care how it ends, Find Me provides an ending so brilliant that it excuses any tedium getting there.The \\"mystery\\" of why Kathy is on the road isn't all that mysterious. The reader knows after a few pages that she is looking for her father -- in some sense. What we don't know is whether her father is a serial killer also obsessed with Route 66. Will Kathy find her father and then arrest him?O'Connell has always done an excellent job of making others -- not just Kathy and her crew, but the most minor characters -- more interesting than the killer. Here she pushes that element to a daring extreme that may be the reason for some of the confusion and disappointment. No way to explain that without spoilers; suffice it to say that the encounter between Kathy and the killer is one of the most memorable of any mystery endings I've ever read.O'Connell has always had her sights on something more ambitious than whodunits, and every book carefully balances Mallory's story with the suspense of tracking the killer. In every novel, the killer is revealed to be a person of no consequence beyond their impact, like a shark's, on their victims. They are creatures of eccentric banality, to twist Hannah Arendt's famous words. Here is no exception.Mallory's world is a cartoon universe, where everyone is a bit simpler and stranger than we are used to in the real world. It is a style, like the cartoons of William Hogarth or Francisco Goya, meant to capture essentials quickly and precisely. It works, but for some readers Kathy -- and reality -- are too important to be \\"reduced\\" to cartoons. Get out of that mindset, and you will enjoy your trip on Route 66."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"Since the first Mallory book, Mallory's Oracle, we get bits and pieces about the 'Baby Thief' - she was alone, feeding out of trash cans, sleepng where she could. She was taken in by Helen and Louis Markowitz, and finally the girl found safety and love. But she never forgot why she had to live in the streets. She had a telephone # written on her hand, partially blurred. She would call all variations of that # and say 'Hi it's Kathy. I'm lost.' But no connections came from those calls..The Markowitzs gave her love and safety, but...When the Markowitz's are gone, Mallory has a career as a Detective with NYPD. Her only friends are her foster father's poker buddies, including Charles Butler and Detective Riker, also with NYPD.Mallory is missing from work and Riker gets a call that someone has been found dead in Mallory's apartment. When Charles and Riker go into Mallory's computer room, they find she unlocked the puzzle of the partial telephone number, and has a clue to her childhood. And so begins her journey.Mallory has been given letters her father wrote, addressed to 'OB'. They show his passions - a silver suped up Beetle, and traveling the old Route 66. She follows his journey down the old road in her own version of a suped up Beetle. But she is not alone - there are families of lost children following that path to find their lost ones. There have been children's skeletons found on the route, and someone seems to have been using that road to kill lost children. Mallory joins them and becomes part of the team to solve this mystery. A lost child trying to find her people..Butler and Riker find her and follow also.Here comes the rub - there is more info on the caravan, the lost ones, the FBI participants, it becomes 'ad nauseum'.But do not give up on this book, for it will solve the mystery Mallory has been looking for. I have been reading the Mallory books since the beginning, and the answers from previous books are there.The ending is so worth getting through the caravan stuff. We see Mallory as no one has seen her before. How this ending will effect subsequent books, one can only speculate. But speculate you will.A must for Mallory fans."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I think you're either gonna like 'Find Me' or hate it. I liked it - very much. I believe O'Connell is continually developing a three-dimensional character and a fascinating one. Is Mallory a sociopath? I keep changing my opinion on that. I didn't find the large cast of characters confusing nor any more unbelievable than the Mallory literature discussion group of hookers. (Didn't ya love that - Sheriff Peety?) It took me a while to realize what Mallory was doing on Route 66, ie, to connect it to the letters, but I usually read Mallory books with a puzzled look on my face anyway. I always love the droll comments and observations, and I'm pleased that Mallory approved of Kansas (square fields and perfect right angles) as that's my home state.

I was really surprised, cause personally, I loved this book. I a huge fan of Kathy Mallory and all the books, and I think this, while not up there with my all time fav, (Flight of the Stone Angel), i think it was both fitting and satisfying. Like 'Stone Angel', i love the stories about Mallory's past, and this is no different. The ending WAS shocking, but it ties up heaps of loose ends. I for one, had never given Mallory's father much thought, only Cassandra.So do read it, it's worth it, especially to find out what happens at the end. While it doesn't have the excitment of the New York based novels, it's still an excellent read.Let's hope this isn't the last we see of Kathy Mallory!"},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I totally enjoyed this latest in the Mallory series. I could not put it down and read to the end in the wee hours of the morning.As each book progresses, we see more and more into the psyche of Mallory and how she came to be who she is now. This book ties up quite a few loose ends. Mallory actually seems more human and less robotic. Her obsessions are understandable, as are her fears and questions. We grieve with the fourteen year old Mallory for the loss she felt so long ago.We let our emotions run amok with the parents on the caravan, and we lose our patience with the FBI characters who are no more than little followers of their leader who has his own agenda.My only concern is that this wil be the last Mallory. So many story lines were concluded, so many endings to the ongoing storylines, that I fear we are losing my favorite character. The O'Connell books are the only ones I buy first editon hardbacks, and yes, I do re-read them.I can only hope that Mallory will continue her crime fighting ways with her own unique sense of justice and right vs. wrong.Perhaps now that some ghosts have been laid to rest, she will be able to grow emotionally and can finally feel the joys and love that normal people experience. I only hope that Charles is there to reap the benefits. I know Riker will be around. I worry about Charles."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I really debated giving this four stars because I like this series--I like it a *lot*--and O'Connell usually works magic with her unusual premise. But the mystery in this one is just too wildly convoluted to carry the other drawback. Sad to say, it's the characters. Another reviewer noted that the whole series has a cartoonish larger-than-life quality; I agree, and weirdly enough it complements O'Connell's tragic themes. The delicate willing suspension of disbelief buckled too many times--very annoying, and suprising for this series--and the plot wasn't enough to sweep me along on its own.Usually I love wandering through O'Connell's spooky, twisty plots while relishing the revelations about Mallory, Charles, Riker and the various vivid side characters. For the first time I got just plain sick and tired of how overblown Mallory is. She's so beautiful, so brilliant, so damaged and tragic...yeah, got it already. Every supporting character is too willing to sacrifice careers, integrity and and even lives out of hopeless love for someone who treats them vilely. Even the people who love her are terrified of her. They call her \\"brat\\" and feel so guilty when they rightly suspect her of being a violent sociopath, they forgive and enable her iciness...and for the first time my primary reaction was a reluctant, \\"Oh bullpucky\\".This isn't a pan of the book. It won't attract many new fans but those already hooked on the series may find enough development to satisfy their jones. I was suprised at the welcome hint of healing at the ending, so the series probably has some mileage left. I just hope next time O'Connell tightens up her plotting and ratchets back the Mallory-worship. So...this book is a fairly good entry in an unusual, risk-taking series with some genuinely excellent titles."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I have read all her books and have enjoyed each of them. This one is the best yet. She actually makes Mallory human and the story hummed right along with each character an individual with a story of their own.Would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"There is a dead woman in her apartment and NY detective Kathy Mallory has taken off in a VW Beetle with a Porsche 911 engine to travel old Route 66. At the beginning of the highway, the intersection of Adams and Marshall in Chicago, lays a body with its hand pointing down the road. As Mallory is in search of her past, her friends Riker and Charles Butler, are after Mallory and join with a caravan of cars driven by the parent s of missing children brought together by the discovery of children's graves discovered all along this famous road.Reading O'Connell is such a pleasure. In Mallory she has created one of the most interesting female characters written and then added Riker as her friend and partner who loves her as she is, and Charles who just loves her, much to his detriment. In her usual style, O'Connell gives us a layered story of Mallory's search, the parent's plight and the battle of jurisdiction and corruption of the lead investigator. There is tragedy on many levels, humor to lighten things along the way, twists to keep the reader on their toes, and the metamorphosis of Mallory. Is this the end of the series? I certainly hope not, but as long as O'Connell keeps writing, I could bear it. I enjoyed everything about this book, include Route 66, some of which I have driven, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I love this character!

I've loved them all, and I strongly encourage you to read them all - IN THE CORRECT ORDER.While I love all of these books - each one develops the primary protagonist - Kathy Mallory - and her cohorts in crime - Charles and Riker - I REALLY loved this last book - FIND ME.The book is really 2 separate stories interwoven into one cohesive whole. What a unique mind to create such unique characters and events.While the human stories contained within this book are great, the book also celebrates another - called the \\"Mother Road\\", Route 66 comes alive in the pages of Find Me.

Even still, very entertaining mysteries all. However it will be very interesting to see what happens in the next one (if there is a next one) considering that a major mystery has been solved and should open up an entirely new avenue for this character."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I had a very hard time getting into this book.

I happen to have traveled route 66 in the 50's and 60's with my family on summer vacations so some of this book was wonderous memories. The characters are revealed in ways that make them feel as if I know them personally. The plot was thick with possibilities. I can only hope there is another Mallory novel."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I could hardly put this book down, even to eat.In this episode of the Mallory saga, we learn about her mystery father through a series of writings more than 20 years old about Route 66. At the same time, we learn more about Mallory. Compelled to follow his same route, she deals with murder, good and bad cops, parents of missing children, and her own motivations. She becomes a little more human without losing any of her special character.The themes incorporated into this novel of nostalgia for the decommissioned highway, the continuing pain of parents with lost children, the pain of the lost children themselves are mingled with the story of a serial killer, law enforcement turf wars and petty politics, personal growth and self-examination. That's a lot on one plate. But O'Connell does it beautifully. She manages these several threads without losing a beat on her characters. Even the most minor come across as flesh and blood people.I didn't know this book had come out last year or I would have bought it long before this, but I am certainly glad to have found it."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I'm surprised at the number of people who have complained that this novel took them a week to read. It took me that long I think--I don't keep track--but then I was paying attention to the plot and enjoying the reading. Like all the other Mallory novels, Find Me is beautifully written and complex. O'Connell's Rt 66 is a dark, poetic, magical setting where parents sacrifice themselves for their children and the dead sometimes return to protect the living. This is a definite must read, but the reader has to be willing to take the time to enjoy what O'Connell has put before him."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"This is an excellent book. Much anticipated. Brings into play a whole other dimension. Eagerly awaiting next book; hope we don't have to wait as long as we did for this one."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I went looking for a new Mallory story from Carol O'Connell after reading Stieg Larson's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo because it seemed to me that he'd created a character in homage to O'Connell's Mallory. I read the first few Mallory novels -- Mallory's Oracle to Stone Angel -- published in the US between 1995 and 1998 but stopped the series because I was burned out on crime fiction. Still, Kathleen Mallory was an unusual and unforgettable character -- abused as a child and a gifted computer hacker as an adult, a cold-hearted loner loyal unto death to those under her protection, a merciless predator whose friends assume she's a sociopath -- who sprang to mind as soon as I encountered Larson's Lisbeth Salander. Find Me -- the latest Mallory -- drew the most raves of the five novels I'd missed, and may in fact be the final novel in the series, judging by the last line in the book: \\"And Mallory's road was run.\\"In Find Me Kathleen Mallory has gone AWOL from her job as a NYPD homicide detective to take a road trip on Route 66 after obtaining a packet of letters from the father she never met which lay out the trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, pairing the places that must been seen along the way with the music that must be playing during those stops. But Mallory soon learns she isn't the only person making the trip. A convoy of parents of missing children and their Internet guru has embarked on a similar journey to publicize their plight and the fact that the FBI is unearthing dozens of tiny corpses of little girls murdered and buried along Route 66 over the past 30 years by a serial killer dubbed Mack the Knife. Late arrivals to the convoy include Mallory's NYPD partner, Riker, and the egghead shrink who loves her, Charles Butler. The murder of a parent suggests that killer is part of the convoy and so the game is on.It's easy to see why Mallory devotees love this book. The completion of Mallory's mysterious back story serves to complete the humanizing that has been underway since her first appearance in print. But the novel may not be as satisfying to readers unfamiliar with the series. The story unfolds through the inter-cutting viewpoints of a bunch of characters major and minor with individual scenes ranging in length from a paragraph to several pages. The effect is, I suppose, cinematic with a series of quick cuts, but to me the overall effect was disjointed and off-putting. For a story to really grab me, I need at most a handful of characters and among that handful a sympathetic individual worth my emotional investment. Despite my familiarity with Mallory and her horrific background, I found it difficult to warm up to her in Find Me because the quick cuts left me with little opportunity for sustained engagement with any character."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I'll refer to it in MY review. I have adored the Mallory books, since reading the first one. The only one I didn't like had a lot to do with magicians, which I am not interested in! THIS book is another in her line of great reads.

In fact she is the only author whose books I buy hardcovered.Being a fan of Kathy Mallory and having read every book in the Mallory series I have to say after reading \\"FIND ME\\"; in the Kathy Mallory series I was disappointed at the end of the book. I was also confused at the end of the book as I couldn't help think that Carol O'Connell was ending the Mallory series and she was ending it in a way that was disappointing.Sure Mallory finds her father, but there is no closure between Mallory and Charles. Riker (Mallory's cop partner) is off on a highway by himself heading for New York, and Charles is walking away from Mallory.If this book was the end of the series what a sad confused ending it was.I hope I am wrong and there will be more Mallory books forth coming from Carol O'Connell and that there will be a happy ending for Charles and Mallory together."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"This book was so disappointing. One reviewer wrote what I was also thinking, this book was all over the place. Mallory's character was more annoying than interesting.

Wait for the paperback, don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"Sometimes success can go to an author's head ... er .. pen. Look, for example, at the latest Bob Lee Swagger effort from Stephen Hunter. THERE is a writer clearly overtaken by his creation. Not so with O'Connell. I admit that WINTER HOUSE worried me. Not up to her usual standard. The omens and portents for another superior Mallory following WH were dark and cloudy. But then, out of nowhere, along comes FIND ME. Not just good, her best. Not just great american fiction; you can, if you are so inclined, do your entire thesis on this one. O'Connell went into FIND ME having already(!) mastered the extraordinary feat of writing two stories at one time -- the obvious murder mystery hidden behind the less-obvious character mystery. Her she trumps even herself, writing three stories all-at-once, so carefully blended together that you don't even recognize the third (and most potent) one until the very last paragraph of the book. Nothing less than extraordinary. Don't read it. Savor it."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"My question to those who have given this book a poor review -- why would you start reading a series at the end? What is this, number 9 in Mallory books? OF COURSE the main character doesn't make sense!

I was sorry to see an end to this story, and I think, to the series."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"This is a crime novel that I had to read very carefully. I couldn't skim or skip because I might have missed something.

She is heading for the famous route 66. Back in New York City, a woman is found dead in Mallory's apartment. Mallory's partner sets off looking for her. Mallory and Riker get involved in a search for a serial killer and with a caravan of parents looking for their children.Although the story is unique, I found it difficult at times to continue reading it.

So, I thought I'd love Kathy Mallory. Not!I am aware that there is a series of Mallory's \\"adventures\\". I am aware that one needs to read a couple of other books of the series before rendering a verdict. However, this book alone was enough for me to decide that I won't be reading another book by Carol O'Connell.In this series, Mallory hits Route 66 for two purposes. One, to find her father or rather, to find pieces of his life. You see, Mallory was a \\"feral\\" child before she was caught and adopted by, now deceased, Lou Markowitz, a legendary cop/detective. Two, she's in search of a serial killer who abducts, kills and buries children by the edges of Route 66.Initially, sounds interesting. However, the Mallory character is hard to relate or sympathize. You could say that despite of it all, Mallory is still feral. She's unapproachable, brash and has a big chip on her shoulder. Sure, people can be tough...but show a little humanity.Nah. I'll stick with Kinsey Millhone and Kay Scarpetta any day."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"This is my first read of a Carol O'Connell novel so I don't know what the previous in the series were like. However, I'll never find out. I just couldn't follow this story; it was all over the place. Events were jumbled. Had I not read the end flap, I basically would have had no idea whatsoever what the plot was supposed to be about. O'Connell assumes the reader knows more than they do, I think. The writing was neither smooth nor particularily compelling. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the ending as I never got there; I was too hopelessly lost in the poorly executed plot. Any book that it so poorly written that I cannot finish it gets one star from me. Unfortunately, I purchased this book new. Wish I could get my money back. Life is too short to read bad books!"},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"Introduced in MALLORY'S ORACLE, Carol O'Connell's debut novel, Kathleen Mallory and her origins have been as mysterious as some of her cases. FIND ME, O'Connell's latest work, provides Mallory and her fans with some answers.This complex and occasionally murky work begins with Mallory's unexplained absence from her position as a New York City homicide detective. Detective Sergeant Riker, Mallory's erstwhile police partner, visits her apartment in an effort to discover the reason for her being away. What he finds, however, is the body of an unknown woman, dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the beginning of not one but two mysteries that slowly and excruciatingly will unravel across thousands of miles of legendary highway.Mallory is in pursuit of two haunting enigmas. One is of a monster who has murdered over 100 innocents, leaving their bodies scattered in a seemingly random pattern across the western half of the United States. The other is the father she never knew, a man whose only legacy is a series of letters that, in their way, serves as a starting point to the solution to both puzzles. The common element that the two mysteries share is Route 66, the idealized, iconic link between Chicago and Los Angeles. For years the serial killer has been kidnapping children and burying them along the unmarked, disappearing highway. Mallory's absentee father, meanwhile, had sent before her birth a series of descriptive essays from various points along Route 66, providing a visual and (in some cases) aural guidebook.The beginning of Mallory's journey is cursed with a murder, as a body is discovered in Chicago at the famous eastern origin of Route 66. Mallory, the adult seeking her phantom, unknown father, joins an ever-growing caravan of parents traveling along the highway searching for their missing children. She brings an almost psychopathic relentlessness to her pursuit, as clues ebb, flow and dovetail. Riker, pursuing Mallory in an effort to help and protect, is an almost hapless presence for Mallory, as are a number of other characters from past installments in the series, who are more or less along for the ride. It is, however, primarily through their eyes that FIND ME is told, as Mallory, almost to the very end, is an enigmatic presence, more a driven force of nature than a protagonist who readers can ever really come to know.As FIND ME progresses, we learn --- as Mallory has intuited, perhaps all along --- that the killer is among the parents' hopeful, sorrowful caravan and that he is manipulating not only their journey but also the investigation. Yet, by the time the reader discovers the killer's true identity, who he isn't is in some ways more important than who he is, so that the revelation is somewhat anti-climactic. What ultimately makes the effort of reading the novel more than worthwhile, however, is the solution to Mallory's other puzzle, one that in its occurrence and aftermath is stirring and, in this darkest of tales, most welcome.FIND ME leaves Mallory, and possibly O'Connell, at a crossroads. It is a perfect place to end the series and yet could also provide a jump point for a new direction to the series. While it is doubtful that the book will attract new readers to this complex, enigmatic character and storyline, fans will find their long infatuation with Mallory rewarded, and then some.---Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"I've read on another site that the publisher has called this the final in the Kathy Mallory series. Judging by the other reviews, and my own love of the series, this is sad but somehow not unexpected given the ending of this novel.This novel is beyond entertainment. The brilliance in the series and in this novel in particular is in everything from the intertwined and unfolding story lines, to the prose and its humour, and finally to the characters and the humanity that O'Connell somehow instils in them. I have nothing to compare it with. It was wonderful to learn more about Mallory and her past, and to entertain possibilities for her future.

I find her character very layered and I love this about Mallory. \\"Find Me\\" is just one of her latest journeys toward healing her past.

My favorites are Mallory's Oracle, Stone Angel and now, Find Me. Given her rough life between \\"almost 7\\" and 10 years old, it is amazing that Mallory even survived so that the Markowitz's could take her in and nurture her.The stress of living her rigid life and being a Special Crimes Detective have taken their toll on Mallory. She had her supporters in Charles and Riker, even when they thought she was being bizarre. There were other supporters, friends of Markowitz, who cut her lots of slack because she is so brilliant at her job. I was getting worn down by Mallory fighting everyone in her life. In Find Me, Mallory \\"plays nicer\\".I realized early that Mallory was on an exploration of Route 66 (because of her father's letters) that just happenned to coincide with the serial killer's life. \\"Sentimental\\" would be a difficult word to use for those who know Mallory. Being the great detective that she is, she modified her trip to help solve the Chicago murder mystery that she stumbled upon. No crimes like the little graves along Route 66 could go unpunished in her code of living. I had to take my time and read carefully, but still managed to finish the book in 2 1/2 days.In Find Me, it looks as if Mallory may now have a life worth living. I would love to read more.

I would love to see any new direction this would lead in, but I don't know if its meant to be wrapped up here."},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"This is the eighth book in a remarkable series that focuses on Kathy Mallory, a New York police detective with a unique past and personality. Mallory was found as a child living on the streets, unable to remember much of her past. She is possessed of amazing abilities in computers and analysis; she is also emotionally remote and unable to give or receive love. Nonetheless, she is fiercely loved and protected, first by her adoptive father, the late detective Louis Markowitz, and now by two friends, her partner, the hard-bitten alcoholic Riker, and her friend and fellow genius Charles Butler, a big, goofy, and warm-hearted psychologist.While each of these books is held together by some kind of a murder mystery, taken together they are really quite an achievement, for they tell the story of several lost people attempting to make sense of the past, find meaning in a cruel and often violent world, and understand what it is to love and be a decent human being. To tell this story, O'Connell has constructed an entire alternate reality, which sometimes possesses elements of magic and the supernatural in unexpected ways. Because of the complicated structure and emotional themes of these books, they don't always work perfectly, and they're not for everybody. Still, O'Connell has really transcended crime fiction and created literature that I believe will have lasting merit.In this book, Mallory continues to search for her past, going on a cross-country journey on old Route 66 to find out what happened to her father, who abandoned her before she was born. At the same time, she becomes involved with a bus caravan of parents of missing children trying to draw attention to their cause. Surprises ensue. A must read for fans of the series.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis & Clark\\""},{"Title":"Find Me (A MALLORY NOVEL)","review":"O'Connell has succeeded again in creating an intricate masterpiece where the subplots mirror the main plot, the characters are unique, and Mallory is slowly cracking showing she just might not be the total sociopath you thought she was.

Meanwhile, a serial killer is out on the loose murdering the parents of the children that he has already killed. Mallory then must solve both cases at the same time.The depiction of Ariel Finn was so graphic and heroic that I was actually brought to tears imagining the scene in my mind. O'Connell shines in the details; everything is palpable and just so odd we can really can see these things happening in real life.

At one point she beats up an FBI agent without provocation and then walks away, while neither her victim nor his colleagues make any attempt to arrest her. The author really lost me with this scene; not only was it unrealistic, but it made Mallory seem like the quintessential bad cop - a violent nutjob who should not be carrying a gun or a badge.On the plus side, the prose is crisp and clean.

The first three volumes were released in 1933, the next three were released in 1939, and the last four volumes in 1954. The preceding volume in the series isA Study of History, UNABRIDGED Volume VIII / Eight / 8, and the next volume isA Study of History. Volume X.He observes, \\"The fundamental faith of Western Man had always been a belief that the Universe was subject to Law and was not given over to Chaos, and a deist or atheist Late Modern Western Man's version of this Western faith was... that the law of the Universe was a system of 'laws of Nature' which were accessible to progressive investigation, discovery, and formulation by a Collective Human Intellect.\\" (Pg. 192)He wonders, \\"If Freedom is to be taken as being a relative concept, and if all mutually contrary and contradictory laws in an ascending hierarchy are in some sense laws of God... is there any sense in which the Law of Love can be called God's Law without qualification, and in which the freedom to be found in God's service is, after all, not relative, but truly 'perfect'?\\" (Pg. 404)He admits, \\"As he took up his pen to write the present Part of this book [\\"The Prospects of Western Civilization\\"], the writer was conscious of a sense of distaste for this self-imposed task... it was, of course, clear that the forecasts about the prospects of Western Civilization that he was venturing to put on paper might be belied by events before the ink was dry...

[that] the prospects of the Western Civilization were at any rate very much less obscure than they had been when, in the early months of the year 1929, he had been drafting the original notes for this Part that were now lying at his elbow.\\" (Pg. 406) He added, \\"Western Society held the fate of all Mankind in its hands at a moment when the West's own fate lay on the finger-tip of one man in Moscow and one man in Washington...

Gurdjieff often stated that the basis of his teaching was esoteric Christianity. In GNOSIS, Boris Mouravieff reveals that this Tradition is found in its complete form in Greece and Russia, transmitted by the &quot;Great Esoteric Brotherhood.&quot; The author informs us that this ancient Tradition in which is found all of the Fourth Way's ideas, diagrams, cosmologies, and exercises, comes from the heart of Eastern Christianity. Anyone long-studied in these ideas will recognize that this book expresses the very essence of the teaching. Mouravieff, who knew both Gurdjieff and Ouspensky before their appearance in western Europe, presents an astonishing display of brilliant and profound wisdom. There is no denying the authoritative atmosphere which radiates from every page. These volumes will require all who seek awakening to reconsider in a new light the great legacy left us by Gurdjieff."},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"Mouravieff's Gnosis series presents a rendering of Gurdjieff's teaching, as transmitted and reported by Ouspensky. On top of the kernel of the 4th Way Work ideas, Mouravieff adds concepts that are specific to him alone, namely the notion of polar beings, the division of mankind into Adamic and Preadamic man plus generally synarchistic political ideas and some speculations about esoteric history.To derive benefit from this series, we must consider these elements each in turn.Mouravieff's cosmology and description of man's inner structure is basically Gurdjieffian. Whether he got this from Ouspenskky or some other source is unclear, however Mouravieff did not get it from Gurdjieff directly. In his own words, he found it as a fragmentary oral tradition in Eastern Orthodox monasticism. Be the case as it may, Mouravieff lays out the system with a good sense for structure.For intellectually oriented people, this is a nice rendition of a complex set of ideas and the schematics of the worlds, hydrogens, centers and so forth provide good cognitive tools for describing self and the world. Of course we always run the risk of confusing the thing itself with the word or symbol if we take these of necessity approximate theoretical descriptions too literally.Mouravieff very specifically presents all ideas in a Christian context, whereas Gurdjieff and Ouspensky are not specifically tied to the Christian context. At any rate, his quoting and interpreting of the New Testament is clever and insightful, whether he penetrates to the intended inner meaning of the text is something we cannot determine with certainty.When seeking to understand the 4th Way Work ideas, Gnosis can be a good additional source for another perspective on the same or related concepts. It is more of a textbook than In Search of the Miraculous or Beelzebub's Tales. Whether this is a plagiarism of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky or another transmission of the same source as Gurdjieff's is uncertain. Still, this is a work of intellect and reading it with attention can deepen one's understanding.Historically, Mouravieff had little respect for Gurdjieff and even though the two met a number of times, Mouravieff was never a participant in the Work. Mouravieff found Gurdjieff personally little better than a snake charmer. Gurdjieff likely considered Mouravieff an exterior man with only theoretical ideas. This is good to keep in mind as background.But let us talk about things which are proper to Gnosis and not generally foun in 4th Way literature.The concept of Adamic and Preadamic man basically states that one half of humanity has a \\"soul\\" capable of esoteric evolution away from the mechanicity of the world and that the other half has no such soul. The two types are basically evenly mixed in families and nations and no exterior test can discern the difference. The concept is on one hand helpful for explaining why some people have an esoterically inclined spirit and others not. On the otherhand, this can feed feelings of specialness and give rise to labeling and name calling. Laura Knight-Jadczyk elaborates on these ideas in depth at her www.cassiopaea.org site under the heading of \\"organic portals.\\"The other idea proper to Gnosis is the notion of \\"polar opposites,\\" a man and woman \\"made for each other., the two halves of the androgyne of Plato's symposium. These two halves would be precisely complementary and when united could achieve rapid spiritual progress. This Mouravieff calls the \\"fifth way.\\" Well, if one subscribes to any notion of preincarnative life plan or soul essence one brings with one when born into this world, then one cannot exclude the possibility that such \\"meant to be\\" couples may occur. Whether this is a universal law and applies to each is however less certain. Again, the treatment of polarity by Mouravieff, even when not talking about the perfect match, provides a nice framework for thought about attractions and affinities. Again, this is a conceptual device, to be used if found helpful.Mouravieff's political ideas are rather naively synarchistic. He talks about bringing the world under one government, under some sort of enlightened supervision by the UN or similar, guided by a sort of spiritual elite. Failure to do this would cause the world to meet a fiery end in the not very distant future, a sort of failure of the divine experiment of Earth, where the planet did not deliver the prescribed quota of consciousness.The idea of the Earth producing a sort of harvest of sufficiently evolved souls is not specific to Mouravieff, the same is found with Gurdjieff and many present day sources. The synarchistic gloss and apocalyptic tone is all Mouravieff's own, though.Gnosis has many good conceptual tools for organizing ideas and describing things. The book is almost exclusively geared to the intellectual side of man and is abstract and academic in tone. Reading the book and attempting to apply the concepts and descriptions to real life situations and phenomena can be an enriching experience. One should have the proper experimental spirit and not take everything too literally or at face value. Mouravieff has the tendency to makeauthoritative and dogmatic sounding statements about very complex matters, whose complete description is likely above any human capacity. Use the schematic where it helps but do not confuse the picture with the real thing, as Gurdjieff might say, do not fall into \\"formatory thinking.\\""},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"Man is asleep. This is the explicit message of the 4th Way school, and the implicit message of many other spiritual traditions. In \\"Gnosis\\", Mouravieff, who was loosely associated with Gurdjieff, describes a method, based on esoteric teachings of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, that is to lead to our awakening and consequent salvation.Mouravieff argues that most of our actions and thoughts are just mechanical reactions to stimulae. We identify ourselves with those thoughts and actions and put the label \\"I\\" on them, thus giving them authorship. However, it would be more correct to speak of many \\"I\\"s. And, if we are truthful with ourselves, we will admit that these actions and thoughts do not proceed from our will but sort of \\"happen to us\\".So far, so good. Anyone who has done any meditation training will be familiar to some extent with the above description. We sit in meditation and tend to our breath, a mantra, a prop. Very soon, though, we will be distracted by a myriad of thoughts, some of them very strange indeed. Whence did they arise? We are taught, in such cases, to observe these thoughts and return to our concentration. We can see that in some way the thoughts that arise are alien to us and the \\"observer\\" is the one, permanent, I. Let us call this \\"observer\\" the True I.These worldy phenomenon- be they thoughts, emotions or events- to which we usually identify ourselves are given the name of \\"A\\" influences. Occasionally we will have another type of higher experience, named \\"B\\" influences or those issuing from God.It occurs to me that one should observe the \\"A\\" influences from the vantage point of the True I and willfully decide to engage them or not. The idea is to enter into a more conscious role with the world and ourselves. Mouravieff has other ideas though.We should according to him, \\"never again participate enthusiastically in life. In other words one must die to life if one is to deflect the \\"A\\" influences and attract more of the \\"B\\" influences.Here is where Mouravieff shows his hand and where I must part company with him. He views the fall of man from a strictly negative point of view similar to some forms of gnosticism. Life is an evil into which man has fallen and you had better disengage with it. Instead could not there be a positive view of the fall: that it is also a chance for creation and consciousness to expand?In order for consciousness to grow, life must be engaged consciously and not avoided. To do so, one must be a conscious participant and not just a disinterested actor (as Mouravieff suggests).

As many others have pointed out, these folks are working with largely the same patterns or pool of truth; the same principles that have also played a part in the formation of all major religions and schools of philosophy and our most cherished myths, archetypes and storylines.To label Mouravieff's Gnosis as strictly rooted in Esoteric Christianity is missing the point, I'd say. His work is like the study of sacred geometry. We don't have to question the validity of the golden mean; it is self-evident. We can look around and apply it to practical things and it corresponds to real life very usefully, showing us additional threads of truth in new dimensions. Such are the patterns Mouravieff shines new light upon, making more advanced understanding of their own models possible for many people already on or interested in beginning their own journey toward greater freedom. Yes, some of the comparisons and examples he uses come from better known threads also running throughout Christianity. I'm not too picky about where I find my truth, or what color clothes its wearing, and thankfully neither does/is Mouravieff. He's interested in what shows him yet greater truth.That said, it can be a rather comprehensive read and it's the kind of book that, for me anyway, requires reading at least a couple times to really feel like it's digested. If you don't want to work/reach for understanding, don't get this book. As Mouravieff clearly discloses early on, there are many areas of study that are relatively skimmed over (because as the title implies, it is the Exoteric version of the info he's got to share) and makes it clear that the further volumes will revisit these gaps in the information. He delivers on these promises, and reminds where we left on when he gets back around for a second pass, providing greater resolution of the models and concepts.For example, in this first volume, one portion I didn't totally get was the \`lateral octave'. But sure enough, after sidetracking into many other areas through the rest of the first book -necessary items that arrive eventually at... Book Two (the Mesoteric), which comes back to lateral octaves and Lo and Behold it makes so much more sense.Now back to the deep seated need some reviewers have of relating everything Mouravieff says to what Gurdjieff, Ouspenksy, or even Patterson(?) say. seriously? I mean don't get me wrong, I loved \`Eating the I' as an honest human perspective of a seeker encountering some of the most challenging involutionary experiences of his life, but he's no expert on Mouravieff.It's certainly worth giving these other great thinkers' books a spin or two; don't get me wrong. Gurdjieff has an anecdotal style, which can be very entertaining, and consequently is great for attracting devotees, not so much self-motivated seekers --or they quickly go on to their own variations of similar philosophic exploration. Gurdjieff's is primarily a style of information transmission that is more palatable for people at particular earlier parts of the curve or those who enjoy a storytelling style of teaching/learning. Ouspensky bends toward the rational, scientific analysis, which is a refreshing beam of reason if you try to make it through something like Gurdjieff's Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson (IMHO it strikes me as cryptic, or needlessly veiled, but then again I never have really meshed with that style).But if I were going to seriously compare Mouravieff with other writers like G and O, head to head, I'd say Mouravieff just goes so much further and really synthesizes into whole new dimensions. Think golden spiral, Logos, the underlying ordering principles of the universe. THIS is the stuff of his Gnosis series. The diagrams and clear and succinct examples he provides have been invaluable in my studies.There are some other reviewers who attempt to portray Mouravieff's work as being dark, even dystopic, or promoting defeatism. Wow. Really missing the point, and should consider reading further on.Mouravieff *does* clearly state what a wonderful opportunity Human Life and the Fall are. In Vol II pg. 95 he says \\"...Thus human birth emerges as the highest possible birth in the whole Universe. Amongst other things, this is the reason for the Traditional statement that even the angels, if they wish to evolve, are obliged to pass through a human incarnation. For despite all its inconveniences, this is the only opportunity for evolution towards and through the second Birth\\"This is a prime example of the essence of his intention and message."},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"I know of no equivalent discussion of philosophicaland or metaphysical matters.

Those who are familiar with the \\"Fourth Way\\" system of G.I. Gurdjieff should note that the two are essentially the same tradition, however Mouravieff provides considerable Biblical and Apocryphal referencing to propose that the system is at root an \\"inner\\" or \\"esoteric\\" form of Christianity.While I do not agree with Mouravieff's overly-Christian gloss (Gurdjieff himself mentioned that the Tradition was pre-Egyptian), the attention to detail and thoroughness Mouravieff has displayed in writing the series has to be commended. If Ouspensky considered his Fourth Way magnum opus, \\"Fragments of an Unknown Teaching\\", then Mouravieff's \\"Gnosis\\" series can be considered to be a more integrated version of the Tradition. It is unlikely however that even Mouravieff knew the full picture, and has presented us with what he has been able to find.This first book, \\"The Exoteric Cycle\\", provides the fundamentals of the teaching in straightforward, if somewhat technical, language. The essential theme is that mankind exists in a hypnotic trance that keeps people asleep, relatively docile, reactive and mechanical. A person has no true, permanent sense of self, going from one subjective mood, aim, and action to another, dependant on whatever external circumstance occurs. This premise is supported by the science of modern psychology; likewise the starting point for a way out of this state of affairs - self-observation.The book is divided into 3 main sections: Man, The Universe, & The Way. The first section expounds predominantly upon the structure of the psyche of man, the division into \\"centers\\" of psychological activity (intellectual, emotional, instinctive or \\"moving\\", and sexual). Certain other centers exist initially only in potential (higher intellectual, higher emotional, magnetic center etc), although they can be actualised if conscious efforts are made. The second section is focused on the Universe and its multi-layered structure, governed predominantly by two major laws (The Law of Three, and The Law of Seven) which from the Source then diversify into layers of increasing materiality and rigidity, governed by larger and larger sets of \\"sub-laws\\", the sum of which are taken on this level of reality under the name \\"The General Law\\" (or Law of Accident).The third section outlines the spiritual aim of man - to liberate oneself from the General Law and be \\"reborn\\" as a conscious being serving the greater good of All - as well as the Way by which this aim might be realised.While Mouravieff has been accused of plagiarism of Fourth Way material (notably by William Patrick Patterson), there are concepts here that I found unique to Mouravieff. His discussions of the film, the ascending spiral, and the Courtly Love tradition are worth investigation and meditation on. There are other concepts (such as pre-adamic and adamic man) in the later books that have no known correlate in the Fourth Way teachings (except perhaps in veiled allegory or innuendo) that I am aware of.As a system of self-work and study, it is fairly straightforward and lacking in much of the \\"occult\\" symbolism and mumbo-jumbo that one tends to find in other mystical or hermetic traditions. Mouravieff appeals to the scientist, rather than the mystic, in the reader, and I give him due credit for taking this approach. The development of reason is lauded in these writings as a means to progress, rather than being considered a \\"distraction\\" to the goals of only \\"thinking positive\\" or meditative navel-gazing (as one tends to find in the spectrum of New Age philosophies and systems).Overall, this book is highly recommended to all spiritual seekers and especially those interested in the Fourth Way, Gnostic or esoteric Christian traditions."},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"I just finished the Exoteric Cycle a couple weeks ago. For those already familiar with the Fourth Way, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, etc. this stuff will not be new. Sometimes, new words are used to define old ideas. Other times, the usual terms remain unchanged, although frequently a new and subtle shade of meaning is revealed. That's how I generally feel about Gnosis volume I. It methodically (some would say tediously) walks the well-worn path of esotericism, but this time adding a fresh coat of paint to the fencing and perhaps repairing a few damaged cobblestones along the way. How Mouravieff's Tradition runs virtually parallel to Gurdjieff's System is never directly answered. I'm hoping the other books, or additional research of my own, uncover their common roots.My biggest complaint about the book (and this may be cleared up by the 2nd and 3rd volumes) is that it reinforces the need for x, y, and z without teaching readers exactly how x, y, and z are achieved. A smaller complaint is the translation. For example, one has to get more than halfway through the text before discovering that \\"constatation\\" basically means Self-Remembering.Those with an interest in esoteric Christianity (unfortunately, gnostic Christianity is given scant attention) or wanting a Christian bias in their 4th Way education should definitely pick this up. Students who have already read the main texts may not find as much in the Exoteric Cycle, but I think that one can't receive the Work from too many angles. There's always a little something hiding in each perspective.Compared to non 4th Way books, this probably deserves 5 stars, but within the realm of available esoteric tomes, volume I was not as impressive as it could have been... that is why I gave it 4 stars here.

This book, the first of a series of three, is for those who are serious about their inner lives, and if you are serious, you will read all three. They must be read in order, and especially you need to read the first book first because it gives you definitions you will need in the other two books. The books were originally written in 1961 in French and not translated until 1992. In my opinion, it's a shame it took so long. I think it's also a shame that the Church fathers who knew the truth about these principles did not teach them to the public. If they had been taught widely, we might not be facing annihilation as we are today, for, according to the author, it is the imbalance in man's development that is leading us down the road to destruction.The author says, \\"To overcome death is the watchword of esoteric science.\\" And that is what these books are teaching, how to do it. He explains who and what man is and that, lacking spirituality due to our lack of emotional maturity, we have allowed the Personality, which isn't the real us at all, and which is totally inadequate to rule, to dominate our lives.He says that we have a motor center, an intellectual center, and an emotional center. Because we have greatly developed the first two centers and totally neglected the emotional center, most people are emotionally immature. This means that we are basically nothing more than intelligent animals, and are reduced to animal behavior due to this lack of emotional maturity. And it is the emotions which link us to the spiritual world.Below I paraphrase some of his ideas along these lines:Due to its complete neglect, alongside the exaggerated development of the physical and intellectual centers, the emotional center in cultured contemporary man looks like a poor relation. Religious instruction is no longer obligatory in civilized countries, and what there is of it is intellectualized. The positive side of the emotional center is in perpetual lethargy, if not actually paralyzed, while the negative part follows the habits of animals. At the least unpleasantness the machinery of negative emotions begins to act, or rather overreact. Man is weaponless against his own passions creating a dangerous and violent world.As far as man's love life is concerned, the positive tenderness of genuine affection is replaced with sensationalism dominated by a spirit of possession. Sexual inclinations are often deformed in one way or another, creating more dangerous situations.The author also suggests that if one can recognize and work with his or her integral polar opposite, spiritual progress can be speeded up tremendously.There is repetition in these books, but I feel it is needed to drive home the message. Some of the technical explanations are beyond me, but don't detract from the main theme of the books as far as I'm concerned.I believe that people today know that something is wrong with our world, but they are confused about it. I can tell by what the TV and radio commentators who are trying to lead us out of our problems have to say. They are trying to help and think they have the answers, but they never really get to the heart of the matter. They understand that we need spirituality in our lives, but they don't go deep enough. Our government apparently believes that high intellectuality solves everything, and spirituality is not needed when true spirituality is the one thing that we do need, and desperately."},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"This book is part of 3 books with the title Gnosis, that deals with the fourth way teachings. For those unfamiliar with Gurdjieff and the fourth way I would recommend reading Ouspensky first and in particular \\"In search of the Miraculous\\".Mouravieff brings many of the same teachings up as in the above mentioned book by Ouspensky, but he adds his own insights to certain topics and adds new concepts such as the idea of polar beings. There is a Christian flavour throughout the book with many quotes from the New Testamente. This would have to be taken with a grain of salt, especially after having read Burton Mack's excellent bookThe Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins, where he raises serious and valid questions to the historicalness of the New Testament.For any student of the 4'th way I would recommend reading this series of books, but be prepared that it takes more stamina to read as it to me has a more theoretical flavour than Ouspensky's book mentioned above."},{"Title":"Gnosis, Exoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy (Vol 1)","review":"I started reading the three books a second time.

Great confusion replaced my interest, and I put the book down for a while.Then I discovered a book by Patterson called Taking With The Left Hand. In it he discussed Mouravieff as a bit of an imposter. He did not actually study with Gurdjieff and may have actually plagiarized Ouspensky. His addition of courtly love was an attempt to create a 5th way which Gurdjieff did not teach, and his use of the phrase 'eastern orthodox tradition' may be based on a misunderstanding of something Gurdjieff did say, indicating a form of Christianity older than Egypt, not the Eastern Orthodox brand.So before buying this, research Mouravieff and maybe read Patterson. Being gay, I cannot get past that certain paragraph and so may never read v. 2 or 3."},{"Title":"Corporate Finance: A Focused Approach","review":"I used this textbook for one of my graduate level finance classes, and I just loved the book!

The entries are unsurpassed so far as classical music is concerned, but I did have to look for other resources when I needed accurate indepth information on jazz or popular music. It would be difficult in this day and age to have one all-encompassing reference on every musical style in existence, so I think that the work stands on its own and may dilute its effectiveness if it were to overextend itself by trying to accomodate everybody. As a former composition student and someone who scored in the top 3% on the music theory portion of the graduate record exam, I wholeheartedly recommend this dictionary."},{"Title":"Harvard dictionary of music,","review":"This book, together with 'Baker's Bigoraphical Dictionary of Musicians', is one of my most frequently used reference books. The edition I have is Willi Apel's second edition, revised and expanded; there is a later Harvard Dictionary of Music done by another editor, but this one has been on my shelf for over twenty years, and I have come to find it incredibly useful for ready reference as well as giving information for further research.Most entries have citation and bibliographic information so that further research becomes an easier task; my one regret in this direction is that there has been so much scholarly work done in the past thirty years since this publication that is missed from this listing, but much of music reference material is not that time sensitive.This is a very comprehensive text with regard to music technical information, particularly when it comes to ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods. In the modern area, it is a little less helpful, and does not really address the area of pop music at all.The one thing I could wish for would be an index of some sort in the rear; even designed as a dictionary, many articles become encyclopedic in length or nature, and an index would have made this that much more useful. However, there is a good deal of cross-referenced material, making it easy to use in research mode.The entries themselves range from just a few words (for example, Gusto, con [It.] - With style, with zest.) to multi-page entries (examples include the entries on countries such as France and Germany, discussing their histories of musical tradition). There are entries of history, of technique, of composition, of instruments, even of the mathematics and physics of sound, harmony and rhythm. Many major opeas and other musical pieces have entries - however, this is not a biographical dictionary, so there are very few entries of this sort. The listings go from Mozarabic chant to Mozarteum, for instance, without Mozart between them.One might have minor quibbles here and there with the data (and no such undertaking as massive as this dictionary can be without fault and error), but in general, this dictionary serves the general seeker and the student of music very well."},{"Title":"Harvard dictionary of music,","review":"I purchased the HARVARD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC (KINDLE EDITION) with some really high expectations.

For example, if I'm searching for the word \\"tetrachord\\", I'll get 39 results. In those results, I still need to find which is the definition and which are occurences throughout the dictionary.

Do not buy it."},{"Title":"Harvard dictionary of music,","review":"As someone who knows extemely little about classical music who wants to know more, I bought this book some time ago and, it has been quite helpful. However, it is also true that although this the twenty first printing was in 1997, this, the Revised Edition was copyrighted in 1972 by Willi Apel (and previous copyright dates of the book were 1944 and 1969 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College). This Second Edition undoubtely needs to be revised. Since I have had it, I have noticed only a of couple areas in which I think it needs to be changed (and it has been extremely helpful as to others). Firstly, The entry on &quot;Ballet&quot; on pages 73-76. On page 75 this book still says &quot;There is still much disagreement about the quality of the ballet in the Soviet Union&quot; and proceeds with a brief paragraph about ballets performed and produced there. Since it not only is the Soviet Union not the Soviet Union any more, and since other things have changed as well since Willi Apel's page 75, there really ought to be revisions in this book reflecting that. Secondly, as to the entry &quot;Voices-ranges&quot; on page 920, this book says, &quot;Human voices are usually divided into six ranges: three female voices, soprano, mezzo-soprano and contralto, and three male voices, tenor, baritone and bass&quot; and subsquesntly gives subcategories of these, but omits countertenor entirely from this entry which it should not. It isn't that countertenor can't be located in this book. It is not with the rest of the voice types where it belongs, in my opinon. When I found it what it said was &quot;OLD (CAPS MINE) name for (male) alto, derived from CONTRATENOR ALTUS [See Contratenor] which I did on page 204 which said in part, that it explains, that four part writing and the consequent separation of ranges resulted in a renaming so that there existed contratenor altus (alto) and contrateor bassus (bass) which, the book says, explains the name alto &quot;for a part that, from a modern point of view, can hardly be considered 'high', as well as countertenor for the male alto&quot;. This entry sounds to me like it has relegated countertenors, who are alive and performing and recording now, to history. In my opinion the term countertenor should be included in the entry &quot;Voices-ranges&quot; with the rest of the male and female voice types, so they are all together where they belong. This entry also refers the reader to the word alto page on page 31, which states of the male alto &quot;....(2) Originally the alto was a high male voice....this type of voice, also known as countertenor, was cultivated especially in England, where the church music of the 16th and 17th centuries definitely implies its use.&quot; What this entry and these entires taken together also imply is that countertenors, male altos as such, are history since they are not included in the entry &quot;Voices-ranges&quot; as extant in the world which is to say living now , performing now, and recording now. Saying that this voice type (p. 31) was cultivated in England where the church music of the 16th and 17th centuries implies its use says nothing to me about the use of this voice type in the latter half of the 20th cantury and in the 21st century. I am very new to classical music and I am living proof that it doesn't require a lot to know that t here are countertenors : Charles Brett, countertenor, one of the male soloists ( the soloists on this CD which is of H&auml;ndel's Messiah are: one soprano, one mezzo-soprano, the aforementioned countertenor, one tenor, one bass, and one boy soprano) singing as recorded on this exceptional recording of this 18th century work conducted by John Eliot Gardiner is one. I also have at the present time one recording each of Dunstable's Motets and The Old Hall Manuscript by The Hilliard ensemble (two countertenors, three tenors, two baritones) which I been able to listen to as much as I'd like to, but have enjoyed nevertheless. This book needs to be revised as to this subject matter and with a view to enabling readers to become aware of all of the voice types that there are as well as what they capable in the appropriate place which is in the same place. Additionally, since there have been recordings of works on period instruments for more than a few years, it would help if the differences between, for example, a period violin and modern violin were addressed in this book and they are not. As someone who knows little about this I hope that, for others( I am not in a position to buy a new edition of this book, if ever there will be one), there will be a revised edition without these problems. Highly recommended otherwise , however, at this time."},{"Title":"Round the World in Spanish (The round the world series)","review":"This dictionary contains a lot of information and words that are included in social studies and reading units in schools.

Fuller analyzes both theaters of operations in terms of initiative and resources giving invaluable, and relatively unbiased, insights into successes and failures at all levels of warfare, then integrating the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, demonstating how they affected each other and how they lead to the ultimate results of the operations, campaigns, and war itself. No military studies or modern military history library is complete without this work, which contains analyses that are essential to an understanding of the Second World War from a military perspective."},{"Title":"The Second World War, 1939-45,: A strategical and tactical history","review":"JFC Fuller, the author of The Second World War: A Strategical and Tactical History, just cannot be surpassed for the ability to see the big (REALLY BIG) picture and point out the good and bad in the strategic moves of the Allies and the Axis in the Second World War.For example, he is able to strip apart the decision by England and France to go to war over Poland, and he thinks it was a big error. Fuller calls attention to the debacle after Munich, and how the USSR was ready to intervene with the Allies to stop Hitler. But the Allies folded, and now Stalin perceived it was best for him to side with Hitler - and least for the moment. In 1939 the picture had changed, and England and France knew it. They also knew they could not significantly help Poland. Also, their decision was an abrupt change in policy which caught Hitler by surprise (so says Fuller) and he could not be expected to change his foreign policy so quickly.I do not agree with every point Fuller makes. For instance, I think Hitler was given many diplomatic warnings after he took over Checkoslovakia so the change in Allied position could not have been unexpected. But my criticism is beside the point. What JFC Fuller makes the reader do is THINK. And that is what history is all about.All through the book the author examines the tactics and strategy of the two sides from an expert's point of view. And he is an expert. This book was published before the secrets of Ultra and Magic were revealed, and Fuller decided not to alter his book (published in 1947) because of the new information. He decided his analysis was correct and the new information did not change his strategic thoughts. That is how broad his strategic thinking is - even something so important as Ultra did not throw off his big picture examination of the war.A great book!AD2"},{"Title":"The Second World War, 1939-45,: A strategical and tactical history","review":"If you want to study history from a military standpoint, you cannot beat J.F.C. Fuller.As he is fond of saying, \\"War is an extension of politics.\\" In all his books he begins his discussions by describing why the two sides are at war. What is each side trying to accomplish? He then narrows his focus to the particular battle in question. What is the relevance of this battle to the two antagonists and to the war he is discussing? He introduces the leaders of the two opposing forces, and discusses each sides strengths and weaknesses. He explains the plan each leader had going into the battle, and how the leader reacted to unexpected developments. And, of course, he describes the terrain, the effects of the terrain on each sides endeavors, and describes the battle. Unlike most historians, J.F.C. Fuller tells you why the winner won and why the loser lost. He doesn't pull any punches. If somebody messed up, he lets you know. For example he appears to have no fondness for Winston Churchill even though General Fuller is British. And, finally, he describes why this battle is important in history. For example, he claims that if the Christians had lost the Battle of Lepanto, we would all be Muslims today.I have read five of General Fuller's books, and I highly recommend him."},{"Title":"The Second World War, 1939-45,: A strategical and tactical history","review":"The word \\"Jews\\" has just three appearances in this book, \\"Jewish\\" just one.On page 400 \\"... the Germans exterminated hundreds of thousands of Jews and locked up hundreds of thousands of people in concentration camps.\\"The other two appear along with \\"Jewish\\" on page 30, where Fuller quotes from Mein Kampf."},{"Title":"The Second World War, 1939-45,: A strategical and tactical history","review":"I thought that the book conveyed clearly the military struggle on all of the fronts in the second world war. The author was an early proponent of the mechanised warfare that characterised the second world war. He explains the tactics and strategy of the antagonists he explains well and quite even-handedly. Giving credit and blame where they are due. The book falls down on the politics. The second world war was not like the gentlemanly affairs of the eighteenth century. It was a war of peoples and ideologies. The author is clearly more in sympathy with the beaten Germans (He was after all a supporter of Mosley). He can be understood for criticising the policy of strategic bombing (a waste of military resources he thinks), but he hardly mentions the extermination of the jews, gypsies and millions of Russians and Poles by Herr Hitler's forces. The killing of so many people helped the Nazi war effort not one bit.

I came here when I was young and I have tried many of the foods in this book and I must say that this is the best and most conscise cookbook on Russian Cooking.The book is very fat and thick but that is exactly why it is so good for its wealth of differnt varities of food for different occasions, from weddings to Easter(Kulichi). The book is 632 pages long including the index. The book is constrcuted in different chapters depending on what you want to cook. It also gives the americanized phonetic saying of how to say these foods in Russian which in my opinion would be very useful for both cultural and traveling reasons if you want to order the food there. The book has many chapters as I said earlier among them are &quot;Fish&quot; &quot;Soups&quot; and &quot;Meat.&quot;Among the most convenient things is the details told in teh making of the cookings. The details are so detailed stricken that it is impossible to go wrong.There are many foods here that Americans remember as being Russian among them &quot;borshcit&quot; which are told here to make.Plus some of the best thigns about this endeavor is the fact taht the recipe is written by a Russian Women which means that she knows how to cook this. This isnt' simply a book written by a visitor the country, this is written by a woman who grew up in the Soviet Union, having been a food critic for a very high circulating gazzette. The recipes are sometimes simple and sometimes a little bit more hard just like in any cookbook. Plus one of the other enticing features of the books contents is the fact that the book includes recipes from different Russian cultures, such as the Georgians and Ukranians and Belorussians. That is an incredible brush of stroke since many great &quot;Russian Foods&quot; are not russian at all but come from different Russian cultures.In the end, in my opinion this is the most detailed and conscise book on Russian cooking I have looked over yet. The thickness of the book says it all. The book includes a americanized way of pronouncing the cooking in Russian and is very detailed in its description of the food.

However, i use some as a general guide and improvise, and to jog my memory of the time i used to cook with my grandmother -- they are just not up to her standards. A number of them seem &quot;sovietized&quot; (my opinion, i've never lived there, but i know money was tight and some unusual or expensive ingredients were difficult to find for many years).Example: my granny's paskha recipe calls for 5 lbs. bakers cheese, 20 yolks, 4 cups sugar, whipping cream, nearly 2 lbs. butter, lots of vanilla beans (among other things); Volokh's recipe is quite frugal in comparison.I realize that good food takes time, but some recipes are WAY too time consuming, particularly those in the Pirogi section due to the way the chapter is structured, which forces you to flip back and forth between pages to assemble.Overall, an excellent, comprehensive collection of Russian recipes (with a few from non-Russian Commonwealth regions).

If you want current Russian cooking or cooking from other ex-Soviet republics, this book is not for you. It was written back in 1983 long before perestroika. I went to Russia during this time period and the dishes described are very much those you got if you paid with US dollars. I think the food was great. The book also contains some upper-class, Russian recipes from pre-revolutionary times. Most of them probably coming from the classicClassic Russian Cooking: Elena Molokhovets' \\"A Gift to Young Housewives\\".When I look at the book today, sadly, I find the recipes quite dull. This is often what happens when somebody makes a selection from a classic. When time passes that selection will feel more dated than the classic. This is clearly the case with this book. In contrast, if I look in Molokhovets's book I find lots of amazing, different dishes that I would like to try. Molokhovets is wild and the current author is pedestrian. Go to a food market in Moscow today and they have plenty of sturgeon, Russian caviar and other delicatessen.It would have been easy to recommend Molokhovets's book, but sadly the English edition is translated by a useless translator who removed 75% of the recipes because she didn't think they were relevant for the modern age. Seriously what a complete idiot. So the current book is worth three stars. If you are very interested in old Russian food, you can get hold of this book. If Molokhovets's book comes out with a proper translation, that is the book to buy - even if 100 years old.(Intourist was the only approved travel agency for foreigners in the Soviet Union era.)"},{"Title":"The Art of Russian Cuisine","review":"Finding a Russian cookbook is not difficult. Finding a Russian cookbook written in English by a knowledgeable Russian food writer is rare. This volume is an excellent updating of many classical Molokhovets recipes (the 19th century Russian cookbook) and also includes work by Edward Pohklebkin--the premier culinary writer of the late Soviet period.The book is somewhat marred by the dated, but wholly understandable, bitterness against the Soviet system which produced some serious food shortages at the time of the book was published.For anyone who wants to learn classic Russian cuisine and wants a knowledgeable Russian guide to help on that journey, this book is highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Art of Russian Cuisine","review":"This book was even better than I expected, it arrived in perfect condidtion.

I have a little cutout of him when he died, infact his real name is not JHC, i cannot remember now. Let me recite a passage from his novel &quot;YOU NEVER KNOW WITH WOMEN&quot; just to give you a taste of the guy: (I've been around and i've known a lot of women in my time, they've given me a lot of fun and a lot of grief;now women are funny animals, you never know with them. They do not often know where they are with themselves. It is of no good trying to find out what makes them tick, it just can't be done.They have more moods than an army of cats have lives and all you can hope for is to spot the mood you are after, when it shows up step in quick, hesitate and you are a dead duck! Women are funny animals you never know with them. Love between a man and a woman is a brittle thing.) Ask me who can describe a woman like that? No other author describes a picture and you the reader thinks the description is right in front of you like this guy. It is a shame that he is out of print. Readers of today are surely missing out.

Joseph Mary Tallon, the main character here, uses his personal journal to reveal his life in a small town on the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The journals begin in 1976, with brief narratives about a Provo murder and a suicide, suddenly shifting without transition to Joey's revelations about The Seeker, a deceased friend with whom he discussed Carlos Castaneda and listened to Santana. Again without transition, he describes his long-time relationship with someone named Mona, with whom he lives in a trailer at a sometime gypsy camp, though we also discover that he worships someone named Jacy from afar.Because Joey does not always explain background or identify characters, the reader is not always sure who the characters are, their roles in his life, or how events are connected. He is \\"scattered,\\" shifting quickly from Provo activity, to a priest's plan for a peace rally, and to his own search for nirvana, all of which keep the reader constantly energized and involved in deciding what is real and what is fantasy. Clearly unstable, he is an unreliable narrator who tells us about the world from his very limited perspective.Unlike McCabe's earlier characters, Joey is intellectually curious, reading Hesse, T.S. Eliot, Gogol, Ginsberg, and Burroughs, and he is a compulsive writer. Despite his delusions, and his impulsive actions, resulting at one point in a jail sentence of several years, he achieves considerable success, writing stories, plays, screenplays, and even a novel. This allows McCabe to expand his scope beyond that of dramatic plot twists to show how one becomes a writer, how writing attempts to bring order to the world, and how writing, ultimately, can be misunderstood. When Joey eventually uses his writing in a bid for public office, the sympathetic reader roots for his success.Fully-developed and fascinating, Joey, like earlier McCabe \\"heroes,\\" is a prisoner of circumstance and victim of fate. Through him, McCabe illustrates T.S. Eliot's point that \\"the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/ And know the place for the first time.\\" By the time Joey and the reader have reached the end of this circular journey of exploration, both will have been on a wild ride in which dreams collide with realities, hopes bloom and are crushed in defeat, and tragedies exist within triumphs. Enlightenment, as we see here, sometimes comes at a huge cost. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"McCabe's best novels, \\"Butcher Boy\\" and \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" managed to convince you that, despite the melodramatic and even ridiculous predicaments that the twisted cartoonish narrators were placed in by their author, a true and distinctive voice expressed his tormented view of Ireland. In \\"CMTB,\\" the Charlie Manson-meets-Nikolai Gogol, Steppenwolf-Tarantino influences would have made for a decent novella, but nothing can sustain a reader faced with hundreds of pages of snippets from his briefly productive but ultimately solipsistic life. While a couple of the treatments he gives are engrossing on their own, and show how the hundreds of pages have been distilled into genuinely engrossing condensations, the effort expected of a reader to sift through so much dross to find the diamond is likely to discourage all but a McC fan who simply must read his every effort. This rivalled \\"The Dead School\\" for tedium, which is unfortunate given the dramatic potential of that and this book.Even Ardal O'Hanlon's \\"Knick Knack Paddy Whack,\\"a first-time effort I found remaindered, offered as much fireworks. For a novelist of McCabe's proven abilities, \\"CMTB\\" is slacking off.If, as the blurb tells us, it took five years to write, perhaps he should take ten per novel, like his fellow Border craftsman John McGahern. Nothing's shocking or compelling this go around.Three examples: what was his rival Johnston's \\"Cyclops\\" thriller all about? Jimmy alludes to its contents in a sentence but given his jealousy towards his plagiarising mentor, why not elaborate? The stint in Mountjoy takes a few pages--whole years go by, with little from his incarceration to influence the rest of the novel, except to mark time, I suppose, and speed up the chronology. I found it curious that the narrative voice went into 3rd person briefly around pg. 296, and I hoped that--late in the game--this portended a fresh angle, but the end dribbles out into a series of dissipated conclusions, none of them that surprising given the unrelenting dreariness of the story.Compared to noteworthy recent Irish fiction from the northern regions treating similar themes and situations--as disparate as John McGahern (By the Lake), Colin Bateman (Cycle of Violence and Divorcing Jack), Glenn Patterson (Burning Your Own and Number 5), Robert McLiam Wilson (Eureka Street and Ripley Bogle) and Niall Griffith (A Welsh version--in Sheepshagger), Mc Cabe's tale of inflatable dolls, IRA thugs, ennui, drugs, and autodidacts seems tired and exhausted."},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"An enthralling but at times dragging account of the life or Joey Tallon. The story is set in a fictional small Irish border town initially during the 1970s and the height of the troubles but eventually takes in a 30 year period.Joey is a fantasist and obessive and although he means well he seems to make a mess of everything he touches but somehow bumbles along and has his fair share of good and bad luck. There are really funny moments in the story and some nasty and sad moments too. The only downfall of the book is that it is narrated by Joey Tallon. Joey has issues caused by a dysfunctional upbringing and some heavy drug abuse when young and alcohol abuse when older. This means he can go from being in the depths of despair to the feeling he can conquer the world fairly quickly. His narrating style (supposedly recalled from diaries, notebooks etc) can be confusing at times and jump around. While this is doen on purpose and is probably a fairly accurate account of how someone like Joey would narrate the story it does at times lead to long spells of rambling and some jumping around. This causes the book to feel longer than the 300 odd pages it actually is.That said Joey is a very well imagined charater. He can be an over the top pompous blowhard but he is also a sensitive and vulnerable individual who has had a lot of hardship is his life and personally I couldn't help but like him and enjoy his company. The other main charaters in Scotsfield are also fairly well defined and you do get a good sense of time and place and it is difficult not to feel a certain affection for Joey.Very enjoyable book and worth sticking through the more rambling parts."},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"patrick mccabe never seems to stop amazing me, it doesn't matter whether it's old, new, ancient or frivolous, i fall in love with whatever he writes. character development was once again incredible. this book may be one of my favorites of all time, right next to the butcher boy. i'm not spoiling it for you."},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"Comparing this book to THE BUTCHER BOY, I would say that CALL ME THE BREEZE wins hands down in matters of plausbility. I found it all to obvious that a young man like Joey would find himself at odds with society, and yet there's a comic edge to this writing that was missing in his earlier novels, and that imparts a soft, cotton candy feeling to the book which is nice, and makes the reader feel as though the sights and sounds of a small town in Northern Ireland were drifting through the air like a dreamy Maeve Binchy novel, but for men maybe.The extreme FIGHT CLUB like violence of BUTCHER BOY and the implausible gender hijinks of BREAKFAST ON PLUTO take a back seat now to gentle, Philip Roth style light comedy about a pathetic wanna-be and how he gets to be the way he is. We've all seen the stereotype of the lazy Irish bum with desires bigger than his abilities to satisfy them, blowing bubbles in the air, prone to a large fantasy life, and not much good with women. Now McCabe gives us that character writ in neon letters in this tiny masterpiece of precious prose. One of his best, maybe THE best, and I'm looking forward to the inevitable Adam Sandler movie they make out of it."},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"Patrick McCabe is one of the smartest writers working today, and Call Me The Breeze is his best book since The Butcher Boy, and maybe his best book to date. Fans of medernism will love this, but traditionalists may be put off by the way the narrative/plot is subsumed by character--many situations it's hard to tell if it actually happened or if it's just a figment of the protagonist's imagination--but regardless, BREEZE is a fascinating look into a troubled character that in many ways provides a model for our fragmented times. Fans of A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, a brilliant book in its own right, will find much to love here. McCabe is a writer's writer but has largely been ignored in America but for other writers. But McCabe without question outshines many of today's so-called literary stars and CALL ME THE BREEZE is a novel that years from now will be heralded as one of the classics of the 21st century. Read it."},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"Patrick McCabe has long established himself as one of the more gifted contemporary writers and certainly one of the more creative. His writing style takes some getting used to for the novice McCabe reader, but despite what appears to be a confusingly insurmountable task in his first chapters, perseverance pays off and McCabe's gifts are stunning!CALL ME THE BREEZE, aptly titled, traverses the fanciful, quasi-delusional life of one Joey Tallon from the 1970s to the present. Joey lives in Ireland, is surrounded by a throng of characters that could be either real or drawn from his imagination. His adventures run the gamut from drugs, to crime and subsequent incarceration, to poetry, to screenplay writing, to Don Quixotesque, Don Juan-like meanderings with multiple Dulcineas, delusional inamorata - all the fantasies we have grown to appreciate form McCabe's mind - along with piquant and tender moments of actual introspection and intellectual diversions. Joey Tallon is a newly created figure that McCabe now places in the sanctum sanctorum of unforgettable literary 'heroes'. Yes, he is manic, contagiously enthusiastic about everything he encounters (or fantasizes), recklessly susceptible to heroes from Charles Manson to Hermann Hesse to Joni Mitchell, given to obsessive ambitions, yet he at all times is wholly lovable and believable to the reader. Think Stephen Daedalus, Holden Caulfield, etc.Gratefully there are many authors writing today with abundant talent: Patrick McCabe is toward the head of the line. He is not an easy read, but delving into this book will be an adventure you are unlikely to find elsewhere. For those new to his style perhaps reading THE BUTCHER BOY first will allow you to jump in to CALL ME THE BREEZE without the struggles that may face first time readers of his books. A significant novel and a true joy!"},{"Title":"Call Me the Breeze","review":"this novel relates the sometimes third-, sometimes first-person narrative of the life of joey tallon, a travis bickle wannabe, and takes place in Northern Ireland in the 70s and 80s. joey's a bit of a deluded tragic hero; his life milestones are like classic &quot;get rich quick&quot; schemes that receive his total initial buy-in but then crumble like the house of cards they are. though the dust jacket announces this novel was 5 years in the making and includes a send-up from none other than bono, this is a pretty weak effort by mccabe standards. The Butcher Boy and Breakfast On Pluto excelled because of compelling narrative voices, characters who do horrible things but who still garner your respect and sympathy, and -- especially in the case of The Butcher Boy -- pure horror. Call Me the Breeze failed IMO because i never really liked or understood joey tallon, his voice cried from different directions without hooking up with a satisfactory mental reason and the plot wasn't very interesting."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"America has done more than any other country to change the world, according to Singapore's Ambassador to the United Nations. This is the story of America and the world from the Asian viewpoint. He served in theSingapore Foreign Services for thirty-three years from 1971-2004. He lavishes praise on the support of his mother, saying that she has tremendous strength and resolve, courage and fortitude. Now if Jeff would say the same about me.He calls these difficult times we live in. He says that America has alienated hundreds of millions of European colonists, which is the reason the Muslims hate us and want to cause mass destruction. If they hate us so much, why are so many living in the United States now?\\"In your face\\" is an American term for when a person's personal space and sense of dignity are violated. He gives personal experiences and examples comparing what has happened to him to how \\"people\\" feel about the American government: \\"it is park on their toes.\\" Read the book to see where that comes in!He discloses that there are rising levels of anti-U.S. (6 billion people) around the globe, particularly the Asian and how they feel about the American power (not good, too bad!).So he spent some time in New York at the United Nations, and yet he looks down on the reputation of the United States, writing that our beneficiaries react with anger or bitterness (as I did the privation of one Arthur Friend into my life uninvited).American power has both beneficial and harmful dimensions, and affects every human being on the planet. Who would have thought we were so popular to keep them coming back for more? They hate and despise what we do and write but keep on keeping on. Why don't they decide to hate Russia or Spain. He is the author of CAN ASIANS THINK? I think not."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"Singaporean scholar and diplomat Kishore Mahbubani is a great admirer of the United States. He is also a stern critic. I think these qualities are exactly what America needs now at the time of our greatest strength. What Mahbubani wants is to gently admonish the United States for acting unilaterally and without the benefit of international law, while at the same time remind us all of America's greatness and all that America has done for the world.He emphasizes that the US is not and has not been an ordinary superpower. Unlike other great states, it has not sought empire or the economic enslavement of the vanquished. Instead it has rebuilt the enemy, as in Germany and Japan, and as it is presumably trying to do in Iraq. These extraordinary behaviors by a nation state mark the US as an enlightened nation, a nation that knows that world stability and the economic success of other nations only contribute to stability and the good life at home.\\"America is...an atypical human society,\\" he writes, \\"unlike any other. Until recently, it has served as a powerful beacon, pointing to a future for all of humankind. That is its essence, its real mission: to remain true to its soul and remain an extraordinary society.\\" (p. 211) Mahbubani adds that in other parts of the world, the men who open doors for you...look down in a sort of implicit bow,\\" but that \\"New York doormen never look down. They look you straight in the eye and behave as total equals... They may work...in the building\\" and \\"receive tips...but they possess not an iota of inferiority.\\" (p. 210) He calls this \\"an enormous leap upwards in the human evolutionary ladder.\\" He believes that \\"America has largely escaped the pernicious effects of class stratification prevalent in the rest of the world.\\" (p. 211)His main point, however, is that America power reaches with its tentacles, both soft and hard, into every country of the world and affects everybody from the poorest to the wealthiest. Yet the only people who have any direct say in what the US does are Americans who can vote for its leadership. Consequently there is great frustration throughout the world with a power that to some extent controls them, but that they cannot control.Mahbubani believes that it is especially important that America use its military power wisely. If we do not, the rest of the world will view our \\"soft power\\" suspiciously \\"as an increasingly frayed velvet glove that covers a mailed fist.\\" (p. 197)As an example of the wise use of military power, Mahbubani notes that \\"Global trade continues to grow steadily. Many reasons explain this: technology, open markets (an ideology spread by American influence), political stability, global trading rules (another American legacy). But one important factor that is rarely mentioned or recognized is the spread of American military power around the world. American military power keeps global sea and air routes open. Any force that tries to disrupt these routes will have to reckon with America. Since no country can, global trade has flourished.\\" (p. 140)Consequently, Mahbubani argues, the rest of the world benefits \\"enormously and directly from the global American military presence, which costs American taxpayers over $400 billion a year. But other nations pay not a penny for this.\\" (p. 141)What Mahbubani would like to see--barring a sharing of power--is a foreign policy by the US that understands the extent of its power and uses that power wisely for the benefit of all and not just for narrow, short-term American interests. He believes that what is good for the rest of the world is good the for the US. If the rest of the world suffers because of unenlightened US policy, as it sometimes has in the past, the US itself will suffer as well.He makes it clear that the neocon dream of an American Empire is a delusion based on an unrealistic understanding of both America and the modern world. He writes, \\"With all the military power in the world, America appears incapable of subjugating one medium-sized country in the Middle East because it is incapable of administering the kind of brutal suppression the British applied when they conquered Iraq in 1917.\\" (p. 10) He adds on page 202, \\"If America cannot tolerate the sight of its soldiers abusing a few Iraqis, how can it build an empire?\\"Then there is the question of legitimacy. Although they have no vote on who is elected president of the United States, Mahbubani believes that the planet's 6.3 billion citizens \\"are the ultimate custodians of legitimacy in the international environment.\\" (p. 186) Since most Americans believe in the rule of law and in the idea that some actions are legitimate within its scope and others not, it behooves our government to act accordingly. Mahbubani's point is that if our use of power (as in the invasion of Iraq) is not seen as legitimate, we will lose prestige and credibility in the world, and with that loss, we will abdicate moral leadership and ultimately become isolated from the rest of the world. In the \\"Age of Innocence\\" that would have been okay. China existed for centuries isolated from the rest of the world as did the US (for the most part) until the first world war. However in the modern world where everyone is so closely connected, such isolation is not possible.A note on Mahbubani's choice of title and his message: \\"The Age of Innocence\\" was before the modern age, before the globalization of the planet. There is a novel by Edith Wharton with the title The Age of Innocence published in 1920 (but set in the1870s). With every country in the world affecting not only its neighbors but countries around the globe, there can no longer be any innocence of intent in foreign affairs."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"Kishore Mahbubani's book provides, in uncluttered prose and through a balanced lens, a wake-up call both for current/future architects of U.S. foreign policy and for the ordinary bewildered U.S. citizen. This book details the flaws in current U.S. direction and manages to do so in a fair and balanced manner, which never smacks of the shallow and often uninformed anti-Americanism that is so trendy at the moment.Mr. Mahbubani clearly loves America and so his stark criticism of its behaviour is the honest and earnest admonishing that one sometimes hears from a true and trusted friend.George Bush's offensive words: \\"If you are not with us, you are against us.\\" came to mind as I read this book. At a governmental level, many countries must give the appearance of being with America; it is economic suicide to do otherwise. At a societal level, however, America has few allies.This is worthy reading."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"Mr. Mahbubani's book is a valuable resource on foreign policy. He hopes the book will help \\"make American society aware that daily, billion of pairs of eyes are watching, studying and judging America.\\" - xix. Mahbubani came from a poor Hindu family in Singapore and luckily got a scholarship to university. His perspective is very interesting because of his view from having been poor AND privileged. He also looks to America as a shining example in the world, but has some problems with some of our policies of the past thirty or so years.I first saw him on \\"Foreign Exchange\\" with Fareed Zakaria and it should be noted that his style of writing is very similar to that of Zakaria and Thomas L. Friedman, both of who he quotes a great deal. The book is very strong in the beginning when he talks about how America has helped and harmed the world as well as America's relation with Islam and China. Mahbubani's chapter on China where he suggests that having China become the major dealer with Islamic countries is VERY interesting:\\"Even though China has a sizeable Muslim population of its own, this Muslim minority has not dictated the terms of China's engagement with the Islamic world. As a consequence, without any historical baggage (unlike, say, Islam with Christianity and the Crusades), there is no natural antipathy between Islam and China. Instead, there has long been admiration of the great Chinese civilization within the Islamic world. If China successfully modernizes, its success may have a powerful ripple effect throughout the Islamic world. Many Islamic thinkers are reluctant to use the West as a model for Islam to emulate . . . But these same thinkers would have no hesitation to use China as a positive example.\\" - pp.125-126Toward the end, Mahbubani starts to sound like a NY Times columnist like Kristof, Dowd or Krugman attacking (and repeating) how America has harmed the world with farm subsidies, Iraq, Kyoto and the IMF. He has lost some of his great faith in America and you can see this.One of his biggest wishes (and I am in full agreement with him) is that regular Americans need to know more about international affairs. According to Mahbubani, Americans (and even many government officials) rarely know how their actions in international affairs have ripple effects on others around the world, in many ways they never would know or realize. Many Americans have no idea how a good deal of the world holds them in contempt for things America didn't necessarily think was bad at the time, but may have turned out differently later on. This is his main point of the book: America has to implement its policy while examining ALL of the possible effects on others, because it could come back to haunt you. Sure, one policy might not be favorable to another group or groups, but you must be cautious and wise.Two movie quotes would sum up this review: Spock (from Star trek II) said, \\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.\\" And from Spiderman (and Mahbubani uses this): \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\"Overall, a recommended book on what America can do to re-shape it image in the world while also dealing with the rise of China."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"This is a wonderful book. Kishore has achieved a crucial balance between personal experience and general observation (I relished the journey as a reader between these poles!) and between being critical and supportive (it is unfortunate one has to be applauded for such an achievement but 'dem's the breaks' in today's polarized environment!).Kishore's book beautifully articulates some generally-recognized dichotomies - for instance, the tension between individual American generosity and structural institutional implacability - and introduced me to welcome new insights. I was particularly taken with the notion of the ordinariness of American national interest in the context of superpower status and the structural disregard for external consequences - both critical insights for a prolegomena for any future reform of the American role in the world."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"If another Rwanda happens, the world will sit on its hands and do nothing. That's exactly what representatives of the 5 permanent members of the Security Council admitted at a private meeting.Why is the world the way it is today?Kishore Mahbubani offers rare insights and some sound recommendations for American global policy after 9/11. This isn't the run of the mill, former policy insider publication that sounds out the same tired refrain. What makes this book stand out is that it is written by an outsider with deep knowledge of America, its global strategy and its dealings with the world. Mahbubani is a kind of Asian Tocqueville of American foreign policy. He peppers the book with personal anecdotes and salts it with his wide-ranging diplomatic experience. He has produced a work that isn't just aimed at the policy wonks at CFR and the other high-brow institutions (although he certainly knows them), but pitched at the average American who cares about the US and its world standing, as well as all global citizens.Thanks to Mahbubani's clear and uncluttered style of writing, we learn how America benefits and harms the world while separate chapters on America's relations with Islam and China highlight two major challenges for the sole superpower. Mahbubani speaks to all Americans honestly about the \\"in your face\\" attitude of American power, or at least one aspect of it, suggests how to better manage it and charts the way ahead for a more stable world order.Apart from the many fascinating behind the scenes diplomatic stories, this book taught me two simple truths: First, the world can be a really nasty place. Two, only America has the power to limit its nastiness. The big question is whether it will heed the message to use its power wisely, or whether it will give in to its worst instincts.Anyone who cares about the past, present and future of our world should read this honest and compelling book. And American leaders should read it if they want to restore the lustre to the city on the hill."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"I don't agree with all that Kishore Mahbuhani says, but he summaries very nicely the post cold-war attitudes that have arisen as a result of US policy, the world over. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who asked, \\"why do they hate us?\\" after 9/11."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"If a required reading list existed for all Americans, this would most certainly be included. In the book's 212 pages, there is not a single statement I could take issue with. The 4 previous reviews have done justice to the author.The USA had a spectacular origin and has a long list of contributions to society, but this book points out that the average American doesn't have a clue as to what is happening in the rest of the world, doesn't understand why the rest of the world often disagrees with us when we incorrectly think we're on the moral high ground, and therefore aren't aware of the potential adverse consequences of our actions. Page 166: \\"One remarkable paradox about this global village is that the occupants of the household with the best information resources are among the least well-informed about what happens outside their house. Like many other large societies, America has wrapped itself up in a comfortable insularity....When Americans watch Monica Lewinsky, the rest of the world watches the Americans watching Monica Lewinsky. It would be no exaggeration to say that for the rest of the world, Americans have become like goldfish in a bowl, absorbed and self-contained in their little universe with, apparently, little or no awareness of the eyes watching them from outside.....Hence, the 6 billion other citizens of the planet have to share an ever-shrinking space with a progressively \\"noisy\\" neighbor whose domestic affairs are thrust into the faces of the rest of the world...But they turn on their TV sets to find the weird reality television of American domestic life instead. This is dangerous\\"Mahbubani makes it clear why we can't \`democratize' others, including China. He makes it clear why Islam is and will be such a worldly dominant force. [It has the most followers @ > 1.2 billion, as a group they're more fervent {stopping to pray 5x's/day}, and they are present in every \`corner' of the planet]. He explains why our subsidy system is a crime, why we need a hefty gas tax, why the world saw our invasion of Iraq as not legitimate, the failures of the IMF and the UNSC (United Nations Security Council), and much more.He has hope for our country to lead us into the next century, by suggesting 4 strategic decisions America has to make. But, \\"...often the right hand of American is not aware what the left hand is doing\\". [p. 38]. This is just one of many concerns I have that mitigate my hope for America's future. Reading this book and \`spreading the word' may improve our chances."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"Kishore Mahbubani is an avowed admirer of America and what it stands for. When the European empires crumbled in the aftermath of the Second World War, it looked as if America was going to deliver mankind from servitude and oppression and faciliate every nation's right to self determination...and for the longest time, America was that beacon of light to which all free men gravitated. So how is it that within a short span of less than 50 years, the world's most powerful and admired nation has become the world's most misunderstood and disliked nation by a surprisingly large number of otherwise friendly nations ? In this excellent treatise, Mahbubani laments that America has forgotten the adage that with power comes responsibility, that as the world's only superpower, it cannot afford to behave like any ordinary nation and act only in its own narrow interests. The tragedy is that America's low level of self awareness and appreciation of the extent of its power and influence over the lives of the rest of mankind has led it to behave insensitively - even parochially - towards the rest of the world thereby inadvertently sullying its own image. If America has sinned against the world, it has done so unknowingly but that's no excuse when the stakes for the future of mankind are as high as they are. Mahbubani argues that the tragedy being played out is not irreversible and urges America to take stock and reconsider its stance on inter-civilization and strategic policy issues to become yet again the great nation the world once admired.\\"Beyond The Age of Innocence\\" is an astoundingly intelligent, well argued and relevant treatise on a subject that must be on the minds of most citizens of the world. Read it."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"This book is written by a diplomat who has seen America from both the inside looking out, and the outside looking in. As such, he offers a glimpse of America and our actions abroad that few others can offer. This book describes America's foreign policy since World War II, how this policy and its actions have affected the world, and how this policy and its actions were viewed by the world.The topics/events covered include the Cold War, Vietnam War, trade policies with Latin America, trade policies with East Asia, and relationships with Middle East countries. The book itself covers the history at a brisk pace with not a lot of detail. What the author does emphasize is how America's actions abroad affected the lives and opinions of other people.This book is correct in saying that America has held forth democracy as the optimal form of government, and that the American standard of living also backed up this supposition. This book is also correct in saying how America's actions often do not support democracy abroad; with listed examples being America's direct support of military dictatorships. The author also gives a good summary of the financial crises in various nations during the late 1990's, and how the actions of the US government, both directly, and indirectly through the IMF and World Bank, impoverished millions in poorer countries. As such, this book is another in a very long line of texts critical of American hypocrisy; many of which are worth reading.There are several things that the book is incorrect about. First, the author retells his career, and how the society and culture of America provided him the opportunities to work hard and succeed in a way that few other societies would have provided. This is true, but the author forgets to mention that he probably came from a family that emphasized hard work and success, hence giving him the skills and personality traits to succeed. If the author was born and raised in America, and went thru the American public education system, he would have certainly turned out differently.Second, the author fails to mention that the economic opportunites he found in America are not open to all of America's citizens. A quick tour of the various Native American reservations throughout the US will bear this out. Throughout the 1700's, 1800's, and 1900's, white colonialists took over the North American continent. This was accompanied by economic growth in white America, and the destruction of Native Americans.Overall, this book is worth reading, though the points it makes are covered in greater detail in many other books."},{"Title":"Beyond the Age of Innocence: Rebuilding Trust Between America and the World","review":"Mr. Mahbukani should know that \\"America\\" is a continent and not a country.

This a book I will be saving and giving to my kids to read, there aren't many books I have read that I would save and make other people read.This book is absolutely fascinating primarily because of the chapter on crime, but it is very interesting in other chapters on love/sex/marriage/feminism, religion, and power. I skipped the last chapter on artificial intelligence. It is also very well written and flows nicely. Some of the stuff is obvious but is still worth reading because you have never thought about it before or had the presence of mind to articulate it yourself. One of the themes of the book is \\"solidarity\\" or emotional connection and belonging (with a moral sense). Solidarity influences many of our behaviors and is central to understanding society. The primary reason crime exists that you learn in this book is because criminals in the bottom strata of society aren't connected to society--or don't have solidarity with it--therefore they act in their self interest and commit crimes like property theft and gang banging/drug dealing. I will admit it would be much more helpful if you could read this book in a class taught by a sociologist and listen to him lecture on it and ask questions, but the reading is still very engaging. In fact, this book was offered in introductory classes at UW-Madison, the top ranked sociology department in the nation so you know it is a good book. I didn't take it in a class, I looked at the book list and read it. The only drawback is that this book was written in 1992, but it's better than buying a new expensive version. It would be nice to hear the author articulate the advances in the feminist movement, but that's really all the better the book would be plus some advances on the crime rate.

Volume II, however, covers the 1930's and includes the date of publication for each catalog.My problem with the series is that the books are only a collection of old catalogs with guesses as to the prices of the items.

All-in-all, a nice, concise overview of current issues that all special educators should be aware of."},{"Title":"The Shroud of Turin and the C-14 Dating Fiasco","review":"I was going to grade this book with four stars, since recent evidence published by researcher Ray Rogers in a peer reviewed journal established that it was a reweave... not the physics of a fire, bacteria or miracle... that altered the carbon-14 dating of 1988. Thus, one star should be deducted for delving into explanations that weren't necessary... for the inept carbon dating of 1988.But since this book has been given two poor ratings by skeptics, someone should make up for their bias.What? How could two individuals, untainted by faith, ever be considered \\"biased?\\" Easy. Lack of faith is a faith unto itself, Agnosticism and Atheism are religions by another name. Skepticism is a hymn sung by true believers.Open minded skepticism should be the standard... not a close minded, \\"that's impossible until you prove otherwise\\" skepticism.\\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\\" the skeptics love to say. But THEY appoint themselves as judges... as to what qualifies as \\"extraordinary.\\" They know all the workings of the natural universe, and nothing shall violate their borders.Here is the indisputable proof that skeptics are biased... they quote the thoroughly discredited conclusions of Dr. Walter McCrone.McCrone never studied the Shroud in person. He looked at sticky tape fiber samples under his old fashioned microscope. Eureka! He saw a few paint particles! He saw iron oxide! his findings were a favorite topic of his OWN journal, \\"The Microscope.\\" No need for scientific peers to get in the way, is there?McCrone determined that the Shroud's blood was made of \\"Vermillion\\"... he saw a handful of these particles. Guess what? There also happen to be pink nylon fibers found on those tape samples. Was he certain the blood wasn't comprised of pink nylon? After all, if particle evidence is the ONLY STANDARD BEARER here...Oh yes, the iron oxide particles McCrone observed were also evenly distributed over the Shroud, not concentrated witin the image area. They were found to be too \\"chemically pure\\" to have been pigment related... instead, these particles were the end result of \\"rhetting\\"... the ancient manufacture of linen.But of course, what would a particle analyst know of ancient forms of linen manufacture?Luckily, the other researchers of the Shroud of Turin Research Project were more comprehensive and less myopic. (And NO... they were NOT a bunch of zealous Christians, anxious to validate the relic... just ask Orthodox Jew, Barrie Schwortz! Their official findings never linked the Shroud to Jesus... read the PEER- REVIEWED journals for yourselves.)STURP researchers utilized tests such as ultraviolet and infrared photography, VP-8 image analysis, topographic imaging, low energy x-radiology, x-ray fluorescence, thermography, microdensitometry, electron energy dispersive spectroscopy and wet chemistry: generation of porphyrin fluorescence; cyanmethemoglobin and hemochromagen tests. For a short list... theirs is much longer.Unlike the touted McCrone, these researchers were THERE... standing at the Shroud... taking direct measurements and making direct observations. All Walter McCrone observed was a collection of stiky tape samples lifted by the researchers he would eventually go to war with...This is the verdict of Science... The Shroud of Turin's image is a dehydration of the topmost linen fibrils. The blood is human, type AB, rich in Bilirubin... the \\"jaundiced\\" quality victims of torture acquire (thus, the unnaturally \\"red\\" quality of the blood stains). The carbon dating of 1988 was contaiminated by medieval reweaves within the extracted corner sample.Science cannot say the Shroud is of Jesus... only logic and faith can. But Science CAN dismiss this nonsense about the Shroud being a medieval painting... and has DONE SO convincingly.Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\""},{"Title":"The Shroud of Turin and the C-14 Dating Fiasco","review":"If this were another object, no one would have dared challenge the findings of the scientists who dated it at approximately 1300 AD. But that is not the case - this is the cloth in which Jesus was buried! Notwithstanding the utter absurdity that a blood-stained cloth from a crucified leader of a small band of Jews would be whisked away to Europe and retained by a band of monks, one of the Gospels (they contradict each other) states that he was wrapped in cloths (plural). But first a word about the man who started it all.Kouznetsov claims that a fire \\"changed the atoms\\" of the cloth and that he has validated its authenticity. THis Russian has been thoroughly discredited. He's been a Creationist since 1983 and attempted to \\"prove\\" his theories ever since. Fraud has been the hallmark of his work. References include documents and books that do not exist; he invented outside sources to support his findings. He was then declared persona non grata in Russia for claiming that several non-existent Russian museums provided him with old cloths that he then dated. Yet this fraudulent scheme laid the groundwork for his claim that the shroud is original.He found his calling among those who rejected the findings of the original dating. The cloth HAD to be a relic - not a shrewd creation from the early Middle Ages when it first appeared in history. This is yet another chapter in the dreary process of \\"proving\\" Christianity through scientifc rather than moral or theological means. The author explains his side of the story and then give us an interesting conversation with another scientist as they discuss the issues.The information about Dr McCrone, whose book on the scientific aspects of the carbon dating is excellent, is both biased and quite selective. It is pitiful to see scientists substitute the alleged findings of a hack for the rigorous tests of the laboratory. The neutrality of the author is a joke but in a work about scientific evidence, this bias is deadly."},{"Title":"The Shroud of Turin and the C-14 Dating Fiasco","review":"Within the first few pages of the book, the direction of Mr. Case's, well, case, was obvious. A few quotes from his summary (entitled &quot;Physics of a Miracle&quot;, of all things) shows quite well that Mr. Case is utterly assured that the book is already closed on the Shroud investigation...despite all the evidence against it still unexplained.On pg. 13, Mr. Case speaks of the most outspoken anti-authenticity scientist, Dr. McCrone, mentioning his analysis of a Viking map of the New World, which he proved to be faked. The author immediately attempts to cast doubt on Dr. McCrone's work (he being the favored whipping-boy among &quot;Sindonologists&quot;) by parenthetically mentioning that &quot;there is some question about his negative judgement&quot;. The &quot;negative judgement&quot; in this case (unrelated to the Shroud) was by a rather small group of people who generally had stake in the validity of the map...including Yale University, the owners. Many others outside of Yale agreed that the map was faked, but this is not mentioned. Mr. Case then refers to ideology entering the scenario...and mentions only &quot;A small group of skeptical journalists and scientists&quot; There is no mention of the considerable influence of religious ideology (skepticism is hardly an ideology, for that matter).Throughout the book, Mr. Case refers to the &quot;Image&quot;, not the &quot;image&quot;, on the shroud. Unless there is some peculiar usage of capitalization here, this seems an obvious assumption of a divine origin of the image.In all, this is a difficult book to read if you are looking for an unbiased view of the results. Half of the book is dedicated to Mr. Case's own assessment of the data, while the last half is the transcript of an interview with Dr.'s Heller and Adler. It is for this information alone that I give the book more than one star, for being able to learn some of the thinking of those who did some actual testing on the Shroud."},{"Title":"Stuart masques and the renaissance stage","review":"Allardyce Nicoll, in this book, gives an inside look into the royal celebrations of the Stuart age.

I heartily recommend this book to just about anyone as a source of tasty, easy, traditional dishes. The only reservations would be to people who may not have the time or inclination to search out some of the speciality ingredients.Almost all recipes in this book use fewer than 12 ingredients and the technique rarely takes more than four (4) steps, taking no more than a half page of text. This is not exactly quick cooking, although there are a fair number of quick recipes herein. Some recipes do require long marinades, but very few require long cooking. Most heat is from either a quick saute or a grill.The issues with ingredients, especially for those who like to stay authentic, is probably solved if you live in a large city and there is a Greek or middle eastern grocery available. It is also probably not a big issue if you live near a \`megamart' which carries a generous supply of Greek and Turkish staples. Needless to say, even if you live in the sticks, there are internet sources for everything. The most important speciality ingredients are:Greek feta - There is barrel cured and tin cured. Some recipes recommend one type. Some the other.Other Greek Cheeses - Popular Italian cheeses like ricotta will substitute for most requirements.Greek Oregano - DriedGreek / Eastern Mediterranian yogurt - Fortunately, there is an easy way to make plain yogurt work.Dried Mint - Yes, dried. Fresh mint is also commonly used.Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil - \`What is grown together goes together'. But Italian or Spanish will work.Phyllo - Supermarket Phyllo is fine.Octopus - The national seafood of Greece.Pastourma - Cured BeefOnce you locate a source, I believe most ingredients such as the Greek olive oil will actually be less expensive than Italian substitutes. Almost all other ingredients such as eggplant, pita, and ouzo are very common everywhere in the country.Meze, short for mezethes, denotes small dishes served typically at small eateries like \`mezethopoleion'; ouzeri, similar to the Italian wine shop; and the tsipouradiko, serving Greek eau-de-vie. The object of these establishments and their meze fare is to offers its patrons a place to eat, drink, and have conversation in the hours between large meals. The author points out that although there is a strong similarity in portion size and preparation similarity to Spanish tapas, the dishes were specifically developed to be eaten only as an accompanyment to drink in the middle of the day, not as a \`before the meal' bite to get you started on the main meal of the day. It is much more comparable to bar nuts, pretzels, and pickled eggs on American bars.All portions are small and most are designed to be eaten with the fingers, bread, or skewer.

The color pictures are decorative, but few. While I found all instructions very simple, the author did occasionally seem a bit opaque.

And just as it seems that her dream has come true, a lack of family fortune and a duty to provide for her younger siblings snatches her dream away. Forced to marry the less-than-perfect Justin Strand, Lisette tries to do what's required as Justin's wife, but things go wrong when a terrible rumor drives them apart.Veryan writes wonderful books, and this one fits right in. She manages to capture not only the romantic spirit but the social one as well. I found that I liked both Justin and Lisette because they complimented each other well. It seemed like it was a Regency Taming of the Shrew, although the shrew wasn't too bad. The ending was very sweet, and I was glad that Lisette finally came to her senses. And the resolution to Jeremy Bolster's problem is satisfactory, although I don't know if I believed he could be so strong and healthy after his ordeal. This book is a must for all Veryan fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Married Past Redemption","review":"Ignore the silly cover of this book! You would never know it from the cover drawing, but this is actually fiction and not just a drugstore romance novel. And it is \\"clean\\" without any \\"pulsing\\" body parts--ha ha.My love of Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell led me to Georgette Heyer, then to Marion Chesney. Patricia Veryan is much more like Georgette Heyer than like the others---complex, interesting plots, appealing/detailed main characters, with secondary characters also drawn with detialed personalities. This book is about a young woman adapting to the idea of an arranged marriage with a man she is not attracted to...at first, and then how she adapts to the marriage when she realizes she wishes he was more attracted to HER--not just her family's good name. He married her because of her family's noble lineage and while trying to overcome his family's damaged reputation due to his father's debts. There is a very good plot...things are not always what they seem and it is entertaining discovering what is and what is not accurate about Lisette's view of the situation. The characters, the plot, and the secondary characters are well done...and the book is long. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Married Past Redemption","review":"Sans a couple of super-corny moments, Married Past Redemption is not only one of my favorite Patricia Veryan romances, but one of my favorite romances altogether!Neither of the main characters, Justin and Lindsey, are perfect, which is part of their appeal, but they are both extremely likeable and sweet. It's easy to understand, for instance, why Lindsey is a little cold towards Justin and his family, but for the most part, she does the right thing and doesn't behave vapidly or ridicously like some other romance novel heroines.And though there are plenty of those \\"misunderstandings,\\" they actually add to the plot and overcome fairly realistically. The plot mechanisms give time for Lindsey mature in her own expectations (and time for the reader to soak up the romance) and start to love and appreciate Justin. Veryan novels are nice, too, because she has a whole cast of likeable and fully-fleshed characters (like Lindsey's sisters and Justin's friend Jeremy Bolster).I have to say, too, that it's pretty clean and funny as far as romance novels go and that's part of the novel's appeal as well. Veryan cuts out the trashiness, and really focuses on the emotion, characters, and plot. Super satisfying!!!"},{"Title":"Married Past Redemption","review":"I have now read two of Veryan's books: This and \\"The Dedicated Villain\\". Both are on my top ten favorite romance stories. After reading \\"The Dedicated Villian\\" I knew I would like more of her stories! This novel was as fine as the first. Ms. Veryan is a writer with whom you do not wish to skip a word or sentence. That says it all for me! I look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Married Past Redemption","review":"When two people end up married against will and inclination, there are a few ways the author can take the story...Veryan delivers a witty yet heartrending story along the lines of Taming of the Shrew - in Regency England.Although her new husband is a wounded war hero, Lisette hears some very bad things about him, and being a girl, believes them of course. And so the course of two people who might otherwise have gotten along very well, takes nearly a full novel to fill.If you are, like me, a fan of the genre then you are probably already a Patricia Veryan addict, and if you aren't yet, then you will be.I recommend all of her books unreservedly.The Jewelled men series is absolutely delightful as are the Georgian romances.Anyway no need to blab on, the gist of it is, Veryan is the best Regency author around. I urge you to immerse yourself in her delightfully spun and extremely convincing worlds."},{"Title":"Coming Clean: Dirty Little Secrets from a Professional Housecleaner","review":"I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the description and the glowing reviews posted here.

A Conversation with Jesus","review":"This is a book written by Kim Michaels in which he give the teachings of Jesus Christ--not channeled but a raising of consciousness to reach up to Jesus Christ. I've read a number of books like \\"A Course in Miracles, Walsh's books, The Poem of the Man-God, etc. but none had a complete ring of truth to it as this book does. I note in the first page of each book I read the page number of things I found profound. I use the entire width of the page for these going left to right. In this book I fit 15 into a line and there are 10 rows of them! That's 150+ points in this book I found profound. I don't own any other book with so much highlighting in it. Chapter titles are:Chapter 1 The Secret of LifeChapter 2 Leaving the School of Hard KnocksChapter 3 The Key of KnowledgeChapter 4 Take Control of Your LifeHere in this chapter I found info that now one ever offer me in New Age/New Thought circle. When talking about meditation: \\"I am not hereby saying that people need to give up meditation or other Eastern techniques. However, they need to realize that most Eastern techniques were meant to be given to people who lived in the protected environment of a retreat or ashram.\\" Years ago I was learning these types of meditation techniques and I could not figure out when after doing them, I was usually more irritable then before I started them.

I keep reading this book over and over, finding new insights each time. The oneness of life is the key theme. In order to attune to the universal Christ who Jesus represents, we need to let go of our egos and rise above the duality of life. In this book Jesus gives many guidelines and suggestions on how to enter into the oneness of life and love. I highly recommend it to anyone open to the reality that Jesus is still teaching today.

I couldn't put it down, and I now have a much deeper spiritual consciousness, and have attained greater peace of mind. And it feels good!"},{"Title":"Save Yourself! A Conversation with Jesus","review":"After rereading this book I come to the conclusion that I overlooked certain aspects of that I can no longer support in myself and in others. Life is a flow between Father and Mother, a constant being in that flow of giving to the other, to God, to your neighbor or friend, and also in yourself where you can have that balance. In the parts below of the book in the chapter about rising above false teachers I see and feel the lack of willingness to share your all, that which you are, with others.\\"However, you have to be willing to leave the teaching behind. In other words, you must be non-attached to the outer teaching. If you do become attached to a teaching, then that teaching - even if it is pure and has a high degree of truth - will become a false teaching. The reason being that a false teaching is any teaching that prevents you from reaching your Christhood. And even a true teaching can do that if you become attached to it.\\"I was shocked that I didn't see this red flag before. This concept is a total lie and is based upon relative good and evil, thus an invention of the dualistic carnal mind that says there is no absolute Truth. In this way the teacher can justify doing whatever he wants, and control you by saying you are attached to an older yet True teaching. I can see now how this tactic is used to drive you out of the heart by projecting that you are attached to a True teaching so you move out of the heart, as that is where the Truth resonates. A false teacher can thereafter always put out lies as new relative truths, and deny the True teaching as false. Some of them follow in the same chapter:\\"As you rise to the higher levels of the path, you will be faced with the initiations of having to leave behind everything that that got you to that point. You must literally leave behind all outer expectations and all human sense of security. You must be willing to lose your sense of identity, even your physical life, in order to rise to the next level of the path. \\"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it\\" the inner meaning is that if you hold on to any aspect of your mortal life, you will lose the eternal life in the Christ consciousness.\\"I feel it is a misinterpretation of what Jesus said, and I feel that when you are willing to give and share with others, and with God, and within yourself, then you will be the Christ and find the eternal life. Behind many words in this book I feel an unwillingness to follow the heart into the emotional realm, where you learn to become balanced in being both an emotional and mental Being, something what always seems to clash between man and women. It is then a typical manly book, a mental approach to explain the path, in a technical way. The book promotes that one is striving to become more mental, and reaching up higher into the spiritual (nirvana) via the mental, whereas the true way of being is to go through the emotional realm and reach the spiritual via the other side, and we need to communicate and share our Being for that. This unwillingness to communicate, that I also start to recognize in my husband, then leads to the invention of a path of gradually letting go of desires, and a false path of letting go of all mental concepts to go into the spiritual realm 'losing your mortal life' in the process, while you haven't even started to live in the first place. What is missing is Love and Gratitude for God's Will, and instead having an inordinate mental love for free will, that gives you the freedom to say: I know my own way back to God, \\"I will Be who I will Be\\"The book goes on to say: \\"As you reach the top, you will be required to sacrifice everything that is left of that mortal sense of identity. Only then can you accept your identity in Christ and see yourself as a Son or Daughter of God.\\"Behind this approach is a subtle changing of the of what \\"Being the hands and feet of God\\" means. This path is built upon a false idea of purity, that you have to become totally transparent without any worldly identity to become an open door for the spirit God and do as he wants. In reality the path is a path of Being here on earth as God is in Spirit, and to work as one. You do not have to give up your identity that has been given to you by God in the first place to build upon and become More of God on earth. What you give up is your need to do whatever you want to do, from that limited mind and identity that you currently have. When you love your true Self, the masculine and the feminine aspects of yourself, you love God, and you Love his will, and you love to share your Being with others. Then it is easy to let God into your heart and work as one on the earth, without having to question everything before you act. I Hope for a book that will help people find that in themselves and others.These hidden concepts leave this book to be a one-sided mental approach to spirituality, whereby there is sadly no promotion of the true path of Being, as there is no mention of the emotional implications, of the actual experience of being on the path of Christhood, and thus nothing to connect to besides the switching between happy mental sympathy and putting you down at the same time between the lines . No leaven of Christ, and no cup of cold water but a cup of hot air in Christ's name, which I believe is not what Jesus meant by being his messenger."},{"Title":"Trash Talk: An inspirational guide to saving time and money through better waste and resource management","review":"When I was very young, the authorities drained most of a small lake in the state park near my home. My mother took my best buddy and me out to the lake, and we walked around for hours picking up trash. It was a stewardship lesson I never forgot. To paraphrase Audrey Hepburn in \\"Roman Holiday,\\" I will treasure that time cleaning up the lake for as long as I shall live.But, it was one of many lessons about being a responsible resident of the planet. I grew up in a home where we already practiced much of the advice in Trash Talk. That made us unusual, in a positive way. As an adult, I continue those same practices--because they are good for the earth and good for my wallet. They simply make sense.I did learn some new things from Trash Talk, which in itself was a surprise because I am noted for being able to stretch a buck and not waste things. I like the ability to live cheaply without being a cheapskate to do it. Not all surprises are good, but this one was. And I've already begun implementing some of what I've learned. Even very frugal, waste-conscious people are likely to realize monthly savings in excess of what they paid for this book. The average person could easily save that much each week.As a professional speaker on time management, I was delighted with the way the Brummets organized this book. The \\"don't waste\\" philosophy of Trash Talk also applied to the actual reading of the book. That shouldn't be surprising, as planning and organization are key elements of reducing trash and cutting costs.Trash Talk explains the three Rs: Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle. It then adds a fourth R: Refuse (as in, refuse to buy the wrong items). These principles form the foundation for the hundreds of useful tips in Trash Talk.The book is organized into four parts.Part One addresses commonly wasted items and explains how to reduce waste and extend the usefulness of each item. Every item has its own section, and each section ends with a bulleted list of the benefits from following the advice in that section. The items include such things as bags, carpets, cloth, containers, dryer sheets, furniture, glass, hangers, nylons, plastic rings, soap, and toothbrushes.Part Two is less oriented around specific products and more around areas of concern. Each of these has its own section, as well (again, with those wonderful bulleted lists). Areas of concern include energy use, holidays, indoor air, infant and feminine hygiene, kitchen waste, organic gardening, and water use.Part Three is really about saving trees. There's much more to this than most people realize. If everyone followed some simple steps, as outlined in Trash Talk, the benefit to our forests, streams, and air would be immense.Part Four provides short examples of good things happening. The point of including these is to show that significant trash reduction is a reality for many corporations and other organizations. An extensive list of resources follows the examples.Form is important and Trash Talk could use some editing. But even so, it was enjoyable read and easy to understand. This book is valuable, in many ways. First, remember that this book is a financial investment. It will pay dividends exceeding its purchase price, not long after you start putting it to use. Second, it provides badly-needed advice on how to be good citizens of the world. It's not a \\"feel good\\" book written by some politician or celebrity who wants to spout some politically correct blather. It's a practical \\"how to\\" guide written by people who walk the walk.Buy this book for yourself. But also consider giving it as a gift to others. It may be one of the most durable gifts you have ever bestowed on another person. Your planet will thank you."},{"Title":"Trash Talk: An inspirational guide to saving time and money through better waste and resource management","review":"Although many people and communities have developed an on-going commitment to recycling that has helped the environment deal with the vast amount of waste we have created, Dave and Lillian Brummet have written a book to help us go many steps beyond just recycling.

By giving of their thoughts, ideas and resourses to heal Earth, they share with the reader facts, percentages and studies that were so carefully tried and proven. The numbers will stun you and the immensity of these tasks gives one pause. The book has part one through four filled with a wealth of knowledge for those who want to learn how they can do their part in giving back to the world around them. The three R's (Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle) has been joined by a fourth R, Refuse. The fourth R is for refusing to buy fancy packaging and the process it takes to make them, which adds to our landfills. The three R's are certainly put into motion in this fasinating book. Dave and Lillian have gone as far as drawing diagram examples in their book Trash Talk. It is a great learning tool for youngsters to start getting involved in their ecosystem at an early age and discovering how they can do their part. I myself am very passionate about this topic and I was doing some of the same things that were mentioned, back in the 70's, but by reading this book I have learned many new things that I can put into practice today.This book is one I strongly recommend to those that have the same endearment to Earth and can spread the word.

Production processes in our society result in94% of the materials extracted turned to waste...\\" In light of such dire, disturbing statistics as this, the book Trash Talk by Dave and Lillian Brummet is a most welcomed resource for simple, easily assimilated time and money saving habits that actually make an appreciable difference in our planet's overall health.Whether one is already a dedicated advocate of the 4R's of waste management, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, or a curious newcomer who appreciates conservationist ideals but has no real program in effect, Trash Talk is a detailed, well organized, thoroughly researched guidebook. The Brummets offer a wealth of information, not only about the harsh realities of how the rampant misuse of our natural recourses is rapidly depleting the world of its ability to support the excesses of the average North American lifestyle, but also provide many excellent suggestions as to how one might immediately start to effectively reduce one's own wastefulness and start enjoying the unexpected benefits of extra time and money to spend on more worthwhile activities.Trash Talk is not the typical tree-hugger's tome commonly associated with the practice of conservation and recycling. In fact, Dave and Lillian place recycling at the bottom of their list of the 4R's, encouraging everyone to \\"shout with your dollars - demand to be heard.\\" The Brummets recommend that the first step in reducing waste should be to simply refuse to buy products from companies that have wasteful processing policies, excessive packaging, and unnecessary energy expenditures. Buying in bulk diminishes the amount of packaging used, as well as, saving time spent shopping and traveling back and forth to the store. This is a very simple practice that a single city dweller or someone with a large family living on an organic farm could began to do and immediately realize the many benefits with the very first exercise.Trash Talk is organized into four general sections, each one broken down into an extensive list of topics and items and how these everyday products not only waste limited natural resources but, for most people, limited resources of discretionary time and money as well. Drawing on their years of personal experience, Dave and Lillian generously share their ideas and suggestions based on extensive research and practical applications on how to reap the most benefits with the least amount of negative impact.Part 1 offers suggestions on how everyday items found regularly in every household can be made far more economical and earth friendly through inventive and creative usage, minimizing the need for landfills and maximizing benefits. At the end of each discussion is a list of the immediate and long-term benefits that can be realized by implementing the simple but practical ideas outlined in the chapter.Part 2 concentrates on the many opportunities that one has to make a positive impact on his or her immediate community as well on people they may never even meet through the wise and conscientious use of products that might otherwise be wasted. From donating items such as prescription eyes glasses to the Gift of Sight program to just basic good sense or good cents measures as Dave and Lillian call them such as turning off electronic devices when not in use and weather-stripping to reduce gaps around windows and doors, everyone can make a difference. Just by participating in these two projects communities can help the less fortunate and save a substantial amount of energy reducing the possibility of shortages and brown outs and the individual saves real money on utility bills. Good Sense earns Good Cents!Part 3 is devoted almost entirely to reducing the wasteful consumption of paper products. \\"...62 million tress and 28 billion gallons of water were used to produce the U.S. mail - 50% of which was never even opened.\\" The Brummets provide a list of contact addresses for direct marketers that can be used to effectively reduce junk mail by up to 75%. The savings in aggravation alone from all that unwanted mail clogging our mailboxes and littering our desks is well worth the price of this excellent resource book.Part 4 is dedicated to instilling a sense of hope and inspiration, offering encouragement and empowerment to everyone attempting to make an effective contribution to the welfare of the world or, perhaps, just trying to provide a better environment for themselves and their families in their immediate community. Dave and Lillian provide an extensive list of websites to businesses, government services, and environmental agencies for anyone who wishes to have additional information on how they can become more active in promoting effective waste management programs in their homes, communities, country, or world wide.Dave and Lillian have drawn from generations of practical experience and knowledge in compiling this extremely informative and helpful manual. Trash Talk is presented in such a practical and affable manner that this book is not so much a call to arms as it is a call to conscientiousness. Although the Brummets are passionate about talking trash, Trash Talk is a real treasure.

I'll check back to see what is posted and design my future reviews accordingly thank you, deVoll)"},{"Title":"Trash Talk: An inspirational guide to saving time and money through better waste and resource management","review":"I was recently expressing concern to a friend about the environmental state of our planet; how our food, air and water supply are being compromised and how I feel as though I can't make a difference.

The results show how deep their research must have been and the pain they must have taken in producing Trash Talk, while they accepted the challenge to educate the people around them. This book is full of information and will ceratinly motivate it's audience to implement these simple life-changing habits.

However, the family comes on hard times when their animals are lost and the decision is made that Johnny must leave. He packs up his few possessions and the old woman bakes him a journey cake for him to eat. As he walks along, the cake pops out of his sack and rolls away, taunting him. He gives chase and when he passes various animals, they join in the pursuit of the journey cake. The cake rolls and rolls, until it eventually falls over. Johnny looks around and discovers that he is back where he started and he has brought an entire entourage of farm animals with him.The book is well illustrated and has a happy ending when Johnny returns home.

Some part of me became the character in the book and I was completely lost in it. Possibly because I am a Sagittarius, I related to the travel and the journey and the ideals put forward."},{"Title":"The Best of Ed Zern: Fifty Years of Fishing and Hunting from One of America's Best-Loved Outdoor Humorists","review":"I grew up reading monthly Zern articles in hunting/fishing magazines and I love this guys' humor.

His stories are interesting, informative, and funny in content. This is great reading while you relax after a long day."},{"Title":"Counseling in Sports Medicine","review":"This book offers the Athletic Training and other Sports Medicine Professionals good advice when working with athletes who need guidance. It is not easy to educate and counsel athletes. Too often athletes hear only what they want and not what they need to hear. Since athletes are highly motivated to achieve success in competition, they tend to focus on their problems and how it affect them, not others.Athletes have multiple problems, just like the rest of the population, the difference is, that most will try to work on their issues if they are identified and given strategies that work. Ray and Wiese-Bjornstal do a good job of presenting problems and solutions. They have identified the sound techniques and theories that work in the counseling arena.The authors are quick to point out the dangers of uneducated counseling and the warning signs of potential serious disorders. It is fair to assume that the reader should have some understanding of basic psychology, and human behavior.The reader should also understand sport and the different circumstances it presents to daily living.I have been a professional in Athletic Training for over 30 years and found the text to be very helpful. It is succint and to the point but also in detail and complete on the topics discussed. I highly reccomend the text for the Sports Medicine Professional."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"This was an excellent ghost story! Usually with any ghost/mystery book, you can guess the ending mid way through the book, but not this one! Mrs. Boyd keeps us guessing until the end! The story is about The Mason's, a family recently moved into their lake home in Mercy, North Carolina, and struggling with family crisis, and Mary, a ghost of a woman who has been dead for seventy years and doesn't realize she is the ghost. Mary seems to be connected to this family in some way, after all, she has waited seventy years to return home, and that connection is the real mystery behind the ghost story! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"If you have ever longed to read a good old-fashioned ghost story, a chilling tale of the supernatural, Donna Boyd's \\"The Awakening\\" should fit the bill perfectly. If you prefer the metaphysical over the mundane, the author also raises some intriguing questions about the nature of death and freewill.Paul Mason, a successful writer of children's books, and an English professor at a college in North Carolina, is fired for having an affair with a student. His wife, Penny, a surgeon, is now the only breadwinner in the family. She is devastated by her husband's infidelity. Their thirteen year-old daughter, Elise, is very troubled and recovering from a trauma she experienced a year ago. Withdrawn and depressed, Elise has been pulled out of public school and her father is homeschooling her. The family leaves their home in town and moves to their lake house, hoping to rebuild the marriage and their former close, loving relationship. After a brief time at the lake, Elise becomes more introspective and appears to hear voices and strange noises. Penny begins to have vivid, violent reoccurring nightmares. Paul meets and converses with an unknown woman, who seems very much at home on their property. There are indeed bizarre goings-on at the Mason house. However, Paul, Penny and Elise are estranged from each other and not communicating well. But it is only through pooling their knowledge that they will be able to unravel the mystery - and there's not too much time left!At almost the same time the Masons move to the lake, a woman awakens from a long coma. She is disoriented and remembers nothing about herself, her life or her family. Someone, a psychiatrist or doctor, works with her but tells her that only she can unlock her memory - if she wants to remember. She slowly determines that her husband and daughter are dead, in an accident. Her only wish is to return home. Finally, when she remembers her name, she is allowed to go home.Donna Boyd has written an eerie tale about worlds which exist on parallel planes. Those with pressing needs may pass from one to another. This is a simply written, engrossing novel where the telling of the tale is all important. I enjoyed it...and was scared at times - the test of a good ghost story!JANA"},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"This story slowly spins a tale of a family in crisis alongside a woman in crisis. It gains momentum and draws you in. The characters, the house, and the countryside are beautifully and painstakingly described. The story is very complex, yet the book is remarkably short. I was shocked how quickly I read this."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"The author, who has written a number of well-received books, including her elegantly written werewolf saga (\\"The Passion\\", \\"The Promise\\"), now turns her attention to ghosts in this intriguing tale of the supernatural. Those who have enjoyed the author's previous books will not be disappointed.The story is told through the eyes of a family in crisis, the Masons, as well as through the eyes of Mary, the ghost in this well told tale. The Masons are a family who have had their world turned upside down through a series of unfortuitous events. Their teenage daughter Elsie is suffering from some traumatic experience that has resulted in her being home schooled. Paul, the patriarch of the family, has done the near unforgivable, by having an affair with a student at the college at which he had been a professor. Having been summarily dismissed from his position for his ill advised behavior, he, a formerly successful writer, also has had the misfortune to watch his career wane, as that of Penny, his wife and a successful surgeon, has been on the rise. Clearly, this is a family in crisis.To escape the scandal, help their daughter, and try and save their marriage, the Masons have moved to their lakefront home in a rural section of North Carolina. While there, each of the family members has a series of unusual experiences. Elsie sees a woman named Mary wandering about the house, as does her father, while Penny has a series of violent dreams in which the woman named Mary also plays a part.Meanwhile, Mary is having her own crisis, as the reader will soon discover. Mary has ties to the house in which the Masons now reside, and the Masons themselves seem all too familiar to her, as she wanders around the house and grounds. You see, Mary is desperately trying to remember something that remains elusive, and the Masons may just have the key to her past.This story is beautifully told when done so through the voice of Mary. Vivid in its imagery and language, it is very well done. When told through the collective voices of the Mason family, the book takes a much more pedestrian tone in the telling, which detracts somewhat from the book and takes away some of its polish and luster. Notwithstanding this, it is an intriguing and novel ghost story that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"The author, who has written a number of well-received books, including her elegantly written werewolf saga (\\"The Passion\\", \\"The Promise\\"), now turns her attention to ghosts in this intriguing tale of the supernatural.

It lay on my desk for several weeks until I picked it up when looking for a stand alone short read when going to Raleigh to move my daughter back to college. It turned a 3 hour ride into a delight as I delved into this great mystery. I've got to admit that I thought I had it figured out several times but the author deftly ran circles around me. I can say little that doesn't spoil the book but you will not be disappointed at all upon reading this short though amazingly complex story."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"This is a very quick and light book. I thought it was interesting and unpredictable. While the story was other-worldly, I thought the characters were realistic and believable."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"The Awakening is not nearly as intriguing as the Passion. The story is unique but the characters are rather non-compelling. As a fan of the Passion and the Promise, this book was a let down."},{"Title":"The Awakening","review":"Paul and Penny Mason spend the summer in their home in Mercy, North Carolina trying to patch up their marriage and help their thirteen-year-old daughter Elsie heal from a trauma she went through a year ago. Paul is a best-selling author of children's books and had been a professor at the Woodlands, but was fired for having an affair with one of his students. Penny is working hard at trying to forgive him but is spending more of her time in Chapel Hill doing surgeries than staying at a lake house that is making her increasingly uneasy.Penny has vivid dreams of the people that lived in the town in 1932 and the tragedy that occurred in her home. Elsie sees the ghost of Mary who is looking for her own husband and child. Paul is the only one who can speak to Mary but he doesn't understand why she is haunting his home. Elsie and Paul research the history of their home but it is Penny who finds out the answers that Mary needs to move on after her purpose is finished.Donna Boyd has written a chilling and spooky old fashioned ghost story about two worlds in time and space that temporally connect so that members of one family can interact with the surviving member of the other family who needs to discover the truth about her past. The characters are all victims and survivors who must find a way to move on from the tragedies that have affected their lives. Readers will really enjoy THE AWAKENING and appreciate the wonder that is so much a part of this stirring tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tongues and Tails (Head to Tail)","review":"In the animal kingdom, there are a wide variety of different functions that tongues and tails provide. We are all aware that tongues are used to move food into and around the mouth. However, there are many more uses. Specialized tongues are used to lure and capture prey, grab the food, sometimes by wrapping around it; sometimes it is a tube to suck food and other times food is captured when it is stuck to it.Tails are even more versatile. Some animals use them as an additional appendage, others use theirs to communicate, defend themselves, lure mates, as blankets, and even as an ever present source of shade. Written for the young reader at the middle school level, this book chronicles all of these uses for these appendages. There is a diagram of each animal mentioned with an emphasis on how the appendage is used. I strongly recommend this book as it demonstrates the wide diversity that is found in the animal kingdom. I was biology major in college and there were some uses illustrated in the book that were news to me.In the animal kingdom, there are a wide variety of different functions that tongues and tails provide.

Although authors themselves are respectable researchers in the field, this one more looks like a collection of papers rather than a \\"book\\". Also not all of them are good writers, so some of the chapters are extremely boring. Few concepts are just not explained to the level of detail I would have liked...in short this book gives you a \\"high-level\\" view. And at least I would not be able to implement any system explained without making my own assumptions. Of course, I should accept that I am not a master of this subject (but then isn't that the reason I am buying this book ?)I will not recommend this book at its given price. Makes no sense to spend $175 on this"},{"Title":"Hotel Berlin '43","review":"Vicki Baum was both Austrian and Jewish. Her novels \\"Grand Hotel\\" and \\"Hotel Berlin\\" make a wonderful read. In \\"Grand Hotel,\\" she captures 1920s Berlin while in \\"Hotel Berlin\\" she moves us to a few weeks before the collaspe of the Third Reich. Both books were made into movies which are well worth seeing. Who can forget the immortal Gretta Gardo's famous line in \\"Grand Hotel\\"- \\"I want to left along.\\" Baum does not write in a condemnatory style. She creates real life characters who face no win choices. Her protagonist in \\"Hotel Berlin\\" is the actress Lisa Dorn (played brillantly by Andrea King in the movie of the same name). Dorn is a star in Hitler's Reich. While the bombs are dropping over Berlin she continues playing to a full house. She is involved with a German general slated for execution because of his involvement in the July 1944 plot to kill Hitler. He is given a choice suicide or hanging. Dorn is given a choice- abandon the general or face arrest. All the characters in this book are faced with choices- some make the right choices while others make the wrong choices and must face the consequences. Vicki Baum has been out of print for many years. In some ways readers may find these types of WWII novels dated. However, I throughly enjoyed Baum as she helps me to better understand an era that has always been beyond comprehension. (A trivia note- this book was written before Berlin fell to the Russian army. It is a testament to Baum on her knowledge of Berlin and German culture and mannerisms that make the book so strikingly realistic.)"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Louisa is hiding in plain sight as a dowdy widow. Her past is something that she's ashamed of and she holds out little hope for a happy future. Anthony Stalbridge is interested in her and their first real encounter is when he kisses her outside Elwin Hastings' bedroom while they're both attending a ball.His reasons for being there are different to hers. She's investigating for a scandal sheet, while he's trying to find out whether his fiancee's death was truly a suicide. Both of them have an interest in Mr Hastings and they propose to join forces to bring him to justice.With a lot of twists and turns this story brings the two characters together and is quite an amusing read. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to more of the same."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Set in the late Victorian era of England, this is a charming romance with a dose of a compelling tale of mystery to boot. The reader will find that the characters are well-developed and realistic. There is humor which I always appreciate and some of the supporting characters actually made me think of someone that I had known over the years. As the story moves along in this enticing story of society's upper-class that is cloaked in dark secrets that are tied to the Thames River, hence the title: The River Knows.The novel has the main character Louisa Bryce, the journalist, and then there's the wealthy Anthony Stalbridge that is seeking answers to his fianc&eacute; Fiona drowning that has been ruled a suicide. These two connect and fall in love. I'll stop here.As the story moves along in this enticing story of society's upper-class that is cloaked in dark secrets that are tied to the Thames River, hence the title: The River Knows, the reader will find that this tale has plenty of action and a number of surprises.If you're a Quick fan, I'm sure you will enjoy this novel, it's got all the typical plots and characters that you have come to know and appreciate. If you haven't read any of Quick's books this is an excellent introduction to her writing skills."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"OK, sorry but I just HAD to write that! Now seriously, this is a fun romp with yes, a few bumps along the way, but altogether quite a pleasant read. You have the plucky heroine who is not afraid to investigate and the brooding hero. I will say that the male character was not as interesting as Ms. Quick usually creates but I'm willing to over look that minor inconvenience. If you typically enjoy Amanda Quick novels, you will enjoy this one. And I promise, no more puns!"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"As usual JAK AKA Amanda Quick has scored another winner.Fast pace easy read and very good story."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"This was a little change of pace for this author but as always I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and will take it again and again as I have with all of Amanda Quick's books........thanks for another wonderful entrancing tale."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Amanda Quick is an automatic \\"buy\\" for me. I always enjoy her books. In fact, I love the books she writes as Jayne Ann Krentz and Jayne Castle, too. They're smart and funny and very intelligent. I hope she keeps writing more!"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I really enjoy her books and this one was no different. I really enjoyed the romance between the main characters. They mystery was pretty predictable but a good read. The sex scenes were a little disappointing and silly but not enough to take away from the overall read."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I enjoy all of amanda quick's books they are exciting, suspenceful lots of romance"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"One thing I really like about AQ/JAK's novels is that not only does she create fascinating characters and excellent plots, but she also manages to capture the mood and atmosphere of whatever period she is writing about.While I was hoping for another Arcane Society novel, this Victorian suspense novel is still a very good read. The characters are ambivalent about each other, which makes the conclusion that much more satisfying, and the secondary characters nicely contribute to the fabric of the book."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"This is a lovely quick read of a Victorian time. It is amusing, innocent by today's standards; thus it was a delightful day's diversion.Louisa was sweet, smart and innocent at the same time. Anthony was wonderfully written and I bought the whole thing.This was a fun romance/mystery. No blood and guts to mess up your mind. Just an excellent way to spend some time."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"An Excellent story in the same vein as her other Arcane series books. Nothing was too surprising, but I liked the sense of humor that she portrays in all of her characters."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE READ THIS AUTHOR AND I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, RIGHT TO THE END"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I really enjoy the old Amanda Quick books. I have read most of her books written under her other names (Jayne Castle). The only problem is that she is reusing the plots and scenes from old books. This plot of this book was very similar to her other stories and some of the scene actually reminded me of scenes from her other books. I used to buy Amanda Quick books now I just check them out from the library. She has not written a book for my keeper shelf in years. Basically if you have read Amanda Quick's other books then you have read this one. If you are just looking for something to read then read this. This book is like a loaf of bread-plain but filling. But otherwise look for something else."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I really tried to like this one but to me it was just boring. I finally skimmed through it. I usually enjoy Historical romances with some mystery but none of this just rang true to me. I got so tired of the formal language which I relaize is Victorian style but when Jessica keeps referring to Anthony as \\"sir\\" even when they are having an affair simply got on my nerves. There were some secondary characters that were interesting, yet I found myself putting the book down thinking I will come back later which is very unusual for me when I'm reading. Some reviewers liked it so I realize we all have different tastes. Perhaps I should stick to the books she writes under the Jayne Ann Krentz name as I usually like those, though I have liked some of the ones under the Amanda Quick name. This one just lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. I simply couldn't keep my interest in it."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I love Amanda Quick's writing style-smart, funny and very romantic. I high high hopes for her newest book. While the book had it's moments of brillance, the balance of the story was too formulaic to spare the story of it's average appeal. The problem was in the author's attempt to write a \\"romance + mystery\\", she failed to make either stand out. While the hero and heroine were both likeable characters, not enough time was spent on their burgeoning romance.Don't get me wrong-the good parts were very good, but too much of the same ole same ole made Ms. Quick's newest tome a book look for used, and not a keeper.3 stars."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"The books in the Amanda Quick series are starting to slip into the predictable. The characters lack color and the story line is so much like previous books that it is difficult to separate one from the others. Perhaps the author needs to explore different time periods, such as she did in \\"Desire\\" and \\"Mystique.\\""},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and it sounded like it would be intriguing, mysterious and sexy. It wasn't. It was plodding and predictable, with no surprises, and a \\"romance\\" that seemed especially fake. Left me with the feeling that the author needed to crank one out in order to make some quick cash. Waste of time."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I found this to be the best Amanda Quick story in long time. I love all of her stories, but this one is more like her earlier stories. It was so good I reread the book a week later to remember all the details. I enjoyed both characters, Louisa was strong and intelligent, Anthony was accepting of her intelligence and his family was wonderful. I hope Ms. Quick writes a story for Anthony's sister, Clarice, she was one of the best parts of the story. The secondary characters were all very interesting to me. I was also glad that Ms. Quick left out any paranormal or Arcane Society in this book. I have enjoyed those stories, but it was good to see a different type story."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"First I will say that I am an Amanda Quick fan and these are the only books that I buy in hardback. This is a good story but I feel that she did a horrible job with her non-existant descriptions of the characters and the scene. It made the story difficult to read and hard to really get into. If she had been more descriptive I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I've had a book going for 20 years and never once did I read an Amanda Quick story, or any other books under her different names. I picked this one up last week, deciding to give her a try-and couldn't put it down once I started it. It grabbed me right from the beginning with a good plot, good characters, good suspense and great writing. I loved Anthony right from the beginning and Louisa was extremely likeable. Both investigating the same man, for entirely different reasons, they team up and work together in what is a story that flows right along, has great dialogue and I love the wit AQ gives her characters. He's a handsome, rich eccentric and she's a dowdy widow, and together they search for answers and eventually begin an illicit affair. The entire book was completely enjoyable and now I'll have to get more. Great read!"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I may be a man, and not just a man, but a family man, but even I like to spend Sunday afternoons lying in my hammock with the latest Amanda Quick (aka Jayne Ann Krentz) novel in one hand and a frosty brew in the other, so completely lost in the Victorian world of Quick's imagination that the noises of my kids playing in the yard, my neighbor mowing his lawn, and my wife yelling at me to get off my lazy bum all fade into the dim background. That's usually when I get the urge to pee.That doesn't compare, of course, to Louisa Bryce's urge to uncover Elwin Hasting's dark secrets, one of which may have something to do with the recent drowning of several women in the Thames, one of whom was the fiancee of wealthy, handsome Anthony Stalbridge.The unlikely partnership of the \\"unimportant, unfashionable, excessively dull\\" Louisa Bryce and the dashing Anthony Stalbridge begins with an expedient but passionless kiss but soon leads them into danger, suspense, and even possible romance as they investigate the mysterious Elwin Hasting in the dark underworld of Victorian England. Quick writes not only a compelling tale, but a quick-footed and quick-witted one, leading our intrepid duo further into the privileged world of the upperclass and the dark belly of the underclass, both shrouded in secrets and dealings that, dare I say it, only the river knows."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"THE RIVER KNOWS reminds me of all the great older Quick novels. No Arcane Society or psychic powers just a wonderful mystery and romance set in the time of Queen Victoria.Lousia Bryce is persuing a career as an informant and writer for one of the Newspapers that circulates in London. She writes under the name I.M. Phantom. She is currently investigating Mr. Elwin Hastings. He is suspected of funding one of the many brothels in London. Lousia is the companion of Lady Ashton and as a result has the ability to travel amongst the titled and wealthy. Being a companion she is rarely noticed, until Anthony Stalbridge takes an unwanted interest in the widow.Anthony is the scion of a wealthy, eccentric family. A year earlier his fiancee committed suicide by jumping from a bridge. He has been searching for a reason or a killer, since he does not believe she killed herself. The search has led him to Mr. Hastings and now to Louisa. The very fact that she tries so hard to be invisible and suceeds at it, fasinates Anthony and when he rescues her with a kiss he finds there is a fire hidden under the drab exterior.While seeking a chance to go through Hastings papers she is almost discovered and only the quick thinking of Anthony saves them both for he is also wanting to search Hastings safe. Discovering that both are interested in Hastings they join efforts and share information. Anthony knows that his fiancee went into a garden where Hastings and his wife were and she never came out. A few days later Hastings wife jumps or was pushed from the same bridge and a week later the owner of a bookstore committed suicide by jumping from the bridge. Something tells him it is no coincidence. Lousia is disgusted by the brothel which forces ladys and women whose husbands leave them in debt to work as ladies of the evening to pay off the debts. Togather they investigate Hastings. The only trouble is Louisa has her own secrets that could cost her her life. As she falls helplessly in love with Anthony she knows she can never have a life with him. He is also very friendly with a detective from Scotland Yard.I really loved this book, one of the best she has written in some time. Do not miss it."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"\\"This is the thing with an illicit affair....It cannot end happily.\\" Oh, but yes it can --- and it does --- in Amanda Quick's latest romance novel, THE RIVER KNOWS. Where love and romance and excitingly dangerous liaisons are concerned, \\"There are exceptions to every rule\\" --- and we wouldn't have it any other way. Amanda Quick, a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, shows us the way to romantic bliss.Steamy Victorian passion and devastating kisses are what fans of Quick desire. The New York Times bestselling author reveals that the Victorian Age was not quite so straight-laced after all. It was a time of romantic trysts inside the crested carriages that clop-clop-clopped down foggy London streets, long walks in moonlit gardens that led to stolen moments behind large, perfectly trimmed bushes. The seclusion and humidity of the conservatory provided a private location for the passion that novelists and playwrights wrote about. Lovers seeking to ravish and indulge their passions stole away from elegant balls for exhilarating interludes.Not only do we enjoy a peek behind closed carriages, we also read that there were many bright, educated and talented women who secretly and/or openly engaged in journalism, playwriting, painting and mercantilism. Some even presided successfully as a scantily clad brothel Madam. In a time when it was common for a young woman to wait patiently until she was swept off her feet by a wealthy, handsome Lord, it is refreshing to read here about a Victorian family with \\"razor-sharp intelligence and forceful willpower\\" and the young women who forged the very beginnings of the sexual revolution.THE RIVER KNOWS revolves around Louisa Bryce, who has a secret that only her employer, Lady Ashton, knows --- one that surely would send her to jail. Louisa is determined to flush out the rogues of Society by writing tabloid articles under the name \\"I.M. Phantom\\" for the Flying Intelligencer, a \\"disreputable paper that thrives on the most lurid sensations.\\" Louisa's romantic experience is limited to what she has read in sensation novels; she is captivated by the portrayal of illicit passion as a \\"transcendent experience.\\"When Louisa meets Anthony Stalbridge, a handsome member of Society with impeccable bloodlines, at the Hammond ball, Louisa falls in love at that first moment. Louisa undertakes a brazen quest to expose the shocking activities within Polite Society, including the murder of Fiona Risby, Anthony Stalbridge's fianc&eacute;. Louisa and Anthony find themselves in intimate circumstances as they delve into the business affairs and blackmail schemes of Elwin Hastings, a prominent member of Society who is at the center of several mysterious deaths. Anthony fears that he failed to protect Fiona from the circumstances that led to her suicide in the river Thames. The clues take the reader from brothels to an attempt on Anthony's life in London's Arden Park to clandestine meetings in foggy alleys and straight to Elwin Hastings's former wife --- who comes back from the murky waters to expose Hastings.When the servants have the afternoon off, the young lovers bring to life a scene from one of the many sensation novels Louisa has read. Anthony leaves Louisa breathless with kisses and the \\"transcendent experience\\" of an illicit tryst. However, danger lurks as the pair gets closer to the truth behind the deaths, and Anthony must rely on his eccentric family to help him save Louisa from the depths of a darkened dungeon.The \\"Polite World\\" of Victorian London had its share of secrets, romantic trysts, villains and marriages based on money, property and family connections. What I was surprised to learn was that Louisa possessed a \\"wide assortment of sensation novels...filled with stories of illicit love affairs.\\" Quick's books portray an age of privilege and passions, contrary to the belief that Victorian London was staid and proper.Novels of romantic bliss are not without peril and insecurities. Matters of the heart are mostly complicated, and Louisa finds herself thinking, \\"Live for the here and now; it is all you will ever have with Anthony.\\" If you believe, as I do, that it's possible to fall in love (or lust) at first sight, then prepare to abandon yourself to the fantasy of romantic bliss a la Amanda Quick.--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Anthony Stalbridge is highly placed in society even though his family is considered very eccentric. At present his image is tarnished because his fianc&eacute;e committed suicide and there are rumors that he was breaking off their engagement. Although Anthony is sure she was murdered, he wants to find the killer in the hopes that it was nothing he did or didn't do that caused her demise. He believes Edwin Hastings had something to do with her death and he tries to break into the man's bedroom safe.Coming out of his Hasting's bedroom is Louisa Bryce who is looking into Hastings investment in a brothel. They meet up with each other and he grabs and kisses her because he hears a guard coming. After they leave, they talk about why they are interested in the same man. Louisa wants to write a story about him and Anthony wants to prove he murdered his fianc&eacute;e. Later that night he breaks into the safe and finds his fianc&eacute;e's necklace there as well as proof that the man is an investor in the brothel. As Louisa and Anthony work together to bring Hastings down, they fall in love but she has a dark secret that she hides from everyone and fears when she tells Anthony he will turn from her in disgust.Taking place in the late Victorian era, THE RIVER KNOWS is a fantastic romantic thriller. Like any Amanda Quick novel, this book is a charmer due to the realistic characters who don't quite fit the society mold. Their amusing antics will have readers chuckling out loud while the support cast moves the plot along quite subtly in a tantalizing tale filled with plenty of action and quite a few surprises.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"In my opinion, The River Knows is one of Amanda Quick's best! From the opening, the air of suspense builds until the action packed end. The search for truth brings Anthony Stalbridge and Louisa Bryce together. Louisa is spirited and independent and Anthony is something of a free thinker, too. As fans of Ms. Quick will know, the romance between the two is lots of fun. I enjoyed the mix of humor, suspense, and romance -- the mystery left me guessing to near the end. The River Knows was lots of fun to read. I highly recommend it to fans of romantic suspense."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"As a long time Amanda Quick fan, I wanted to like this book but was horribly disappointed. As other reviewers have said the slow moving, improbable plot dragged until the last several chapters when everything was hurriedly tied up with a neat little bow. The characters were one dimensional, poorly developed and lacked any sort of chemistry. I also feel that neither the hero nor the heroine were especially bright. The \\"widow\\" is still a virgin? No problem. A fashionably dressed woman in black is stalking you while you are investigating a murder? Must be a hooker accidentally in the wrong neighborhood. You killed someone and faked your own death? Let's not even talk about and jump straight to the bit were we live happily ever after with my kooky yet lovable family, who hardly knows you but thinks you're wonderful anyway. Several scenes and supporting characters seemed to be lifted straight out of earlier books. All in all, this book was a waste of the time I spent hoping it would get better. I am glad I got it from the library instead of wasting the money on a hardcover as well. If you must read this book, I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"When she is forced to murder a London gentleman who sneaks into her home, Joanna Barclay decides to fake her own suicide and reinvent herself as Louisa Bryce, the distant relative of an old Society matron. With the past behind her, it would be easy for Louisa to accept her new role in life and forget about the past. Still, she finds herself drawn to the scandal and intrigue that forced her from her old life and takes on a role as a correspondent for one of London's sensation papers The Flying Intelligencer. When her journalistic investigations involve her in the case of Elwin Hastings, a gentleman who has secret connections to a notorious brothel, Louisa joins forces with someone else who is investigating Hastings, Mr. Anthongy Stalbridge. When Louisa and Anthony get together, their mutual attraction begins to distract them from their investigations. Soon they are involved in an illicit romance while carrying on secret investigations into Hastings' affairs.The River knows was fine, but not great. It's the kind of book that is utterly forgettable. I doubt I'll remember much of this one in about a week and, instead, it will probably blend in with all the other Amanda Quick novels I've read in the past. Which is a shame. I really like Amanda Quick. Her books are funny, romantic, and mysterious. I usually like her heroines and storylines, but this one was filled with lackluster characters and a plot that was reminsicent of so many others that came before it. There was nothing new or exciting here, and I'm starting to think I might just have to wait for her books to come to paperback from now on. I've been disappointed the last few times I've gone for the hardback (most notably Second Sight, which was a waste of my time and hers). Anyway, if you're a Quick fan, I guess this book is worth reading. It's got all the things I've come to know and love about Quick's writing, but there's nothing new to distinguish it from the rest of the pack."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Louisa Bryce, the mysterious sensational journalist known as I. M.Phantom, has another secret that she must keep from the authorities or risk the hangman's noose. Anthony Stalbridge is searching for the answers to his fiance's apparent suicide by drowning in the Thames. The two join forces to find the truth and, in the process,love.Amanda Quick has written a suspenseful Victorian thriller with fascinating main characters, sinister villians, and a host of supporting characters that neatly round out a tightly plotted, satisfying romantic suspense novel."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"It was not that the story was so sensational, but that the main characters were so darn likable they made the story highly amusing and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Only a year or so ago, Louisa Bryce, a very intelligent woman, faked a suicide to run from the supposed murder of a very prominent, but very evil, man. Hired by Emma Ashton as a companion, someone to write her memoires, Louisa and Emma quickly become fast friends, where Louisa confesses all. In order to help, Emma is playing off Louisa as a distant cousin from the country who is now widowed. \\"Unimportant, unfashionable and excessively dull\\", Louisa manages to squeeze around the Polite World, uncovering deep secrets of the weathly Society ton. She is, after all, a journalist for the Flying Intelligencer, a notorious rag; pen name: I. M. Phantom. No one knows her background, and she intends to keep it that way.Convinced that Elwin Hastings is up to no good, let alone a possible murderer, she sets off to investigate and find the truth. During a ball, she slips unoticed up the stairs to search his rooms. Leaving his bedroom, she is caught by Anthony Stalbridge, saving her from almost being caught by one of Hastings's personal hired guards. Seems that Anthony is convinced that Hastings murdered his fiancee, Fiona Risby. He's looking for proof - regardless if Hastings pays for his crimes, he still wants the proof. With a quick-witted discussion, the two become unlikely partners, both after the same goal.And that's when the fun begins. Evidence is found in the way of business papers and one of Fiona's very expensive necklace (the one she was wearing the night she disappeared from a party); now Anthony and Louisa are sure there is more afoot and continue to dig. Louisa would like nothing more than to expose him to the Society he so desperately wants to belong to. Anthony wants him to confess to murdering Fiona. Will they get what they covet most?Oh, you most certainly bet they do - almost more than they bargain for. Yes, you find out early on the who and what, but it's how the plot came about and to a close that keeps your attention. The more they dig, the more facts come to light, the more questions answered and more arise, that have you focussing on the story, and the main characters.Louisa is a strong and intelligent woman, regardless of her naivete. She fights for what she believes is right, even if she's putting herself unknowingly in harm's way. Anthony is the only person in his family with a head for finances; seems his father, mother and sister are the eccentric artists of the family. Strong-willed and relentless, he had spotted Louisa right off and became intrigued by the unknown woman; he could see the intelligence in her eyes, no matter how dull she made herself seem in the form of dress and conversation. And the more time they spend together, the more they fall in love with each other. But Louisa believes that it can be nothing more than an illicit affair, especially knowing that, if anyone discovered her past, she'd be hanged for murder.Quick-witted conversations, discussions and the hot passion they feel for each other will have you believing they are made for each other - two halves of a whole. I liked how Quick touched base on what it was like for woman in that day in age, where women were really considered the weaker sex, where they were valued for their looks, bloodline and money, not for their mind. I like how, not once but twice, Louisa rises above, first after her father dies, then after her faked suicide. It was nice to see Anthony falling in love with her, first and foremost, for her intelligence and integrity. Perfect match. Great climax to the story, even if you did see it coming. Couldn't have asked for better!"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"This book contains far too much mystery and far too little romance. The love scenes are too forced, and there is no chemistry between the hero and the heroine. There is almost no trademark AQ humor. I bought this book because I had to wait for 8 hours on an airport and needed something to do. I somehow managed to read majority of this book while waiting, but when I got home it took me about a week to read the final few chapters. I just didn't care about what happens. I guess this book is OK for AQ fans, but don't expect too much from it."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Novels like this one are the reason I like her as a writer.

One woman was found, the other was not found. Louisa Bryce is the reincarnation of a third woman who has supposedly committed suicide in the river. The charade was necessary after she bludgeoned a \\"Lord\\" who attacked her in her home. She now lives as the poor country relation/companion to a society lady. Louisa also writes as a reporter for a sensational newspaper and uses her connections on the fringe of society as the source of her stories. While attending a party at the Hastings' home, Louisa begins to snoop around on the second floor. Just outside a bedroom, she runs into Anthony Stalbridge who sweeps her into a kiss as a guard enters the hallway. The kiss leads to their collaboration to seek the reason behind the death of Anthony's fiancee.As the river flows, so does the story. The witty, spirited conversations between Anthony and Louisa were enjoyable, particularly as she was unaware of the effect that she was having on Anthony. As the mystery unfolds, many of the incidents are predictable, but entertaining nevertheless."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"The River Knows was an excellent read. I enjoyed it as much as the many other Quick novels I've read. The only criticism I have is that I did not get to know Louisa Bryce or Anthony Stalbridge well enough. There was a great emphasis on the intrigue of the story which worked for me since I love mysteries, but I would have liked more details about who they were. I wonder if she will write other books featuring these characters. I hope so. If she writes another book, I hope she fleshes out the characters more so that we feel as though we really know them."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"The best romance novel I've read in a while. Really liked the way the writer wrote. And The story kept me interested. Did not want to put it down! Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"By whatever name she goes, Amanda Quick is always great. This is a great series and worth reading."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I am always excited when a new Amanda Quick OR Jayne Ann Krentz novel comes out and I buy them straight away. And USUALLY I find that my money is well spent. This time however I feel a little ripped off! The River Knows started out so well. Our Heroine Louisa Bryce is a sensation writer who is set on uncovering the truth about Lord Hastings. But this is not the only thing she trys to keep secret. Louisa is also wanted for murder. Our hero of the piece is Anthony Stalbridge a man set on finding justice for his fiance who commited suicide.. Or did she? I found this book fabulous with lots of shocking surprises.. that is until the final chapters. Quick ends the book quite suddenly by [SPOILER ALERT!] having her hero calmly admit that he has no problem with Lousia actually being the notorious Miss Barclay. And he has no problem with her being a murderer! Instead he informs her that they will be married! I was eagerly waiting for the betrayal shock and guilt to arise from this final confrontation however the book ended on a rather hollow and dull note. Definately not one of Quick or Krentz best novels but still quite enjoyable. I suggest getting it from the library that way you wont feel ripped off like myself."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I enjoyed it so much I started and finished it in one day! I've been a fan of Amanda Quick for a while now. As someone else mentioned, this one does not involve any odd Societies or scientists, which made for a nice change.I highly reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great Regency novel."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz strikes again under her historical romance pseudonym, Amanda Quick. Her heroine, as usual, is spicy and daring. Her hero, as usual, is strong and not a little mysterious. Why mess with a proven formula."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I'm on the fence about this book. On one hand, I can't say I'm overly fond of the main male lead. The heroine is interesting and likeable, and I almost wish she'd end up with someone better (though the hero's family is quite interesting). The storyline has a good mix of mystery and action, if a little overly melodramatic. For those who like a bit more intrigue in their romance novels, this is a decent novel. Not the best by this author by a long shot, but not bad, either.And even though the author does a bit too much leading (as opposed to letting readers guess themselves or be utterly surprised) it's still a tidy, interesting plot. Pity about the hero, but still a solid novel. And if you like this one, I'd definitely read others by her (discounting the recent Arcane society ones)."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"\\"The River Knows\\" is so much like other Amanda Quick novels that, if you have read other Amanda Quick novels, you have, for the most part, read this one already, word for word, scene for scene, character for character.That wouldn't necessarily be such a bad thing -- sometimes, when you are looking for comfort reading, a bit of predictability can feel cozy.But this book isn't just predictable, it's lifeless. I didn't sense any enjoyment on the part of the author in conveying this story. Rather, I kept thinking, \\"Why did she bother? Doesn't she already have enough money?\\"I never got a sense of either main character. I never got a sense of the villain, either. I kept waiting for a scene that would let me *see* who these characters were -- see their facial features, their eyes, their attire. That scene never came. I felt cheated. I wondered if the author just forgot, or decided that readers didn't care? I cared.I'm not a big reader of romance novels -- the first one I ever read was Amanda Quick's \\"Paid Companion.\\" I found that book funny, smart, engaging, with just enough substance under the fun, and a real page turner.I read a couple of more novels by Quick, and, while they were fun, neither was as good as \\"Paid Companion.\\" But they had enough going for them that I wasn't sorry I'd picked them up.\\"The River Knows\\" was a real disappointment. I really can't remember anything positive that I'll take away from it, not a character I really liked, or hated, or an especially felicitious turn of phrase, or a particularly nifty plot complication."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"The River knows how ridiculously drab, typical, formula romance is? I've read this plot before--heroine murders in self defense and assumes another identity--and in the right author's hand the story line can be interesting and entertaining. Not happenin' here.The \\"River Knows\\" was a so-what, who really cares, boring mystery, easily-solved, lack-luster semi-romance novel. I couldn't wait for it to end. Could not care about either the heroine or the hero. Or anyone in the book for that matter. The writing was quite horrible actually, nothing intriguing or engaging at all.If you like Amanda Quick, and feel compelled to read this don't waste your money. Library is the way to go. I also suggest that you should read the other 2- and 1-star reviews here. Those reviews are right on target."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Not quite as good as some of the other Quick historical but still much better than most.I would have appreciated more character development. The story was a little weak in the jump from the prologue to the main story."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"This was an excellent Amanda Quick novel. Full of Intrigue and suspense. The novel with Louisa out to expose Hastings and of course Anthony to find out who killed his fiancee Fiona. There's chemistry between these two. But also deep secrets also. I won't say anymore but to say read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Amanada Quick (JAK) has created another excellent tale of romance and suspense. The characters are interesting (as always) and the storyline is well written. It is formulatic in many ways (as so many of Krentz's books are) but I don't think that detracts from enjoyment of the book.I highly recommend this book for those who love the earlier books by Quick, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"There is no suspense, Amanda quick-ly lets us know who the murderer is. Beyond that, the book is padded and padded and padded with extraneous info. I would rate it \\"I hate it,\\" but the sex scenes are more true-to-life than most."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"How refreshing to read a Quick novel set in some time other than Regency. And with no Arcane or Zaruthian societies in evidence. Just a lovely romance set in Victorian times.TRK reminds me of earlier works by Ms. Quick. One of the things I've always enjoyed about her books is the h/h against the sceptical world around them. They keep their heads while everyone else is losing theirs. (stolen from Rudyard Kipling)There are very few authors whose books I will buy in hardcover. Ms. Quick/Krentz is one of those. Then, I have to buy it again when the paperback version comes out. So, I'm very careful about which hardcovers I lay my money out on."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Though this is a romance, shaken with a light dressing of mystery, there are some very serious topics tackled herein.First off is the absolute inability of a woman in Victorian times to control her destiny. Employment opportunities for women were few and far between, and even honest employment could lead to very dangerous situations for a woman alone.Also, this book directly addresses how justice was very different for the gentry than for the non-gentry. Even one with money was not as important as one of the right birth. And if a gentleman was suspected of wrongdoing, he could refuse to answer police questioning. Forget about warrants!We've come a long way, baby.Beyond all this, though, the book contains a wonderful romp. Louisa Bryce is an intrepid Lois Lane for a dime rag. She uncovers the wrongdoings of the \\"polite\\" world for all to see. She has her own secrets, however. Anthony Stalbridge is the bad-boy gentleman who, despite her unpromising plumage, becomes quite taken with Louisa. Together they solve a relatively complex mystery (which, at the end, you see pieces of have been cleverly alluded to all through the book, right from the prologue on down!)There is evil, there is tension, and of course there is sex, but it is not horribly graphic, is relatively short in duration, and is easily skimmed without missing too much book. There is even a huge amount dedicated to tongue-in-cheek making fun of illicit passion in \\"ladies' novels\\".I really, really enjoyed this book.(*)>"},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Louisa Bryce was never the life of the party. Supposedly a distant relative of the respectable Lady Ashton, Louisa stays invisible by being dowdy--and serves as an investigative reporter, reporting on scandals in 'society' in Victorian England. She's hot on the trail of a rumor that a respected gentleman is actually part owner of a notorious brothel when she runs into someone else investigating--a man who just might be a jewel thief. She and Anthony Stalbridge form an alliance--they'll pool their knowledge to learn the secrets that both of them need.What starts out as strictly a business arrangement takes a turn toward the sensual when Louisa and Anthony are forced to rely on an ancient device to escape detection--they pretend to be lovers, kissing. But pretend kissing has a way of turning into real kissing. Unfortunately, Louisa has a secret that she knows will ever keep her from finding love and marriage--and everyone knows an illicit relationship can only lead to an unhappy ending.Although Louisa is certain their relationship is doomed, the investigation goes well. Louisa's evidence is only the beginning of the evils Mr. Hastings has undertaken. He's certainly conducting blackmail. Could he also be guilty of murder--including, perhaps, the murder of Anthony's ex-fiancee?Author Amanda Quick writes an engaging story with a light touch. Neither Louisa nor Anthony is a particularly complicated character, but their clever dialogue, the cute misunderstandings, and a nice mystery with just enough twists to keep the reader involved add up to an enjoyable novel. THE RIVER KNOWS is summer-beach reading, but it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that and we all need a nice desert from time to time."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I think Amanda Quick is in dire need of a new muse. I don't know why I even bothered wasting my money on this book---perhaps because I keep hoping she'll put out a book on par with her earlier work. I never realized that a plot line could be so straight and narrow....and boring! It was almost painful how easy it was to predict what was going to happen."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I've been on the fence for Amanda Quick for a few books, but I've fallen off now. I really wanted to like The River Knows, but it was a tedious read that I quit two chapters from the end. I flipped ahead to see if I was wrong about the resolution of events, and I wasn't. If you aren't bothered by Quick's overuse of certain words (sensation, transcendent) or her heroines faith in their own abilities (all evidence and actions to the contrary) you'll be fine with this one. I just couldn't suspend enough disbelief. Her heroine's earnestness grated on me - somehow she's survived poverty, assault, murder, etc and done it all without developing a shred of self protection or caution. See a stranger? Confront them! She's a reporter for the tabloids (sensation press) yet never thinks to investigate her own past. She runs from it without looking back, yet reenters society and exposes other people's crimes. Not big on the introspection. He's obsessed with proving his ex-fiance was murdered, despite not having loved her. Because if he loved her, he'd have some depth to him instead of the one note here. Sees heroine, wants heroine, everything the heroine does is nifty keen. The bad guys are so, so bad. The good guys are so, so earnest. The heroine enjoys giving a good lecture. And (of course!) is disappointed in their first sexual experience but chalks it up to 'being wrong' so the hero can 'rise to the occasion' and she can be amazed. I tried to care about any of them and I just didn't. The highlight of the book is the tour the hero takes of the heroine's crime scene. While his smugness grates, the tour guide was the most realistic and interesting person in the novel."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Although I love Amanda Quick and have read all of her books, this plot was a bit more improbable than her usual. The pacing was a bit slower than usual as well, but it is still a good read and her characters continue to entertain."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"There were a few things that bothered me about The River Knows. First the story just seemed to grope along at a snail's pace. I didn't find to many parts in the story that kept me in suspense, which is unusual for Amanda Quick. She always seemed to have knack for blending, suspense, romance and humor with characters that you enjoy. I've always enjoyed Amanda Quick and normally the heroine is strong, with a mysterious flare, but this book sort of let me down. But despite these criticisms, I still thought the book was a worthwhile read and I'll continue to buy her books."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"Amanda Quick is the kind of hit-or-miss author for me. Either I love her stories from the very first page, or I just instantly know I won't be interested enough to finish it.Thankfully, this one was a delight from beginning to end. Very much like Mischief was. When Quick gets it right, boy, she gets it VERY right. Her heroines are all so very independent, self-suficient and practical about things, they are very fresh sights for sore eyes in the middle of the sea of too-young and too-silly heroines we usually find in historical romances. No, her heroines are in their middle-twenties, they are generally alone in the world and just have to be clever enough to survive in a world where women are nothing without a man to stand beside them. Or in front of them.When women found themselves alone and without means during that time, they were expected to do anything, ANYTHING, mind you, be it becoming a governess, a companion or even a prostitute, anything BUT go into trade. And that was what our heroine did. At least in the beginning of the book. Before she killed a man who was trying to rape and kill her. After that she was forced to fake suicide, and sometime later managed to reapper in Society as a widow called Louisa. She also managed to attract the eye of gentleman Anthony Stalbridge. But that was not all she managed to attract... now there's a killer on the loose and what started with the investigation of a couple of crimes soon becomes three, then four... and, if she is not careful enough, her murder might be next on the list.Quick's heroes are always very likeable as well. They are the first ones to notice how much they care about the heroines, and then have to convince them to be with them. It's most unusual and diverting. Yes, Quick is very good with influencing her readers to use new/more 'archaic' vocab. :PI loved Anthony and Louisa and their misadventures. I could almost feel their chemistry, they were so good together. Too bad Miss Quick isn't much of a fan for steamy scenes, because they sure would have been great at one of those. LOL!!! Anthony's family were delightful as well. Very unconventional, like most of her characters.That is the perfect word to describe Quick's books: 'unconventional'. That and 'unexpected'.If you like books like that with strong, proud heroines and amazing, heart-warming heroes, then Quick is the author for you."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I love most of Amanda Quick books. This was one of my favorites. Their all similar but I really liked the hero and heroine in this one."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"I wish that writers would not call their books Romance novels if they are going to leave out the romance. The hero and heroine in this book have all the romantic excitement of Ozzie and Harriet. The interesting thing is, I liked them both, but Amanda simply did not make them the least bit romantically appealing. I don't mind enduring repetitive plots in her stories because some of her secondary characters are absolutely great, and in this story, some of them were more exciting than the leading couple. In fact, I don't even remember the lady's name. I think the hero's name was Anthony. If you're happy with a story in which the leading lady could easily have been a young and gabby, prim and proper Agatha Christie, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you're expecting romance, find yourself something else to read. That's what I had to do because I couldn't finish this one."},{"Title":"The River Knows","review":"\\"It's ok\\" defintely describes how I felt about The River Knows. After reading the sample chapter, I was greatly anticipating reading the full story, and promptly signed myself up on the request list at the library. Who doesn't want to read a thriller where the heroine fakes her own death?Sadly, while several exciting and suspenseful elements are introduced throughout the novel, none of these elements are developed to their full potential, leaving this reader with a sense of letdown once I finally finished the book. As the villian is introduced, he truly seems like quite the scoundrel, yet he never seems to fully come alive as an evil man; the surprise second villian, who makes an unexpected appearance 3/4 of the way through the book leads the plot on an interesting twist, but again, Quick introduces this character and just sort of lets him dangle along without any real development.Even with the love story, Anthony and Louisa just seem to roll along. Oh sure, there are a few obstacles placed in their path, but neither has any real emotional hang-up to overcome, and even the faked death - the thrilling beginning of the story! - is merely passed over, almost as an afterthought.The story did keep me engrossed, sort of, but did not leave me wanting more. Not my favorite Quick novel, and while I didn't hate it, I wouldn't recommend it to fellow readers."},{"Title":"Glenn Head's Avenue D","review":"I loved the book! Sanders is a gifted writer and I love evrething he writes about. Dora is a funny and a loveable character- It's great to finally read about a female heroine."},{"Title":"Glenn Head's Avenue D","review":"Lawrence Sanders ran the gamut in suspense detective prose. From the intellectual cop Delaney to the hip private eye McNally, Sanders was able to create memorable characters in highly entertaining novels.In \\"The Seventh Commandment\\" Dora Conti, a tough insurance scam hound is called in to investigate the death of a jeweler, Lewis Starrett. Starrett, stabbed in the back with a kitchen knife, is obviously a victim of foul play, but who did it? With millions at stake, there are abundant motives from numerous suspects.So when other characters in this drama of violence start getting killed one at a time, Dora plunges into a world with cobwebs of duplicity - A world where murder is cheap, and adultery, cheaper.In sync with his later novels, Sanders toned down the hard edge typical of suspense, eschewing action in favor of characterization. Dora, as the plump housewife, is unique in a genre populated by lithe men and slim women (Just watch the TV shows.)At times, the Seventh Commandment can seem reminiscent of his Timothy Files, however it vindicates itself with its enjoyable plot. This novel should make for some good evening reading."},{"Title":"Glenn Head's Avenue D","review":"This book was well written, despite its predictablity."},{"Title":"Glenn Head's Avenue D","review":"Great story and great characters.

The intricate family dynamics of the murdered man, interwoven with the potential romance of the two investigators, is further enhanced with humor. This reviewer liked and cared about the characters.

L. Davis, most notably the novel Winds of Morning and the beautifully executed short story, \\"The Homestead Orchard.\\" It was with pleasurable anticipation that I obtained Davis's prizewinning magnum opus.But this monstrosity totally surprised me. The rendering of Oregon's history and geography is too far removed from the truth for a novel that is supposed to be a fanciful tapestry of Oregon's history and geography--it's so fanciful as to merely annoy. The characters are not well-developed and are cartoonish. I can stand fantasy sequences (loved Dickens's Little Dorrit), but this endless ramble exhausted my patience. I kept waiting to reach the good part. I should have given up after the first 100 pages.H. L. Davis is a little-known and under-appreciated author whose works are not of even quality. Following is my list of his works that I've read, in order of my esteem from highest to lowest.1. The Homestead Orchard--Humorous, sad, joyous, beautifully crafted short story about a father and son.2. Old Man Isbell's Wife--Humorous short story3. Bench Squatters--short story about a single dad and his kids4. Flying Switch--action-packed hilarious short story5. Open Winter--sweet & realistic short story about moving a herd of horses6.

The Distant Music--saga-like novel of an Oregon family's generations10. Beulah Land--saga-like novel of America's westward movement11. All of Davis's essays--not profound but they reveal Davis's thinking12. The Kettle of Fire--a fictional legend that doesn't really work13. Honey in the Horn--spare yourself! Saga-like, overlong, random, Pulitzer-prize winning, historically inaccurate, pointlessTo access the short stories, get a copy of his Collected Essays and Short Stories, published by the University of Idaho Press. Even better, if you can find it at a reasonable price, buy a copy of Davis's short story collection, Team Bells Woke Me (currently the best Amazon Marketplace price is $19.21, but this gets you Bench Squatters, Flying Switch, and some other lesser pieces not in the Collected Essays and Short Stories)."},{"Title":"Honey in the Horn","review":"This book was impossible to put down.

This book did manage to do that for me though.Honey in the Horn takes place in the Pacific Northwest, when it was still half overrun by indigenous people and almost everyone in the area was transient. There was a lot of farming business, killing of people business and jail-breaking business. None of these topics are ones that I'm ever particularly interested in, but H.L.

This is a VERY funny book! And well done. Murphy, like many dogs and their humans had gotten into the habit of too many calories and too little exercise. To view the storyline as a case of \\"society's...reverence of appearance above all else\\" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with \\"humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting\\" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy! He's a dog: he lives to eat, sleep AND please his alpha dog, Cheryl. And Cheryl, like any good alpha dog (or parent, for that matter) is using positive discipline and proactive behavior to mold her protege into the best--and healthiest--dog he can be.My kids love this book!

Is it alright to force someone to exercise, or to threaten them with punishment if they don't? Do we want to perpetuate this society's fascination with and reverence of appearance above all else? How many of us were humiliated by forced exercise or dieting as children, and how do we feel about it now? Did it improve our relationship to food or exercise?

It was just a new job. You had to be careful. You had to use your brains. It was not a question of hatred. He had only seen the minister once : he had been pointed out to Raven as he walked down the new housing estate between the little lit Christmas trees--an old rather grubby man without any friends, who was said to love humanity. -Graham Greene, This Gun for HireRaven is a hired killer with a harelip. His profession and his deformity combine to give him a passion for privacy. But when he's hired to kill a socialist minister who's active in the peace movement and ends up also shooting an elderly woman from his household staff too, he's suddenly one of the most sought after men in England. And when the man who hired him, Mr. Cholmondeley, pays him off in counterfeit notes, he becomes an easy man to track. In addition, his strong sense of professional ethics lead him to try and find Cholmondeley and whoever's behind him, rather than simply hiding out.Through a circuitous set of circumstances, Raven is helped in his search by a young woman, Anne, whose boyfriend just happens to be the lead detective on his case. She recognizes how dangerous Raven is, but feels sorry for him and, with Europe sliding into war, thinks she can use him to strike back at the shadowy forces who wanted the peace loving minister dead.Though it lacks the universal moral tension of some of Greene's better work, this is an entertaining noir thriller. The plot depends on a few too many fortuitous twists, but if you take it in the spirit of say The 39 Steps or a Hitchcock movie, the implausabilities aren't unbearable. Perhaps the most interesting reading of the book is as a forecast of the central ethical dilemma of WWII. Think of Raven as the USSR and of Anne as the Allies. She accepts Raven out of sympathy for his physical and spiritual deformities and assumes that he, despite his amorality, can be twisted to serve her own noble purposes. In the end, a lot of folks die as a result of her naivet&eacute;.GRADE : B-"},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"This seems more to be a book of psychology than actions.

Admittedly, the book is hugely flawed - the plot becomes increasingly implausible; the dialogue is sometimes false; the characterisation, especially in the central relationship between Raven the runaway hitman and Anne, sometimes doesn't quite ring true. But there is so much that is excellent - the mixture of dusty, fish and chips realism with almost whimsical fantasy, precise detail clashing with a nightmare-world of physical grotesques; the brilliant control of language, in which a deliberately limited vocabulary is used to imprison characters in a social and implicitely metaphsical destiny. The first half is a superb, almost intolerably nerve-wracking, thriller, and the second, as Raven seeks revenge during a practice gas raid, is dottily surreal. The allusions to fairy tales, history , poetry, popular music, drama, philosophy etc. open the book from its generic base, and makes it infinitely richer than it first appears. It should be read anyway by anyone who loves the cinema of Jean-Pierre Melville, who based his masterpiece 'Le Samourai' on it. A flawed, yet fascinating work."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"Mine is clearly a minority opinion, but I think this novel is actually more complex and interesting than many other critics and readers do. I remember first reading it in a college British literature class and finding Greene's juxtaposition of a typical crime novel, the backdrop of international intrigue and the paranoia conspiracy of traitors everywhere, Raven's disfigurement, and what was for me a very moving relationship between Raven and Anne a wonderful and engaging read. I just reread it for a critical study I've been doing and, while I agree there are holes in the plot, I'm not sure they are anymore distracting than the series of coincidences that drive Brighton Rock. I read BR recently also, for the first time, and I see why critics rate it higher--the psycho-sexual pathology of Pinkie, the moral-religious issues of his \\"Roman\\" identity, but I have to say I find lonely Raven a more memorable character in many respects."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"On the face of it, A Gun For Sale by Graham Greene is a genre thriller, featuring a crime committed by a confessed and declared villain, followed by a police pursuit. In the hands of a great writer, however, even clich&eacute;s such as this can be transformed into thoroughly satisfying novels.First published in 1936, A Gun For Sale is set in a Europe over which war looms constantly and threateningly, casting a shadow of fear and even depression over all human interaction. Graham Greene appears to use this context to allow the book to make a significant, yet very subtle point, an assertion that conflicts, even grand conflicts like wars, are pursued by interests, instigated by an intention to profit. The grander the conflict, the greater the potential gain. As individuals vie for influence, prominence, control and dominance, so do societies, groups, companies, even countries. And some of the protagonists play dirty, rarely receiving the comeuppance of justice. When they do, we are gratified, sensing the same rightness that a happy ending might provoke.A Gun For Sale has several important characters, more than a review can list. Raven is the first we meet, the blackness of his name immediately suggesting a functionality for the plot, for he is the anti-hero, the hired gun who completes the bloody assignment in the book's first pages. Hare-lipped and ever resentful of his disfigurement, both physical and, as a result of a painful upbringing, psychological, he suggests a figure that the reader might be invited to despise, perhaps a pantomime bogeyman of genre fiction, always accompanied by a threatening, trademark fanfare.But Graham Greene is not that mundane a writer. We eventually come to know Raven well. Though we are never actually invited to like him, we eventually sympathise with his plight, if only by virtue of the fact that there are some apparent social heroes who in reality are a darned sight more deserving of our contempt. Raven is double-crossed and sets out to track down the perpetrator of his humiliation.Raven leaves a trail and a policeman, Mather, takes up the pursuit. By chance Mather's girlfriend, Anne, boards the same train as Raven from London to Nottwich, an industrial town were she will appear in the chorus line of a pantomime. Raven and Anne meet and, viewed from the distance of the pursuer, become accomplices.Mather's fellow copper, Sanders, is an interesting foil to Raven. Both are disfigured. Raven's problem is with appearance and he yearns to be rid of the hare-lip that disfigures his face, a disfigurement that Anne plays down, thus engendering his trust. The policeman Sanders, on the other hand, stammers. He is quick of wit, but not of voice, and is aware that his impediment has cost him promotion.Mr Davis, also known as Cholmondley, amongst other things, is the greasy lackey employed by Sir Marcus. The latter is an industrialist, owner of a steelworks in Nottwich, a business that has seen better times. Mr Davis is a right cad, regarding theatre girls as fair game, regularly picking them up and persuading them into the grubby room he rents from a truly surreal couple in order to protect his reputation. The freemason Sir Marcus is barely clinging to life, but he retains sufficient pride, or malice, perhaps, to inflict untold suffering on others, merely to retain his own status in a future he does not have.And so Raven pursues Cholmondley, who answers to Marcus. Mather and Saunders pursue Raven, and Anne seems to be on everyone's side. And it all works out.But Graham Greene does much more than tell a tale. Through simple language and structure, and via a plot that would grace a b-movie at best, he penetrates his characters' psyches, locates them in social class and history, and manages with a deft lightness of touch to convey a remarkably strong sense of place, setting and context. Through his simply constructed prose, we see people, places and events from a multiplicity of perspectives and are left with a complexity of associations with every character. And that, precisely, is why clich&eacute; is left far behind."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"A Gun for Hire is a noir set in the dark decade of the 1930s. Most of the action occurs in the English Midlands in the fictional city of Nottwich (based on Nottingham where Greene had worked for a short time as a newspaper reporter).The Plot: Jimmy Raven is a murderer. As the novel begins he has just murdered of the British Minister of War and an elderly secretary. He is paid for his crime by receiving banknotes which have been stolen and traced by the authorities. The chief detective on the case is a man named Mather. His girlfriend is held at gunpoint by Raven. Her name is Anne. She is the most well drawn of the characters. Anne sympathizes with Raven who has seen his father hanged and a tough life in the London slums. The story is sometimes convoluted and the characters can be hard to follow in their actions. The best part of the book is the descrption of low class in pre-World War II England."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"On the very first page of what he called \\"An Entertainment,\\" in sparse, simple language, Graham Greene provides us with all we need to know about \\"Raven\\" who is \\"A Gun for Sale\\" and not just one particular \\"gun for sale\\" as erroneously implied in the American edition's title of \\"This Gun for Hire.\\" For Raven is any gun for sale and every gun for sale; any man and every man who, as Mephistopheles says of Faust, \\"...nennt's Vernunft und braucht's allein. Nur tierischer als jedes Tier zu sein.\\" Raven has a highly developed reasoning power, but he has lost the God-given power of feeling. Indeed, Raven's own name is all we really need to know; totally devoid of human feeling, Raven stalks and kills his prey in a cold, calculating manner. He is part man, but without feeling, he is more animal-like than any animal.This is no mere \\"entertainment,\\" though it is definitely entertaining. This is the story of an animal-like creature that becomes a man, the opposite of what happened to Gregor Samsa in \\"Die Verwandlung.\\" Yet the story of Samsa and that of Raven are the same. Both Samsa and Raven are, in the end, Christ-like figures who are transformed to another state of being and achieve redemption and the possibility of eternal life in death; in Raven's story, it is the transforming power of the love of another human being that brings the possibility of eternal life. The moral of this \\"entertainment\\" (and Greene was definitely a \\"moral\\" writer) is that we humans can achieve the same transformation and possibility of eternal life only through the God-like power of the love of our fellow human beings."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"A Gun for Sale, by Grahame GreeneRaven was a hired killer. His harelip made him easily identifiable, so he left no witnesses. [Some sort of psychological motivation?] A letter of introduction gets him admitted, and he leaves a piece of paper as \\"evidence\\". The police are searching for any clue to this murder. Raven meets Chumley and gets his payment in 5 notes (nothing smaller?). But this was stolen money and police are looking for Raven. A double cross! Raven will get his revenge by following Chumley to get to the men at the top. There are some amazing coincidences in this story. Raven meets Anne, Anne meets Chumley, Anne talks too much. Anne's boyfriend is one of the policemen looking for Raven.There is a psychological discussion in the dark train shed. [It is not as long as in \\"The Ministry of Fear\\" and is supposed to explain motivation. Does it?] The gas mask drill sounds like some kind of perverse holiday. But it allows Raven to enter the corporate headquarters with Chumley and get Sir Marcus, the evil old man who caused it all. The last chapter ties up the loose ends in telling more about the characters in this story. The solution to the assassination averted a war - for now.It seems implausible for Sir Marcus to use one of his flunkeys to arrange a murder directly. Usually they would use an intermediate who has no backtrail to the guys at the top; a cut-out agent. (See the James Bond films for examples.) This is a good story, even if it quite implausible for Raven to travel abroad for the murder as if he were a \\"James Bond\\". [This was titled in America as \\"This Gun For Hire\\".]"},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"\\"A GUN FOR SALE,\\" is an early-career British crime drama/thriller by much honored twentieth century English author/screen writer Graham Greene (The Third Man,The End Of The Affair). It is, I believe, the title given to Greene'sThis Gun for Hire, (1936) in America. The book is set in England, a country then unhappily anticipating the start of World War II.The protagonist/anti-hero of GUN is Christian Raven, an extremely unfortunate young man who was born to poor parents who didn't much care for him, who both proceeded to die in his youth - his mother committing suicide at the kitchen table, leaving her body for her son to find. So he is sent to an orphanage, where, of course, he isn't treated well, either. In addition, he was born with a harelip that has been poorly mended, and he is ugly. He is, willy-nilly, a loner, who doesn't care for or trust other people, particularly women, whom he calls \\"skirts,\\" and with whom he has little experience. He does, however, find it easy enough to use a gun and kill people, and has done so.As the book opens, Raven is on the European continent, killing an old man who is minister of defense of some unnamed small country. Raven is executing this hit at the bidding of a man who calls himself Mr. Cholmondelay (pronounced Chumley), who will later betray the young man by giving him marked bills in payment for the job. Raven does some investigation, and follows his betrayer to a midland town Greene called Nottwich, where the young killer discovers the man who hired him is actually named Davis and works for the town's largest employer, Midland Steel. And the corporation, at the direction of Sir Marcus, its owner, has ordered this assassination in hopes of starting World War II, similarly to the way World War I was started. Along the way, Raven will meet a pretty actress, Anne Crowder, whom he tries to trust, as she helps him somewhat. But she is actually naively trying to prevent the outbreak of WWII; and she is engaged to Jimmy Mathers, superintendent at Scotland Yard.Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave usThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics), andOur Man in Havana (Penguin Classics)among others. These four books mentioned, as many others of Greene's prolific works, were made into notable films. So wasThis Gun For Hire (Universal Noir Collection), a popular noir film starring Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Robert Preston and Laird Cregar.The author's books were very well-written, highly literate; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership, frequently being best sellers. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created vivid characters with internal lives; they faced struggles and doubt. Sometimes his characters despaired, or suffered world-weary cynicism - they were always self-aware. But Greene, who also worked as a screenwriter, always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. However, if you've never read him before, I wouldn't recommend starting here. It's one of the grimmest of his books, also hard to find. Might as well start with something more entertaining, likeThe Comedians (Penguin Classics), orTravels with My Aunt (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"\\"A Gun for Sale\\" is a study like a nested Russian Doll: of duality, of an evil act, of revenge, of abuse, of evil visited upon you and created by you. It is most comparable with Conrad's \\"Secret Sharer\\" and is obviously a major influence on Le Carre's \\"Smiley's People.\\"The plot follows assassin Raven who is like the Peter Lorre character in \\"M\\": a misshapen monster driven by a perverse need. But Greene's thesis with Raven is some characters extend sympathy to him because of his inalible humanity. Following his latest assassination of a top political figure who is the key to a major decision to go to war, Raven is befriended by Anne, engaged to Police detective Mather, who has been given the case of hunting for Raven. Anne is sympathetic to Raven on the surface, but narrates her own internal doubts when he kidnaps her as a shield. She is torn not so much in her attachments as in her offering of her charity to Raven, a stark contrast to her fidelity to her straight ahead law-and-order black and white fianc&eacute;e Mather. Raven's dark complexity attracts her dormant need to shed a little light and make the world incrementally better as Europe is hunched on the brink of chaos and war.Perhaps the most overlooked and subtlest of themes is that for the first time Greene introduces a shadowy conspiracy that smacks of Judeo-Masonic proportions. Thankfully it is only a literary device and not some full-on paranoid screed, but it is subtly there nonetheless. An industrialist of obscure background and immense power is reveled to be the money behind the political assassination, and Raven is on his trail as he chases the reprobates' bagman back to his lair to seek revenge for his being cheated on his fee. The Svengali then moves all his pieces against Raven, which includes corrupt politicians, the Masonic lodge members, and local police: but in an attempt to silence Raven and hide the conspiracy rather than a reversal of his decision to assassinate an old fiend. War is lucrative for his industry.The setting is England's (then) bleak industrial north, and Greene does not hesitate to use fog, smoke, clouds, rain, and the incessant dreary grays of the entire landscape to color his narrative as occurring at a twilight between good and evil.Greene's prose is lean, his descriptions are sketches that reveal worlds, and his characters are rich from only snatches of dialogue, small gestures, and descriptions of their superficially banal inner reflections. The sort of reflections anyone goes through on a daily basis. But it is from this thin tapestry that a world of moral choice is created and we shudder as we see ourselves in the mirror. True literature.A major masterpiece disguised as genre, not a minor novel at all."},{"Title":"A GUN FOR SALE","review":"The author He is right in calling this book an enterteiment.

Plot and characterization are thin, but the dialogue is fascinating to a 21st Century American reader, and so is the detailed portrait of ordinary English life in the '30s with its train travel, telephone boxes, and pre-Sexual Revolution view of men and women. A glossary would be a real help, also, since Greene writes in period British slang. The book would be informative reading for students specializing in mid-20th Century cultural history, since it presents a vivid eyewitness report on a vanished world.As a mystery, this book would merit two stars. As social history, it's a five. A careful reader can see hints of the mature Graham Greene in the detailed street-level descriptions of city life and in the sense of impending moral doom. If you're just getting acquainted with this author, read The Power and the Glory or The Heart of the Matter first, then go to this one to see how a good writer developed into a great one."},{"Title":"Kate Caterina: A Novel","review":"When I first saw &#65533;Kate Caterina&#65533; at my local bookstore I wanted to read it immediately. I was intrigued by the title and drawn by the cover art. I went home to check the ratings here in Amazon, and was shocked to find that there were no customer comments for this book. That increased my resolve to start reading as I&#65533;ve frequently been disappointed by what passes as best selling. I very much enjoyed this book.Here are some thoughts that perhaps some other readers can embellish.As the book commences, we feel anxiety building&#65533;in a smaller sense for the impending wedding of Esmeralda D&#65533;Alessandria but in a larger sense for the looming possibility of WWII. Several allusions of fear and anger creeping up as &#65533;waves&#65533; and &#65533;cats paws&#65533;&#65533;I love the descriptions of Kate&#65533;her harvest-coloured hair and dark eyes, her strong build but tentative nature, her doubleness and dividedness as she calls it&#65533;and of Esmeralda&#65533;she is fireworks, volatile, beautiful. Through the story we see Kate develop strength and we see Esmeralda move from boredom to purposeful action.Kate and her mother in law share some similar experiences&#65533;both more or less shed off their old self and are born anew. They change their names as they assimilate to their new culture. Kate taking on the name Kate Caterina and finally accepting herself as Caterina (&#65533;Kate Fenn died long ago&#65533;) and Sonya dropping her original first name of Hildegard and using the possibly Italian Sonya&#65533;(&#65533;She was German&#65533;). Sonya and Kate were both from enemy countries, which further endangers them and their children.The book addresses what people (and dogs on one occasion) will do to protect their loved ones (both their family and country). Luigi is haunted by the Fascist oath taken to secure his job as a university professor. He returns from WWI changed by the horrors he witnesses. He is not close to his children and drifts from his wife. He can no longer live in lies and unconsciously resolves to live in Ca&#65533;Santa Chiara. This escape to the &#65533;green world&#65533; offers him time to reflect on his personal failures and those of the Italian people. Luigi finds his way to help his community...in a manner that highlights the absurdity of the times. His son Gabriele sacrifices his career as a doctor and also his marriage by joining the partisans to fight for his country. Kate and Luigi also court influential members of the Fascist regime attempting to secure Gabriele&#65533;s release.I must not forget to mention Gaetano DaDurante who seems to be everpresent and most loveable. Everyone's favorite \\"uncle\\" and best friend. \\"Lover of paintings and of and women\\".The book is rich with detail which will slow some readers but is well worth it. A minor disappointment: I was hoping for more Italian expressions incorporated into the pages (as cleverly done by Jeff Shapiro in Renato&#65533;s Luck) although I did pick up on the name \\"Ca'Santa Chiara\\" which I would translate as House of the Holy Light. Readers should consider this artful allusion to the painters' chiaroscuro technique of using light and dark. Clearness and light opposing obscureness and darkness as evidenced in the settings (indoors and environmental), characters (via their expressions and clothing) and theme (which character(s)are illuminated or enlightened throughout this book?).Books I also recommend:The Old Gringo, Carlos FeuntesNo Great Mischief, Alistair MacLeodThe Farming of Bones, Edwidge DanticatBel Canto, Ann PatchettThe Samurai&#65533;s Garden, Gail Tsukiyama"},{"Title":"Great Twentieth-Century Violin Concertos in Full Score (Dover Music Scores)","review":"This excellent set of scores, published by Dover, brings Dover's consummate work at a reasonable price. The editors do a marvelous job of staying true to the original text from which their reprints are derived. The print is clear, and the staves are nice and distinct. (The only concern maybe that too much erasing could permanently wipe off the ink on the page.) Instruments are clearly labled and numberings of key pts. in the concerti help a lot. I highly recommend this book to any music enthusiast, and especially to all violinists who are playing, or will play, any of these great violin concerti."},{"Title":"Speaking Chinese in China (Yale Language Series)","review":"This text is an excellent second year book. It concentrates on using sentences is a variety of situations. However, it is not a stand alone work. The publication was apparently meant to supplement first year learning materials. And in that effort is suceeds admirably. The format includes a main dialog, substitutions, mini dialogs and cultural notes. And the course is designed with enough repetition to make retention easy. Although the book covers twenty chapters and six cassettes, I still found myself wanting more. In fact I have found that most Chinese language courses are not all-inclusive. They require supplemental material. And this course is no exception. But unlike other texts, it does not pretend to be the only course you will ever need. In any case, this makes a fine addition to any Chinese language learning library."},{"Title":"No Adam in Eden (POCKET CARDINAL Edition 75002)","review":"I attended a presentation on Grace and her early years growing up in Manchester, NH. The lecturer mentioned other books that she had written and I was particularly interested in this one. It is excellent! Now, I plan to read her other books. This book is almost an autobiography of her life and female ancestors. Although fiction, like Peyton Place, it is historical fiction depicting true life events."},{"Title":"No Adam in Eden (POCKET CARDINAL Edition 75002)","review":"No Adam in EdenI read that this book was not received well at the time of publication but in fact I thought it was excellent. Held my interest throughout. Found that it is more autobiographical than fiction after reading about Ms. Metalious."},{"Title":"No Adam in Eden (POCKET CARDINAL Edition 75002)","review":"But in a way, it is similar. Beginning in Canada, and moving down to NH (if I remember correctly), the main characters each have their say. It begins with a husband, who to deal with a wife who won't sleep with him, becomes an alcoholic. He dies from this, thus leaving his beloved daughter to be raised by her cleanliness-obsessed mother. It's interesting the way she describes him: keeping a bottle under his bed, and throwing up every morning. Metalious died a year after this book was published, of cirrhosis of the liver.Almost everyone in the book is mean and out for number one. You think the final character has perhaps won out, but then her husband has to actually speak, and he's childish and disgusting."},{"Title":"No Adam in Eden (POCKET CARDINAL Edition 75002)","review":"Angelique was small, blonde, passionate-and as capable of love as a hooded cobra. She learned sexual blackmail at her mother's knee, and before she was through she bit off more of the apple than any woman since Eve.It is doubtful that there exists in all fiction a more intriguing character-in spite of her sexual aberrations, her innate selfishness and cruelty, her all but psychotic belief that she was something very special and thus excused from the normal mores of decency and honesty.\\"Paradise\\" she said, \\"I'll tell you what paradise is-it's having what you want all the time. I don't need any one man for that!\\""},{"Title":"Much More Than Counting: More Whole Math Activities for Preschool and Kindergarten","review":"I am using this book to help introduce preschool math concepts to my two at home. It has great ideas that are easily adaptable so that you can use items around the house. The authors provide lots of activities that help introduce concepts like patterning, one to one correspondance, addition and subtraction through play. They also provide a list of what to look for as the child plays and questions to get the child thinking about math. This is the best preschool math resource I have found thus far. Just reading through it helps provide the frame of mind to recognize opportunities to teach math to this age group. I am extremely pleased!"},{"Title":"Much More Than Counting: More Whole Math Activities for Preschool and Kindergarten","review":"This book is an excellent source of information if you have preschool age children in your house or class.

It really is a neat and great book.I have shared with my fellow employees and we all love it and use it often for our classrooms.cool book"},{"Title":"Much More Than Counting: More Whole Math Activities for Preschool and Kindergarten","review":"The book \\"Much more than counting\\" - is in fact NOT much more than counting.It is another pseudo pedagocial workbook that preys on parents' fears that they might miss out on some important developmental window for their kids. But this book is utterly unnecessary. It just contains simple ideas for counting and measuring and manages to blow them up into immensely elaborate project pieces which require moms and grandparents to wield glue and scissors and create \\"cute\\" contraptions before you even can get started.Every pre-schooler can learn more and better if you let them count buttons and coins for a while. And it is so easy to invent little stories like: \\"Each bird eats two seeds. And then their stomachs are full. So there are three birds sitting on the tree behind our house. How many seeds will you have to put out on our patio that all of them can eat to their heart's content?\\"Every parent with average education will have about 20 x the creativity of this book. Save the money."},{"Title":"Dark One","review":"From the moment I picked up the book, I developed an empathy for the main character, Roger. As he traveled in a strange land, making new friends and overcoming new chalenges, I found myself getting more and more involved with all the characters.Without wanting to give any of the plot away, I actually cried when one of the people in the book died.I found myself laughing, crying, and my heart beating faster as I read this epic.I hope there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"Singular Trajectories and their Role in Control Theory (Mathmatiques et Applications)","review":"It is a complete book, deals with one the important subjects forbut in modern control theory, with very recent matematicals tecnics, requires something of experience in algebras of sub- riemman and disciplines when reading it, suitable for students of first year in its Phd."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"This is one of the early Perry Mason novels, which speaks only to trivia, not quality, as I feel the entire series of mysteries, written over decades, is of very even and high quality throughout.As in virtually all Perry Mason mysteries, the reader is presented with a \\"fair\\" mystery, in that you as the reader get all the clues at the same time Perry Mason does. However, you may come to very different conclusions, or none at all, if you cannot put the clues in the context that Gardner does when Mason solves the crime.Here we start out with a very complicated set of situations, as Mason is approached by a man whose wife ran off with another man. But this isn't the first story Mason gets, as the client first complains about a howling dog next door. We soon discover that the dog may have had a good \\"dog reason\\" for his howling, but if that is so, then why did it abruptly stop? Then Mason's client disappears. Things only get more complicated from there to the very end.The TV show version of this book changed a few things around, but overall was remarkably close to the plot of the novel, which I always find to be entertaining. No question, I'm a Perry Mason junkie. However, I try to indulge my habit in small doses, three or four books a year, so that I don't overdose on them and lose my enthusiasm. For anyone already a Perry Mason fan, or for those who enjoy the old style mysteries where you have a good chance to solve it as you read, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"The Case of the Howling Dog, by Erle Stanley GardnerArthur Cartwright visits Perry Mason to see about a dog and a will. Perry explains what makes a will valid in their state. Cartwright hates to hear a howling dog because it means death in the neighborhood. Perry explains how he will avoid a malicious prosecution suit: they will see a deputy district attorney to issue a warning (Chapter I). Clinton Foley, the neighbor, visits the deputy DA and charges that Cartwright is mentally deranged; Foley's dog doesn't howl. Deputy Sheriff Pemberton will personally investigate this conflict (Chapter III). The housekeeper and cook say the police dog Prince didn't make noise. But Foley finds a note - his wife has run away with Cartwright (Chapter IV)! Cartwright left home last night and never returned (Chapter V). Perry orders Paul Drake to investigate Foley and Cartwright; he suspects there is something going on (Chapter VI). Paul Drake reports on the identity of Foley and his wife - shocking news (Chapter VII)! Perry calls Foley to discuss the situation at a 9 pm meeting.When Perry arrives at Foley's home he finds the dog dead, and Foley's body. He calls the police (Chapter VIII). Sergeant Holcomb questions Perry about his appointment. Perry points out that his lack of an alibi shows he had no foreknowledge. A perfect alibi should be suspicious (Chapter IX). Paul Drake's menlocate the taxi driver who brought a visitor to Foley's home earlier (Chapter XI). When they locate Bessie Forbes, Perry visits her and gives her advice (Chapter XII). Perry retrieves a handkerchief, and call Sergeant Holcomb to turn it in as the owner visited Foley's home around the time of his death (Chapter XIII). Perry's clever misdirection points to the Breedmont Hotel.Perry confers with Bessie Forbes and hears her story. Perry tells he she can't afford to lie about her call on Foley, and can't afford to tell the truth. Bessiemust not answer any questions unless her lawyer is present. The police show up next to arrest Bessie, and warn her that anything she says can be used against her (the \\"Miranda warning\\" in 1934). Della and Perry discuss the case (Chapter XV). Perry explains that a defense lawyer presents the facts in favor of the defendant against the powers of the state. Perry must strike at just the right time to free his client. First he must build up sympathy in the newspapers. Perry's case will depend on that howling dog! The police traced the gun to Bessie Forbes, bought over a year ago.Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate the alibi of Thelma Benton, Foley's housekeeper. Her hand is still bandaged from a dog bite. Perry uses a ruse toquestion her (Chapter XVI). The trial starts in Chapter XVII. Perry cross-examines the taxi driver who brought Bessie Forbes to the Foley home; he was coached by the district attorney. Perry plays another fast trick, skating on thin ice because he has to do it (Chapter XVIII). Perry explains the fickleness of the mass mind and how he will use it (Chapter XX). The cross-examination of Thelma Barton is interrupted with startling news! Perry argues for his client, and the jury returns with 'not guilty' in Chapter XXI. In the next chapter Perry explains it all, a happy ending; we learn why that dog didn't howl. Perry would not accept a dismissal; justice was served, not the letter of the law. The language reflects the manners of that time."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"This is the fourth Perry Mason books written in 1934 and I think it is one of the best. The story was very well plotted; at the beginning a strange and tense relationship between two couples attracted me; and the ending was surprising!
