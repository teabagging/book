Since then I went through QBVII, Armageddon, Trinity, The Haj and Mitla Pass. Trinity was a wonderful book, vintage Uris, which was way up there with his earlier novels. Redemption on the other hand is a book that just shouldn't have been written.I think the most shocking thing to me about Redemption was that Uris committed the cardinal sin of rewriting his own history from Trinity. At the end of Trinity, both Jeremy and Christopher Hubble were supposed to have died at the hands of the protagonist in what was a moving, tragic and highly ironic ending, worthy of a master storyteller and apt for a story about Ireland. This alone spoilt the novel for me - I kept checking my copy of Trinity to be sure that I read it right. The book is just wholly unsatisfying. All Uris did for about one third of the book was summarize Trinity, an exercise any average sixth grader would be quite capable of. It has a totally blaise and inappropriate ending and a plot without any main point to it. What could Rory do for Ireland? Kill the brigader and everything will magically become better? Tell me another one. Uris adds needless sexual overtones to his book throughout, I won't go into the details. Others have complained about his historical inaccuracy, and since my historical knowledge of Ireland is virtually zip, I won't go there.Redemption is not without its redeeming (if you pardon the pun) graces. Uris' portrayal of the battle at Gallipoli is vivid and very moving. The relationship between Rory and Liam is also well-written. If only he wouldn't go out of his way to put words in the mouth of his characters to support his primary thesis.... it becomes ridiculous after a while.My conclusion is this: go read Uris' older novels: all the ones I mentioned earlier (except mitla pass which was so-so) as well as Mila 18 and Topaz, which are on my must read list. Don't waste your time or money on Redemption but if you really must read Redemption after reading Trinity, start with low expectations, that's all. My advice is to stop at Trinity and not to spoil the plot for yourself by reading Redemption. Someone should really stop Uris from embarrassing his older works by writing some more, he seems to be pass his prime. I just wish he would prove me wrong."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"What a disappointment! Trinity is Uris's best work. When I heard about Redemtion's continuing Trinity's story, I was eager to read it. What a disappointment! Here's hoping Uris already is working on another great book to redeem himself from this debacle!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read Trinity 10 years ago and loved it. I picked up Redemption because I enjoyed Trinity so much and because I have read and thouroughly enjoyed every Leon Uris book I read. However, half way into Redemption I felt as if I had already read it (e.g., big wrought iron screens, firemen in Baltimore). I also thought there was enough good history to write about and that Mr. Uris' focus on torid sex was pandering to marketability rather than good writing. I wish he would take one more stab at Ireland and stick to the historical theme more -- there's a lot to tell,"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I had to write a review after I read all the other posted reviews. I read this book as a sequel to the author's first book and simply thought it was fantastic. In fact, I just ordered the two-book set for a wonderful Christmas present for a friend. Don't hesitate to read this book - it is great!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"After _Trinity_, one of Uris' best works, we are given his worst. It is almost as though he is having trouble remaining focused on the story; there are frequent flashbacks to the climactic passages in _Trinity_, usually for no apparent reason. Some stories gallop, some walk purposefully; _Redemption_ meanders aimlessly, retraces its steps, and bonks into trees.The only redeeming feature of the book is the description of Gallipoli, which is still a sore point in Australia and New Zealand and deserves comprehension and remembrance throughout the Western world. Unfortuately one must suffer through the rest of the book to get to the Gallipoli part, and unless you are extremely interested in that particular topic, this book is not time well spent.For an idea of what Uris has accomplished in the past, try _Topaz_ or _QB VII_ in addition to _Trinity_. Given the other great reading Uris has provided us, let's forgive him for this one."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Whenever I think of a Leon Uris novel, I think of big themes, large-scale action, a global perspective, and Tolstoy-like interweavings of characters. Redemption has them all.Those who believe in the redeeming qualities of love and seeking forgiveness will be delighted with this book. It explores those themes in a grand fashion.Most of those who read the book will agree that the descriptions of the now little-remembered Gallipoli campaign by the British against the Turks and Germans in World War I will be permanently etched in their memories as great war (and anti war) writing.Those who would like to know more about the development of freedom in Ireland will probably be a bit disappointed. The plot heavily veers away from that subject (although it is always present as a backdrop) for much of the book.The characters are not always as appealing as are required for a great novel. You will simply want to shake them and tell them to do what is right in many cases. I have never read a book that contains so many people who are stubborn about making their lives and those around them miserable.The book would have been improved by either a somewhat simpler plot or more editing to shorten its length.After you have finished reading the book, I suggest that you think about whether there is someone you love who you have not yet told. In this month of Valentine's Day, it would be a good time to overcome that reticence . . . that was so harmful to the characters in Redemption.Live with love in your heart!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"As most of the readers have stated, Trinity was a very good novel. It contained three-dimensional characters, solid writing, and considerable insight into the struggles of the Irish. Redemption pales in comparison. The part on Gallipoli is really good; the rest is essentially a rehash of Trinity. If you enjoyed the characters in Trinity and want to learn more about them, and can overlook some of the author's poetic license, read this book. Just don't expect to be challeged the way you were when reading Trinity."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"By the time I reached the end of this tedious tome, I didn't care about the characters or the war. I finished reading it as an act of discipline. I gave it one star only because there was no lower rating."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"A wonderful and once again epic book by Leon Uris. I have been a Leon Uris fan for more than 40 years. I have read this book twice already, and I will start the third time over within a year. Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Trinity is by far one of the best books of all time. Redemption keeps true to the origonal expanding on the story to the next generation. breath taking."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"If you ever read Trinity, but didn't get this yet. Do. If you haven't heard of either before start with Trinity then go straight into this..... Fabulous tale of life, love, loss and how world events shape nations and individuals alike."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I love historical novels. I did a lot of reading during the mid-90's and early-00's when I was travelling to and from Europe on business. I read most of Uris' novels then. I loved Trinity. My wife, of Irish decent, and I, of English decent, talk about it to this day. I'm retired now and love the time I have to read. I still love historical novels. I had not read Redemption, so when I found out about it I was eager to read it. Uris is a great story teller, more succinct than Michener, deeper than Follet, probably most like Edmund Rutherford and James Clavell. Uris has an ability to make his characters real and he weaves them through historical events that make the reader feel like they are there. Plus he has a unique ability to describe human pathos. I've been in war and understand fear, utter boredom, elation at surviving, and extreme sorrow at loosing a close comrade. Redemption was wonderful in that regard and Uris' descriptions of those feelings are accurate from my perspective. But Redemption is more than a war story or a people struggling with oppression. It is a story of an Irish family that struggled with the times and eventually found happiness. It is easy to read and hard to put down, but I don't believe it is a page turner. There are times when one needs to put the book down and think about what the story teller is conveying. I was sad when I finished Redemption, because, well, I wanted it to continue. That to me is the sign of a good book. Redemption taught me to go back to Uris and read his books again."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I had not read any Uris for years and Redemption reawakened my appreciation for this masters works. Coarse language is used only in appropriate places and it contributes to the realistic feelings of this entrancing book. Uris explains my feelings from Christchurch to Derry."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Although it's been quite some time since I read Trinity, I quickly remembered much of that novel when I began listening to an audio version of Redemption. I enjoyed learning more about the people, wars, politics, relationships, and struggles of the era, and yet quite honestly I often became a bit confused about which generation was being referred to or who was the mother of whom. Perhaps it's because I was listening instead of reading and hence couldn't flip back through the pages to reread passages. My auditory impression of this work is that it would be of special interest to those of Irish descent and to historians in general."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I would like to congratulate Mr. Uris on a job well. I first read Trinity and it was an awesome book, then I read Redemption later. They were both as good. I don't think it is fair, however, to judge a book when comparing it to another great book. If there was no Trinity (God forbid), and the story from Redemption stood alone, it would also be considered great like its prequel."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read Trinity first and then Redemption- not a week later. I loved Trinity so much that I thought it was great to read it again, only a little different. Redemption lives up to Trinity because that's basically what it is. And when the new material comes in, it gets even better. 5 stars all the way. -Franky McGuire"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"This was the greatest sequel I have ever experienced. Leon Uris is magnificent! This book kept me wanting more with every page I read. The sequel to Trinity was outstanding! Let us hope that Leon Uris will keep the epic novels of Ireland continuing - Redemption deserves ANOTHER sequel!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I've always been a big fan of Leon Uris and my only explanation for Redemption is that it cannot have been written by him! I literally felt like it was another author writing about the continuing saga of the Larkin family (the New Zealand branch) and the remaining Hubbles. The fact that Uris (?) contradicts his own previously written material is confusing and pointless. The characters appear shallow and the women are reduced to two-dimensional sex objects rather than the rich supporting figures they were in Trinity. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I loved Trinity. I was psyched to see there was a sequel. Man, the first 200 pages are disappointing. I like the review that said it was a long book report. That's exactly it. Just summary. Booo Leon Uris. You could have done so much more."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Great literature... perhaps not. As the the great nephew of an ANZAC killed on Gallipoli, and the grandson of his brother severely wounded in the assault on Hill 60, I feel that Uris brings more of the history and humanity of Gallipoli than any official record or contemporary history such as Pugsley's. He does for the ANZACs what 'Battle Cry' does for USMC.

This is a wonderful epic saga of the Larkin family. It spreads across about 25 years, and frrom Ireland, to New Zealand to Australia to Egypt. It also encompasses the First World War. We also see a young Winston Churchill who can almost single-handedly be blamed for the Gallipoli fiasco. This is a book that takes you by the throat and won't let go until you turn the final page. I think it is a true classic and is a fitting finish to the also truly wonderful \\"Trinity\\"."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"BORING in the biggest way possible!

If I had not received this book as a gift from loved ones who were watching me read it and waiting to see how much I enjoyed it, I would have put it down quickly.No, I would have put it far, far away or given it to a book sale.I'm a long-time Uris fan and I truly hope someone else wrote this awful waste of paper and merely stole Uris' good name.Let's hope the author and the publisher make some charitable contributions out of the money they make on the sale of this book because it ought to be good for something.Deliver us from any more like this one!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I don't understand WHY the author felt he had to rehash the Trinity story. I loved that book, and was looking forward to the creation of some other three dimensional, admirable characters. There are none in this book.

Or minus three."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"As other readers have noted, this book is not nearly the book Trinity is. Wish I hadn't read it, the first was so good.I guess that's the trouble with sequels."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I just read Trinity, then the sequel, Redemption. I plan on submitting this review for both novels.Trinity is an 800+ page saga about Ireland in the late 1800s early 1900s. It took me a good 100+ pages to get hooked on the book, but once hooked, I raced to finish it. I loved the description of Ireland, the religious conflicts, and the incredible characters. This book is great, read it now.Redemption was also an 800+ page novel, however, not as gripping as Trinity. The first 300+ pages covered plot that had been described in Trinity. For those readers who read Trinity years ago, this may be a bonus. For someone who had finished Trinity a day prior, I wasn't interested. The book gets a bit more exciting with the description of the war being fought which eventually leads back to Ireland. The book then, unfortunately, wimpers out with a quick, gift packaged ending. I am not sorry I read this book, because it brought a bit more closure on the Irish saga for me...however, Trinity is the more impressive novel."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Having read all Uris's books, I was eager to read &quot;Redemption&quot; when it came out. Yes, it was discouraging to realize that much of the book was a poor rehash of a brilliant &quot;Trinity,&quot; however, I was literally blown away by the account of the battle at Gallipoli. My grandfather fought there for the Anzacs, and my grandmother told me about his experience of waking up one morning and discovering one of his comrades, who had shared his sleeping bag to keep warm, shot dead. Now, my grandfather has been dead since 1959, but I felt like Uris had personally interviewed him for the book! Wow, does he do his homework, and in addition, he has given me an opportunity to know more about my grandfather than my grandmother could ever tell me. I never realized how miraculous my being here is, since so few made it through that battle. The book is definately well worth reading, and if you have never read &quot;Trinity&quot;, it is a must!"},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Written like an incredibly long, high school book report, a mere rehashing of the important events of &quot;Trinity&quot;. The book added no more dimension to and seemed bereft of any sympathy towards the characters - I found the characterizations to be flat and uninteresting. The dialogue was incredible and sophomoric - I mean, let's be frank - people getting together to plan the throwing off of the chains of 700 years of oppression aren't going to sit around a table at secret meetings, under cover of darkness, yammering things like, &quot;And forever, nothing of beauty has ever escaped his eye. No leaf, no sound, no drop of rain, no sweet word, no scent. He finds beauty in thunderheads and raging seas, and never a woman has he seen or touched did he not find beauty in. Along with his ravenous craving for knowledge and his fury against injustice, this man has gathered in beauty more fully than any human being I know....&quot; Puh-leeeze. Give me a break - no one talks like this. I am sorely disappointed in this poor attempt at a sequel, but I'll finish it because I'm hoping it gets better (or at least more realistic). I'm glad I read &quot;Trinity&quot; first, because I never would have after reading this."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"As a Uris fan and Trinity lover, I ran out to buy Redemption when it was released. What a letdown. It was a Trinity review with some Clancy-like battles that lasted forever. Never thought Uris would put out such nonsense to make a buck."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read Trinity a few years ago. An emotive book which captured the mood of the times and attitudes of the groups of people involved. A great book. I received the sequel, Redemption, as a gift. After reading roughly one third of the book, I conclude that I will only finish it as a duty to the giver. The 'new events' described in the book (Suddenly it transpires that Conor visited Hubble Manor as a child apprentice and argued with Caroline about who constructed the screen), the lack of historical accuracy being teeth-grinding and the fact that formerly incidental characters are fleshed out to an astonishly irritating degree, are bad enough. The above is only outdone by the author's extraordinary fixation with coupling between whichever characters appear on the page. In the absence of coupling, there is the constant preoccupation with coupling. We find Winston Churchill and Randolph Churchill falling asleep contemplating the breasts of Caroline Hubble. Is the author re-living his puberty?Aside from this, who actually cares what Atty Fitzpatrick did as a child? Are we interested in how Rory grew up, and although I have not forced myself to read that far into the book, I understand that following Conor's visit to New Zealand and instilling the love of Ireland in Rory, in order to get to Ireland, he joins what was nominally the British Army. Is there no end to credibility stretching nonsense? There are many other questions which cannot fit here. All in all, just a very tedious read."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I received Redemption as a gift, but noticed prior to reading it that Trinity was the first book in the series. So I read Trinity and loved it which made me excited to get to Redemption. What a let down. I can't understand how an author would follow up such a great book with something so awful. It was basically a review of Trinity with a little more detail...boring! Although, I'm glad I got to read Trinity. I hope Uris' other books are as good."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Conor Larkin was larger than 'LIFE', Rory Larkin (Landers) was just beginning his. The parallels between the two - father's driving them off to an uncertain future, leading men who could not, or would not, lead themselves, living a cause - Gallipoli and Ireland - they either believed or did out of dedication - are incredible. Agreed - the book treaded water in points but did add detail to those who read Trinity. If you picked up Redemption first some of the most amazing characters would have flown by as a name on a page - Tomas, Freddie Weed, Roger Hubble. The point - a good book, Gallipoli, the Easter rising, the brass of Atty and Caroline. The downside - I wish all 735 pages had been as new, fascinating, historically educational and riveting as Trinity's 900 pages were."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Hate to have to rip Leon Uris, but this book seemed like it was written just to quiet those people who clamored for a Trinity sequel. Either that, or he did it to make an easy buck. After reading this, you would swear he wrote the thing in about a week. The writing on Galipoli isn't bad and this book might be okay if it had to stand on its own. But as the sequel to Trinity, it captures none of the inspiring qualities of the original masterpiece."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Leon Uris is one of my favourite authors, but Redemption was comparatively disappointing to Trinity. It was unfortunate to revisit much of Trinity's story in Redemption, and in a more poorly written style that seemed to exist only to avoid exact repetition than anything else. It did improve somewhat in the second half, but it was somehow spoiled for me. I felt patronized in that I, as a reader, could not be trusted to read Trinity first, or take the &quot;Redemption&quot; portion of Redemption as a novel unto itself. Do read Trinity. Then read the second half of Redemption. I've not given up on Leon Uris by a long shot, though. He truly is a fabulous and captivating author. More often than not, at any rate."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Redemption is a good book that is well written with good use of language and history. The characters are well developed, real, and likable. All in all, it is an excellent book to read instead of watching television. The story follows three protagonists in their attemps to win Ireland its freedom from England. The characters are Rory Larkin, Atty Fitzpatrick, and Countess Caroline Hubble. These three honerable people face hardship and devestation in the hopesof realizing their dream of a free Ireland.Despite its many good qualities, I found this book rather disappointing. Leon Uris has written many outstanding novels. Redemption wasn't quite up to par with some of his earlier works. The main problem with it is that it is a sequel to Trinity. Trinity was one of the best books I have ever read. Unfortionly, Redemption hides in its shadow. Trinity was a magnificient tale of fighters for the freedom of Ireland. The whole story was wonderful from the first page to the last with tons of history and characters that were wonderful, believable, and just short of super human. The problem is that thte subject was so involved that it was about used up when Trinity made its triuphant ending. I think that Uris realized this when he wrote Redemption and tried to compensate. The first three hundred and fifty pages are just a summary of Trinity from different view points. Except for the first two chapters, these pages should be skipped by anyone who has read Trinity. After these pages, the novel starts to pick up where Trinity left off and succeeds with a good story line. The characters are excellent, but they are lessened in the reader's eyes because they refer so much to the greatness of the Trinity characters. They fear that they will never measure up, so that, in the reader's eyes, they don't.My suggestion would be to read Redemtion first then Trinity. The book will then seem great and the characters greater. Still, I do not mean to belittle this novel. It is very entertaining and contains excellent material. Even if it fails to overtake Trinity, it is nonetheless a masterpeice of writting."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read Trinity and thought it was supurb. Because I loved Trinity so much and learned so much about Ireland, I eagerly got Redemption. I was disappointed that Redemption did not move along in time. I wanted to get to the Irish Revolution. Instead Redemption went over the same time period, but with some new characters. I kept thinking that Redemption would have been super if it had been combined with Trinity and issued as one big book, with those parts of Redemption inserted in proper place in Trinity. The section of Redemption that enthralled me was the war writing re Gallipoli. It is some of the best I have read anywhere by anyone. And Gallipoli is 300 pages of the book. The writing on Gallipoli is worth the price of the book and more."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Trinity is among the very best books I have read; the kind of book that teaches and leaves you with something for years to come.

Just wanted to know what the hell it was all about.And I got all the information I wanted and so much more. Trinity not only gave a complete history on the situation but told me what Ireland meant to an Irishman.Now why am I reviewing Trinity instead of Redemption? I don't know. Maybe its because the sequel cant even hold a candle light to its predecessor .Redemption just drags on from basically where Trinity left off. Nothing happens until Gallipoli. But there, the book completely switches pace and becomes very interesting.The Bloody hills of Gallipoli and the British, Australian & the New Zealand forces invasion is described in vivid detail. But that's it. You have to suffer through the rest of the book to get to this part.Give this a miss. Read Trinity instead and hold on to the memories."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"Trinity was based upon Uris's Irish experiences. While living in Dublin, he had written a photo-essay entitled Ireland, a Terrible Beauty. Trinity was a chronicle of a Northern Irish farm family from the 1840s to 1916, whose fate is connected with two other families, one representing the British aristocracy and the other coming from Scotland. The central characters are a young Catholic rebel and a Protestant girl, who try to find their own place in the country divided by religion and wealth. The story of the Larkin family continued in The Redemption. In these works Uris developed further one of his central themes, the restorative capacity of love and forgiving. Also the situation in the Northern Ireland, from Ireland to New Zealand, Egypt, and Gallipoli."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"The 200 or so pages in this novel that Leon Uris devotes to the battle of Gallipoli Peninsula in WWI are very well-written and extremely interesting. I have to wonder if Uris originally planned to write an entire book about Gallipoli but didn't have the energy left in his old age. He knew he'd make a pile of money with a sequel to his popular book \\"Trinity\\" so he stuck the Gallipoli story into the sequel.The first 300 pages of this book are a rehash of Trinity and I skimmed over them very quickly. The parts after Gallipoli are mildly interesting but not worth spending a lot of time on."},{"Title":"Redemption (Thorndike Core)","review":"After reading \\"Trinity,\\" I cannot have been the only one who hunted high and low for \\"Redemption.\\" I see from other reviews that I am not the only one who was, let's say, mildly appalled by what I found. \\"Redemption\\" has all the earmarks of a novel written for contractual purposes and I'm frankly surprised Uris put his name to it.

Very satisfied!"},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"It grabs you in the beginning. But it rambles. I picked this up for the historical element; that was great, the relationship between the characters was fine....it just didn't seem to get to the point soon enough. I didn't finish the end; didn't feel the need to. Was almost done too.An obsessed professor is taken in and then takes in a penniless Wall Street woman on a very LONG journey to a fabled lost city.Did I say the journey was LONG!? And the heroine is from New York and shes very annoying? Thats about all thats interesting until they lose you on the trail to El Dorado or wherever they were going."},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"Obviously, this is an early work of Kristin Hannah. I've read most of her books, and can honestly say, had I read this first, I never would have read the others she's written. I've never been so happy to put down a book in my life. I thought it would never end. The first novel of Hannah's I read was Home Again and I've read all her works since then. This book isn't even in their league."},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"The hero is unusual, and potentially endearing. The heroine deliberately different, though less endearing--meant apparently to be redeemed in the course of the book. BUT....The pace is so SLOW, and the plot virtually non-existent. I used to love to read romance, but lately the books seem to drip long overblown blah-blah-blah paragraphs and pages and pages supposedly about emotion while nothing at all is going on, or is about to either. In some books, passages are endlessly repeated while plot is nowhere to be found. Ms. Hannah isn't quite as repetitive as some; but though I need characters I care about, even more I need to read a book that is going somewhere sometime somehow. The snail's pace lack of plot here, or one that could have been handled in about five chapters, just isn't what I want to read.I will say on a sentence-by-sentence level, Kristin Hannah is an okay writer; but THE ENCHANTMENT put me to sleep. I know this nice lady could do much better."},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"This book was so bad that I put it down for 6 months. After I had forgotten how bad it was, then I tried again. I forced myself to finish it thist time but I did not enjoy it. It is just a silly romance that was sprinkled with only a TINY bit of adventure. And the adventure part was the most appealing thing about the story. Everything else was boring or silly. And when I say silly, I'm talking about the sappy love junk that isn't realistic, especially on the guys part. And the worst part about the book is that Kristin Hannah is obviously not a Christian because she continues to use the GD phrase throughout her books. This is the 3rd one of hers that I've read and it may have to be the last since I cannot such constant disrespect for the Lord. I'm not a holy roller Ms. Hannah, but couldn't you be creative enough to use words that won't alienate such a huge population of people?"},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"I found it difficult to read this book. The plot was slow, and I found it difficult to keep my interst in it. ..I was ok though. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"Emaline &quot;The mad hatter&quot; Hatter is ruthless, cold, experienced investment banker...

It's not her best - it's only the second book she wrote - but it's awfully good nevertheless. The initial interplay between the abrasive, arrogant rich lady and the calm professor-turned-adventurer is especially well-written and warmly amusing. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"Emmaline is a wealthy investor, cold and untouchable. Larence, a bookish professor, is a dreamer in search of a lost city. Emmaline becomes Larence's financier, the fulfillment of a promise to an old friend. When Emmaline, who had worked hard to overcome the humiliating and degrading poverty of her childhood, loses everything, she decides to accompany Larence on his quest in order to protect her investment and, hopefully, make a fortune.Larence is a compelling character unlike most romance novel heros. He's a fairly optimistic fellow, in spite of a rather sad childhood, and in spite of what he calls his \\"deformity;\\" a malformed ankle which causes a pronounced and painful limp. It is only when he's with the cold and beautiful Emmaline that he becomes acutely self-conscious of his physical deformity and his complete (I do mean complete) lack of experience with women. He was aware of these things, of course, but, in keeping with his good nature, had grown to accept them. Trust, friendship and, eventually, love blossom during their quest together.I was somewhat surprised at some of the negative reviews because I really felt a true abiding loving connection developed between these two, who taught each other so much; Emmaline gave Larence the confidence and self-worth he'd been lacking and Larence, in return, taught Emmaline how to trust and to love.There are some mystical scenes which require a brief suspension of reality, and one's appreciation, or lack thereof, of fantasy fiction will determine one's appreciation for these scenes. I was pleased that, though Larence's deformity sort of magically disappeared while in the lost city, it returned again back in the \\"real world,\\" (and made no difference to the lovely Emmaline.)"},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"34-year-old Professor Larence Digby wants to find the lost city of Cibola; a dream he's had for half his life, to find such a lost, yet miraculous civilization. If he were to find it, he'd claim his destiny and be completely whole for just one unforgettable moment. In order to achieve such a heavily yearned for moment? Needs 10 grand to finance this once-in-a lifetime expedition.After hours of monotone speaking, \\"bottle green\\" eyes bright with a believer's passion, he takes his eyes off his drawings to find his audience who were MEANT to be swayed to fork over cash...asleep. Being the cool and calculating businesswoman that she is, Emmaline Hatter strains to hand over the check. One catch: 1/2 of whatever is found goes to her in order to make a profit. Larence doesn't truly believe she'd sell the treasure of the past, and so he agrees... Then comes a great market crash and Emma is back to where she never wanted to be again; poverty-stricken. She decides to journey with the \\"dim-wit\\" and thus the adventure begins to New Mexico! (the most unromantic setting ever, it appeared)This tale was an absolute adventure to read BECAUSE it was rather peculiar. The heroine is actually the one who is withdrawn, self-centered, cold, yet a brilliant financial businessperson. She had to be in order to get out of the slums of her youth when she was left alone without parents; felt compelled to seek security in the feel of cold, hard cash. She views poverty as a weakness and loathes ever having to go back.Then you've got a beta-male, not an alpha-male... One who is the \\"smiling, boyish type.\\" A virgin professor with a trademark \\"the world's a great place\\" smile, youthful energy about him, and a dream. So ever hopeful. I swear, the moment he first appeared sopping wet in outdated clothing and walking with a limp, I wanted to bear hug him then and ravish him later =)There's so much DEPTH to the lives of these two leads. This quest essentially started as one to find Cibola, but later...Accidentally, or perhaps was it fate; became a quest to find themselves. Larence and Emma both had such tragic pasts, yet it was how they grew from it that was simply marvelous. One with hope and optimism, the other with resentment. This story makes you question and think twice as you find these characters having to be challenged by the building blocks of who they WERE, who they are, and who they want to be. Love is SUCH a key to this story. Everything having to do with love was brought up in this read and is was epic to see how it developed between Larence and Emma.This book really is enchanting. There's these rich and deep notions of love, hope, the future, dreams, the past. Really, it's about how the couple wanted to live their lives. It was an adventure of self-discovery in the face of finally finding their home. Yet, will they accept or reject it? There's absolute gorgeous vividness and clarity in every page. There's actual humor, as well! (I did burst out laughing.) The character development was steady, yet sure and powerful. The love scenes were unforgettable and just another treasured facet. This story hit me really hard. I will never forget what I witnessed transpire between the gorgeous, hopeful professor and his hardened partner :DHappy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Enchantment","review":"After a devastating crash on Wall Street, Emmaline Hatter finds herself completely broke with no one to turn to.

The Enchantment, her second book, pales in comparison to her more recent books, especially Angel Falls, Mystic Lake, and Home Again, to name a few.I devoured her other books, but found The Enchantment relatively slow going and a tad bit sophomoric at times. Disappointingly, this book is not as good as her later books in which she draws the reader straight into the heart of her characters as well as into the plot. I really could not find the characters really that believable. Yet, once again and true to form, Hannah delivers her \\"message\\" of hope and renewal, as both characters learn to shed their old haunting habits and persona by learning to trust and letting love in. The setting was just not believable at all to me, searching for the lost city of Cibola in New Mexico in the late 1800's.This is not one of Hannah's better novels and the title of the book would not have caught my eye either.

Beginning with the armed confrontation on Lexington Green between British regulars and American militia, Professor Morgan eloquently traces the pivotal events of United States history up to the ratification of the United States' Constitution. Included are discussions on the Stamp Act crisis, the Townsend Act, the Quartering Act, the Boston Massacre, and the Boston Tea Party. Also included are discussions on the Colonists' political philosophies (\\"equal rights and equal men\\"), their experiences with government after the Revolutionary War, and the impetus for and events surrounding the creation of a Federal Constitution.This book is, by far, the most concise and informative survey of this critical period in American history. I most highly recommend it as the point to begin an understanding of this remarkable historical period! Balanced, well-written, and a delight to read, it is unquestionably a classic study!"},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"I had to read this as a summer assignment for AP US History, and wasn't particularly looking forward to it. But once I started reading, it was surprisingly quite interesting to see how the actual \\"birth of the republic\\" took place. Morgan tells the story from mainly an objective perspective, but throws in opinions at times. I'd recommend this book to any high school student and any adult simply interested in American history, but to highly educated history scholars, this may be too basic."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Morgan's Birth of the Republic is a wonderful overview of the political groundwork of the American Revolutionary period.

I used to be so confused about history, but not any more. His chronilogical order makes history so easy and understandable."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"The information in The Birth of the Republic is plentiful and straightforward.This book is an unbiased account of both sides of the Revolution. The facts are thoroughly explained without any evidence of an opinion favoring the British or the Americans. The facts are delivered without adjectives which would throw sway into the text and is helpful for education but also makes for dull reading.Morgan makes many generalizations when he speaks of the average citizen in America. He addresses significant leaders and not members of the public the represent the beliefs of the masses. However, this is understandable because these leaders were meant to be such representatives.The documents in the appendix, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the Declaration of Independence, and the Consitution, are helpful because they are documented proof of the efforts of the American people in the beginning of their government. They are somewhat difficult to understand since they are written in the dialogue of the time period, but thankfully, they are explained in The Birth of the Republic.A hinderance to this book is the bibliography. It is confusing because it is not presented in the normal fashion. The sources were given but they were not cited in the narrative so there is no proof that the book was not plagarized. If one wanted to go to the source of a certain piece of information, one would have to resort to consulting all of the sources because of the way the bibliography is set up. Thus, it is difficult to use."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Edmund Morgan's narrative of the period leading up to and just following the American Revolution is too broad for its own good. Ascribing to an antiquitated and particularly unuseful view of history, Morgan abridges the narrative for the sake of introduction rather than analyzing it, which does violence to any sort of constructive understanding of the Revolution. One gets the blatantly simplyfied (if not totally false) impression from this book of a single-minded people carrying a totally novel idea into the future for no other reasons but principle with no great assistance aside from their own ingenuity and nave idealism. This book is dated by its author's ideas (freezing it in the 1950s when it was written). Instead of getting an analytical introduction, students will find themselves bombarded with ideology and rhetoric. Morgan's narrative stops short of anything but a patriotic pageant, parading before us our favorite archetypal faces we remember so well from elementary school.Overall, this book is little more than a relic from an outdated mode of American history. Morgan would do well to spend less time celebrating his subject matter unabashedly and at least offer the reader some questions to think about. As it stands, the book is a work of historical fiction, tackily written. It definitely has no business in classrooms except those studying perceptions of American history in the 1950s.Instead, for those interested in a particularly more interesting (and helpful) look into the formation of the thirteen colonies into a cohesive (or at least marginally functional) 'Nation' capable of fighting a popular revolution, I recommend T.H. Breen's The Market Place of the American Revolution. It offers insights into the same time period as Morgan, but deals more with the nuanced and complicated process of nation-forming that is often credited to a few big names and ornate documents in American history."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"I only chose this book to read for a review in class because it had the shortest amount of pages. I actually read it in less than three days and had a seven-page review written in five days. It was generally easy to understand if you have read about the topic before. I'm not talking about what they taught in high school either. This book reveals the Americans' belief in life, liberty, and economic interests. Its funny how Morgan shows the sinister ulterior motives for American patriotism. Patriotism is in the pockets of our founding fathers. They only wanted the country to succeed so they could have a place to cash their checks. I like to discover new thing about the godlike founding fathers that our high school history books were so wrong about."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!

IF YOU HATE HISTORY, YOU WILL HATE IT EVEN MORE, AND IF YOU LOVE HISTORY YOU WILL BEGIN TO HATE IT."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Edmund Morgan remains America's most readable colonial historian after a half-century of writing. This short volume is still my favorite book about the American Revolution. Written in clear, readable prose that anyone with half-a-brain could understand and enjoy, &quot;The Birth of the Republic&quot; covers all the major bases from 1763 to the Constitutional Convention in 1789. Primarily a political history, readers seeking for a military history should look elsewhere. But for almost fifty years, this book has remained in print, luring readers into a deeper appreciation of our most important piece of history: when the American colonies began to separate themselves from the British Empire, deciding that one's political liberties were more sacred than loyalty to a crown. While in retrospect we can now see that there was little tyranny actually being practiced against the colonies, the fear itself of what dangerous precedent might bring remains with us today. A truly marvelous book, both for a general audience and for those with historical awareness. I first read this book as a student; now, as a history teacher, I give it to my own students with the greatest of anticipated joy: that they too will find this short book as wonderful as any they have ever read."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Originally published in 1956 and revised in 1977, this book is probably familiar to a couple of generations of college students. This may well be the most accessible overview of the formative history of America. As an overview, of course, it does not go into great detail about the myriad of topics debated by historians still today, but it does hit most of the predominant features of the Revolutionary story. Morgan builds his work around the premise that the Founding Fathers did indeed operate on principle in building a new nation and that the struggle eventually framed itself as a pursuit of equality among all men. He admits that many of the decisions made by the leaders of the Revolution did equate to economic or property gains for themselves, but he argues that this is not contradictory at all with a commitment to liberty because liberty in the 18th century essentially hinged on land ownership. He also rationalizes the contradiction of slavery's continued existence being incorporated into the Constitution by arguing that the convention delegates acted out of urgent concern for the future of a government in its death throes at the hands of a powerless Congress as set up by the Articles of Confederation--without such compromise, the important new Constitution could not have been ratified by a sufficient number of states before the young nation collapsed at the feet of the British and Spanish.Morgan first examines the increasingly rocky relationship between the English Parliament and the colonies--specifically, the debate over taxation and infringement of liberties that led up to the declaration of independence. He devotes a few pages to the war but does not delve very deeply into military matters. Morgan does an excellent job explaining why the Articles of Confederation failed and how the problems of that system were widely recognized, frankly debated, and resolved in the creation of a new national government established upon the bedrock of a new federal Constitution.Aside from Morgan's excellent treatment of the birth of the American republic, this book also features the texts of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and federal Constitution; a timeline of important events; and a pretty expansive discussion of source materials published before 1977. In sum, this book is ideal for anyone just wanting to learn or review the pivotal events surrounding the creation of the United States without having to sift through scholarly criticisms and debates of important yet secondary aspects of the story."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Morgan's book, The Birth of the Republic, is a well-written book of a very interesting time in American History. His book uses great detail to describe this unrevealed part of history. Morgan does not just describe what was going on in these times but he tells why these events occurred. We get not only the story, but also the meaning behind the story. Through the use of Morgan's words and my own imagination I now have the understanding of why &quot;Revolution&quot; occurred.Morgans book taught us about the times of the revolutionary period in American history. Morgan discussed the taxation and legislation from Parliament and the Americans loyalty to them. Morgan's book shows the challenge of British taxation and why the Americans fought to protect their freedom. He discussed the constitution and to what degree it controlled and helped heal the American society. The book illustrated a division of Americans, turning against each other and becoming an unconstrained nation to fight for the rights of individuals.I enjoyed Morgan's book because he described the thought and reasoning of the Americans better than I had ever perceived. He used thought rather than facts to discuss the why of the revolutionary period. He supported his why with the reality of what had occurred. Morgan used great judgment in concluding what this period of American history represented. He used clearly cut issues to put meaning behind the acts of the people of this time.Morgan only had a few flaws in my opinion. He reflected back too much on some of the past experiences. He used too many references that related to what was happening. Morgan also tended to repeat himself in making many points. All of this was not necessary in order to get his point across.This book presents the American Revolution as a great conflict, not just of men or nations, but of ideas. It tells, not just about the battles, but about the reasons behind the battles. Morgan has done a wonderful job explaining and teaching this part of history. Anyone using this book will get a great understanding of what the American Revolution was about, and why the constitutional principles are so powerful."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"For those of you whose idea of American history only stretches back to 1776, you might want to fill in the gaps with this book. Morgan not only takes the reader through the war that made our country independent, the Revolutionary War, but also how &quot;the challenge of British taxation started the Americans on a search for constitutional principles to protect their freedom.&quot; He takes you into the hearts of the colonists and the minds of the diplomats. At the end of the book, Morgan masterfully places copies of the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the United States Constitution so you, the reader, can see the effects of the events and outcomes that you just read about. Great book to enhance your knowledge of history, I give The Birth of the Republic 4 out of 5 stars making it &quot;almost perfect.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Perhaps independence from Great Britain was inevitable, but Great Britain herself had precipitated the Colonies declaring themselves to be \\"Free and Independent States\\" in 1776. The colonial settlers thought themselves to be entitled to all of the constitutional rights of Englishmen, especially the rights to liberty. When Parliament sought to enhance its poor revenue collections by imposing extra taxes on the colonies by the Sugar and Stamp Acts of 1764-65, the colonists immediately invoked rights to be directly represented before taxes could be imposed. The author shows that it was those acts that started a reexamination of the colonies' relationship to Great Britain.Though those acts were repealed, Parliament was fixated on imposing its authority on the colonies. The colonists rejected the notion of \\"virtual\\" representation, and moved from a position of rejecting taxation yet accepting general legislation to one of questioning any jurisdiction by Parliament. The author distinguishes the American Revolution from more far-reaching social revolutions and from nationalistic impulses. The colonists in their minds merely wanted the freedoms enjoyed by all Englishmen.But opposition to a central government proved to be an insufficient basis for establishing a viable political entity. The Articles of Confederation proposed in 1777 left the Congress without any teeth to enforce its provisions, especially in collecting revenues. The securities that Congress offered to fund the war soon became greatly debased because of the Congress's unsound financial basis. Even after having defeated England through some timely help by France and British ineptitude, governing realities and existing in a world of hostile nations forced colonial leaders to call for a constitutional convention in 1787 a mere four years after signing the peace treaty.In many ways the Constitution was more controversial than declaring independence. The author discusses any number of conflicts that arose: small states versus large states, where a compromise was reached subordinating the equality of men to the equality of states in determining the basis of representation in the Senate; slave states versus free states, where each slave was counted as three-fifths of a person for representation at the cost of banning further importation of slaves after 1808; an independent executive and judiciary elements were established with some power to override the Congress; and the financial interests of the well-to-do were protected in having the value of securities upheld. It is clear that the idealism of the language in the Declaration had been considerably reduced.Despite its brevity, this book sufficiently explores the events and the mindset of the colonists from the Stamp Act to the Revolution, through the Revolutionary and the Articles period, and into the Constitution making stage for the reader to gain a good understanding of how a content people could find themselves living in an independent nation with a Constitution that has withstood the test of time, though suffering some shocks along the way - all in the span of twenty-five years."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"In his book, The Birth of the Republic 1763 - 89, Edmund S. Morgan addresses the historical problem of why the American colonists, who frequently engaged in quarrels and disputes with each other over the most trivial of matters, united together in a common enterprise to end English rule and establish a new government. Morgan's historiographical analysis offers a response to the progressive historians' emphasis on the internal struggles among the colonies before, during, and after the Revolution. While Morgan may agree that the colonies were not without their share of conflicts and discord, he strongly argues that they were able to set aside their differences to unite in a common cause. The belief in principle, namely the belief and discovery of human equality, united the colonists to a common cause and was the most significant force behind the American Revolution. In addition to the principle of human equality, Morgan demonstrates that the Lockian principles of property and liberty were also vital factors in the cause for revolution.In addition to his detailed biographical notes, Morgan's book can be appreciated for the inclusion of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of important dates between 1763 and 1790. Seemingly, such documents as the Declaration and the Constitution are central to the history of the American Revolution and founding of our nation. Perhaps more significantly, these items supplement the patriotic sentiment prominent in Morgan's book, solidifying his argument that in order for such documents to have even been created successfully the colonies had to be united in their efforts and ideals.Many other historiographical arguments on the American Revolution exist (particularly on its nature, meaning, and significance); there are certainly many more detailed and interpretative studies that one could read. Edmund S. Morgan is noted for being a consensus historian, often criticized by 'new left' historians for presenting the Revolution as too synthetic and without regard to the issues of women, blacks, and the poor and dispossessed. Despite this criticism, I believe that Morgan's book offers a good starting point for a student of history or anyone wishing to learn about the birth of our nation."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"This book is a great over view of the time before, during, and after the revolution. I must confess that I read this as a required text book for my American history class. It is the first and possibly only text book that I can say I liked well enough to read all the way through and like it. This book goes very breifly over the events in a very readable fashion. Those studying history (such as myself) can always read a companion to the revolution along with it to go more in depth into the revolution. For those who only want a brief history this book is perfect."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"One would think that justice cannot be done to the topic of ideology during the American Revolution in such a short book, but Edmund S. Morgan does the job quite well. In each chapter, you have an introduction to the various basic issues that confronted Americans during the Revolution and how the people grappled with the issues. Morgan does not waste words by going on and on about every minute detail, but hits on what needs to be covered and gives the reader the background knowledge needed when looking at the American Revolution and considering what issues were in play as a result of the new dialogue about freedom and liberty. This volume does not merely deal with how our Founding Fathers responded, but also the laborer and the merchant, the slave and the freedman, and the Southern plantation owner and the Northern farmer. I am not sure if one should read this volume before reading a general history of the American Revolution or vice-versa, but it is clear to me that one is needed to properly understand the other. Perhaps reading this volume with Robert Middlekauf's \\"Glorious Revolution,\\" would make a good duo to explore the history of the American Revolution."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"Edmund S. Morgan has written a highly readable introduction to the American Revolution for anyone looking to re-educate themselves on the founding of the United States or delve in for the first time (if you happened to of slept through high school history). This is a book which would be excellent in a university survey course and I am saddened that it was not required reading for myself while in college. I undoubtedly plan on using excerpts from it when teaching in my own high school history course and looking to bring in outside sources.The book itself highlights all of the main events which constituted the Revolution and early republic. It covers the various Acts imposed by Parliament which led up to the Declaration of Independence, several key battles, the main cast of characters and Founding Fathers, the challenges faced by the young republic, and concludes with the 'critical period' and ratification of the constitution. Those anticipating detailed accounts of how particular battles were won or lost though will be disappointed, as this is not the focus of the book.I believe that this piece works so well because of Professor Morgan's success at covering the main events, pointing out areas of academic/moral debate, and then arguing his own point of view in an even-handed and defensible way. He points out the hypocrisy of numerous founders owning slaves, but also emphasizes the need the founders had of ratifying the constitution in order to preserve the young Union and the fact that they would have been unable to do this had the north pushed strongly for emancipation. This haste in working towards ratification led to 'compromises' which invariably hurt women and slaves, and greatly delayed freedom and suffrage. Also, he makes a nod towards those historians who diminish the Founding Fathers as men only concerned with their economic well-being, but argues that they were also indeed men of principle.I found this a very enjoyable book and even if you are in disagreement with some of his opinions, it is hard to deny its accomplishment in brevity (without lacking in depth) and well-written style. I greatly enjoyed it and recommend it highly to any seeking a refresher in basic US history."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Republic 1763-89","review":"I found Morgan's The Birth of the Republic a good introduction to the American Revolution. Short on flowing narrative, it does cover the history with focus on the causes for the Revolution. If you are looking for a better narrative, I would highly recommend Angel in the Whirlwind by Benson Bobrick. For a focus on the battles, Richard Ketchum's series is excellent."},{"Title":"Enthusiasm: A chapter in the history of religion, with special reference to the XVII and XVIII centuries","review":"If you're British, you'll know 'Desert Island Discs', where celebrities name the eight records and one book they'd want to be marooned with on a desert island. Well, Enthusiasm is my Desert Island Book, and has been for many, many years; re-read at least fifteen times, and known partly by heart, it never palls.The book itself is a survey of Christian 'enthusiasm' from the Corinthians to Father Divine, though focusing most on the 17th and 18th centuries; the nearest equivalent in recognisable modern times is the charismatic movement. (It was largely this book, together with the same author's 'Belief of Catholics', which converted me from a charismatic evangelical to a Catholic.) It's elegantly written, but that's only the half of it; there's a depth of learning and scholarship worn lightly, wit and humour which few other religious writers have ever achieved (Chesterton springs to mind); and, most of all, a compassion and sympathy for many of his subjects (not all; he's very scathing about the Jansenists and Mme Guyon). In all, a book which is wonderful to read, but also full of almost prophetic insights into the current situation in the Catholic Church, which Knox never saw (he died several years before the Second Vatican Council).All I can say is &quot;Buy it&quot;!&quot; You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Enthusiasm: A chapter in the history of religion, with special reference to the XVII and XVIII centuries","review":"I read Mgr Knox's book when I was in high school, but have re-read it several times. I was taken aback by his sympathy &amp; understanding of John Wesley. I haven't read anything more inspiring about Wesley written by a Methodist.His account of the struggle between F&eacute;nelon &amp; Bossuet is masterful. One wonders what he would have thought of the modern televangelists. He would not have made fun of them, but would have discerned the basis of their appeal.This is a work of humanism, grounded on faith, but in no way condescending or superior."},{"Title":"Enthusiasm: A chapter in the history of religion, with special reference to the XVII and XVIII centuries","review":"Knox's &quot;Enthusiasm&quot; is a survey of the history of certain mystical trends, which the author dubs &quot;ultra-supernaturalist&quot;, throughout the course of Christian history. Knox examines the various outbreaks in detail, especially those of the 17th and 18th centuries. Furthermore, he successfully and profoundly analyzes the psychological basis for all such movements.This book is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of fringe religious movements in general, any of the sects described here specifically, or the psychology of fanaticism.I also recommend that students of Eric Voegelin read this book, as it provides much food for thought in light of his comments about the nature of gnosticism. Likewise, anyone who finds the psychological portions of this book interesting should look at Voegelin's work, which deals with similar issues from a philosophical perspective. I suggest that you begin with &quot;Science, Politics, and Gnosticism&quot; and then move on to &quot;The New Science of Politics&quot; to get a basic grounding in Voegelin. He and Knox share a fundamental insight - that fringe religious groups are motivated by an antinomian hatred for reality and society that seeks to destroy nature rather than to heal it, which is the goal of more mainstream religion. What Voegelin adds to the discussion is a deeper fund of historical examples of such attitudes, an investigation of a paralell set of ideas to be found in modern philosophy, and an understanding of how these ideas have influenced modern culture and politics (for example, Voegelin regards socialism, in all it's forms, as a secularized version of the same kind of anitnomian millenarianism to be found in, say the Montanists, who Knox investigates at length)."},{"Title":"Enthusiasm: A chapter in the history of religion, with special reference to the XVII and XVIII centuries","review":"Hard not to be very enthusiastic about this magnum opus of Msgr Ronald Knox. It deserves to be republished today--in a lovely paperback edition. This has been one of my favorite books over the years; read and re-read for the sheer joy of reading! Knox takes us on a marvellous journey through history, unveiling some of the mystical and &quot;enthusiastic&quot; movements, going back to Corinth and Montanism, and some of the &quot;enthusiastic&quot; personalities behind these movements. His chapters on John Wesley are the best I know; alone worth the price of this book. You may be surprised--as Knox himself was--at his conclusions!

You really have to pay attention.

I highly recommend that you print out the sample pages which Amazon.com provides, and read them, slowly, carefully, lovingly.

This fact being the common usage of the idea that &quot;Christ passed through the Virgin Mother as water through a pipe.&quot; This is about as conclusive as asserting someone is from Alabama on the basis of saying &quot;kit and kaboodle.&quot; The book is certainly fun to read, fans of Knox love it, it is full of inuendo and characterizations. &quot;Heretics&quot; meet in &quot;nests&quot; and the &quot;virus&quot; of protestanism spreads throughout the land.

Aside from that I found this book to be useless. It was clearly written by someone who has never implemented an ES. This book is what an SAP salesman would give to CIO/CEO level customers. The big bang methodology he endorses is nothing but a recipe for disaster. When this is used the only thing it ensures is that an organization will be dependent on consultants for the forseeable future. He is way off base and delivers very little proof or personal experience."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"Davenport presented his experience and opinion in one medium-size book (300 pages), covered almost every aspects of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), which he called it Enterprise System (ES). This book is intended for both practitioners and students, and I found it serves its objectives. Starting with the definition, advantages/disadvantages, implementation, strategic integration, Information Technology (IT), business process, managing Supply Chain with ERP, and future of ERP in organization. The topics are the most popular questions in ERP decision, implementation, and continuous improvement. I would rate this book at five stars; however, there are something that I put four stars for this book -as follows: 1) Although the topics are hot and referred to many business cases, the organization of each chapter is terrible. I got lost several times in chapter or between chapters. 2) Each chapter referes back-and-forth to other chapters, which is quite useful for further reference. I, however, found they are too many referals. Again, this makes almost every chapters are not much different than others. Except for the book organization, this book is quite good for its content. I wish Davenport may consider to re-organize the second edition of this book or his new book. His knowledge in this area is exceptional, only it's required lots of organized. This book offers many excellent points of &quot;after-ERP&quot;, which is rarely found in most ERP books. Good but not great book. Therefore, this is not the single book if you plan to get only one. You may consider O'Leary's book (ISBN 0521791529) or Brady et al. (ISBN 0619015934), if you are new to ERP and get Davenport's book for supplement."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"Davenport does a brilliant job of explaining what enterprise systems are and what they can accomplish in any organization. He suggests, however, that they are worthless \\"unless they lead to better information or better ways of doing business. I think that enterprise systems are without doubt an impressive technical feat, but I am primarily concerned that organizations get business value from them.\\" Throughout his book, he addresses key issues such as these:1. What enterprise systems are and why they are important2. The promise and the perils involved3. How to decide whether or not to implement enterprise systems4. How to integrate enterprise systems with strategy and organizational structure5. How to integrate enterprise systems with business processes and information6. How to achieve value while implementing enterprise systems7. How to transform the practice of management with enterprise systems8. How to use enterprise systems to manage the supply chain9. The future of ES-enabled organizationsAs Davenport explains in Chapter 1, \\"Enterprise systems offer the first great opportunity to achieve true connectivity, a state in which everyone knows what everyone else is doing in the business all over the world at the same time. And because they represent the first great opportunity for connectivity, they pose one of the greatest threats to the status quo that companies have ever faced.\\" Hence the importance of one of the the book's most valuable sections, the Appendix, in which Davenport provides \\"A Technical Overview of Enterprise Systems.\\" Those who feel threatened by an enterprise system will seize any and all opportunities to point out its technical flaws. At best, enterprise systems are complex, difficult to install, and inflexible. However, Davenport points out, they \\"will remain the most capable, integrated systems in the history of the world. They may have their flaws, but they are also the answer to our information systems prayers.\\" I agree."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"If you want to know how to implement an enterprise system, this is not the book to rely upon. But if you want an introduction to ERPs and how they can impact your organization, make this the first book you read. Davenport does a good job of laying &quot;the first brick&quot; in your continuing education process in regards to ERPs. It is easy to understand and gives real world examples of benefits and pitfalls of different implementation methods and gives the reader a fair view of the magnitude of an ERP project. Not the ERP bible, but a must read."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"With this title, I expected something related to complex issues on design, implementation, integration and operation of rea-life information systems. For me, this book was a dissapointment. At least, the title is misleading. By &quot;enterprise system&quot;, the author means Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) packages such as SAP and Baan, and most of the contents are about very basic overview on ERP. This book should be titled as &quot;Managers' Guide to ERP&quot;, and could be useful for uninitiated managers who want to know what major ERP products there are."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"The book gives indeed a very good introduction of what is essential when you consider introducing ESs. It really gets the message across that the real benefit of these systems is when your decision is business driven and you adjust your business processes with it. That helped me to deepen my understanding of these systems and my knowledge I got from reading quite a number of articles on the subject. But when I was about half the book it was getting tougher to continue. I really got the feeling that the incremental knowledge I was learning from continued reading was drastically going down. It is a problem I have with many of these university background writers. They feel a need to create a kind of science flavor to their subject, and start using far too many words to explain their subject. It probably was more helpful to provide more real life examples of successful and unsuccessful cases (at least that is my personal preference) The future developments chapter at the end of the book was a disaster for me. It is too technical (or scientific) and too little practical. I still have no clue of what Daverport's message is for us on this subject. Still, I would recommend the book to anyone who is considering buying an ES and has insufficient knowledge of ES, or for those who have an ES but don't feel they are really getting what they hoped for. Because, like Davenport writes in his intro somewhere, I don't know any other book who can give you the same insight as Davenport has done."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"With an easy-to-read writing style, Davenport clearly explains how to go about getting the kind of results from ESs which business executives expect. While many people involved in implementations might get lost in the details and lose sight of the overall objective, Davenport offers extremely useful check-lists and guidelines to make sure your bosses will be happy. Finally, the multitude of real-life examples reassures the reader that the book is not just a set of theoretical hypotheses. I couldn't imagine planning a future ES or working on an existing one without knowledge of this book."},{"Title":"Mission Critical: Realizing the Promise of Enterprise Systems","review":"This book has never received the recognition that it deserves.It is about ERP systems ... or Enterprise Systems (ES) as Davenport calls them.If you're interested in the STRATEGIC issues of ERP systems, then you'll learn that there are surprisingly few books on this topic on the market.Davenport's contributions are the best that I've found. Especially, I found his discussion of implementation approaches on speed and focus (quick relief vs. long-term competitiveness) interesting. Also his perspectives on \\"after the implementation\\" were far ahead of his time. In addition, his considerations on the implementation plan's options on scope and function (process phasing vs. big bang vs. geographical or business unit phasing) are illustrative.Perhaps Davenport's book could be better structured, but considering the quality of the arguments in the text, I can live with it. Content before structure. Five stars!Peter Drucker wrote in 1999 \\"we have spend the last 50 years on the T in IT, we need to spend the next 50 years on the I in IT\\". If you read Davenport's book, you'll be better prepared to capture the information part than the technology part in ERP systems.If you're interested in the more tactical and operational issues of ERP systems, then buy Brady's \\"Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning\\" (2001) and Hamilton's \\"Maximizing your ERP System - A practical guide for managers [in manufacturing firms]\\" (2002).

Sometimes, bits of information are scattered across sections in chapters.There are important topics on creating benefits in the installation, and how to avoid failures. In particular, I felt the sections on how an ERP installation affects competitive strategy, organisational structure and culture very impressive; it's hard to find such stuff so well-written in many books.The sections on pre-, during, and post-implementation issues are interesting read and I feel complemented Daniel O'Leary's \\"Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Systems, Life Cycles, Electronic Commerce and Risk\\" 2000, Cambridge University Press very well.

But Georgie's public career was far more extensive than that of dais speaker or eulogist. (Mimic David Frye, in his famous comedy albumI AM THE PRESIDENT, has Jessel declaring he won't deliver a eulogy for anything smaller than a chicken.)Jessel's vaudeville career began at age 9, shortly after the death of his father. As kids, he and Walter Winchell were vocalists in the Imperial Trio. Like many vaudevillians, over time George had many partners, appeared in multiple cast sketches as well as \\"in one.\\"He wrote lyrics for a number of once-popular songs such as \\"My Mother's Eyes.\\" Jessel's 1929 recording peaked at #8 on that day's equivalent of the Top 40 chart. With some experience in Broadway revues, and after losing a half-million in the '29 stock market collapse, George became a semi-successful show producer.Following the example of long-time friend Eddie Cantor (who also urged George into Wall St. investments), Jessel tried his hand at radio, again with mixed results. George claims in SO HELP ME that he came up with the idea of a radio amateur contest with him as emcee two years before Major Bowes, but no network liked this concept. Yet, since Bowes brought it to the air in the early 1930s, amateur contest broadcasts have been a part of American life in one form or another ever since.Impressions of Jessel from his book: he borrowed money from a lot of male celebrities; pined after, and/or dated a bevy of gorgeous ladies; had a lot of breakups with women; wasn't the modest type.After a first divorce, George married the love of his life, Norma Talmadge. They remained a couple during several lean years when Jessel struggled to make a living. He tells of a dramatic open plane flight in a snowstorm to be with Norma in Palm Bch., FL. shortly after their divorce, for an emergency that only existed in Jessel's alcohol-soaked mind. George punched out a man who answered the bell at his former home, then used bullets on a bedroom door when Norma refused to let him in. Naturally, these acts led to an arrest.On the rebound from Talmadge, middle-aged George foolishly fell for and married 16-year-old Lois Andrew. After 3 years, one child and much tsooris und umglick, Lois and George split for good in August 1943, which is where his autobiography ends, halfway through a long, eventful, yet now nearly forgotten life. (He never remarried, BTW.).In playwright William Saroyan's intro to SO HELP ME, he describes George as a storyteller rather than a writer. An excerpt here to illustrate, from Jessel's first visit to Britain in 1915 during the Great War:This was one of the warmest nights London had ever known, and it was to get warmer as far as I was concerned. Suddenly there was a great noise of running feet in the halls and much knocking on doors. Two Zeps were flying over London. The anti-aircaft guns had started shooting at them, and people were rushing to the cellar of the hotel... I immediately packed my things, wrote a note for my partner and left.The city was completely blacked out. The sky was lit by searchlights, and Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus were crowded with people watching the fight in the air. These raids were not new to London, and only a small percentage of the English people ran to cover in the underground (subway) or the cellars. With valise in hand I stood and watched. Suddenly I saw the Zep. It ducked in and out behind the clouds like a great silver cigar, then---bang! Tommy Atkins had hit it. It burst into flames and came down at Enfield, a few miles from London. There was a very slight cheer from the crowd---just a few \\"Well, 'e's got it; old Fritz must be pretty warm by now; good job;---good night, 'arry---good night, Alf; toodle-oo lads, cheerio.\\" And that was my second night in London."},{"Title":"The prayer that spans the world: Sermons on the Lord's prayer","review":"Sermons were preached in Germany during the Allied bombing of WWII.

They are different from one another in many passages and fingerings. I bought this edition because they are edited by Chopin's long time pupil, later, his teaching assistant, Carl Mikuli (1819-1897) - Polish pianist, composer, conductor and teacher. Also helped by many Chopin's faithful pupils and beloved friends. As Mikuli said in the Forward: \\"This edition would succeed in restoring the authentic text and in making further mutilation(of Chopin's music) forever impossible, ......I must note here that the fingering of this edition comes in large part from Chopin himself, where it does not, .... in the editor's opinion.\\" -- I had some Chopin's music edited by Rafael Joseffy, like \\"Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2\\", also by Dover Publication, which I did not like that much. The fingering did not works for me.The following is a list of Chopin's Works in the Carl Mikuli Edition by Dover Publication.

Almost all of them include a disclaimer by the author: differently phrased but always firm statements that the kind of psychiatry Dr. Szasz practices has nothing to do with the conventional coercive psychiatry. I often wondered what kind of psychiatry Dr. Szasz does practice, and if there is a way to practice psychiatry at all if you accept Dr. Szasz basic ideas (these ideas, of course, are not exclusively his, he just has enough courage to be the staunchest defender of the common sense among psychiatrists).There is nothing in the book about the specifics of Dr. Szasz' psychoanalytic methods. This book is dedicated strictly to the ethical aspects of the relationship between the analyst and the patient. Dr. Szasz describes in great detail his views on the nature of the relationship between the patient and analyst, the fundamental ethical principles underlying this relationship, and the developmental stages of the relationship from the ethical perspective.After reading \\"Ethics of Psychoanalysis\\" I can tell you that, yes, Dr. Szasz does what he preaches, and, yes, it is possible to practice psychiatry in a non-coercive way.A word of caution: In order to understand this book, it helps to be familiar with the basic psychological ideas advanced by Dr. Szasz throughout his long career.

He is a well-known critic of psychiatry, of the social role of medicine in modern society, and is a social libertarian.In the Preface to this 1965 book, Szasz states, \\"In this book, I propose to describe psychotherapy as social action, not as healing. So conceived, psychoanalytic treatment is characterized by its aim---to increase the patient's knowledge of himself and others and hence his freedom of choice in the conduct of his life; by its method---the analysis of communications, rules, and games; and lastly, by its social context---a contractual, rather than a 'therapeutic,' relationship between analyst and analysand. In sum, I shall attempt to define the nature of psychoanalysis; clarify its limits; and establish its proper relations to other forms of psychotherapy, medicine, ethics, and social science.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"I have occasionally done this, referring to (Szasz's form of psychotherapy) as 'autonomous psychotherapy.' I chose this expression to indicate the paramount aim of this procedure: preservation and expansion of the client's autonomy.\\"\\"My thesis is that the practice of analytic technique issues from the personality of the analyst and can never be distinct from it.\\"\\"This does not mean that I advocate a nondirective technique. The autonomous therapist is not a dummy echoing what the patient says;... The analyst ... participates actively and meaningfully in a particular kind of dialogue.\\"\\"(The therapist's) task is, first, not to diagnose the patient, but to engage him in a meaningful dialogue and, second, not to try to collect data from the patient, but to relay appropriate information to him.\\"\\"Despite the inverse relationship between man's wish to control his fellow man and his wish to understand him, psychotherapists seem to have wanted the best of two incompatible worlds.

He read from age three. He took pleasure in conversation. His first literary success was an essay on Milton, 1825. He was appointed a member of the Supreme Council of India.Joseph Addison resided at Magdalen College, Oxford for ten years. He was elected a fellow. His serious attention was concentrated on Latin Poetry. His classical knowledge was confined within narrow limits. Addison imitated Virgil with skill. He was probably introduced by Dryden to Congreve.In 1700 Addison was in France and subsequently in Genoa. Addison was not mean, he was not cowardly. He wrote with a delicate and humane sense of humor. He was in Parliament for nine years. His influence was the result of his literary talents. Addison did not speak in the chamber.Steele had known Addison from childhood. The best writing in THE TATLER was the handiwork of Addison. In 1711 THE SPECTATOR was conceived by Addison. Steele sketched the two friends. About three-sevenths of the work was done by Addison. At the close of 1712 THE SPECTATOR ceased to appear. Swift showed respect and tenderness for Addison.Milton is best known by his poetry. He admired Euripides. The only poem of modern times PARADISE LOST can be compared to is THE DIVINE COMEDY. THE DIVINE COMEDY is a personal narrative. Milton wrote in an age of philosophers and theologians. Milton's fiends are wonderful creations. Dante had intensity of feeling, Milton loftiness of spirit. The strength of Milton's mind overcame every calamity.Macaulay has an admirably compressed style. His focus is on character and personality in regard to his subjects."},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"I was given this book and decided to read it in preparation for Holy Week. While I am not a big fan of historical fiction or historical/religious fiction, I thought that Malchus looked interesting, and indeed it was.The story revolves around the High Priest's slave and his view of the events surrounding Jesus and his journey into becoming a follower. I enjoyed this book and it has made me interested in looking at more historical fiction in the future. I think that Griffiths may have gone too far in making all jewish characters look bad and non-jewish characters look good, when in reality there should have been a mix. But overall this is quite a good story, even if it is only a fictionalized snapshot of what transpired. Still, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"What a wonderful story! In this fictional rendering of Malchus, the slave of the high priest famous for losing an ear to the Apostle Peter, we are treated to one possible insider's view of first century slavery, religious corruption and, most importantly, Jesus. While there is much detail to debate and discuss, the story is well written, enjoyable, believable (mostly!) and very thought provoking. It reminds us again that the world into which the Bible was written was, at the same time, very much like our own and yet very different. While we can relate to the shallow, selfish evils of humanity depicted, there is much about the culture of the Gospel completely foreign to us. This makes for very interesting reading."},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"This is a good view of the triumpial entry and Christs lasts days on earth from the perspective of the high priests right hand man/jewish slave.

G. Griffiths's opus \\"Malchus\\" started with a promising premise: a slave's view of the events surrounding the last days & death of Jesus of Nazareth. The result was a poorly drawn story of Caiaphas's slave & his conversion to the new faith...the standard tale of Christian redemption without the benefit of historical research or plausible characterization. All the Jews come out bad in this book starting with the high priest and his cohorts in the Temple and devolves into the predictable artifice of the poor country Jew who \\"sees the light\\" and follows the Galilean --such as the old man Japeth who presented the donkey ridden on Palm Sunday. Very little of the story is spent in capturing the times in any believable fashion: it's the same tired Christian Literature technique of telescoping two thousand years of history and religion into the simplistic presentation of \\"Malchus.\\" The two-dimensional characters hardly flesh out the period adequately to make this book any where near satisfying. This reviewer has read other books with better research (The Theones' \\"First Light\\" series), a clearer understanding of the historical/cultural dynamics of the period (Randall Ingermanson) and more sympathetic to the Jewish perspective (Anne Rice); so, I know those stories are out there & possible. Griffiths disappoints at all levels and reveals this book to be self-indulgent: another hackneyed attempt at justifying the Christian worldview before there even was Christianity."},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"Very rarely will I give 5 stars to 2 books from the same author. I had to read MALCHUS after reading Griffiths' DRIVEN, a 400 page thriller I read practically non-stop until the last word. I figured DRIVEN would be impossible to top but had to give him the chance. I still haven't decided which book I like best. Besides gripping me with suspence, lovable characters and excellent writing, DRIVEN stirred my conscious to wonderment. MALCHUS on the other hand has changed my way of thinking. The same excellent writing style, great characters (mostly non-fiction in this one) and touching moments that literally brought me to tears at times. I am a regular in the historical fiction genre, and this book is reaserched to the max. Where did Griffiths ever find the names of the actual priests that were plotting Jesus' arrest and their job descriptions in the temple? And half way through the book I was in a sweat, thinking if I put the book down the cosequenses of whatever was to happen next would be on my head. Breathtaking, really.

I have now purchased Driven, and find it hard to put down, also!"},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"Interesting that author used not much used Malchus in only one verse (John 18:10) in the Bible with unknown background into a story that could have happened with some Biblical truth surrounding Jesus and scriptures interwined into a great novel.What I like about this book is that author used characters in the story, who believed in Jesus, take a firm stand for what they believe in, no matter the circumstances to save themselves or to die for the truth and faith in Jesus. That's one way to help and encourage the Christian readers to spread Good News as well as non-Christian readers to learn more about Jesus while it's enjoyable to read at the same time.To learn more about truth, it's best to read from the Bible and can use this Malchus novel as reference with scriptures being used and surroundings around Jesus' life in the novel.Updated 3/27/05I recently ordered \\"The Witness\\" by this same author. Be forewarned that \\"Malchus\\" was formerly titled under \\"The Witness\\". Both are the same book. I wasted my money on the second book.

I wish Amazon left description on the former title, so I wouldn't have ordered the book in the first place!"},{"Title":"Malchus","review":"I expected the story of Jesus through the eyes of Malchus but what I received was the story of Malchus through the eyes of Malchus. Jesus did play a part and was the power behind the story but what we have here is a story of a cynical slave who ends up being in the right place at the right time (although he doesn't think so at the time). Although this is a historical novel the reader is not bogged down with facts and figures but is led through a believable journey set during the most amazing events in world history. Malchus is believable and likable, written in a way that is easy and enjoyable to read. We feel what he experiences and come to know him as a friend.This is my first W.G. Griffith book and will not be my last. His writing style is easy to read but not immature. Griffith pens a story that clearly shows the power of the cross and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. I like that fact that he shows a sharp line between religion and truth. He also did not shy away from the corruption of the Jewish religious leaders of the time even though there are those today who take issue with it.If you are looking for a really good historical novel that reads like a story that could take place today then get yourself this book. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.1 Star = Pathetic2 Stars = Fair3 Stars = Good4 Stars = Excellent5 Stars = Life changingFor those who give me a negative vote on my review please comment and let me know why.

Griffiths becomes a Master storyteller in an unforgettable journey through the eyes of Malchus, the main character who comes to life in a thrilling story made for the movie screen. Can we relate to the selfish evils of humanity, and do we think about what the last days on earth might feel like? How many times have we read the Bible, and did your point of view change about the chilling events that took place? Does the Crucifixion give you a new perspective on life, and does this remarkable story reflect on our own strength? I highly recommend this enchanting book to all historical fiction lovers, Christian readers, and anyone who enjoys inspirational stories. Through the use of extensive research, this intriguing book can be used as a reference with Scriptures as it conveys the true meaning of the word 'Christian.' In this fictional rendering of Malchus, the reader is taken to different places and events as we contemplate on religious corruption, first century slavery and the life of Jesus, while we focus on our own faith. This incredible story is filled with creativity from the beginning with explosive action throughout, then ends as a Triumph!

The indenting got fouled up on many of the soucrce code samples (typestting problem?) so as to confuse a python/jython novice like me. The author will occassionally show you a bit of source code and then show you output from the execution of what is clearly a different source file. This is very distracting and if I didn't already have some inkling of how Jython works I'd really have a hard time with this book. Sure seems a shame becuase the explanations of the source code are more complete than you'll find an a typical intro book and this is really very helpful in tracking down the author's/typsetters errors and getting the reader REALLY familiar with the inner workings of Jython. The Sample files on the author's website do help clear up the code errors in most cases.2) Bear in mind that the author goes out of his way to familiarize you with the basics of Python, so he can get to the Java integration. For this reason the reader is really getting an introduction to Jython. This is ok since the author points this out in the opening of the book and guides you to pertinant sections if you have experience with Python, C++, Java or OOAD in general.Had I to do it over again I probably would wait for a second edition with the code errors corrected. But if you really need a good low level intro to Python, this book, warts and all, has been more valuable than other titles that introduce the language. I attribute this to the really detailed 'plain english' explanations of the code.To be fair I can't comment on the Java integration portions (the sample code or the writing) as I'm just finishing chapter 6, so I'm still learning about jython itself)."},{"Title":"Python Programming with the Java Class Libraries: A Tutorial for Building Web and Enterprise Applications with Jython","review":"This book focuses heavily on demonstrating key concepts with the Jython interactive interpreter. While this method is not entirely without its drawbacks, it has the distinct benefit of letting you try out code one line or block at a time (which is one of my favorite benefits of Python in general).Some books are noted for their depth, others for correctness, some for the range of concepts introduced, etc. And of these, I'd say that this book demonstrates the absolute basics of a wide range of Jython areas better than anything else I've read so far. It's the sort of book you can pick up, open to the middle of, and start coding quickly (assuming your system is set up properly, of course).While there is room for improvement in future editions, this seems like a good first edition."},{"Title":"Python Programming with the Java Class Libraries: A Tutorial for Building Web and Enterprise Applications with Jython","review":"The content of this book is excellent.

I also use it for a reference.I find it quite handy."},{"Title":"Philosophical Texts (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","review":"Leibniz is indeed one of the most important and influential of philosophers and also one of the least examined, perhaps even among students of philosophy. He is most known for his contributions to mathematics, theology, and physics while his philosophical views are most often perceived through Voltaire's popular, but rather superficial mocking of his arguments regarding \\"possible worlds.\\" But Leibniz' \\"best of all possible worlds\\" view is more subtle and robust than Voltaire was willing to see. The argument is not that the world is perfect -- certainly not if taken from any single, topical point of view, but that \\"in producing the universe [God] chose the best possible design, in which there was the greatest variety, together with the greatest order.\\" One may dispute Leibniz' general view and/or aspects of his justification of it, but as Leibniz developed the argument along the lines of possibility, contingency, and necessity, it is difficult to see how one would logically disprove it. It has had to be enough for detractors to declare that they disagree with, or dislike the argument.The famous argument is a recurring thread and summation in this Oxford Philosophical Texts volume edited by Woolhouse and Francks. Here is certainly a book that belongs in the library of any student of philosophy. As is noted in the editor's introduction, a recent biographer has written of Leibniz -- \\"Even if he had only contributed to one field, such as law, history, politics, linguistics, theology, logic, technology, mathematics, science, or philosophy his achievement would have earned him a place in history. Yet he contributed to all these fields, not as a dilettante but as an innovator able to lead the specialists.\\" But even in the reasoning of such a magnificent mind there are problems and weaknesses (which tells us a great deal about philosophy and the human mind!). I won't explore the main difficulties that I found. I share one of the concerns expressed by Antoine Arnauld in his correspondence with Leibniz, as well as a few others.Leibniz draws first from classical schools of thought, the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics (while wise ancient philosophers will always need rehabilitation, they \\"were not so far from the truth, nor so ridiculous as the common run of our new philosophers suppose.\\"). He mostly rejects the Scholastics as well as the popular influences of European thought, Hobbes and Spinoza. With modification, he rehabilitates Aristotle's \\"entelechies,\\" which become his \\"monads\\" (from the Greek, 'monas', meaning unity, or that which is one). A monad is the universe \\"from a point of view\\". Matter is understood as phenomena, not substance. Substance (for example number or mind) is irreducible, matter is a composite. Leibniz' view is amenable to Pythagoras and in many ways to both quantum theory (in the \\"quarks and gluons\\" model, the \\"solidity\\" of matter is merely a phenomena of the gluon force, and voids in space-time are not exactly voids) and to so-called string theories. One might say it is amenable to grand unification theory as well. Leibniz also hinted bluntly of Einstein's Relativity, repeatedly stating that there is no such thing as a physical state of absolute rest, motion, or time, as they are all \\"relativities.\\" Newton, for all his genius, got that wrong (as regards time, that is).I could go on and on, there are many pregnant themes in this collection of essays, articles, and correspondence (for example, \\"the present is big with the future\\"). Trying to keep this brief, I will simply suggest you read Leibniz (but do not skip the excellent introduction in this volume). Histories place him in Newton's shadow, which is unfortunate; as a philosopher, he certainly does not belong there. As regards the comparisons, Leibniz' mathematics was more elegant, his physics more far-sighted, his theology better by almost any standard. It seems he had a nicer personality too. His influence on such divergent thinkers as Kant, Russell, and Plantinga indicates his continuing importance."},{"Title":"Philosophical Texts (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","review":"A very good textbook, but with poor emphasis on Leibniz's mathematical work. I did't put four stars since it is a book intended for philosophers, or more precisely, students of philosophy, but I believe that no course on Leibniz can be complete without placing emphasis on his mathematical views, and their influence on his philosophical views."},{"Title":"The Framing of the Fourteenth Amendment","review":"I have been interested in the Fourteenth Amendment for some years. There is always one aspect or another being discussed in political circles. There are also a myriad of court decisions based upon it. To gain a better understanding of these issues I wished to better understand the 14th Amendment itself. This book is a great start. I bought it used from a seller here on Amazon.Com. It had apparently been used as a text in a college class. There was a lot of writing in it but I didn't care. The book is an excellent resource for learning about the origins of the 14th Amendment and just what exactly the writers intended to accomplish by adding this change to the Constitution. It is more of an academic work than one for pleasure reading but that's what I wanted. I detected no political bias in the writing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"Often when a Voyager novel is included in a crossover series it falls flat. Seemingly just along for the ride. &quot;No Man's Land&quot; certainly did not fall flat. It's an enjoyable, if not outstanding read. But it as far as placing it among the other Gateways books it does feel as if it's just along for the ride. Perhaps because the plot is so far removed from the main story line of the series. Author Christie Golden always captures the Voyager crew members very well. Her characterizations in &quot;No Man's Land&quot; are one of the books highlights. With a deft touch she brings the crew and factious aliens to life, leaving you despising some while admiring others.Set during the sixth season of Voyager, the crew is beginning to feel like they will actually be getting home someday. The recent contact with Starfleet has raised hopes and spirits. But directly in their path lies an extremely hazardous region of space that the crew dubs 'No Man's Land'. After deciding that traveling around the region is not an option, Janeway concludes that they could all benefit from a little R &amp; R on a nearby uninhabited class-M planet before the ship undertakes thislatest challenge.Shore leave is cut short when a mysterious portal opens on the planet depositing one very lost and confused alien canine. Investigation of the portal provides no answers and the crew seems to have acquired a grateful mascot when suddenly large portals begin to open all around Voyager in the surrounding space. Voyager soon finds itself overwhelmed and outnumbered by ships from all over the galaxy that have suddenly found themselves displaced. 62 vessels, representing 48 differentraces, most previously unknown, all lost along with Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.By now the crew has realized that these portals are some kind of Gateways. Gateways which seem to have closed, at least for the moment. Janeway decides to extend Voyager's companionship, protection and assistance to any of the vessels that wish to accompany them on their travels. Hoping that by working together they can solve the mystery of the Gateways, share resources and all somehow arrive home. A number of the ships, representing very diverse species decide to take Janeway up on her offer. Some of these species are obviously peaceful. Others arrogant or hostile.As this ragtag fleet of disparate ships sets out they have no way of knowing what dangers lie ahead as they attempt to traverse 'No Man's Land'. Or if they can truly trust each other. One thing after another goes wrong with the situation quickly becoming even more tense and desperate. The Gateways keep reappearing and disappearing. Each contact draining the ships of power. Just as it seems that they may all be forced to abandon their vessels Janeway makes the decision to step through a Gateway and try to discover if the answer to finding a way home can be found in what lays beyond.&quot;No Man's Land&quot; is a very short, light and fast read. The plot moves quickly. While there is nothing particularly outstanding about the story it is filled with interesting characters and has nice touches of humor. The story never really develops a sense of urgency, although it does present a number of small mysteries and subplots."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"I don't know what to say about this book. For a Star Trek story, it was good, not the greatest thing but a good book. For a Voyager story it was even better, Janeway's ability to lead and conquer impossible situations shines though in this book. For the Gateways series... this book was useless.I'm a huge Voyager fan, so this was the very first Gateways book I read. After reading it I thought it was phenominal, Janeway, all alone in the Delta Quadrant, happens upon SEVERAL other ships now also lost with her. Some of them friendly, some of them hostile, some of them at war back on their home planets, and some of them (the Hirogen) who are supposed to be enemies but don't seem to be. And then the end (in book 7) was &quot;WOW.&quot;But, now I've read three other Gateways books (TNG, DS9, and NF), and I have found that the Voyager installation in the Gateways series really had absolutely nothing to do with the Gateways in the other books. The only link is that you find out where the Iconians got the Gateways to begin with. But the Gateways in Voyager were not of the same sort as those in the other series, making this a useless read if you want to follow the Gateways series specifically.My recommendation here is if you like Voyager and want to see some typical Janeway diplomacy and tough-as-nails leadership read this book. But if you are only getting this book for the Gateways' series skip it."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"Let me start by saying it would be just plain impossible for me to give a bad review to Christie Golden. Sorry, but I just can't do it. As an added bonus, she used the word &quot;gibe&quot; correctly. This alone was worth the read. (An inside joke, to be sure, but it still counts for me.)Unfortunately, I could give this one only three stars because the story itself is pretty watery, though I don't necessarily blame Christie for it. She wrote a VOY novel set prior to the series end, as part of a crossover series of stories. I wouldn't wish for a worse set of parameters! No way can a VOY story with these kinds of limitations ever hope to be anything more than a swift ride with Janeway at the helm.And that's just what this one is. Strange gateways open in Delta Quadrant space, spilling out all manner of ships, containing friend and foe alike. Janeway herds and leads. Things happen. Up pops a dangerous nebula. Janeway leads the caravan through. More things happen. In the end, we find Janeway herself going through a gateway on a planet and disappearing - thus the set-up for the conclusion, contained, together with conclusions of the other five books in this series, in Book Seven of the Gateways series. One thin thread keeps this story bound together, but it seems a bit far-&quot;fetched.&quot;"},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"This book stands alone as much as any of the 5 Gateways I've read, except that like the others, it says &quot;to be continued&quot; in book 7. However, the story to this point does have some partial conclusion. It is a good Voyager story and involves all the crew, but a lot of focus is on Janeway's dilemas leading the caravan. I must say it isn't totally clear why ships from all over the galaxy would want to follow Voyager the direction they are going, especially since danger lies that way. But once you get past that, OK."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"This is a very good book. It has Captain Janeway in a very sticky stitution. She must lead a fleet of alien ships through a dangerous sector of space and most don't trust or even like her! This book is good on how it has Janeway and the crew deal with slavery, greed and just plain rotten people. Seven has some interesting sceens in this book which makes it even better. The books first two chapters are a little slow but it picks up. An all around good Star Trek adventure."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"Christie Golden can now be called the &quot;Official Voyager Novelist&quot; as most Voyager books coming out are under her moniker. This stood out as one of the better novels in the Gateways series, but the reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was that this book could have been a stand-alone novel. This book was about Voyager leading a fleet of miss-matched vessels through some hazards in the Delta Quadrant. As it was in the Gateways series, the tagline was:&quot;Voyager leads a fleet of mismatched vessels through some hazards while trying to avoid the Iconian Gateways in the Delta Quadrant.&quot;It could have been:&quot;Voyager leads a fleet of mismatched vessels through some hazards while trying to avoid the [insert random space/time distortions] in the Delta Quadrant.&quot;Very good book, though."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"This book is easily the weakest of the Gateways series so far. Part of it can be blamed on the fact that the Voyager is simply too far away from the events that are taking place in the Alpha Quadrant to get the reader to care much (whereas the TNG, DS9 and NF appear to share a common linking thread of seeing the various crews work toward the same goal and getting three different perspectives on that, the Voyager book finds the crew outside the loop and thus, clueless as to what is going on, which is frustrating. Had this book been the first of the series, it might have been better). Another problem with the book is that the characters are too one-dimensional--including the new aliens we meet. It's obvious who the good and the bad guys are from the beginning. Finally, the ending of the novel is far too forced to be believed. I found myself wanting to throw the book aside in frustration several times in the final 50 or so pages.The book is very loosely linked to the Gateways saga. There are times when the Gateways concept seems forced upon the book--almost as if the author had a good idea for a story but was forced to make it fit into the current series. Overall this leads to a lot of my dissatisfaction with this book."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"A++++i love it, thank you , thank you thank you, thank you , thank you , thank you="},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"And it IS a fun book. Its too bad that like the other Gateways books, it is really only a boo..., because there is no ending in this volume. This was a Gateways series \\"marketing ploy\\" to force customers to buy an extra book that they should not have had to buy. In the history of publishing I cannot think of a time where the end of 6 books were held ransom before. It was sleazy, and there is no other way to express it. Most of the Gateways books are missing both a beginning and an ending. This book, given that you are familiar with Voyager basics at all, doesn't have that problem. It is only missing the ending, and I have docked it one star for that.Now for this book itself. The author captured the Voyager crew well, although some of the main characters get relatively short shrift. In an entire book, I would expect important characters in the show to play more than brief utility roles, as happens in this book.As a Gateways story, this book is operating out to the side somewhere. The gateways are very different from the gateways in the other books (which you can \\"see through\\"), and they are inexplicably numerous. Possibly the \\"ending\\" in book seven explains this, but that isn't part of this book, so it doesn't count. I docked a second star because the book makes no attempt to fit in with how gateways work in the other books, and it is after all supposed to be part of the framework of the Gateways' series, hence the verbiage on the cover.The story itself is interesting and involving, if not particularly exciting. Voyager encounters a large number of alien races all at once. The problems that arise and the intricacies of dealing with all these races at once is well handled by the author. The book even has a large scale murder mystery, which while introduced late and not left hanging for long, was also interesting while the plot element was active.I found that the motivations of the characters and various races held together very well, with one exception. A race which kept \\"disposable\\" slaves on its ship was a major plot element. A portion of the slave-holding race resolved this inherent conflict a bit too simply and easily. It seemed like the author ran out of steam and just wrote that conflict out of the story rather than put in the effort to deal with it.In another circumstance, tension between two races who had been in conflict for centuries, and about which the author gave us a major foreshadow, likewise was terminated in a short and simplistic manner, and in a way that invalidated the foreshadow. Frankly, the book could have been twice as long if these two plot elements had been fully fleshed out, and maybe that was the problem. Possibly the publisher told her to be done with them and deliver a book that would print to a certain number of pages. If that was the case, the story would have been better served to drop one of these sub-plots and complete the other one. As the book stands, the ending to neither sub-plot is at all satisfying.Despite these problems, the book was an enjoyable read, and possibly from the standpoint of just sitting back and enjoying the read, the best of the series so far. At this writing I have read the TOS, New Earth, DS9, and Voyager books, upon advice to save the TNG book for last, even tho it is numbered third in the series.I bought all these books used from Amazon sellers, and in every case so far I'm glad I didn't pay full price for them."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"This may well be the best of the \\"Gateways\\" miniseries; the story is quite good, with an interesting plot, good characterizations, and good pacing. Unfortunately, it has the inevitable problem suffered by all of the books in this series: it ends on a cliffhanger. The first six books of the series are all incomplete, leaving their endings for book seven; book seven has no plot of its own, being simply six story endings. The concept was a cheesy excuse to sell an extra book; none of the first six books would have been made unduly long by including its ending, so there was no excuse other than marketing for arranging the series the way it was arranged.If, like me, you are foolish enough to want to read all Star Trek novels, and are therefore intent on reading this series, I would suggest getting the whole series before beginning, and reading each book followed by its complementary segment in book seven, rather than reading each of the first six books before continuing to book seven. Of all the books in the series, this might really be the only one even marginally worth doing so for, but I'm unconvinced that even this story is worth the price of two books (which is what you need to buy in order to have it).If, on the other hand, you actually LIKE cliffhanger endings and \\"come back next week, same bat time, same bat channel\\" stories, you'll LOVE this one."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"I must say Christie Golden knows the characters of Voyager all too well and how to portray them in her wonderful writing. She styles them in a format that you could not tell was different from the television shows. But there was a typo- for starters this book takes place late in Season 6. She accidently calls Pairs (Lieutenant) a rank that he did not have during this time but regains in Unimatrix Zero. But throughout the rest of the book she refers to him by Ensign. Overall, I think the Gateway saga could have been the most thrilling for Voyager- the possiblity of returning home? This could have been another good 2 parter episode for their return home. I have not read any of the other Gateway books, but this could have been the most interesting saga of linking distance galaxies and other dimensions! Overall Golden has a lot of humor in this book something that has lacked throughout the Voyager novels along with Fluffly/Barkley. Great book and great to see the Hirogen make a come back!"},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"I am usually wary of anything that deals with the Voyager series. The few Voyager novels that I have read though have been superior to the TV series. This is one of those novels. The author captures what was really the best qualities of the series and the characters. Here all the characters have something to do not like the TV series where it became the 7 of 9 show. Nothing wrong with that but variety would have been nice. Here we get to see Janeway as a strong leader. Not someone that sometime became irrational as shown on the show at times. Janeway and Chakotay have a strong bond here which I approve but differed from the series finale. This is more appropriate and logical not the crazy pairing they did at the end. I also liked the fact the author show us all these different alien species and some of the older ones of the TV series. The book has good action and has some cute, light moments. It is not perfect but the Gateway series has definately picked up from book 2 and has done well after that. Hopefully book 6 will be good too."},{"Title":"No Man's Land (Star Trek Voyager: Gateways, Book 5)","review":"I am very pleased with this book and the seller. I received it promptly and as described.

The author shows a basic equation, but also provides some quick lookup tables to save time on calculations. This section does give a sense of how money can grow. Most other personal finance books don't even discuss the math or give examples, and I think everybody should understand the basic math behind this concept, as it applies to anything that gains interest (your investments, bank accounts, etc.) or charges interest (your credit card, mortgage, etc.)The other thing that was good were the worksheet examples to allow you to tabulate your expenses and do a net worth analysis (list your assets and liabilities).But for many other topics in the book, it gives too general description of the topics, and it does not offer too many examples or anecdotes to help reinforce the concepts.

In the 150 years since rail service began there, Toledo has been served by 35 railroads (down to four now). The photographs show Toledo's rail services through bridges, roundhouses, stations, yards, and of course equipment.I find something wonderful about looking at a photographic history like this. These pictures tell a story different than all the descriptions that anyone could write. They show how it really was. The casual things like the man working in the switch tower wearing a suit.

It's not an instructional book although you can get lots of ideas from looking at the classic and contemporary drawings included.

While there are topics like composition, light and shadow or perspective, they are mainly to introduce such concepts to beginners.The book is heavy on subjects. The main chapters are on animals, botany, architecture, still life, body, portraits, costumes, imagination and many more.It's a general guide to sketching and understanding the different sides to it. It's a bit too general for me though. For drawing books, I prefer those that are dedicated to specific subjects.It's an interesting book to flip through, and isn't too expensive.The US version of this book is \\"Sketch Book for the Artist\\".

But the point is that this book was a good motivator to give it a go and learn so that the next one will be better. IF you're looking for a beginners how to book, I would suggest you pass on this one for now only because I think it's a book you will appreciate more once you have been drawing for a while.

Forget the fact that it seems to be printed on paper three grades below newsprint. Pay no attention to its external dimensions, which are smaller than most hardback novels. Although it's natural to be skeptical about any book that has \\"complete\\" in its title, lets ignore that. The key question is: What's inside the book?Why did I get such a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling when I started to thumb through the it? Turning to the table of contents I soon realized why some of the material seemed so familiar. The entire book is made up of chapters from other books! Do you own the book Mastering Photoshop 6? Well six chapters of that book show up in this one. All in all about 8 books were raided in order to compose this one volume.Now if you don't own any of those 8 books, then by all means consider buying this one. It does have a lot of useful information in it, and it certainly won't require you to take out a three-year loan to pay for it.

What Fr. Canatalamessa says in this book is that the Charismatic Renewal is for every Catholic--it is a renewal and unleashing of the graces received in sacramental Baptism and Confirmation and in the other sacraments. In nine chapters, he explains clearly and simply but with the precision and balance of the first-rate theologian that he is how the renewal relates to the sacramental system of the Church and to Christian life. He even critiques some of the excesses of some charismatics who become puffed up over their charisms (as the Corinthians did in the first century!) and those individuals who want to receive charisms but still remain in objective situations of mortal sin, especially in the area of sexual morality (again reminders of the Corinthians to whom Paul wrote in the first century). These critiques show the wisdom, prudence, and balance of Fr. Cantalamessa. Yet, none of the warts in any way suppresses the enthusiasm of Fr. Cantalamessa for the action of the Holy Spirit in the renewal and its promise for the Church. His book is prophetic and calls all Catholics to open up to the abundant, joyful, and full life of the Spirit. The title of the book is taken from a Latin quote from St. Ambrose that is translated: \\"Let us drink the sober intoxication of the Spirit with joy!\\" Fr. Cantalamessa persuasively and soberly invites each of us to this new, joyful, and uplifting intoxication. If a non-charismatic Catholic wants an introduction to the Charismatic Renewal, I can think of none better or more authoritative for these times. We are fortunate to have these collected talks translated into English. You can find a fuller review at the above blog link (Oct. 24, 2005, post)."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"Cantalamessa, the papal preacher of Pope John Paul II's household, presents a collection of teachings on the Catholic Charismatic renewal, known in Italy, as \\"the renewal of the Spirit.\\" He begins with an explanation of the term \\"sober intoxication of the Spirit\\" used by the Fathers of the Church: \\"an enthusiasm based on the cross and nourished by the cross.\\" Within the charismatic renewal movement, this enthusiasm, is demonstrated through \\"spontaneous and creative prayer, songs, tongues, and the joy of being brothers and sisters and of being nourished by the pure milk of the word of God...and a firm commitment to building the kingdom of God within us and in the Church.\\"Cantalamessa describes virtues and actions that mark the renewal of the spirit today, and shows their roots in scripture. He addresses humility, which always involves something negative, as \\"self-denial, a renunciation of anything that is wrong in our intentions and our actions, an abasement of ourselves before we move in the direction of others,\\" linking the experience to Jesus's \\"descending.\\" He also explains the charisms, spiritual baptism, and the healing power of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is healer of both mind and body, he writes, including the mental illnesses of unbelief, idolatry, and superstition and heart diseases such as lack of will, the will to power, and the spirit of slavery.This work is rich in details of the charismatic renewal and its role in establishing the Kingdom."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"There are many people who confuse the accidental (people waving their arms and clapping, being \\"slain in the spirit\\" etc) with the essential (the recognition of the action of the Holy Spirit in the Church.) In this book Fr. Cantalamessa seeks to clear up such misunderstandings, to lay a foundation of what the renewal in the Spirit means, and to further explain the importance of it.Fr. Cantalamessa shares annecdotes from his life and the lives of others that witness to the action of the Holy Spirit through the ages, and of the sanctifying and transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of people to this very day. This is certainly an instructive book in understanding what the Renewal in the Spirit is, what it is not, and the impacy it can have upon the lives of individual Christians and upon the Church."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"This is a brilliant treatment of the presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the world today. It is filled with the wisdom of a man who is Preacher to the Papal Household for several popes; he gives retreats to the popes. Still Father Cantalamesssa writes in an easy-to-read-and-understand style, with very practical advice and encouragement. This is a hopeful, helpful book for anyone who is serious about their faith and desires to live a more God-centered life in Christ Jesus."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"There is a great deal of hype and emotionalism in the so-called Charismatic Renewal movement. At times it seems people flock to the next exciting location or other always looking for that next spiritual high. But Fr. Cantalamessa is quick to remind us that any renewal that does not bear fruit for repentance is no renewal at all. He reminds us of the great paradox of being drunk in the Spirit as not some emotional movement that puts us out of our right minds - it is a sober intoxication that leads us to our right minds, renewed in the Spirit of truth. We should be suspicious of any movement that promises intoxication without renewing our minds and our hearts. Our spiritual enemy knows our tendency to follow the latest exciting fad and uses that tendency against us. Fr. Cantalamessa calls us back to be sober minded and wise as serpents in examining our hearts for the true intoxication of the Spirit.A wonderful work that guides us back to focus on the giver rather than the gifts and challenges us to live our lives worthy of the calling to which we have been called. Come Holy Spirit, renew our minds with the sober intoxication that comes only from You."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"This humble, yet profound book about the baptism of the Holy Spirit in peoples lives is a much needed bridge between the Catholic Charismatic renewal and other Spirit filled parts of the Church (ie Pentecostal, Protostant Evangelical Charismatics etc). Having been beautifully raised in the Catholic Church in Australia, it was from other denominations that I experienced the life giving baptism of the Holy Spirit. This book is so helpful in communicating to other Catholics how God would love to pour out His love and Spirit on ALL believers if they would allow Him.God has placed this man in the centre of the Catholic Church to be His voice and I thank God for the Holy Spirit's work in Fr Raniero to keep his eyes fixed on Christ and be led by Him alone."},{"Title":"Sober Intoxication of the Spirit: Filled With the Fullness of God","review":"This is a very readable book.

Charismatic Christians (Pentecostals, Vineyard, Assemblies of God) tend to accept the &#34;official creed&#34; about the Person and works of the Holy Spirit.

She is recovering from a near tragic relationship with Boyd from book 5, and World War II looms bigger and bigger. Between jobs as the book opens, Christine attends the wedding of her big brother and meets another Mountie, Laray. Is it love? Unable to decided, Christine leaves and cares for her injured Aunt Mary. She discovers a worthwhile ministry at the local Hope Canteen, sharing Christ with young servicemen and women. An automobile accident proves pivotal for both the story line and Christine's life. Oke introduces a handsome young resident at the hospital whose family helped found the town. Christine is torn about her future which seems to revolve around her beloved North.

She builds up a romantic story line and then skips over into another story entirely. I must admit I like the stories about settlers better than the more modern settings and situations. I suppose the wars aren't that modern but they're a less innocent time. I felt like she had cheated her readers by rushing this to press before taking the time to edit it properly. She had proved herself in the past and I'll buy her books again but it was really disapointing. A writer who can write Roses For Mama can do a lot better."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about the Delaney's kids. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured; either way, these two books were not that great. The sixth one was especially aggravating! The character development was poor; the plot was choppy. It was as if the author was trying to minimize words, frequently giving summaries of what had just occurred, rather than allowing you to enjoy it yourself. Without spoiling, the romance aspect of this book completely failed, and was completely unbelievable. Stick with the original four and skip the latter two."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"As an avid christian fiction reader, I eagerly await new books by my favorite authors. This book was well worth the wait. I don't know about anyone else, but I was disappointed when Janette Oke ended the Canadian West series a number of years ago. I was incredibly pleased to see her continue on last year, with &quot;Beyond the Gathering Storm&quot; and I have been anxiously awaiting this book. It is supurbly written and was satisfying in the end. There is just enough suspense to make it impossible to put down. It is a book that reminds the reader how important faith in God really is and that if you listen to Him, you will not choose the wrong path for you life. I am hoping that Oke decides to contine on with this series. I am looking forward to seeing these characters again. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"This book was merely ok for me. It starts right when Beyond the Gathering Storm lets off and continues the story of Christine. This time, Christine is the main character with no switching of point of view to her brother Henry. Her parents, Elizabeth and Wynn, feature slightly but are again, not the main characters.We find Christine living with her parents after the breakup of her relationship in the South where she subsequently loses her job as well. She is just about to look for another job when she gets the good news that her brother and his beloved Amber will be getting married at Christmas and would love if she would come early to help with things. This she agrees to readily.She and her mother first stop at Calgary to visit family and obtain some supplies, like fabric for a new suit for her position as bride's maid. While her mother stays in Calgary, she continues on to her brother's place.After the wedding, it is Christine's job to look after Danny, Amber's son. It is during this time that a certain young Mountie that we know from Beyond the Gathering Storm (one that was mauled by a bear actually) takes a special interest in her. While he is not pushy, Christine just isn't sure she is ready for a relationship yet. She leaves with him saying if she ever changes her mind, all she needs to do is send him a note.She stops briefly back home before going back to Edmonton to pursue a job. Here she finds one and is just hired when she gets the bad news that her Aunt in Calgary has fallen and hurt her back and needs a nursemaid. Knowing that it would be probably for the best, she goes to take care of her Aunt, abandoning the job she just had.The care of her Aunt goes well and soon she finds herself in a job in Calgary, thanks to her Uncle who was able to suggest it to her. With such happiness going on, they decide all family should come for Easter. When all but her brother Henry is there, they get bad news that he and his family have been in an accident. While they wait at the hospital visiting and looking after Henry and his family, she meets a young doctor who later turns out to have romantic pursuits.In addition to the doctor, a young priest also has been pursuing her and knows her from the volunteer work that she is doing for soldiers. However will she decide where her heart leads?There wasn't as much Christian emphasis in this book as there were in the rest of Oke's in my opinion. The only time she really brought it in was towards the end when Christine was seeking guidance towards making a decision. The way she did it, to me, was really strange. It involved Christine conversing with different quotes from the bible and while I realize people do this, it just seemed awkward to me. I think it was perhaps the way Oke wrote it rather than the situation actually being awkward.Another disappointment in this book for me, and the reason I only rated it three stars, was because I did not agree with the ending at all. While there were three guys to pick and choose from, she didn't choose the one I would have chosen for her. Oke had all possible logic leading to a certain one and then out of nowhere switches it up. It made it less of an enjoyable read for me.At least in this book, compared to the last, the characters were more believable. They weren't always perfect and were more fallible. This made it easier for me to connect with them.As always, Oke's writing is inoffensive and while she deals with some tough things, she doesn't go too far with them or get too descriptive in gory details.Overall, while I would have liked to see a better ending to the Canadian West series this wasn't terrible. It just isn't the end I would have chosen for it.When Tomorrow ComesCopyright 2001256 pages"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"Being a Janette Oke and looking forward to reading her books, I was disappointed that the book did not end in the way I had expected.

Why not? Plenty of real-life people have made decisions that way! There have also been cases of people in love with someone for years before they knew it, I'm glad the story wasn't like that. Perhaps the reviewer has never had such an experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything! It's great to have stories where people read the Bible and act on what they've learned, and Janette Oke is one of my favorite Christian writers!

Overall I thought it was an okay book, but the ending just didn't seem right. Even though Oke wanted us to finish the book with the feeling that Christine really was in love with Eric, I don't think she was. The day before she was supposed to make her decision about whether she wanted to continue seeing Eric seriously or not, she had no idea, then after just reading a chapter in Exodus she realized that she truly loves him?? Come on, really. I felt through the whole book that she and Henry's fellow RCMP Laray were a perfect match, esp. since he was going back to the North where she always felt that she belonged.

It is nice that there are books like this out there for Christian girls to read."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"I've been a huge fan of Janette oke since I was a young teen, and have continued to enjoy her books for the past decade. I must say though, that this was the first time ive ever been dissapointed by her. I read the first book in this series (When calls the Heart) when i was 14 or so and it was my favorite book for years. The next 5 in the series were all entertaining and just the right amount of romantic while providing a beautiful message of God's love and guidance. This book was just a mess. I found Christine's character to be painfully flat and uninteresting. Her reactions to the men who were interested in her were almost irritatingly self-centered. I know the end of the book where she spends a week \\"searching for God's guidance\\" was supposed to make up for it all, but I think it fell a little short. The way the book starts by setting up the romance between Christine and Laray and then just dropping it suddenly to start another romance with Eric makes it all feel unhinged. I guess it might have worked if the relationship had been at least romantic, but Christine is unsure of her feelings the whole time so it's really hard to understand where it's going. Anyway, I guess it's hard to write an amazing story EVERY single time...so 5 good books out of 6 ain't bad.."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West #6)","review":"I'll admit, I'm not a huge Oke fan, but she's decent. The characters were just all right in Beyond the Gathering Storm and When Tomorrow Comes...the plot twists are almost the only redeeming pt, though they do well in that role.

Five years of blogging about music and literature have taught me that the easiest thing to do with a blog is offend someone with your opinion.The stand out figure in my recent audit of 18th century British literature was Frances Burney. She is an appealing Author/Artist for several reasons:1. EARLY WOMAN AUTHOR.2. Daughter of well know 18th century musician/author Charles Burney.3. HAD PLENTY OF HITS: Evelina, Cecilia, Camilla.Burney published Evelina, her first book, in 1778- she was 26. It was a hit, though the combination of Burney's status as a single woman and the nascent state of the development of the market for literature combined to deprive her of financial rewards that would have equaled her critical success.Evelina was published anonymously, but that only lasted until the critics made their positive statements and the initial press of 2500 copies sold out. An important biographical fact of Frances Burney's life was her relationships with her \\"Daddies\\"(her words, not mine)- her actual father Charles Burney- court musician and author of the path breaking History of Music- and her \\"Uncle\\"- Samuel Crisp. It is Crisp whom Burney most often referred to as \\"Daddy\\" in her correspondence. Burney and Crisp played a crucial role in her career- a role best illustrated after the success of Evelina, when Frances decided to write a play.The play (never produced) was called The Witlings, and it was essentially a satire on modern life. Doody wrote this book before Seinfeld aired, but the over all tenor of the play would have to be described as Seinfeldian since it is essentially a \\"play about nothing.\\"Even after reading an entire chapter on the subject, it's still unclear to me why Crisp and Burney pere conspired to suppress The Witlings. The common take on this circumstances is that Burney/Crisp thought it was too \\"unladylike\\" for Frances to be writing plays, but if that was the case, they didn't put it like that. Rather they told her that the play was terrible, and too imitative of antecedent plays, and that she would, essentially, ruin her literary reputation as a result of its performance.By the time The Witlings had been suppressed it was 1781, and she was pressured to write a follow up- a book which became Cecilia. Burney wrote Cecilia for an existing Audience, one that anticipated the release. Cecilia was published in summer of 1782- either 30 or close to it- was the \\"age of spinster\\" in late 18th century London.In December of 1782, Burney met Owen Cambridge, a minister from a good family. They spent the next couple years in a halting court ship that resulted in no proposal. OUCH. After the Cambridge fiasco, Burney secured a job- via her father- as a lady in waiting to the Queen of England. She took her position in July of 1786- having wasted a full four years with Owen Cambridge. She was not excited to take the gig- it involved being \\"on call\\" day and night, and spending many an hour standing around and doing nothing at all.Ironically, it was her journals during this period of servitude that proved to be Burney's most enduring work before her late 20th century revival at the hands of feminist inspired literary scholars. She had a front seat to what we now of as \\"THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE\\"- she was right there, and taking notes the whole time. She managed to escape the clutches of the Queen, essentially by feigning severe illness, and was released with a 100 guinea a year life pension in 1791.She was now 39, unmarried, childless. So what does she do? She goes out and lands an exiled French military man and has a kid. Boom. Then to secure her lively hood she writes Camilia: Also a hit. BOOM. Eventually she ends up in France with her husband and her child, and never writes another hit, but lives up until 1840. She was... 88? When she died.There must be some interest in Burney- since Cambridge University just republished this book. I find Burney interesting because of her unique perspective on 18th century social practices and her status as an early successful Author/Artist. What's interesting is she was simultaneously an outsider (a young woman) and an insider (daughter of Charles Burney, court musician.)"},{"Title":"Renovate to Riches: Buy, Improve, and Flip Houses to Create Wealth","review":"I've remodeled and sold several houses and this book is as close to real world as any I've read.

At this point in time, an author had better have some new twist to the subject and write it well in order to justify going down this well worn path. Unfortunately, Mr. Dietz's twist isn't good enough for me to recommend it to others.'Earthrise' is the sequel to 'Deathday.' I'd received 'Earthrise' as a gift, discovered it was a sequel, and decided that I should see if I should buy the first book. Almost all of the reviews I read of both books rated them both at fair or poor. After reading a summary of 'Deathday' I realized that I didn't need to read it before 'Earthrise.' I picked up enough from the summary to know what the scene was: Earth had been invaded by insectoid aliens and was now enslaved.Dietz's twist was that the insectoid aliens were racist. In their hierarchal society, black bugs ruled, brown bugs were warriors, and white bugs were slaves. As such, when the bugs enslaved humans, they categorized them that way as well. For example, the black governor of Washington state is picked by the bugs to be the US president.So why did the bugs (who call themselves 'Saurons' - not too obvious that they're bad guys) invade Earth? They needed to reproduce. Apparently the entire species reproduces asexually at death, giving rise to a nymph that carries the genetic memory of its parent. It's an intriguing concept but every single bug all at the same time? That sounds far-fetched to me.In 'Earthrise', the President leads a resistance movement to take back Earth at the point when the bugs are spawning their nymphs. The humans are aided by another slave race that the bugs have brought with them through space. They're called the Ra 'Na. Their physical description makes them sound like otters, but they're a technically adept race who know more about the functioning of the bugs' starships than they do.So why the need for slaves? Well, the bugs have this millenial tradition of building great pyramids where the spawning is to take place. And tradition dictates that slaves have to haul large blocks of limestone into place, no superior technology allowed. Once the pyramids are built, the bugs plan on killing all but a handful of slaves, just to make sure that no one attempts to kill the nymphs while they're still vulnerable.There are alot of questions that I have regarding the bugs. Do they have an endoskeleton capable of supporting their massive exoskeletons? If not, why don't they collapse under their own weight? How did this spawning technique arise? And why only one nymph? If a whole species is spawning at once how did they come to their present size? Why weren't they eaten by predators on their homeworld millenia ago? Maybe the answers to these questions are in the first book.As for writing style, Dietz jumps all over the place. One page you're in Washington state, the next you're in Guatemala, and then you're in space on the bug ships. And so many characters are introduced that few stand out. Just as one character starts to be developed, he/she disappears for 40 pages. The end result is that the characters seem like cardboard props on a cluttered stage.I was leaning towards a 2 star rating but the ending was a letdown. I kept waiting for the book to build up to a climax but it never really happened. When it ended I actually said, 'That's it?!' The whole book reads like a series of events just strung together. There's no ebb and flow of drama. I never got the impression as I read certain events that they were pivotal moments in the book. It's only now that I've finished it that I can realize them for what they were. It was like driving over speed bumps when I should've felt like I needed to swerve to avoid fallen boulders on a mountain pass.In summary, if you're looking for a good alien invasion story, pass on this one."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"I was about half way through the first book when I read the reviews on this site. I wondered why most of them were negative. Sure, the action is confined to a small part of the world, the aliens are one dimensional and the good guys are stereotypical. But, for all that, I found myself enjoying it. That was until I hit the last third of the book. At about that point, I noticed that Dietz used the phrase &quot;the fact that&quot; and &quot;given the fact that&quot; every second paragraph. It really started to bug me and I found myself mentally rewording his sentences whenever I came across that particular piece of laziness.I bought this book because I wanted to see if it was as bad as the reviews depicted. Once again I found that the story was acceptable but this time saw that Dietz continues in the same patterns he fell into at the end of his previous effort. OK, he branches out a bit and adds &quot;that being the case&quot; and &quot;and so it was that&quot; to his repetoire of stock phrases but it happens that often that I wonder if anyone bothered to read, let alone edit, his manuscript. Even the characters, human and alien alike, start saying &quot;the fact that&quot; and &quot;given that&quot; by about half way through the book. It happens that often that I began to wonder if it was some sort of joke.Aside from the poorly written nature of this series, the one thing that annoyed me more than anything else was this: the Saurons live a long time. Every so often they die and a &quot;nymph&quot; takes their place, inheriting its ancestors' memories. One of the Sauron characters does some ground breaking research near the end of this book and discovers how to allow Saurons to have more than one nymph. From that I deduce that under normal circumstances, Saurons only have one nymph. How did the species propagate at all?Ultimately I found this book extremely annoying. Don't buy it. Instead poke yourself every 5 minutes with a pencil or other sharp object. The end effect is the same and you'll have saved yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"I bought this book because I bought the first book (yeah, I know not a real good excuse). You have the evil Sauron, which are basically beetles on steroids, The Ra Na, which a furry little dwarfs and a collection of human refugees.Humanity has been reduced to 3 billion souls. The only kind of religious fever that could survive in this apocalyptic world are white racists.Most of the action is confined to a revolt on the rbiting fleet and what remains of Washington State. (I don't know what happened to the rest of the world, but the last time I checked there were people in Asia, Africa and Europe).Of course, the bugs (as they are called) have a weakness, and the good guys manage to wipe them out.There are good aliens-invade-the-earth-and mankind-wipes-them-out books, this just wasn't one of them."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"Earthrise is second in a duology about the invasion of the alien Saurons. In the previous book, Death Day, the aliens have destroyed major cities around the world, shot down aircraft, strafed vehicles and groups, and reduced the world population by 3 billion. Now it is the humans turn to strike.The Saurons are divided into three classes: the black rulers, Zin, the brown warriors, Kan, and the white workers, Fon. They have likewise divided the surviving natives in their control, with the blacks as overseers, the browns as artisans, and the whites as grunt labor. Alexander Franklin, the former black governor of Washington state, has been selected by the Saurons as the President of the USA. Although an arrogant and manipulative politician, Franklin has grown into the job and is now the de facto leader of the Human Resistance.The Resistance has weathered a major crisis: the White Rose, a racialist group, has attacked Franklin's headquarters and, although driven off, have killed Jina, Franklin's wife. Worse, Jina was killed by the sister of Jack Manning, head of Franklin's security detail.Meanwhile, the Ra 'Na, alien slaves of the Saurons, have created their own resistance group and even the Fons have started to rebel.Now Franklin reaches out to the aliens and other human groups to form a common front. Unfortunately, the Saurons have an informer in his camp and they assassinate one leader and take another into captivity. Moreover, the local slaves are divided and 75% of them are taken from the main camp to reduce the Resistance's effectiveness. And then the Saurons initiate an assassination attempt against Franklin.This is not a very sophisticated novel, resembling Saturday matinee movie serials in both plot and characters. The good guys are strong and silent, the bad guys are thoroughly despicable, and the thrills and spills are continuous. Strangely enough, the most human villain is a Ra 'Na, Dro Tog.Don't expect great literature, but Dietz always gives your money's worth. Good fun.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"This has to be one of the worst science fiction books ever written. The plot and the characters are pathetic. Powerful aliens virtually wipe out the human race and destroy all semblence of infrastructure. Under the very noses of the technologically superior aliens a few survivors are able to organize a rebellion and overthrow the aliens.The attempt at a social message in the book is so clumsy and heavy handed as to be almost comical. The dialog of the characters as they interact frequently borders on moronic. I didn't read the first book which reportedly was worseor I certainly wouldn't have purchased Earthrise. This is one author I won't consider for future reading."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"As the sequel to DEATHDAY, EARTHRISE does you a favor if you haven't read the previous book. The first chapter summarizes the entire first book quickly and (as much as possible) painlessly. Readers are encouraged to skip the first book and read the second only.Earth's teeming millions--at least the ones in Washington and Guatemala--have been decimated by the alien invasion on Feb 28, 2020. The surviving humans are either crazy environmentalists, psycho racists, unwashed slaves, or leaders of the resistance.Time is running out as the aliens' metamorphosis approaches, when they must die hatching the next generation. The rebel humans and aliens discovered the secret in the last book, now they have their chance to exploit it. Their approach is three-pronged: destroy the birth-fluid factories, destroy the temples housing the birth chambers, and kill any remaining Suaron guards.William Dietz profiles cardboard versions of humanity and demonstrates how much luck and little basis in reality can lead to total victory. The aliens who were quite fierce in the beginning fall like wheat cut by the scythe of a tiny, untrained rebel force. Though an uncannily vague character and race study, the plot remains an confusing conglomerate of scene changes, action sequences, and impossible coincidences even as the characters feel as though they are part of your life--like the drunk uncle you wish would stop showing up at your birthday party."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"The planet Earth is in ruins following the Sauron invasion on Feb 28 2020. Whole cities are destroyed and most of the humans that survived are slaves to do the conqueror's bidding. The Saurons have installed Alex Franklin as their puppet president of the USA not knowing that he has joined with the resistance movement to find a way to destroy the invaders and rebuild the planet.The Saurons, a race divided into three castes, are pushing the human and Ra'Na slaves to rapidly build the citadels. The entire race will die giving birth to their hatchlings. Ra'Na and human resistance groups form to find a way of destroying the \\"master\\" race during the few days when the hatchlings are very vulnerable. Aliens and humans alike are willing to give their lives so that others may throw off the yoke of oppression.EARTHRISE, the sequel to DEATHDAY, is a fascinating invasion thriller. The tale enables readers to gain an intriguing look at the psychological and sociological essences of two alien races as well as the human reaction to a first encounter. William Dietz also profiles humanity and shows us as a race worth surviving for many of us are willing to die in the name of freedom. Though an insightful character and race study, the plot remains an action packed novel even as the charcaters feel as though they are part of our lives.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"There were many stories in these two books. Many of which take place in Sauron ships dealing with different aspects of the alien society. I enjoyed the story of Ivory and the white racialists. Ivory starts out as a big time loser and ends up a decent leader (misguided racist pig but a decent leader).I must say that the last third of the book was somewhat of a let down. Maybe too predictable I am not sure."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"If you like stories about humanity winning against all odds you will like EarthRise. I suggest you read DeathDay first, but you will be able to follow the story in EarthRise even if you do not.William Dietz almost always produces a great Sci-Fi novel and this one does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Earth Rise","review":"I had thought DEATHDAY was the worst sci-fi book ever written until I read the conclusion. The story could be compelling (alien invasion, resistance) but it devolves into a clumsy pleading on race, multiculturalism and the evil West. The aliens are so humanlike as to be non-alien and virtually the entire story takes place on the West coast; it's as if the rest of the world vanishes.The plot is almost as bad as the characters. Aliens and humans fight each other and themselves. The location switches could make one dizzy as they move with the logic of drunk: We meet conspirators on various parts of the West coast, fly into space, go on a military mission in Central America, sink in a slave mine all in rapid succession. Despite mankind's near extinction the characters have time to reflect on (America's) racial injustices and note that hey, the aliens are racists too!The ending is one of those things penned on the way to the editor. Dietz tries to be philosophical, dramatic, sensitive and exciting and fails miserably on all counts. Yes, humans finally win (you knew they would) but by this time everything has gotten so confused you don't even care."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"Randall Kennedy's Interracial Intimacies is many things: well-written, well-researched, revealing, disturbing, detailed, and hopeful. Kennedy, a Yale-trained lawyer, a professor at Harvard Law, and the author of the books Race, Crime, and the Law, and Nigger, once again focuses on race and the law as he weaves his way through the topics of interracial sex, marriage, identity, and adoption. Right from the first case, an adoption involving a mixed-race child presented in the Introduction, the reader is introduced to some truly baroque and rococo thinking on the part of often well-meaning people. Kennedy goes where the available evidence leads and writes things that many readers and reviewers will find politically incorrect [e.g., some intimate slave-master relationships were loving; black adults may not always be the best adoptive parents for a black child]. This attention to empirical evidence makes Kennedy a champion in my mind; I truly dislike it when somebody tries to pass off a personal or political agenda as the best answer without presenting any supporting evidence. Even though not the main reason for reading this book [I fell in love with Kennedy's writing when I read Nigger], the following story from my life illustrates one of many reasons why Kennedy's book is relevant to everybody, including a middle-class white guy like me. Back in the '70s, I attended a predominantly white high school in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In my Junior year, I fell in love with the younger sister of a friend of mine. The friend and her sister where first generation Americans and Chinese by descent. I found out in sometimes not-so-subtle ways that being friends with an asian-american and loving one were very different issues. One of my friends concluded what he wrote in my Junior yearbook with a statement that any children I had with my girlfriend would end up being \\"Red haired big nosed chinks -shame-.\\" That relationship broke up because of the reasons most high school romances end - his going away to college, her parents don't like him, his behavior, while often exemplary compared to his peers, is still pretty insensitive at times - but I'm proud to say that the relationship ended as it began, without race being an issue for the two of us. My only complaint about the book, and it's a small one, is that there are more typos than there ought to be in a book of this caliber [due to the fact, perhaps, that spellcheck programs check for words that are spelled correctly, whether they are used correctly or not]. I share Kennedy's vision of a society that truly deals with every person as an individual. I highly recommend Interracial Intimacies."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"I'm a poor college kid and I spent the last ounce of my money buying this book! Believe me, it has been totally worth it. Interracial Intimacies has been just as enjoyable as last year's \\"Nigger\\", and I recommend that every person in America, black or white, mixed or \\"not\\" read this book. Wither you are in an interracial relationship or not, this book will shed light on a culture and an acceptable way of life that has now seriously become mainstream. (Those who *are* in an interracial relationship will further appreciate the times we live in) Those who read this book will learn something new with the turn of every page. It is very well written, comprehensive, and full of facts and interesting experiances in history that all people should know. I look forward to the next great book!"},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"The author pulls the mirror up to our faces and makes us confront our own prejudices today and mourn our prejudices of the past. Of all the things I come away with in this book, I wholeheartedly support the author in his view that race matching in adoption is a destructive practice in all its various guises. Yes, 'it ought to be replaced by a system under which children in need of homes may be assigned to the care of foster or adoptive parents as quickly as reasonably possible.' We have several couples in our neighborhood who have adopted children of other races, and two black children are among them. This is real progress.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"Randall's book is a very accurate account of the history of interracial relationships of the Black/nonblack variety, most particularly the troublesome and controversial Black-White relationships and marriage. Mr. Kennedy traces the history of interracial relationships from the Colonial/slavery times to the early decade of the 21st century. Mr. Kennedy really knows his history and law regarding this elephant in the room, i.e., interracial relationships between Blacks and Whites.I recommend this book along with J.A. Rogers' Sex and Race. I hope people open their eyes to the largely unexplored and controversial issue of multiracial relationships."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"This book as a whole is better than his last book whose title I will not name here. I met Randall Kennedy at the college where I teach last year and made it clear to him what I thought of that book. But I like this one. For one thing, it has a lot of rare and little known history such as the sad tale of Black Reactionary George Schuyler and his racially confused daughter, the young lady who was prevented from being adopted in Jim Crow Louisiana due to confusion over her race, and the angry racially-mixed young man who grew up to be a Black Panther. These and numerous other stories are excellently told and are quite informative, as well as facts and figures on interracial marriages and adioption that may surprise street-corner dogmatists on this issue.This book made me view Dr. Kennedy in a new light. Although I still despise his last book, I will merely agree to disagree with him on that one. I think he is sincerely trying to clear up the confusion that abounds over race in this country on both sides (as he makes clear in the afterword) because he actually has hope that this can be done. The sad thing is that many such people WANT to stay confused to provide an outlet for their personal frustrations and are not likely to read this book. As I have said about John McWhorter, I don't agree with all he says, but since he is not of the Ken Hamblin/George Schuyler reactionary school, we have enough common ground as to where I would be happy to speak to him again."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"Mixed race relationships are a big issue today. The recent imbroglio over Sen. Strom Thurmond's half Black daughter reveals the interest in the subject. Professor Randall Kennedy's book, however,is simply a string of stories that already have been told. Although well written, the book lacks a common thread and it reads like a lengthy monologue about interracial relationships. I find Rachel Moran's book Interracial Intimacy, with which I do not agree with on many points, much more thoughtful, enlightening, and challenging intellectually. Unlike Kennedy, Moran looks well beyond Black/white relationships. In this way, Kennedy appears to have been caught in a time warp."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"Randall Kennedy has written an interesting jumble of stuff about interacial relationships whether they be sexual, marital or adoptive. Alas, the book is so big and spawling that it never seems to settle on one point. There is nothing new in this book, J.A. Rogers talked about the same stuff in his superior Race and Sex trilogy."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"I never thought that a book full of legal history would be as gripping as this book has been!"},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.(1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book \\"Don't Play In the Sun\\" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the \\"Mulatto Follies\\" of BET and MTV is priceless.(2) \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.(3) \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.(4) \\"The Color Complex\\"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.(5) \\"The Darkest Child\\" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the \\"color code\\". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking like Tangy Mae and that spoke volumnes. This book is a very real metaphor for what goes on. Very real."},{"Title":"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption","review":"Here we see an analysis that is not only wrong, but illogical. The main argument here, above all the other rhetoric, is that adoption of interracial children should be the norm among people and that it is incorrect for the agencies to \`match' the race of the children with the parents. Rather the argument is the parents should just be given whatever comes along regardless of the fact that the parents might like to raise a kid that resembles themselves, thus making it easier for the child to feel that his parents are actually his parents.The truth of the matter is people don't want interracial children. Why? Because people have a natural instinct to prefer what they are. Just as a dog would choose a puppy from its own breed a human will do the same. Many couples have worked hard to adopt \`unwanted' children, for instance both my uncles have inter-racial kids that are adopted. And these people who are willing to have these children make up for all the people who prefer like-race children.This book argues the opposite. That its actually better for people to adopt outside their race. But what is the motive here? ISnt the motive secretly that the people adopting are narrow minded and believe that by adopting a child from another race that they are being \`diverse'. The reality is that a child does not make someone \`tolerant' and it doesn't help the child to end up as a pawn in the race game that pervades America. It is universally a fact that minorities refuse to adopt children that are inter-racial, in fact minorities frequently try to adopt children that are as \`pure' which is to say one race as possible. Thus this book is pitched to European-Americans asking them to adopt these \`unwanted children' and arguing that those that refuse to do so are \`racist'. But what about the minorities, aren't they just as racist? This book simply ignores this fact. And ignores reality.Seth J.

It is thought to be fiction, yet it is very accurate. After letting some of my friends borrow it, I will be sure to read it again.It gives such a perfect vision of what it must have been like to be one of the fortunate ones to sit at the feet of our Lord. This book truelly brings the reader back 2000 years ago, to the days that the Lord was hear on earth.I am not a fiction reader at all. I was recommended this book by God's end time prophet William Branham while listening to one of his tape recordings. At the time of the recording, it had gone out of print and Brother Branham wished that they would bring it back, that all listening would be able to read it. Well it is back in print and I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"The prince of the house of David: Or, Three years in the Holy City","review":"This book was also recommended to me by a very dear friend in Christ. And I'm very so grateful for this recommendation! I've been studying scriptures for a couple of years now and found that this book chroniclesJesus' ministry precisely. This book is a collection of letters sent by a young sojourning lady, named Adina from Alexandria, back to her father living in Alexandria. She traveled to and lived in the holy city during the 3 1/2 years of Jesus' ministry there. And she actually met him!! And she goes into beautiful narratives about the miracles Jesus performed!! This book goes into very precise descriptions of Jesus' teachings, works, philosophy and personality. Things which one doesn't understand via the New Testament are clearly revealed and unveiled in this book. I consider this book a miracle, in that these letters, 39 in all, were preserved over this long of a time in order to be put in a book format for us to read. This book truly cemented in my mind that Jesus is the Way, Truth and Life and the love he truly has for everyone: It cleared up any doubt which I previously had, and it strengthened my faith to a new and higher level. I recommend this book especially to anyone whom has questions or doubt in regards to Jesus and His ministry and mission to humanity. This book is truly a love story in and of itself!!"},{"Title":"The prince of the house of David: Or, Three years in the Holy City","review":"Actually, I read this book, or at least one of its editions, somewhere around 1965. I had found it among other old books stored in a box in the basement of the home I grew up in. Probably one of my family members had bought and read the book some time earlier. It was small and not too thick, so I took it on to read; however, being a teenager who didn't have a lot of reading experience in adult-level books, nor a very large vocabulary, I had to use a dictionary often and kept it beside me while reading this book. Not that it turned out to be all that hard to read, just that I wanted to make sure I understood everything the way it was intended.As it turned out, I found this book to be one of the most interesting and thought-provoking books I had ever read up until that time. When I went into the military a couple of years later, the book apparently had been left there at my parents' house, and I have never seen it since. My parents moved several times over the years and I believe it may have been left to mold in an old box on the floor of a damp and musty cellar. They have both been deceased for a number of years now and I have no idea what happened to it. I wasn't sure if there had been many of them in print and a few years ago I did a Library of Congress internet search that brought up some information revealing the author and the date of the printing (somewhere between 1890 and 1900). However, I've forgotten how I attained it and most of the other details.Most importantly, I remember that the book led me to sorrow spiritually over the horrible treatment of Jesus on the cross and it helped lead me to repentance and to desire to live for Him. This book may serve as a great encouragement or guiding light for others who read it as well. Even though it is said to be fiction, it is not altogether fictional in that it relates many scriptural details, and is a story such as could very well have occurred to someone who was on the outside looking in at the time of Jesus' ministry and death.Obviously, since it is a book I never could forget, it is also one that I consider to be among the best books that have ever been written, apart from the Holy Scriptures themselves, since it is written about the greatest man who ever lived.I am writing this review, because I was thinking about this book tonight and decided to see if it was available on Amazon.com. I was delighted to see that it is."},{"Title":"The prince of the house of David: Or, Three years in the Holy City","review":"A Pastor friend of mine has been trying to get a copy of this book for years he said.

For one thing, there must be a reason why most authors of historical romance don't make REAL people characters in their books (other than cameo appearances). Jean Lafitte and Beau Brummell portrayed as nice people helping out a pair of lovers just didn't ring true. Why in heaven's name would Jean Lafitte appear in England so soon after helping the Americans in the war? And that goes for the hero too. He really was guilty of treason against England, and yet he had no hesitation returning to England. How, then, can he be so indignant at being arrested for treason?Another big problem with this book is the apparent ease with which the heroine manages to give birth to an illegitimite child without being questioned by anyone. She mentions a couple of times that she plans to say she was widowed in the war if anyone questions her, but apparently nobody does in over two years. Nor does she even use a married name. Even a duke's daughter would cause a scandal in such a situation, and yet apparently nobody even raises an eyebrow. Nor does she show a moment's concern that her son might be labeled a bastard all his life. Elizabeth's actions show her to be more a contemporary character than a historical one.And then there are minor errors, such as calling Jonathan &quot;Earl Longdale&quot; instead of &quot;Lord Longdale&quot; and having a character called Tiffany 150 years too early that perhaps the average reader might miss. You know, I am not such a nitpicker that I would let little things like this keep me from enjoying a book; however, this book just didn't ring true for me, maybe because I've read so many books set in this time period that I have a pretty good idea what it was like back then.

And it certainly is: with it's good-quality black-and-white figures, carefully designed maps, generous captions and an extended bibliography supplemented by a sufficient index, it ranks far above average when compared to similar scientific references. But this book is a lot more than a textbook: it is a unique comprehensive guide offering a straightforward path to both the novice and the expert through the complex, and at times confusing, interaction between the birds and their habitat. The general pattern Brown lays out in his clear, figurative language for each species in terms of life history, distribution, management history and hunting strategies is unsurpassed in the literature, a knowledge and expertise which can only be accumulated through decades of experience in the field as a wildlife biologist, AZ G&amp;F game manager and a hunter. This book has served me as a faithful companion for not only planning hunting trips into new areas, but also to better understand the many biotic communities in the Southwest. Such information does not come easy, and one has to always work for it. Above all, I consider Brown's hunting anecdotes among the best put on paper. Loaded with practical advice and written with respect for the quarry by a true gentleman hunter, these short stories take you right into the field. Read e.g. about Brown looking back to Ward's Dove Night in Tuscon during the early 1970es and you will understand why this fine book is on my shelf standing right next to such classics as Jack O' Connor &quot;Game in the Desert&quot; and Charles A. Sheldon's &quot;Wilderness of the Southwest&quot;. May it never go out of print!"},{"Title":"Arizona Game Birds","review":"Must have for anyone studying gamebirds, or small game management in Az.

The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Alford, Lord Tennyson,much less read their poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Illustrated Poets Hb","review":"I have found no better way to introduce young people to these great poets than through this Poetry for Young People series. I highly recommend it! The poems are well chosen, and by reading through these books the children will easily be able to see a variety of writing styles.

I am by no means a poetry expert or professional. At best I'm a poetry enthusiast.2. I have not written an amazon review in 5 years and I buy 50~ items from amazon each year.This CD is a complete and utter atrocity.It is vicious death to the works of an exquisite poet who in my opinion - deserves better.My fascination with Tennyson is a pretty straightforward one.Tennyson muses on concepts like honour, truth and duty.Being an ex-soldier myself I find it easy to relate to those concepts.And Tennyson's writes so superbly one must be stupefied when first reading his works.I've been eagerly expecting a collected audio CD of Tennyson's works for years now.When I got this CD I was excited as a 6 year old would be on Christmas/Hanuka/whatever morning.However, this CD butchers Tennyson's works so cruelly I cannot remain silent.It is by far the worst reading of Tennyson's works I've ever heard.I gargle things when I brush my teeth that sound better than this.Reading poetry is more than just about having a good projective voice and a British accent.It's about providing the listener with an experience, an understanding of the text, of a shared voyage.Tennyson's poems are being read like one would read a restaurant menu.The pronunciation is abysmal, the pace of reading is atrocious and I just can't relate to it on a personal level.Honestly, I've listened to every online reading of Tennyson's works.All of those free youtube videos far surpass this audio book.My recommandation to you is to avoid buying this CD.And if you do buy this CD - make sure to burn it once you're done. Otherwise you'll be tempted for a replay and than the true horribleness of this CD really sinks in.I've never imagined anyone could actually demolish \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" or \\"Ulysses\\" like this CD has."},{"Title":"The Standard of Honor: The Crucible of Honor Trilogy","review":"this book does not fit into many typical fantasy or fiction genres. the impressive thing is that it creates its own, and you are not left wondering at a definition. very powerful religious overtones and incorporation of the Holy Scriptures makes the characters real and vulnerable, reliant on their God. The scope of the book is wide enough to keep interest, but focused enough that you come to know the characters. there is a considerable attention to strife between characters, growth in character and relationships, and an expanding knowledge of the characters' histories that define who and what they are to this day, and the course their actions are plotting for their future. both this and the second book are very well worth the money, time, and read...pick it up today and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Standard of Honor: The Crucible of Honor Trilogy","review":"A friend gave me the 1st 2 books and I was pleasantly suprised by the mix of the mysticism with a medieval timeline.

From the character development and a well thought out plot, Colford weaves a tale worth more than a cursory glance. From book one to book three, the story moves along at a fine pace without the fillers of most trilogies. The plot has all the pieces needed to tell an enjoyable tale. The interactions between the Sovereign and his sworn protectors are well done and create a true bond, not a mere story telling arc. If you enjoy a good story, full of intrigue, likeable characters, and a message all can understand, the Crucible of Honor Trilogy will fit the bill."},{"Title":"The Standard of Honor: The Crucible of Honor Trilogy","review":"I have been a long time fan of fantasy, and I am always looking for a new author to read. While waiting for the next Goodkind book, I tried out The Standard of Honor and was amazed. It was very interesting watching the main character struggle with ruling a kingdom, being faithful to his religion, and dealing with those who want to pull him down. It is a book that has fascinating, characters who you want to root for even though are clearly not perfect people. If you get tired of reading fantasy books with flawless characters who never need to grow, you will love reading this book and seeing the characters grow and change over time."},{"Title":"Java Application Strategies for the AS/400","review":"It's excellent book for RPG programmers looking for introduction to Java. This book gives solid base in Java with explanations on OO concepts and working practical examples. The only weakness of this book is poor information about how Java works/runs in the AS/400 environment."},{"Title":"Java Application Strategies for the AS/400","review":"As in his seminars, Don Denoncourt attempts to reach two objectives in a very limited time. The first is to teach object-oriented concepts to RPG programmers. He does a pretty good job of this. The second objective, not covered by any other book I am aware of, is to introduce us to the invaluable tools of record-level access and JDBC, as well as PCML and a few other means of interacting with the 400. These sections of the book make it an essential tool for any programmer transitioning AS/400 databases to Java access. I only wish he had included more information on connection strategies such as applets and EJB."},{"Title":"52 Great Weekend Escapes in AZ Sc","review":"REALLY, REALLY liked this book.

The smoke from the shell is suffocating, and you aren't able to see anything. You have no protection and cannot get yourself to a safer place to dodge the flying shells coming from behind the buildings. As you quickly hurry through the empty streets, anxiously hoping to reach home alive, you see stray body parts of people who had been killed and mutated by exploding shells. How would you feel, if everyday you had to constantly worry that any second, a shell could explode or a sniper would shoot at you and you would be killed instantaneously? Nadja Halilbegovich has written a biography called My Childhood Under Fire, which beautifully portrays the way her family lived in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia during the Bosnian War with great emotion and description.In this biography, My Childhood Under Fire, Nadja Halilbegovich writes about her painful childhood, and how growing up during the Bosnian War affected her as a person. The setting takes place in Nadja's hometown, Sarajevo, Yugoslavia in 1922, when the Bosnian War had just begun. Worried about the dangers outside of their front doorstep, Nadja and her family move to the basement of their apartment for better protection and discover that the life they once knew would be gone forever. Many of Nadja's friends and neighbors were killed throughout the war, but she kept a positive outlook on the future and never lost hope that there would be peace once again. She wrote \\"Why can't we all live together in peace instead of fighting wars? No country is worth a child's tear, let alone a child's life. Just when peace lures people outside, some monstrous atrocity happens, and I hear a warning voice: Nadja, the war is still here!\\" Nadja always had a passion for music and performing, and she never let the war stop her from risking her life to go to hospitals and performing for the sickly patients and trying to lift the spirits of her fellow civilians. The war had such an impact on Nadja that she wrote poems and songs in her diary that were broadcast over the radio several times a day. When Nadja turned 16, she was offered the opportunity to leave Saravejo and flee to America where she would live with another family and start a new life, despite the deep scars that would always be embedded in her soul from the war.By writing the book in diary format, Nadja Halilbegovich has given the story a more personal touch because of all the vivid details and real life situations that she experienced. You can see how Nadja matured throughout the book in her writing as she grew older which evolved into very expressive and powerful writing. Although it is a short book, readers of all ages can read about the impact of war on a child, and the persistence and strength Nadja had to overcome the obstacles of war, which I hope they find as inspiring as I did."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"Bombs are sounding down the street, the ground is shaking, and glass is shattering in the apartment below you. A very intriguing and interesting book, My Childhood Under Fire was a diary written by Nadja Halilbegovich from 1992 to 1995. She started the diary when she was twelve years old and lived in Sarajevo, Bosnia- Herzegovina. In her diary she wrote that she had three lives: the first, before the war; her second, during the war; and her third, after the war. The diary mostly took place while her country was in the war and when she was affected by the surroundings. Nadja had to live in her apartment building for many years. She barely could go outside because it was too dangerous. Everyday when her mom and dad went to work, she would wait and pray that nothing happened to them. Nadja and the kids in her apartment building would play games and bake food with the few ingredients they had. One day Nadja begged her mom to go outside for fresh air and the warm sun, and when her mom finally gave in, Nadja ran down fourteen flights of stairs. \\"Outside I just stood still, mesmerized by the beauty of the world.\\" While she was standing on the street, a bomb suddenly exploded and she was injured badly. Nadja luckily survived.Through the story Nadja explains how she learned, socialized and helped her city get through the war. She wrote poems, sang songs, and spoke on radio shows about peace and love. However, her life was very gloomy. She describes, \\"At night, black and gloomy thoughts invade me instead of sleep. In the darkness, images of bloody, dead children revolve in front of my eyes. One image after another forces upon my eyes. I feel such pain and humiliation that I cry and cry.\\" Although her life was heartbreaking during the war, at the end of the book, Nadja receives a special opportunity that leads her out of war and into her third life.I chose this book because I wanted to read about a place that I had never heard of. Every page of the book was like discovering a new world. It took me to when I was born, 1993, but to a different part of the globe. I had never known that children were suffering like that when I had just been brought into existence. All I could think about when I was reading was how a girl my age made a difference and survived when everybody around her was dying. I recommend this book because of the truth and pain behind each page. Nadja's descriptions were so vivid that you could feel her sorrow. \\"Two years have flown by since the day I was wounded. The scars and shrapnel in my legs do not allow me to forget. Still, if I knew that tomorrow the war would end, my wounds would hurt less.\\" The diary was written straight from her heart and lets the reader discover a new life. This book was very serious and sometimes depressing, but I loved the diary and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"This is a non-fiction book aimed at children ages 10 and up. It's the real-life diary of a young girl who lived in Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995, while the city was under siege. Actual diary entries are interspersed with additional descriptive passages that the author wrote later, after the war.I found My Childhood Under Fire to be utterly compelling. The writing starts out a bit simplistic (the author is a 12-year-old at that point), but matures throughout the course of the book. Nadja's diary provides a window into what life is like for ordinary citizens during a war. Nadja's mood shifts between fear, frustration, humiliation, and boredom, with periods of optimism and determination. She repeatedly rails against the aggressors who are shelling her city, and against the international community that is doing nothing to stop them. She is most disturbed by violence against children, memorializing and mourning the innocent children who have been killed in the war. This is evident even before she herself is seriously wounded.Through all the privations and suffering of war, Nadja maintains her spirit. Even when her family can't leave the house to buy gifts, and make do with scraps of food, they celebrate every birthday. Nadja demonstrates remarkably little self-pity for her own injury, focusing more on the suffering of others. Even as she criticizes the international political community, she notes every parcel that her family receives from aid groups, and the small kindnesses of her neighbors and her family members.Nadja and the people around her do whatever they can to maintain a semblance of normal life, even as they struggle without electricity or water or food or fuel. Nadja continues to strive artistically and academically, and to reach out to provide encouragement to others in her community. She and the children in her building make up a newspaper called Kids of Sarajevo. She writes poems, and reads them aloud over the radio. She sings in a singing group called Palcici, despite the danger of going outside to attend practices and concerts. She writes letters to Bill Clinton, asking him to take action. Although she clearly loves music and culture, the seeds of her later adult work as a peace advocate are readily visible before her 13th birthday.Nadja does have periods of depression and hopelessness, particularly later in the book, in the period before her ultimate escape from Sarajevo. And she experiences terrible things. The recounting of her escape from Sarajevo is almost unbelievable, yet somehow matter-of-fact. Nadja's diary shows how anything can become normal to people. It also shows how people, especially children, can maintain their humanity under dire circumstances. I think that children (and adults) can learn a lot from this book. I read it in one sitting, but will remember it long into the future. I highly recommend it, for children and adults.This review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on April 17th, 2006."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"Reality can weave a more amazing tale than any fiction writer. This is one of those books. The mountains around Sarajevo were once the famous ski slopes of the Olympics. During the Bosnian war they were occupied by tanks and snipers that strangled the city and picked off the stranded one by one. After six months indoors, mostly in a damp basement Nadja went outside to see the sun on a day when the shooting and shelling almost gave way to quiet. The joy of a few minutes of play suddenly ended for her. I won't give away any other details. A young Nadja tells it much better than I could.The book is the real dairy of a young girl with comments from the author looking back as a young woman. It's bound to become a elementary school standard, but is a heart-touching read for adults as well. I highly recommend parents and kids read it together."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"I love this book.If you want to read a book that touches your heart read this book.The author's story is so real.I liked the way she used her own dairy from the Bosnian war to tell her story.She also gives updates on what happened to her after some of the entries. She also included some of her artwork and photographs from the war.This book is amazing. You must read it.I hope she writes another one."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"Nadja's diary is a tribute to her childhood and the children of Sarajevo. Amazingly mature and articulate for her age... Nadja paints a painful portrait of the Bosian War and the city of Sarajevo. Nadja a normal child's life adbruptly ends once Serb forces began beseiging the capital city of Sarajevo- suddenly school stops, gun fire starts and Nadja and her family must hide in a cellar. From her cellar while shellls drop around her apartment... Nadja pours all of her feelings into her diary.As a college freshmen, I found this book insightful and powerful. A short read- but it's a great tribute to a time that the people of Yugoslavia should never forget. Reading a child's fears, hopes, anger, and misunderstanding of the caosis unfolding outside put an eye on untolerable events and the pain of war on it's youngest victims.While Zalta's Diary(Another Bosnian War Diary) is beautiful/honest Nadja's is more personal.... Zalta who came from a wealthy family and a Croat was not as affected as Nadja seems to have been. Nadja- a Muslim(The Serb Target), living in one of the most beseiged parts of the city, and was a victim of the gunfire when a piece of sharpnel hit her leg when she was playing outside her apartment for the first time in 2 months seemed to be a little more emotional affected by the events that she shares in her diary- perhaps sharing a little more about her feelings than Zalta does in hers....Nadja's trimuph is one that should be shared and read and re-read. The contents of her diary at the misunderstanding of the events unfolding around her brought me to tears- bringing up the fact that while men fight- children die.The Bosnian war is a war often misunderstood by Americans to understand the full contents of the conflict you have to realize it was a Civil War that occured in Yugoslavia... at the end of communisn the states of Yugoslavia began to break apart based on their ethnic nationality- Serb, Croat, and Muslim. The powerful Serb ruled- Serbia set out to claim the other states in the country- as they did they forced evacuated and executed Muslim and Croat populations(They also sent Muslim men to forced labor camps). Bosnia the stronghold of the Muslim population became the main target of the aggression and it's capital Sarajevo became a city under siege. The Bosnian war was the worst European conflict since World War Two and resulted in nearly 200,000- most of them civilians and displaced 2 million people from their homes. It was a war when children on a playground were considered fair game, and a war where hospitals, airports, and humantrain buses and bread lines were purposely shot at... It was an ethnically based war based on years of self-hatred.To understand the full horror of any war you must look first at the children- hearing little one's fears always put a brutal eye on the events unfolding around them. The fear little one's have when their own home becomes a prison and they know that their parents cannot protect them from the maddnes outside. To understand the full horror of Sarajevo and Bosnia you have to read the diary of Nadja. Nadja although sometimes painful, it is a MUST to understand why war- should never be the answer and the pain that falls upon these beseiged cities the hunger, the cold, and the abstructive to normal life(getting mail, going to work, walking down your street). Life STOPS in war zones.I think as adults we all forget the actions we make have affects on our children... for that every adult should read Nadja's diary and gain a prespective that children are the ones caught in the crossfire of men's conflicts. It is a true tribute to Nadja's lost childhood and her country- that should NEVER forget their past.Nadja's Diary is a must read for children- but MORE importantly parents and politicans for all the answers lye in the power of her remarkable writing."},{"Title":"My Childhood Under Fire: A Sarajevo Diary","review":"My Childhood Under Fire is the actual diary of Nadja Halilbegovic.

So we learn in spellbinding, horrific detail in Andrew Schneider and David McCumber's &quot;An Air That Kills,&quot; a jeremiad that does for the still-immediate peril of asbestos what Ralph Nader's &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; did for the Corvair.Of course, that sports car could simply be pulled out of production. Yet where does one even begin to deal with the ongoing fallout of generations worth of systemic, unregulated poisoning of our country by an industry that churned out uncountable tons of fibers of mass destruction, in a business most people wrongly think was brought to its knees around the time young Dubya was pledging Skull and Bones at Yale?Schneider (winner of two Pulitzer Prizes) and McCumber center their expos&eacute; on Libby, a small town in the northwest corner of Montana that was mined from the 1920s to 1990 for asbestos-laden vermiculite ore, known commercially as Zonolite. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., which bought the mine in 1963 and ramped up production, hid the risks of the toxic dust that by 1969 was being released into Libby's air at the rate of 2 1/2 tons a day.It would be bad enough if the astronomical fatality rates of asbestos-related cancers had been localized in Libby. Unfortunately, Grace had sent billions of pounds of its tainted ore to more than 750 processing plants throughout North America, including two in Minneapolis; it's estimated that between 15 million and 35 million homes remain insulated with the product that the company always contended wasn't hazardous. Minneapolis alone received more than 192 million pounds of the poison over the years.Schneider and McCumber pile conspiracy upon conspiracy, and if their evidence wasn't so compelling, one would think they were talking of Dealey Plaza and gunmen on the grassy knoll. Yet here it all is, up to and including the Bush White House blocking the Environmental Protection Agency's declaration of a public-health emergency in April 2002, as well as the attached warning to millions of citizens that they still might be exposed.The authors wisely focus not just on deciphering the meaning of the wealth of related secret corporate and governmental memos they unearthed, but on the faces, names and particulars of the suffering. Take Les Skramstad, who worked at Grace's Libby mine for just three years in the 1950s, and got hit with asbestosis in 1995.&quot;It's hard to sleep when your lungs aren't pliable enough to breathe in the air needed to live,&quot; they write. Les's wife &quot;Norita gets even less sleep worrying about him. When he finally lies still, she lies there listening to hear that he's still breathing. His breaths are so shallow that she can barely feel his chest rise.&quot;As to why he refuses bottled help, he tells the authors: &quot;Dragging a tank of air behind you is like admitting that you're dying. Everybody I know who started on oxygen died a few months later. It's like giving in to Grace and saying 'yeah, you killed another one.' &quot;It gets worse. Yet despite the revulsion one feels reading of the calculated destruction of a once-beautiful town that now makes Love Canal seem like a pristine Big Sur, Schneider and McCumber have woven a galvanizing, human tale as entrancing as it is loathsome.Minneapolis author Neal Karlen's sixth book, &quot;Unchosen,&quot; a religious memoir about returning to faith, will be published in October.Copyright 2004 Star Tribune.

It is important to you and your family. I consider myself a knowledgeable person and I don't remember this scandal when it came out in 2000-2001. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I live in southern CA, but the problems with asbestos effects all of us in the US. Attic insulation, talc products and even gardening/soil products have asbestos risks that have been used and available for sale up into the 1990's and beyond.I must have read a review or heard one of the authors in an interview...but somehow this book made it onto my &quot;Must Read&quot; list. When I received the book, I questioned why I had gotten it, having forgotten what motivated my interest in the first place. But I started reading and have found this book to be a treasure.The story is one of deception, corruption and greed on the part of Big Business, in this case the mining business. The owners and executives misled their workers, investors and the government agencies that regulated them into turning a blind eye to the dangers of asbestos in their products.While the deception of the miners in Libby was unconscionable, the book goes on to document the Bush White House withholding information that the air in and around the World Trade Center was not healthy! Can you imagine, after a tragedy like the WTC disaster, that your own government, that you rallied round to give support, would turn on you and withhold information that the air that you breathe is full of cancer causing dust? Which tragedy is worse?The book is truly a must-read.Lastly, I want to point out the courage of the reporters, editors, doctors and the outstanding EPA field workers that fought to get this story out. Whistle-blowers, whose main motivation is to right a wrong, are oftentimes rewarded by getting fired and branded as outcasts. This book is ultimately a story of courage and perserverance of those determined to overcome the obstacles of standing out and doing what's right."},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"As a former resident of Libby Montana, this book brought home to me the deceit, greed and simple cruelty of Corporate America. I remember playing on those piles of Vermiculite when I was a kid and W.R. Grace telling us we could eat it and it would not hurt us. I have not cried while reading a book in my entire life but I cried while I read this book.I hope there is a special place in Hell for the people who had such a blatant disregard for the safety of an entire town and in fact the entire country.Read this book and write your Congressmen afterwards. This is a tragedy and an outrage"},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"Authors McCumber and Schneider spent five years researchingthis story, with much of their time spent interviewingLibby residents. They write emotionally, but with whatcan best be described as an objective passion.Their facts are well-researched and corroborated. This isthe true story of the death of many Libby residents, the slowdeath of an entire community, of corporate lies, and of partisanpolitics which continues to block any medical help reachingthe victims (the conflict breaks down alongtypical conservative vs. liberal firing lines). The partisansniping is found amongst Libby's residents, but it goesall the way to the Whitehouse and into the halls of theU.S. Congress, from which most of Libby's aid musteventually come.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested inenvironmental health issues and environmental politics.It would make an excellent college text book forEnvironmental Science classes and for Environmental Law classes.Unfortunately, this story is not yet finished. Verylittle has been done to provide adequate medicalcare or *individual* financial aid for the victims. AnAsbestos Disease Research Center will soon be built in Libby.Its goal is to study the townspeople and to study howasbestos-related diseases progress in this population.Not surprisingly, many Libby residents now believe thatthey are being viewed as &quot;human lab rats&quot;.Many victims have no health insurance, and so far, noone is offering to help them. Some of the Federal money thatwill be used to build the new Asbestos Research Centercould have been used to pay the medical bills of these people.Therefore, Libby's last chapter has yet to be written."},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"You would think a little town in Montana, named Libby could not possibly be interesting or draw the attention of the nation (and the world). Yet it does, and will continue to do so. These two newspaper journalists do an excellent job of pulling together all the various threads of the story of Libby. The corporations involved, the miners and their families, the government agencies that did nothing, and the ones that finally got around to it (only to be told to back off by the Bush administration). It's one thing when men were mining way back in the forties and fifties, and even if it was thought or known that the variety of abestos were dangerous if breathed in, not enough was known to control or stop it, and the miners back then may not have taken the information seriously as they needed the jobs for the care of their families.But it's a whole different ballpark, when it's their kids who are being impacted by lung disease...because they played in a ballpark, where Grace &amp; Company dumped their waste/tailings. Or when the men know their wives will die of the same thing through bringing their clothes home to be washed.How very presient of Grace to put itself into bankruptcy, just before this information became widely known, through Libby's activist, Gayla and Les. But wait a minute, wasn't Grace one of the companies written about in A Civil Action? They did not care much about killing a bunch of little children with leukemia in their drinking water, so why would anything in LIbby conern them.It would really help if someone put on the Internet, known companies that are placing their workers at risk, so that we can all look at them from time to time and decide whether we want to do business with them or whether we want to buy their products. We have fiberglass in our 1950's made home, but now I wonder what that fiberglass replaced and where it is in my home. I am sure that many will feel the same after reading this book.Kudos to Gayla and Les, as well as the two reporters/authors...Karen Sadler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"The author Andrew Schneider tells the story of uncovering a scandal of major proportions. It is a frightening, chilling story of hidden dangers allowed by government officials whose jobs are to keep us safe. It is the story of a mineral still used in our country whose lethal dangers were recorded by Pliny the Elder. Asbestos cannot be safely used in any manner."},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"I have just completed &quot;An Air that Kills&quot; by Andrew Schneider and David McCumber. I grew up in Libby, MT, the birthplace of this story. I was impressed by how the authors were able to capture the mood and the history of the town. Far more impressive, however, is the scope of their research and their ability to bring understanding to not only the devestation of Libby but the degree to which asbestos is still so prevalent in the United States. The obvious politics of protecting the corporations rather than protecting the health of our citizens is clearly detailed. I recommend the book highly. It's a great story about tenacity of regular citizens, and the integrity of a small band of government officials who worked together to create change....and yet an understanding of how far we have to go in order to write the last chapter of this book."},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"This book is a masterpiece of investigative journalism - well written, throughly researched and truly in the interests of the public.The authors do a superb job of combining all the science and politics with a touching picture of the real Americans who ultimately paid and are paying the price for corporate greed and governmental push-overs.If you read just one book this year, this should be it!"},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"This book was truly stunning.

It's an elaboration of a news story, reported in journalistic style, tracing the peregrination of a journalist in the third person. The journalist in the story, it turns out, is the journalist telling the story.That's not criticism. It's a hell of a story, which he knows better than anyone, at least objectively. He can't very well write himself out of it completely but also wants not to obscure any of the tale's colorful primary characters. Third person narration is one technique for accomplishing that. It leads to subtle tells, though, like details in a mystery that foretell which clues will later prove significant.If anyone out there still believes the fallacy (oh heck! it's not a fallacy, it's a bald-faced lie) that government regulation and oversight is unnecessary, that market forces will curb the rapacious, homicidal proclivities of corporations, read this book. Of course, if you still believe that, someone will probably have to read it to you."},{"Title":"An Air That Kills : How the Asbestos Poisoning of Libby, Montana, Uncovered a National Scandal","review":"Take time to read this well written and informative book.

I was interested because I had just visited my friend in Montana. She is a fifth generation Montanan and we had driven past large mines throughout the state. I instantly became engulfed in the book and the individual's struggle for their lives and legislative justice. We see all the commercials on t.v. for patients suffering from Mesothelioma and how to contact a law firm. I now understand why. Companies were allowed for over 50 years to knowingly kill their employees from asbestos poisoning. They are allowed to sell asbestos as a product in the U.S. and infect consumers as well. Asbestos is still being mined and sold today. It will kill people for many years to come.

WB Grace made their money and now the media will make their money. While I agree that the authors have done a wonderful public service uncovering this environmental disaster, I would like to suggest that a substantial amount of the money made on this book (and the perhaps subsequent movie) could be donated to the victims. If not for their illness, there would be no story. I was recently appalled to learn about the monies that were made by media stars on the Watergate scandal while Deep Throat (whoe courage made it all possible) was not doing quite as well.

There is also a workbook that accompanies the grammar book. Like most texts written for English speakers learning Russian, this text is written in British English.

Should not be listed as a beginner book at all especially with the cost of it, a hard way to learn that I can't use this book for quite a while."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Russian Grammar (Blackwell Reference Grammars)","review":"I use the Oxford Concise Russian Grammar by Terrence Wade all the time.This book attempts to cover a lot of ground and it's very commendable that he has assembled so much information from various Russian grammars that are totally written in Russian and presented it for English speakers. You can answer many questions from it and it has many interesting insights into the grammar of Russian.That said...He attempts to cover parts of spoken grammar and usage and I wish he hadn't because he is sometimes dead wrong and it mars an otherwise well thought out book. Supposedly it was reviewed by many top academics in Russia but they could not have read it carefully because the mistakes are not typos but gaps in his understanding of Russian, that despite a lifetime of study, are things that every child there understands.For example, there is the imperative form of the word to eat which he claims is usually replaced by a more polite verb. He's dead wrong and this is something that people say to each other all the time. In the movies I rarely hear the ones he claims people use though it's definitely a word people use and I do sometimes too. This is a mistake that no child in Russia could make. By the age of 2 they know this word because it's what their mother tells them when she wants them to eat. I verified this with my Russian friends. There is a prefixed version of the verb too which is the verb \\"to finish eating\\" (yes, in Russian there is a verb for everything) that is very common too. It's what your parents say to you when you try to leave the table before you have finished eating.I have been to Russia too for vacation and the same comments apply from my experience speaking and hearing people there.He commendably mentions the alternative imperative verb form in Russian where the infinitive is used but fails to elaborate on this significant item. I have actually never seen this discussed in text books.Russians often use the infinitive in place of the imperative. I first started to hear it in movies and it was always in a setting where police or military people where giving some kind of order. It's like \\"I order you to stop\\" but the just say \\"to stop\\". It's common in Russian spoken language to omit anything that can be omitted that would be obvious from the context.But in real life there on the street, I hear it all the time too.It's originally from the military but it has filtered into general life.For example, a little kid was starting to go into the crosswalk and I heard his mother yell this at him.In Russia as a result of the soviet union, there are three separate sub languages: normal spoken Russian, that spoken by police and military and that from prisons (there were a lot of people in prison) but now it has all filtered into the general spoken language.Anyway, this is a very deep subject and it's not covered very well in this book."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive Russian Grammar (Blackwell Reference Grammars)","review":"I always have my eyes open for good reference books.I took four semesters of Russian in a two-year college program, over ten years ago.

It deals exhaustively with virtually every aspect of the language and gives copious information which should satisfy the curiosity of both intermediate and advanced students of the language. Some American learners might have a bit of difficulty with &quot;Britishisms&quot; such as the use of the first-person future &quot;shall&quot; instead of &quot;will&quot; and a few other such things, but this is no significant barrier. Once in a great while there are a some very peculiar usages in the English translations of Russian utterances (such as &quot;I'll give you argue!&quot; and &quot;I'll give you gallivanting around!&quot; on page 301) which are incomprehensible to Americans (and perhaps also to British people), but such problems are rare.

This was a recommended work when I was doing a degree in Russian. It is a good and thourough work on the Russian language that you will, undoubtedly, find useful. However, I think that there are some sections that really need more detail. First of all the (painful!) verbs of motion need more clarification and explanation in relation to the variations used by Russian speakers. There have been whole books written on verbs of motion so the little that has been devoted to it here is not enough in my opinion. There have been times in my own interaction with Russians when I have been corrected in my use of a verb of motion even though what I said was grammatically correct. We need to know when and where to use them. Secondly, the section on perfectives and imperfectives and the way affixes are used is just not advanced and thourough enough. If you are going to spend your money on a grammar book you want the full story, don't you? Examples used tend to be from Soviet/Russian press, which is Ok, but also from authors such as Chekhov. I think it would be better to stick to modern sources as much as possible instead of gining readers the idea that what they may be learning might be older style Russian. I think that all the examples will be perfectly OK in modern Russian, but I think you should consider the impression you give readers as well as the actual information.

He likes to introduce the obtuse and stuffy to themselves, as it were, and to laugh at the pretentious. His favorite targets are on the Right, which is good, and his second favorite targets are on the Left, which is also good. He is, strange to say, and perhaps unbeknownst to himself, as American as pizza pie and Cabernet Sauvignon, matzo balls and chow mein. If he didn't exist we would have to invent him. He is the heir of Mark Twain, H. L. Mencken and Edmund Wilson with a dollop of Truman Capote thrown in. His ego is as wide as the Mississippi and his self-aggrandizement as consistent as the winter snow in Buffalo. He has done everything in literature except write poetry, and he has probably done that, and I just don't know about it. He has run for congress, for president, written screenplays (e.g., Suddenly Last Summer) and TV scripts, plays, and appeared in a science fiction movie (Gattaca). He and William F. Buckley Jr. have played clowns for one another, and he has been the confidant, if not of presidents, then of first ladies. He thinks of himself as beautiful, although it's been a long time since he really cared about that. He is one of our finest and most penetrating social critics, an original who manages to occupy the left while maintaining a stance somewhere to the aristocratic right of the Boston blue bloods, although of course his roots are in the political south, in Tennessee, Washington, D.C. and Mississippi.I have never been able to read, much less appreciate, however, his fiction. No doubt the failure is mine. Yet I think it indisputable that Vidal is a much better essayist than he is a novelist. In this, his latest collection--effectively just a continuation of his United States: Essays 1952-1992 (1993), a massive volume of 1,278 pages, also jacketed ironically in red, white and blue--Vidal continues his unrelenting attack on all things pretentious, pompous, political and/or simply within reach.He can be balanced (as in \\"Edmund Wilson: Nineteenth-Century Man,\\" the first essay), slighting with faint praise (\\"The Romance of Sinclair Lewis\\" p. 46), adoring (\\"Sinatra\\" p. 149), brutal (as in \\"Reply to a Critic\\" p. 79), and devastatingly funny, particularly when addressing the hijinks of American pols as in his essays on FDR, Truman, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, Al Gore, etc. He is at his best when defending the constitution, human rights, freedom, and democracy against its enemies as in \\"Shredding the Bill of Rights,\\" p. 397, \\"A Letter to Be Delivered,\\" p. 436, and \\"Japanese Intentions in the Second World War,\\" p. 457, not to mention perhaps a hundred other essays here and elsewhere. His main tactic is a cynical sarcasm laced with selected facts from his prodigious memory. He can be ironic and surgically subtle, but he is not above plain old ridicule. His style is accomplished and erudite without being stuffy. His treatment is popular but without any concessions to the verbally challenged.But Gore Vidal (the \\"Gore\\" is from his mother's side of the family, the same family that spawned Al Gore) is also a classicist, thoroughly at home in Roman and Greek literature, and especially in Greek culture. He is an expert on literature and politics, as knowledgeable as any academic and as cosmopolitan and worldly as any ambassador. It is one of the ironies of Vidal's life, he being a staunch foe of what he has always seen as the frivolity of \\"bookchat\\" and its best-seller mentality, that he became with the historical novels he started writing in the sixties, a best-selling author himself, and a darling of the bookchat set. Indeed, Gore Vidal is an ironic man: an American aristocrat who would disown his class and embrace the hoi-polloi while keeping his tie pin firmly in place.I was trying to see how his style has changed over the years, reading some of his essays from the fifties and sixties, and then this volume of 48 essays from the last decade. I must say that he is just as opinionated, assertive and eloquent as ever. I think he more carefully dotted his i's and crossed his t's in the old days, so that his sentences were perhaps a little more architectural, while today he is more relaxed and straight-forward. One might say, nowadays he just lets it fly.In short, this collection is a splendid, energetic and thoroughly enjoyable romp through Americana land courtesy of one of our great tour masters. Did I say that if Gore Vidal didn't exist, we would have to invent him? Certainly America's twentieth century would not be the same without him.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\""},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Gore Vidal is a patriot who sees America through the clear eyes of a long-term relationship. If an unexamined life is not worth living, then an unexamined country is not worth loving. Even as Mr. Vidal reviews our national foibles, examines our errors, and dissects our politicians his love of the founding principles of this flawed democracy shine through. There is no doubt as to Mr. Vidal's erudition, but he is also wickedly funny. Mr. Vidal is a political and social aristocrat that gives him name-dropping rights to the 20th century, and drop names he does. He's had dinner with everyone who matters, and it seems he's read everyone who matters more. Whether he's unveiling the secrets of America's entrance into WWII, or punching holes in Kenneth Starr's multi-million dollar investigation into Bill Clinton's peccadilloes he is unerringly on-the-mark. Gore Vidal is Noam Chomsky with a sense of humor, and the thinking persons' Michael Moore.

In this successor to &quot;United States,&quot; we meet FDR, JFK and Jackie, Dawn Powell, Edmund Wilson, Nixon, Lindbergh and Sinclair Lewis, to name a few, and gain perspectives that nobody else could provide. We watch as Mr. Vidal hilariously demolishes a critic and marvel as he tears into John Updike. We learn that Thomas Mann was inspired by a Vidal novel to return to &quot;Felix Krull.&quot; But for most of the book, we are treated to Mr. Vidal's vehemently expressed political views (the military-industrial complex runs the country, the American polity is a single party state with two right wings - Democratic and Republican, the Federal government is a form of tyranny, the majority of Americans are worse of than their counterparts in other rich countries). Whether you agree or not, reading Vidal always has the salutary effect of making you revisit your assumptions. This reader certainly awaits more from Gore."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"It seems perfectly fitting that Gore Vidal should become our leading man of letters here in fin de siecle America. Through his novels he has become our de facto historian, and through his essays he has emerged as a wry observer of American life and letters, although a sort of disembodied one, as he spends most of his time at his home in Italy.As he enters what is certainly the last fertile period of his life, we ask ourselves if The Last Empire will indeed be Vidal's last collection, or last memorable collection, of essays. If this should indeed be the case, Vidal has gone out a winner.Vidal's strong point as an essayist is not to lecture the reader, but rather to take the reader into his confidence, almost as if he was at his home in Ravello having a conversation. Whether he is discoursing on Claire Bothe Luce, Mark Twain, or the latest history of the Kennedy years, Vidal brings a lot of himself and his personal experiences to the page and opens up new vistas even to his most educated readers. The beauty of Vidal is no matter how much the reader brings to his essays, he or she will always leave with something, whether a previously unknown fact or a lead for further reading.One of the best essays in the book is &quot;Twain on the Grand Tour,&quot; during the course of which Vidal takes apart an academic's book of psycho-babble on Twain. There is nothing Vidal dislikes more than academics who make their subjects fit whatever theory-of-the-day is popular, and by doing so, perform a disservice both to their subject and the reader. As a further bonus for us readers, the hapless fool Vidal criticized didn't know when he was beaten, and sent a reply. Vidal's riposte is a classic, hoisting the fool on his own petard and damning him with his own words. It's like watching an osprey catching fish in the water.One caveat, though. Vidal becomes glaringly inconsistent during the course of his political essays when he insists on issuing a free pass to the Clintons. It is apparent while reading the essays that he has succumbed to what passes for charm in the former First Family, Hillary especially. For him, she seems to represent some combination of the best of Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Kennedy. Though he says time and time again that it is impossible to be elected ruler of these United States unless one is part and parcel of the military-industrial complex, these rules seem to fly out the window when discussing the Clintons as brave reformers in the face of ignoble Republican opposition. In reality, Bill Clinton has proven to be no more than the poor man's Huey Long, while his wife is resentful and duplicitous. Were this America of the forties, Joan Crawford could have easily essayed her in one of the Warner potboilers of the day. It gets so even wooden Al Gore, of whon Vidal has said many unflattering things in the past, is given that ticket to ride. Vidal's strength is as a critic; his weakness is as a supporter.Nevertheless, even flawed Vidal is far. far better than what passes for literary criticism in today's America. One should always keep this in mind when contemplating this book's purchase."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Gore Vidal has lived during the most vitsl parts of the 20th century and knows/knew personally many of the players on the US stage of politics and entertainment. Coming from a political family with strong political connections, he has been privvy to the &quot;real&quot; machinations and intrigues of how policies, laws, and, yes, movies are made. His gift for sardonic wit, cutting observations, and a consistent world view allow him to comment in ways that open the reader's mind to entirely different and eminently practical perspectives. Vidal's use of language is first rate, and his thinking on why we live in the kind of country we have become is expressed in ways that force us to drop the pretenses of patriotism and help us to become active citizens instead - provided we pick up his challenge to think for ourselves. In fact, all his volumes of essays should be required reading for every engaged thinker, but this volume is by far his best contibution yet to the discourse of America. A must own and a must read."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"As usual Gore Vidal is an excellent essayist and social observer in this book. His books are quite informative and you learn a lot about the US and many other issues. For example, I did not know that Frank Sinatra had leftist tendencies, [leftists by American standards as Mr. Vidal aptly points out]. He was sort of blacklisted and tormented by the FBI of Hoover most likely for that than his alleged connections to the mob. This example is just one of many facts that you learn when you read Mr. Vidal's books. I sometimes wonder how many hours there are in his day to read all the books and articles that he refers to. And one can tell that he had read them from cover to cover. If you are interested in current affairs and history or just want to read about Sinatra, Updike, Twain, Lindberg, Anthony Burgess, and many others, just pick up the book and read it. It is truly a joy. By reading Mr. Vidal you also learn about yourself. I learned from reading the article on the vice president Albert Gore why I do not like Faulkner. His style is not bearable for me. I always thought I am missing something because I am not an American. Now I know I never liked that kind of style in my own native tongue either. I do not spoil the book for the readers but I just want to quote one sentence that made me almost fall from the chair laughing while reading it in a bus. I am sure the other passengers wished the bus would have a stop in front of a mental hospital to deposit me. In the passage below he is writing about the magazine The New Yorker . &quot;Nabokov .... needed all of [Edmund] Wilson's help in fighting off editorial attempts to make his prose conform to the proto-Raph Lauren house impersonation of those who fit, socially in the roomy top-drawer-but-one.&quot; P. 93 If you do not think this is funny maybe Mr. Vidal is not for you. But read it for all the information in there for your next term paper or class project on politics, literature or almost any other subject you can think of. But don't forget the right citations. There are many professors who do not admit in public that they read any of Vidal's books, but they do read it at home. Do not flunk your course because you think Mr. Vidal is too radical and your conservative professor probably never heard of him and you can copy his words as yours."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Vidal still skewers sacred cows with a relish wherever he finds them, on the politically correct left or the fundamentalist right. When he takes on the American Empire he is like a reincarnation of Mark Twain. But for me, the three most important chapters were serious reflections on the current state of the Union and its future. The titles speak for themselves, Chaos, Shredding The Bill of Rights, and The New Theocrats. The decline and fall of the American empire may occur more quickly than that Rome. We need Adams, Jefferson and Madison, but all we seem to find are political hacks like Slick Willie, Little Al Junoir and The Chappaquidic Kid."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Gore Vidal is one of those writers who always challenges, excites, and stirs up my thinking. While I do not fully endorse all of the views in \\"THE LAST EMPIRE: ESSAYS 1992-2000\\", I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. He is one of the best.In terms of clarity of thought and analysis, Gore writes on subjects as varied as Sinclair Lewis, Mark Twain, JFK, FDR, Truman, Charles Lindbergh, John Updike (one of the funniest, most thoughtful and scathing essays in the book), \\"bad history\\", race relations, and the U.S. political system.Here are two examples of the passion and conviction Vidal brings to this book:1) \\"...I invite the Senate to contemplate Vice President Aaron Burr's farewell to the body over which he himself had so ably presided: 'This house is a sanctuary, a citadel of law, of order, and of liberty; and it is here in this exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the storm of political frenzy and the silent arts of corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.' Do no harm to this state, Conscript Fathers.\\" (essay on 'Birds and Bees and Clinton')2) \\"What will the next four years bring? With luck, total gridlock. ... With bad luck (and adventures), Chancellor Cheney will rule. A former Secretary of Defense, he has said that too little money now goes to the Pentagon even though last year it received 51 percent of the discretionary budget. Expect a small war or two in order to keep military appropriations flowing. There will also be tax relief for the very rich. But bad scenario or good scenario, we shall see very little of the charmingly simian George W. Bush. The military - Cheney, Powell, et al. - will be calling the tune, and the whole nation will be on constant alert, for, James Baker has already warned us, Terrorism is everywhere on the march. We cannot be too vigilant. Welcome to Asuncion. Yes!

That we are an Empire(the last) with military bases on every continent, as well as ten aboard the aircraft carrier called the United Kingdom. And best of all to me that Clare boothe Luce was at the Ritze hotel in Paris when the Germans swept through France. She wanted to stay to the very end, but the concierge told her that she must leave the now diserted hotel, because &quot;the Germans are coming&quot;. When Clare asked him how he knew , he said because they have reservations.

Vidal, perhaps out of rivalry, perhaps out of genuine contempt resulting from objective analysis, makes a meal out of author John Updike in \\"Rabbit's Own Burrow,\\" the lengthy essay that may be the highlight of this collection. When Vidal brings out his carving knives, you may sometimes pity whomever he deigns to dine on, but you're likely to be satisfied with the feast he serves.Vidal can be nice, too, and his thoughts on Frank Sinatra shortly after the crooner's death, are enlightening for anyone who squirmed at the sight of the Voice's seemingly illogical embrace of conservative politics after a lifetime of populism. Elsewhere, in his reaction to the death of Richard Nixon, you're not entirely sure where he stands. Vidal seems to have a grudging respect for the man he did so much to villify.Vidal's massive ego takes to the stage in \\"A Note on The City and the Pillar and Thomas Mann\\" in which he shares with us entries from Mann's diary praising...Vidal! It could almost be too much to take if Vidal weren't so amusing even at his most insufferable.Vidal is the last of the great curmudgeons, but unlike most of that breed, he resists being fully lovable. His sense of superiority keeps even some of his most avid admirers at arm's length, but whether one agrees with his views or not, he never fails to make you think and to laugh."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"This collection of essays is written in Vidal's always concise, straight-to-the-point manner. As great as he is in the historical fiction genre (his works from \\"Burr\\" through \\"Empire\\" are true American classics), still, I think his essay work is his best venue. Split into four parts, the latter three are often brilliant. His essay \\"Wiretapping the Oval Office\\" is hilarious, while his \\"Time for a Peoples Convention\\" is timely, even before it became imperative. Vidal seems to have the knack for seeing the most viable probabilities before they become crystal clear. The man simply talks (and writes) sensible, if sometimes altruistic, ideas and ideals. \\"Race Against Time\\" is one of those altruistic, yet emminently sensible essays. If anyone doubts Vidal's knack for seeing political reality in advance, let me quote his 1992 essay \\"With Extreme Prejudice\\", \\"...there is no longer a rational for so many secret services unless the Feds really come out of the closet and declare war on the American people, the ultimate solution...\\" Patriot Act anyone? Part Four of this book of essays must be read. \\"Shredding The Bill Of Rights\\", written in 1998, is an eery, uncanny prediction (come true) of what is happening now - ostensibly as a result of the 9/11 attacks - but Vidal saw this coming well before that. Recently, an aquaintance of mine whose opinions I respect stated that \\"desperate times call for desperate measures\\" when I expressed my deep concern with the unusually (and, in my opinion, illegal and unconstitutional) wide scope and potential for serious abuse of power contained in the PATRIOT Act (an acronym for Providing Adequate Tools Required in order to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism). I reminded him that this was precisely the defense used at Nuremburg by Nazi defense council. Count on Vidal to always be on the cutting edge of what is coming to a Country near you."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Vidal's political essays should be required readingin high school.

Its combination of literary, political and pop culture essays was replete with fresh information and insights, and I was pleased with its lack of political correctness. Although a few of the essays run on a little too long, the prose sparkles. The man is a genius. I wish, as Gore certainly does, that he were 20 years younger so he could keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Thsi is not Vidal's best book, though it contains some brilliant essays. However, Vidal at his worst is better than most writers at their best, and this entire collection is the work of a master in late career. His literary criticism is delicious, and the historical knowledge he brings to his work offers sweeping insight into the workings of politics and public policy. If he is correct in his analysis, and I find no basis for disagreement, we are witnessing the last days of the American empire. Whether the experiment failed or will give birth to something better is the question we face individually and as a nation. Vidal's contribution to the great conversation is immense."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"In The Last Empire, Gore Vidal mentions Jean Paul Sartre, \\"...who once observed that the bourgeoisie theater will put up with the most harshly accurate depiction of the human case, as long as there is no hint that a solution might exist. What is, is, and must ever be.\\" Almost all the essays in this book, like almost all the ones that have earned Uncle Gore the title of the finest essayist of our time, aim to destroy this \\"What is, is, and must ever be.\\" And they succeed brilliantly. Their content, let us say, is enormously critical to their success; but even more critically, Gore Vidal's essays succeed because he is the finest American non-fiction prose stylist and humorist since Mark Twain.The last time I saw Uncle Gore on TV was two years ago or so, looking good and saying, \\"Fighting terrorism is like fighting dandruff.\\" A couple of other recent-to-me Vidal comments are, and I paraphrase, \\"One's sexual practices have nothing to do with anything except one's sexual practices.\\" And, \\"Of course African-Americans drop out of school before going to college, out of boredom not incompetence.\\" Like many of Vidal's comments, these may initially sound implausible or sincere but struck off for popular consumption, but upon mature reflection, as they say, their literal truth is undeniable.From The Last Empire, here are three more gems of Vidal's wonderful prose style and humor-while-rocking-the-ship, followed by his tribute to the man I opine is his favorite fellow American anti-imperialist and humorist:Gem 1 - \\"Most establishment American journalists tend to be like their writing, and so, duly warned by the tinkle of so many leper-bells, one avoids their company.\\"Gem 2 - \\"...who would care about Pericles today had he not given a sublime funeral oration - as reported by General Thucydides, Retired - in which he reminded the Athenians that an empire like theirs, no matter how larcenously acquired, is a very dangerous thing to let go? Ditto now, as Perot would say.\\"Gem 3 - \\"Even our wise hero, Edmund Wilson, didn't really write all that good himself.\\"Finally, Vidal's tribute - \\"Mark Twain is our only...Mark Twain....(His) is simply a voice like no other.\\"So is Uncle Gore's."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Though definitely far from perfect, Mr. Vidal's wry comments, and sharp eye for nitwits and blather, always make for entertaining, and thought provoking reading! He has some nice things to say about Charles Linbergh, and even praises much of the politics and courage of the #1 Crooner, Frank Sinatra,(at least during Frank's early progressive days). Gore may be a bit harsh on Mr. Updike, calling him about the only pro-Vietnam War author out there, and someone who near blindly goes along with the politicians on war and peace. His assault on Updike's novel \\"In the Field of the Lilies\\" is definitely over the top. (I though it was a fine book!). He has nothing good to say about Pres. Truman, in Mr. Vidal's opinion the founder of the National Security State, and his comments on 1954 Guatemala are truly a revelation! His tales about Clare Luce and his ambivalence about FDR also provide amusement and some serious thought. And when he learns 47 years later that none other than Thomas Mann was reading his early book CITY AND PILLAR, he is most pleased, to say the least! Even if one does not always agree with Mr. Vidal, he always provides more than money's worth of hilarity and provocation!"},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Only to the extent that I am familiar with Gore Vidal, I suggest that his writings are worthy of a large audience. He brings forth an intelligence to be respected. And feelings that bespeak of nothing but human. Do you reject his feelings? But they are not yours. No one asks that they should be. But it is easy to reject the person per se. Thinking is difficult. Who said it would be easy? Who even mentioned that thinking might be something one should attend to. Here you will find an individual who has Attended."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"In these 'truly' exceptional essays, Gore Vidal poses the only 'truly' ultimate question: 'What happened to all of us for most of our lives?' His answers are also 'truly' devastating.He exposes an empire (the US) which spends half of its national budget to impose her vision of the world on the rest: 'For 50 years we have supported too many tyrants, overthrown too many democratic governments, wasted too much of our own money in other people's civil wars to pretend we're just helping out all those poor little folks all around the world who love freedom and democracy.'What is this vision in Vidal's words?No public healthcare (Everybody \`has the right to die unhelped'),Governing by laws ... and lawyers,Media obsessed with sex (not with \`who collects what money from whom for what'),Leaders as powerless figureheads,A fiercely disinformed population,Massive investments in war matters (\`the same money spent on the country's infrastructure - our rotted home base -would have saved us debt, grief, blood') turning the Union into a socialist country for the rich and free enterprise for the poor (\`public money doesn't go to the people, but to big business')Civil liberties abused on a daily basisA \`moral' majority explaining the \`moral' chaos by the free distribution of condoms ...By the way, Gore Vidal exposes also the myths about Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the A-bombs on Japan, the 1948 Berlin crisis and some disturbing facts about the Oklahoma bombing.His portrait of Frank Sinatra is astonishing, of Harry Truman dark (the National Security Act), of Clare Boothe Luce candid (\`Time' is fiction) and of JFK devastating.Gore Vidal is one of the greatest and most astute political commentators in US history. His books are (and will be) a must read for all present and future US historians, professional or amateur. Hopefully, those will show at least a small part of his courage.N.B. I do not agree that \`ultimately' the JFK and dalla Chiesa murders were Mafia hits."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Gore Vidal is thee sardonic observer of life.

The New York Times expressed its regrets for mistreating young Vidal after he published his no-nonsense City and the Pillar 'shamelessly'.That's all ancient history now. This collection of previously published essays is a strange mixture. As a non-literatus (singular of literati, not the same thing as an illiterate) I had to skip over most of his profiles of fellow writers and critics - not my cup of tea to learn what makes these people tick.I was, however, impressed by the 'American People' who never elected him to any position of power. His political essays are, to put it mildly, very strange. He seems to be a born American anarchist - the only good president, according to him, was Quincy Adams (the second Adams president) and not for his presidential years but his fairly unusual post-presidential congressional years.Vidal can be still lot of fun: he calls our recent presidents 'librarians' since, instead of pyramids, we erect libraries for them, usually in fairly nice parts of this country.So, three stars are OK for Vidal. His hostile attitudes towards FDR, Truman (to say nothing about Nixon, Vidal was definitely not on the right when he published these essays originally) are matched only by his more recent infatuation with McVeigh, the most efficient domestic terrorist, actually quite right of the mainstream.I was born 9 years after Vidal and I wonder how he managed now to die of pneumonia. One can learn something from him, after all."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"As a longtime fan of Gore Vidal I was disappointed in this latest work of his. I have read most of his work in recent times and have even given his books as gifts to friends, but this latest effort is not up to Vidal's usual high standard. The literary essays are fine and in several instances wonderful. However in the political essays there was a sameness about them collectively that seemed to render them shrill and unreadable. It is not the content that I object to, merely the repetition. There is only on essay on politics in this volume and Vidal has repackaged it several times, reheating and serving it up again and again."},{"Title":"The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000","review":"Gore Vidal, clearly one of the great essayists of our time, a wonderful man to read. He speaks to the best iun us and one must be educated to fully comprehend his literary indulgences. Unfortunatly for all his grandeur this publication is mostly flawed. its essays ont he Japanese intentions in WWII, its view of Islam and his biased, illogical hateed of the Republicans and his view of Americas role in the world are all flawed.Nevertheless I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a fair and intellegent critique of the conservative agenda. Most of illogical trash that documents Americas sopposed obessesion with dominating the world is not worth the reading. Pick up Gore's book but I would recommend bringing along some other sources so you can better be academically equipped to rebut Mr. Gores comments."},{"Title":"Uncle Remus: His songs and his sayings; the folk-lore of the old plantation,","review":"Most people today know of how the White Georgian Joel Chander Harris was fascinated by the \\"rabbit stories\\" of Black slaves he met at a Georgia plantation in the 1860s, thus eventually leading to this book in 1880. While it's justly famous for the \\"Brer (brother) Rabbit\\" stories (BTW-Harris was not the first to record these tales from ex-slaves, Abbie Christensen did that in Port Royal, SC in 1874), it's mighty rough for the modern reader. For one thing, the \\"Negro dialect\\" used by Harris is almost incomprehensible to today's reader. Additionally, \\"Uncle Remus' views on education for Blacks (not in favor) and black advancement, as well as his occasional use of the \\"n-word\\" will make this tough to swallow in these PC times. One has to remember when this book was written and get past all that to see the actual beauty and importance of these tales.PS-Be warned that if you like the original edition with the wonderful illustrations of Brer Rabbit in overalls smoking a pipe and of the background scenery and other animal charachters, none of these charming illustrations appear in the Penguin version-just so you'll know."},{"Title":"Uncle Remus: His songs and his sayings; the folk-lore of the old plantation,","review":"I found this book to offer a piece of American history which has since been lost.

From historical research (Suicide or Murder) to insightfully penned novels from the depths of his own mind (Dark Bridwell) he did have a gift undeniable and I enjoyed everything I read. \\"Pemmican\\" was, in my opinion, not nearly as good as the rest, and there are several specific reasons why it didn't measure up.It is entertaining enough, being a tale about a young mountain man, seeking his fortune and his adventure from employment with the Hudson's Bay Fur Company. There is a thread throughout that, in novelist's form, details the actual and historical strife and territorial jealousy between the major fur companies of the time. Pemmican, after which the story was named was the staple food of the natives, consisting of tallow for it's preserving properties, dried buffalo meat, chokecherries, other edibles ground together. It was all important, since it kept well, traveled well and the process itself lent itself efficiently to the lifestyle of the mountain traveler since fly specks or a little dirt or hair accidentally (or intentionally) finding its way into the mix soon vanished within its color and texture never to be noticed again as a foreign object. It also occurs to me that this \\"blend\\" of love, strife, conflict and discounted unimportance (fly specks) is the stuff necessary to life as we travel unknown pathways, and thus, Fisher subtly gives us the reason for the title of the book.That part of it is important, but the real idea behind Fisher's story was a fantasy that the rest of it revolved around; the chance meeting of the mountain man, David MacDonald and a beautiful wild white girl (named Sunday) with mesmerizing blue eyes who had been captured by the natives long before and had been raised as one of their own. He is not only immediately smitten, but quickly obsessed by the discovery even though he is repulsed by her vermillion and grease bound hair; privately the reader suspects that it may have evolved from the author's own secret yearning for the wild, the beautiful, the initially unattainable, animal attraction that gives over to surrender in the end - so intense is the interest afforded it throughout the story.But somehow, it didn't quite accomplish what Fisher obviously intended for it to do and there was an element of disrespect interspersed that was hard to understand, even though each reader knows different times spawn different attitudes. Perhaps it also was partly due to a fear of censorship since he wrote it an era with standards far different than today; but whatever the reason, it comes off slightly stilted; not quite complete, even though all the essential elements were there but left partially unfulfilled.However, we take the writings of others for what they were, what it is, what we take from it and judge not too harshly if the overall body of work was sufficient.

WHAT AN AWESOME RESOURCE BOOK!!!!!"},{"Title":"The crimes of England,","review":"This book was written by Chesterton during World War I to show that the war was, in part, England's fault for supporting Prussia and allowing her to get away with almost anything. His purpose is summed up very well in the first chapter, which is a letter to Professor Whirlwind, a German/Prussian supporter and writer. Chesterton says:\\"There is a very great deal that is really wrong with England, and it ought not to be forgotten even in the full blaze of your marvellous mistakes. I cannot have my countrymen tempted to those pleasures of intellectual pride which are the result of comparing themselves with you. The deep collapse and yawning chasm of your ineptitude leaves me upon a perilous spiritual elevation.\\"This then, is what he attempts to do: to show that England should not be smug and think themselves simply the defenders of humanity (though they may be that), but England should realize that they helped Prussia come to power, and they dealt poorly with the French Revolution and Napoleon, which let to some serious problems in Chesterton's day. Also, Chesterton blasts England for their poor treatment of the Irish, which were at the time involved in the home rule movement.Why does Chesterton do all of this? He think it is patriotic. He said in an essay entitled A Defense of Patriotism (found in his first book of essays entitled The Defendant) that \\"love is not blind...love is vigilant.\\" He thought, I think correctly, that if one really loves their country one will do what is best for it, not simply say it is the best. And sometimes what is best for it is to tell it that it has made mistakes, so that it will not make them again. Chesterton says near the end of the book that \\"I have passed the great part of my life in criticizing and condemning the existing rulers and institutions of my country: I think it is infinitely the most partiotic thing that a man can do.\\"This book gives an excellent glimpse into the situation in England during World War I, as well as an excellent view of what Chesterton considered patriotism to be. Of course, it is filled with witty and deep remarks, as all of Chesterton's works are.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"The crimes of England,","review":"Chesterton's \\"The Crimes Of England\\" was written in 1916 and needs to be read , and perhaps forgiven, as a product of the Great War. The \\"crimes\\" in the title are essentially an ironic reference. Most of the \\"crimes\\" Chesterton relate to the preceding three hundred years to instances where English policy was too pro-German, or at least, too pro-Prussian by Chesterton's estimate. The list of crimes include too much support for Frederick the Great and too little support for the French Revolution. Even the crime of England's brutal response to the Irish rebellions of 1789 - something Chesterton lets loose against - was made worse by the Germanic element in the royal family and the Army's use of German mercenaries against the Irish. Chesterton is sometimes accused of \\"Teutonophobia\\", this book must be \\"Exhibit A\\" in favour of that charge.With these caveats in mind it is perhaps best to survey the book to see what usefully can be extracted. Chesterton's take on Napoleon and French Revolution, defending Charles Fox versus Edmund Burke, is interesting. In a sense this shows Chesterton as essentially a liberal at heart rather than a tory. Today intellectual conservatism is often painted as arising in reaction to the French Revolution, Chesterton in this test case is obviously in the opposite camp. No doubt Chesterton was fully aware of the excesses, including anti-Clericalism (something he called \\"a catholic mood\\"), of both the French Revolution and Napoleon, but he sees the worst of the Revolution as having been fostered by the European powers' counter-reaction. He notes that the continental absolutists were opposed to the pre-revolutionary reforms of Louis XVI as much as anything that happened later. England, a liberal aristocracy and inspiration for many French liberals, by joining the counter-revolutionary alliance may have helped propel the French revolution in a more radical path. The longer term consequences of this still shake the earth. That the American revolution (itself welcomed by England's rival powers) failed to develop Jacobin and Napoleonic excesses, and the 20th century revolutionary and counter-revolutionary experience gives at least some credibility to GKC's interpretation. Similarly Chesterton's defence of the Irish revolution of 1798 and his \\"no holds barred\\" language in this chapter (itself written just before the Easter uprising of 1916) shows some radical spirit despite his support of the Great War.Chesterton doesn't back pedal from his own radical critique - developed over the preceding decade- of British plutocracy with it's origin in (to use a \\"marxist\\" term) the \\"primitive accumulation\\" of the Tudors, the expropriation of Church property and the local commons in favour of a new \\"capitalist\\" ruling class of court favourites which he saw ruling all the way down to his own day. The Tudor revolution, in Chesterton's view biased the development of England away from agrarian smallholding and ultimately stifled local democracy and autonomy, something which always had medieval roots. This lack of local democracy and plutocratic rule came to underpin both Big Capital and the British Empire and saw English policy towards Ireland bent in a more exploitative direction than a more populist arrangement back home would have allowed.Still the failure to apply his own radical critique to the case of Britain's participation in the Great War strikes me as a blindingly obvious error. Chesterton's teutonophobia strikes me as shallow and somewhat ad hoc. It reminds me of criticisms of Russia made in the Cold War that painted communist aggression as rooted in previous centuries of Moscovy and Czarist expansionism. This is all a bit like blaming the secret bombing of Laos on Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase, only drawing a longer historical bow. Most of his specifics, in isolation, are reasonable enough. Even the root of Chesterton's teutonophobia, implied but not made explicit, that Prussia, being outside the ancient borders of the Roman Empire was thus never truly latin and thus not truly European, making it easy prey to various heresies, including ruthless military autocracy, is not unreasonable. This shoe actually better fits the later Nazi period than the actual subject. It is however a bit much to put all of Europe's bad eggs in one Prussian basket, even if you don't particularly like Prussian baskets. Surely plutocracy, Empire, the corruption of \\"the Party System\\" (to steal a title from a book co-authored by Belloc and GKC's brother) and the mass press, the suppression of the Irish and \\"the Servile State\\" - all major Chesterbellocian themes - all came together in the war against the Hun. A critique of the British Empire's involvement here would seem to be logical next step for Chesterton's analysis. Postwar developments would only confirm the astuteness of such an analysis had it been made. In a sense there is a parallel here between Chesterton and the socialists. Just as under the pressure of war the radical socialists of the First International all, bar Lenin, ultimately rallied to their nation's colours, so too did Chesterton and Belloc, although the duo started from a quite different radical base. Perhaps his, and Belloc's, understandable love of France clouded their judgement. Perhaps Francophilia rather than Teutonophobia is the problem.Chesterton's writing style is, in my opinion, not as good as Belloc's. He can take a frustratingly long time to get to his point. Still the stoic reader is rewarded by the odd jewel. Here are a few.Describing genuine democracy. \\"Every Citizen is a revolution.\\"Describing the British two party system of his day. \\"The wrestle of the two great parties had long slackened into an embrace.\\"\\"The libel law was now used, not to crush lies about private life, but to crush truths about public life.\\"\\"They meant a degree of detailed repetition and dehumanised division of labour, to which no man born would surrender his brief span in the sunshine.\\"\\"The very powerful official who makes the choice of that great people for peace of war, might very well be called, not the President of the United States, but the President of the Americans.\\"They all still seem relevant."},{"Title":"The crimes of England,","review":"For as long as I can remember, I would ready whatever was in print and crossed my hands.

This is the kind of romance novel that gives romance novels a bad name (minus the bodice ripping and sex- this one has no sex. At all.) Originally published in 1984, but republished in 2003, Sullivan's Woman features a moody jerk of an artist and a completely innocent dreamer of a writer. Of course she's stunningly beautiful, so he must paint her. Over the two months of their sitting she manages to fall completely in love with him, but heck if I can figure out why. So far as I can tell, they didn't actually talk and he just yells at her a lot. In the very final chapter we find out that he can't live without her and they live happily ever after. What? Huh?

It had a decent story line, and it moved along at a decent pace, but again, the characters just weren't up to par. I understand that this is a reprint of a book written in the 80's, and you can tell how well Ms Roberts has evolved in her writing technique."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Woman","review":"Sullivan's Woman, a Silhouette reissue from 1984, has been re-released in 2003 \\"by popular demand.\\" This romance between painter Colin Sullivan and budding novelist Cassidy St. John takes place in San Francisco and does a very good job of evoking the atmosphere of that city, which is so full of excitement and contradictions. Roberts provides some lovely descriptive passages that bring the sights and sounds of the city to life.The story is simple and predictable-impoverished Cass is discovered by wealthy painter Colin, and they fall in love while she poses over a series of weeks for his latest painting. Despite the fact that there are no twists or other surprises, the story is told in an absorbing way, and the reader likes Cass, who is exclusively the viewpoint character. While I normally prefer to have scenes from both the hero's and heroine's point of view, it works well here to see things only from Cass' eyes because the reader too wonders what makes Colin tick and what his intentions are.Though it is difficult in a novel that is only 219 pages long, I would have liked to have seen more character development for both Cass and Colin. They come off as stereotypes throughout: Cass is the ambitious, high-tempered half-Irish writer who is very honest, intelligent and newly passionate, but we learn very little of her past, how that has shaped her present and really what her present concerns are (other than making it as a writer and resisting falling in love with Colin). Why does she want to write and what specifically are the themes she wants to write about? How do they spring from her life? As it is, we have no idea what makes her tick. It's the same for Colin. He's a handsome, rangy, highly strung, impatient and passionate black Irish man who's totally consumed by perfecting his art. Why? What is his past or present has driven him so? Why is Cass the perfect woman for him? This short novel would be immensely enriched if some of these questions were answered."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Woman","review":"Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:&quot;Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?&quot;"},{"Title":"Sullivan's Woman","review":"Another book by Nora Roberts which once again clearly shows why this author is called the Queen of Romance.Set in San Francisco, the book centers around a young woman Cassidy St.John who is young and vibrant but having soem trouble establishing a career.

While she is initially overwhelmed by his good looks and wealth her personality begins to win him over. As the sittings take place and these two people get to know one another better, it is clear to any reader that this is more than an artistic endeavor. Slowly Cassidy and Colin are falling in love and I imagine any reader would find as I did there was a smile on their face by the end of the book.As with all romance novels there is the requisite happily ever after and readers know this. But in the hands of a wonderful romance author like Nora Roberts, it is truly the journey which thrills her readers and the destination is the icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Woman","review":"Sullivan's Woman is a 1984 book by Nora Roberts. I think to enjoy Sullivan's Woman, one has to keep in mind that it was written in 1984, and that Silhouette and the world viewed romance novels different then. The man was always mysterious, domineering, and a total hunk who mainly only shows his love for the woman by the end of the book. Bearing this in mind, Sullivan's Woman isn't that bad.The two main characters are Cassidy St. John, a struggling writer who takes odd jobs to pay the rent, and world renowned artist Colin Sullivan. He meets her at Fisherman's Wharf on a foggy night and insists that he has to paint her. So begins their relationship. Roberts does a good job of portraying the artist in Colin, how he forgets everything but the painting and how he has total concentration on the subject. Many would think that he only fell in love with Cass because she was his model, sort of a working relationship, but by the end of the book one does see that Colin really does love Cassidy.A spiteful ex girlfriend helps to keep Cassidy insecure about her love for Colin through most of the book, but that does not mean she doesn't have a backbone, for which she does. She shows plenty of spirit and energy, most unlike a lot of the 80s heroines. She is insecure in her love, but I think this is an accurate portrayal of any relationship. Who isn't insecure about their love for their partner in the beginning? Roberts portrays the growing relationship well. I did become annoyed and frustrated with Colin's elusiveness in saying how he really felt, but like I said, this was part of the way romance was written in the 80s.Though this is an early work of Nora Roberts, I still enjoyed it and saw it as a precursor for many of her better books to follow. It is a fast and pleasant read and a must have to add to any Nora Roberts collection."},{"Title":"Sullivan's Woman","review":"I must say I enjoyed this book, which is odd, since I usually don't go for Nora Roberts earlier books. It's a short read, just over 200 pages, and was published in 1984, which might lead some to think that the writing would be dated as well. In this case it was not. There were no references that would make on think that this book was 20 years old. The story between Colin, the successful Irish painter, and Cassidy, the strugging writer, is a refreshing twist, where they actually did'nt jump into bed with each other. Roberts allowed the storyline and chemistry to develop at a natural pace, instead of Roberts sometimes trademark instant falling in love. I enjoyed this book, as it was light, and sweet.

Avvar is a city not unlike London during Victoria's rule. It is inhabited by humans and demons - the Yama. Like the aristocratic British, the Yamas have a strict hierarchical society. The aristocracy, called \\"daimyos\\" do not want to be tainted by mingling with the lower classes (people), or with their own outcasts, rebels who refuse to live within their own hierarchical system, (called \\"rohn\\"). Yamas are a humanoid species, extremely beautiful and gifted. They are able to communicate telepathically and can feed off of human life force without killing their victims. Humans crave the high technology that Yamas have developed and accept the \\"rohn\\" into their world in exchange for the use of this advanced technology.Inspector Adrian Philips, is a detective and peacekeeper, policing both human and \\"rohn\\" communities. He loves his work, is ambitious and has his heart set on moving up in his field, using whatever politics necessary. Roxanne McAllister is a lovely but eccentric artist, a painter, daughter of a deceased diva and an unknown father. She is an outcast from polite society because of her illegitimacy and her eccentricity. Roxanne lives on the edge of the Avvar slums with two boys who she picked up on the streets, starving and desperately in need of a home. Adolescent Charles, 5 year-old Max, (right out of Dickens), and Roxanne make-up an unusual but loving family of three...until Inspector Philips enters the picture.Roxanne finds Adrian literally on her doorstep, seriously injured after a fight with hostile \\"rohn,\\" and takes him in to care for him until he heals. The plot thickens with a huge dose of Ms. Holly's romance and erotica. The mainstream storyline is not bad either. One of the conflicts is that if Inspector Phillips follows his heart and stays with Roxanne, he will ruin his reputation and all chances for promotion. There are enough interesting subplots and unusual characters to make this a page turner. The two boys are adorable, Adrian's family is just too funny, and there's a chillingly evil doctor who steals children for experimentation to keep the plot edgy.This is a fun book, which mixes fantasy, intrigue, history, and sensuality, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.JANA"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I first ran across Emma Holly in the HOT BLOODED anthology and went on to read HUNTING MIDNIGHT. Both those books concerned shape-shifting vampires and I was intrigued by both the concept and the remarkable \\"steaminess\\" of the stories. In THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER, Holly has created an alternative reality in which the worlds of beautiful, technologically advanced demons and humans overlap. This imagined world bears a great resemblance to Victorian era London. Inspector Adrian Phillips of the Securite Service has allowed himself to be implanted with demon powers and finds himself alienated from both human and demon society alike. After suffering an attack by humans who serve the demons while searching for a missing boy, he is rescued by a half-demon woman, Roxanne McAllister. While recuperating in her home, he finds himself falling in love with her while trying to resist a relationship that would destroy the ambitious police career he has been building.Emma Holly's trademark erotic scenes are very hot indeed, and there is a sweetness and vulnerability in both Adrian and Roxie that I find very appealing. The secondary plot concerns the appearance of Roxie's powerful and enigmatic demon father in her life and his intentions toward her. The book probably should be 4 stars, because the wrapping up of the secondary plot seems a bit rushed, almost an afterthought. However, the character development is so strong and the book so entertaining, I had to go for 5! THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER is a definite \\"keeper\\". I don't know if there are the seeds of a series here, but I'd enjoy another visit to Adrian and Roxie's world."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Emma Holly is one of the hottest cutting-edge writers in today's market. She's gaining a strong fan base for her sizzling Romantica tales (Strange Attractions, Personal Best and her Black Lace books) to her Paranormals (Catching Midnight, Hunting Midnight and the novella in Hot Blooded) and Victorian Era (Beyond Innocence, Beyond Seduction). Frankly, I think Emma Holly canand doeswrite anything she wants and does it unlike any writer around. Her writing is frank, open and she loves to walk on the wild side.This time she ventures into another Paranormal tale that is both exciting and very original. It has the feel of another series, and one I will be looking forward to when they tales come! The range of Holly's writing is amazing, her deeply drawn characters and strong plot really set her above others Romantica writers. She succeeds while others often don't make the bar, because her works are well researched, and she gives such heart to her heroine and hero.Set in the Victoria era, Inspector Adrian Philip of Securite Service, is more than a typical policeman, he is the keeper of peace between demons and humans. He has accepted implants in his body that enable him to have incredible strength, and to assume the powers of a demon for short periods. By accepting this role of protector of both, he belongs to neither. Adrian is an outsider in both worlds.When Adrian seeks a missing boy, he is attacked by a local gang. Using his demonic implanted powers, he escapes. After using the powers, he is weakened and collapses in a courtyard of Roxanne McCallister. Roxanne is also an outcast, a half-breed, part demon, part human. She takes Adrian in and treats him. Adrian is very attracted to Roxanne, but knows no woman will want him. Proof of this is his former wife had walked out on him because of his not quite human state. Roxanne desires Adrian, but is unaware of his demon enhanced state. Being a half breed, she fears no man or demon would want her either. As Adrian recovers under Roxanne's tender care, he falls in love with her, yet tries to resist a relationship that could interfere with his police career, and ultimately will leave him hurt when she rejects him.In true Emma Holly fashion, the love scenes are beyond erotic, but she never loses a firm grasp on what makes Romance work. Her fantasy world works, because she strongly roots it in reality of caring people that linker in the readers mind long after you put the book down.Another keeper for my Emma Holly shelf! They are racking up very fast, and each one so special.2004 Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I love Emma Holly's historical romance novels, so I was hoping for something special here. No such luck. By two thirds through the book I just had to put it down; reading it had become a chore.The setting is the part of the book that really fails. It's supposed to be Victorian England combined with aliens and modern technology. People have absurdly prudish views about what is proper in this world (but you'll have to infer them - the author never really explains any of it). At the same time, it's sort of a futuristic society where people live alongside a bunch of aliens called Yama who have brought with them some technology that looks mostly like modern technology. Unfortunately, these two aspects of the setting just cancel each other out rather than combining to form something interesting. Most of the time I just couldn't figure it out.The Victorian social mores of the time are supposed to be the driving force behind the characters' actions, and yet they never really made any sense. The minute that Adrian and Roxanne meet they are torn between desire and the knowledge that they can never be together because Roxanne is not a suitable lady. Adrian is worried that associating with her will hurt his career. But it took me half the book to figure out why Adrian thought she wasn't suitable, and even then it didn't seem like that big a deal. Apparently painters were not considered proper. And Adrian wants a promotion at work, and his boss might not give it to him if he finds out he's been sleeiping with Roxanne. I kept asking, \\"So what? So what if he doesn't get a promotion? So what if his mother doesn't like her? So what if she's a painter?\\" It was a non-conflict.And frankly, Adrian seemed like a bit of a wimp. Sort of a mama's boy. A \\"proper Victorian gentleman.\\"The Yamish implants that give him some special power also don't add a thing to the story. On top of the Victorian morals, which are never really explained in a way that is convincing, there is some kind of social taboo about having the Yamish implants. Couldn't quite figure out what that was about. So basically this book is about two characters worrying constantly about a complex social system that the reader doesn't know anything about. Maybe there was more to the book in the second half. I was so bored and annoyed after a while that I just couldn't keep reading.I think it might have been better if the setting had been Victorian England, and had been fleshed out to the point where the plot made sense. The alien aspect didn't add a thing to the book (except confusion).As for eroticism or romantic tension, there didn't seem to be any. No explanation at all for why Roxanne and Adrian are so consumed by desire the first time they glimpse each other. Adrian seemed totally repressed, and that seemed to be the main focus. I found it boring."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Holly writes the sexiest writing I have ever read. The love scenes are hot, hot, HOT!The characters are endearing. The action is packed. The setting is vivid. Most erotic fiction is bland and corney. Not so with Holly. The plot in all her novels are serious and intiguing. The story line always comes full circle and there are never any strings left hanging. She's simply an excellent writer.In Demon's Daughter (title DID need a bit of work, though) Inspector Adrian Philips is a bit of an outcast after he receives demon technology to help him in his job in policing the demon population (who are stronger than humans). Roxanne McAllister is a unique artist (she does porn-people, yet she's a virgin). She's also the daughter of a very famous and beautiful singer. Unfortunately, her mother is also known for her multiple and frequent sexual partners and Roxie's father. . . (come on people it's not hard to figure out, look at the title).After Adrian ends up in Roxie's garden, badly beaten and in need of medical care, Roxie takes him in and nurses him back to health. Regardless of their backgrounds, they can't help but feel something for each other. But, problems are on the horizon."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Writing a story that is both paranormal and believeable, yet with enough quality components to make the otherworld plausible is a neat trick. Add an interesting set of secondary characters and a dash of spicy--almost erotica--and you've got a terrific book. The whole world of \\"non-satanic\\" demons used here and in the Crimson City series is not a favorite of mine. No matter how it's sold--demons only have negative connections to me. Yet this one provides a strong father demon, a mixed blood daughter as the female lead and an \\"enhanced\\" male lead creating a weird demon blended family that you come to care about. Their story is so well written that you buy the whole package and enjoy a brief escape from the cares of our everday world. Definitey worth reading and a little \\"softer\\" than the usual harder-edged stuff from this author."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"The difference between DEMON and other books that a-s-p-i-r-e to be comparable erotica-romantica-fantasy is like the difference between making love and having you-know-what. There's erotic-romantic-fantasy out there that's fun. It's provocative. And it's also depthless. I read those, but I don't hold my breath. I don't think back on the characters in those books.Both Inspector Adrian Phillips, DEMON'S lead male and Roxanne McAllister, DEMON'S heroine, have strength of character and body that they must come to recognize over time as well as an overwhelming passion and sensuality just bubbling underneath polite emotional shells of vulnerability and shyness.Adrian isn't a normal male lead. There are cracks in what would otherwise be the typical romantica/fantasy author's Ken doll, if you will. He's a sensitive detective who follows all the rules...and looks for lost children on his time off.Roxanne McAllister is a painter who wants to fit into the world she lives in and is simultaneously unwilling to sacrifice the beliefs and behaviors that make her unique. Her generosity as exhibited by her informal fostering of two street children is not the only thing that sets Roxanne apart; and when a distinguished and eerily familiar Yama \`demon' shows up at her door one day to engage Roxanne's expertise as an artist, her awareness of just how different she really is deepens.I think Holly uses Roxanne to represent the reality for most women (and maybe men too) that individuals are often desired for the same qualities about which the world's most harsh judgments are made-sexuality, strength and race (species, rather), among other things. Roxanne is as in need of love as Adrian, and the love story between Roxanne and Adrian is as tender as it is seductive.Holly's crafting of the story, Adrian, Roxanne (and all the characters really) is masterful. With both lead characters, I think Holly strives to bring androgyny to gender stereotypes-that is, showing that behaviors that may seem distinguishably male or female can and do exist in BOTH genders in reality. Holly has created a world that made me think-about stereotypes, about the imperfection of love, and most importantly, about myself.Furthermore, the fantasy foundation of DEMON and the underlying story regarding the Yama \`demons' and the humans is intellectually stimulating and very creative. This sci-fi background is given proper respect and attention, and it does not feel thrown together as an afterthought.Holly's finesse with the 'gray areas' in life (lacking so many extremes in behavior that the subtlety of characterization is properly achieved) allowed for the creation of characters that allow the reader to step into their shoes for awhile, feel pity for them, feel angry for them and keep his or her fingers crossed, hoping that their situations will eventually sort themselves out.Two Thumbs Way Up!"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"During the reign of Queen Victoria, Inspector Adrian Philip enhanced his ability to keep the peace between demons and humans by accepting implants that enable him to have the incredible physical skills of demons for a short time. However, the cost of doing his job better is that neither human nor demon society accepts Adrian as one of them.Adrian wanders in a dangerous part of town seeking a missing boy Tommy Bainbridge. He is accosted by a local gang, but uses his implants to escape, but fails to get on the other safe side of the wall. Adrian collapses in the courtyard of Roxanne McCallister, an outcast half-breed. As she helps him recover from exhaustion due to the implant use and the beating from the gang, he realizes that he wants her. However, he knows no woman will have him as evidenced by Christine, his former wife of three months, who walked out on him. Roxanne is not Christine as she desires her patient, but knows no male, demon or human, would want an in-between soul like her.This is an entertaining historical romantic suspense fantasy that never slows down from the moment the hero is fleeing for his life in the foggy Avvar slums until the final confrontation with his Roxie and (two buggers). The story line is action-packed and filled with a deep cast, especially the lead couple. However, what makes Emma Holly's tale so powerful is that fans from several genres will believe in this alternate Victorian world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Fan's of the very talented author Emma Holly are going to be very happy with her latest erotic paranormal read. Ms. Holly has delivered us another creative world in which nothing is as it seems and where nothing is worth having without taking a little risk. Combine compelling charcters that are not \\"perfect\\", a fast moving storyline, steamy attraction between our main characters, and voila pure entertainment.Of course those that are new to Ms. Holly should be warned that her love sense are \\"HOT\\" to say the least and are not for the faint of heart.The reader will step into the Victorian like city of Avvar were humans and demons live side by side, and where it's dangerous to find the two mixing. Or at least it should not mix but Roxanne McAllister just so happens to be an outcast in this city who shares genes from her human mother and her demon father. As if this is not bad enough she finds herself drawn to her injured guest Inspector Adrian Phillips. What starts off as a brewing mutual attraction turns into a searing relationship that is doomed from the start. These two should not be together. Ever.Adrian knows that he can't share his life with Roxanne, but one week under her care has changed him forever. When he finds out about her heritage he knows that he must end things with her quick and clean. Easier said then done and he finds himself crossing a line that could put everything they feel and share at risk.Again this was a great story for fans of the paranormal genre. The characters are truly multi-dimensional and as a result the reader can't help but feel for them. Love scenes are hot and explicit in true \\"Emma Holly Fashion\\", but it only adds to the telling of the story. Ms. Holly has truly created a very interesting world in which a reader can loose themselves if for only just a little while.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I haven't read any books by Emma Holly before and I thought I'd give this one a go. When I started it I was initially rather perturbed - it seemed like I had bought a book which was erotic fiction, not something I enjoy reading. However, I persevered and I'm glad I did. There was much more to this book than it first seemed and I thought it was very well written - I just wish there was less sex and more of the rest of the plot as that plot was actually very good.Adrian Philips is a police Inspector in a world that's sort-of like Victorian London but slightly different. There are Bow Street Runners, gas lighting, the Queen is on the throne - but this place is actually a different country in a different world where, 30 years before, a race of other people were discovered, called Demons. The demons have started to live with the humans but there is significant distrust between the two communities. Although the demons actually have a lot of modern technology (such as cars, communication screens etc) and the humans are still in 19th century levels of technology, the demons keep a lot of their technology away from the humans.Adrian Philips, however, is the beneficiary of some demon technology, some implants that enable him to have super-human strength when he calls upon it. This is very useful for his job as a police inspector but because he has used some demon technology his colleagues shy away from him. He works the difficult beat looking for missing persons in a dodgy area of town - some young boys seem to have gone missing and people think that the demons are taking them to feed upon their life force (something which demons can do).Adrian finds himself rather battered after a fight and ends up being looked after by Roxanne McAllister, an artist and the illegitimate daughter of a famous opera singer. She has taken in two boys from the streets, Charles and Max, and has given them a home and made a family. She looks after Adrian for a week and nature takes its course as one would expect in a novel like this - except that there's no future in it. Roxanne is from the lower classes, her personal history makes her an outcase, and Adrian is warned to sever connection with her or his job is at risk. So he does.Roxanne has always wondered why she is so strong and when coming face to face with a demon diplomat she discovers the answer - he is undoubtedly her father, although everyone knows demons and humans can't breed together. This adds one more obstacle in the way of a relationship between her and Adrian, especially when her father tries to initiate contact with her. When she ignores this she finds Max has been removed from her care and later she and Adrian are nearly kidnapped. What is going on with her father and the prince of the demons. Is there any possible future with Adrian despite their different social levels? And what about the fact she's half a demon, surely this makes her completely beyond the pale?What's good about this book is the way that two caring people learn to deal with the issues that initially seem too big to get past. Although there's a lot of sex in this book there's also a lot of character building, plot unravelling and a lot of consideration of how two very different races might settle in to living together just 30 years after the discovery of each other. I would recommend this book if you don't mind reading about sexual scenes because the rest of the book makes it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER is erotic - and most of the plot revolves around the sex scenes. I'm not complaining, mind you. I'm just warning you that there is A LOT of intimacy in this book. Some of it is very exciting - to the point where you don't want to read this book in public for fear of embarrassing yourself. Yet, sometimes, the sexual descriptions are so detailed it's almost clinical (and sadly humorous, to boot).I personally enjoyed DEMON'S DAUGHTER. It's the first book I've read by Emma Holly, and it has made me curious to read more. DEMON'S DAUGHTER takes place in an alternate world, sort of a Victorian England thriving with both humans and a technologically superior race called the Yama that feed off of human energy. The heroine, Roxy, is half Yamish (or, half demon), while her hero, Adrian, is a cop who is something of an outcast among his fellow humans for having Yamish implants that make him super-strong. Accident throws them together, while social and racial issues try to break them part.I thought Roxy and Adrian were both well rounded, intriguing characters who (demons aside) actually seemed realistic. My only complaint would be Adrian is the only hero I've ever read about who blushes over everything, non-stop (he is the exact opposite of a bodice-ripping, chauvinistic warrior-type), while Roxy's initial resentment and anger toward her Yamish father seem overblown. Other than that, DEMON'S DAUGHTER was fun to read. Adrian is quite probably the most inoffensive hero EVER to grace a romance novel (he's a real sweetie), and while there is some colorful language used in this book, overall it's still pretty tasteful and quite exciting to read. Just remember, this book is all about the love scenes. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll be sure to enjoy this most unusual, most unique love story. PS. Will Charles get his own story?***For a similar read, try Melanie Jackson's romantic Goblin City series, which begins with TRAVELER. It's an alternate universe, set in the US, in which characters are half-fairy and are fighting underground goblins who are trying to takeover the world.***"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"The Demon's Daughter brings together two of Emma Holly's best genres - eromance and science-fiction. Adrian Philips is a peace officer ensuring that the civil rights of both humans and demons are enforced. Roxanne McAllister is the illegitimate daughter of an opera singer and demon diplomat who makes a living painting erotic art. When Adrian's hobby brings them together their instant chemistry sends them on the adventure of their lives and gives us a great story."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"It is the nineteenth century and London has been transported to another universe: the city of Avvar in the empire of Aedlyne. Inspector Adrian Phillips tries to keep the peace along with his fellow police officers, but he has, in many people's eyes, become one of the enemy.The enemy are the Yama, otherwise known as demons. The demons have fantastical powers, and also a very hierarchical structure. Their aristocracy, the daimyos, do not mix with humans unless they can avoid it - like Lord Herrington, the Yamish ambassador to Avvar. Some of the rohn, the Yama underclass, are criminals but, because of their powers, they are difficult for the human police force to subdue. Because of that, Adrian has been enhanced by demon technology: he has implants which allow him greater strength, speed and so on. But these implants now have made him a near-outcast. His wife threw him out, and he's almost a pariah at work.One night, pursuing a missing child whom no-one else seems to care about, Adrian is attacked and almost dies. His rescuer is a beautiful young woman, Roxanne. She too is an outcast: Adrian assumes that she's a prostitute, but she's actually the illegitimate daughter of a famous music-hall singer. They begin a relationship, but Adrian is convinced that once Roxanne knows about his implants she won't want to be with him. However, he doesn't know about her own secret, the secret she doesn't know herself until her father shows himself in her life.Against the backdrop of an inventive twist on Victorian society - the atmosphere is so vividly written that I almost felt myself walking down cobbled streets lit by gaslight - and several, in the end integrated, side-plots involving a doctor experimenting on missing kids, political plots involving the daimyos and Lord Herrington's conflicted loyalties, Adrian and Roxanne's romance is played out with sensuality and emotion. Holly is definitely an author to watch!- wmr-uk"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"This was so well crafted. You actually felt like you were in Victorian England (well with demons). The heroine is resourceful and loving. Adrian is smart yet not over bearing. He is not a super alpha male hero, but he shows such care and love. I love the fact that he makes difficult choices and is not apologetic about them. No quirky, zany characters or last minute saves from new people. This is a tightly drawn story you will soak in. The only real problem is it ends a little abruptly. I could have gone on for another 100 pages."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Love this series. I love the world that it's set in. It's everything Emma Holly is known for. I've read this series more than once. Totally worth the buy."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Emma Holly conveys a sexual freedom in her work that is addictive and luscious! This was not one of her better works. The sex became monotonous and extremely \\"not-special\\", the flip-flopping of the main character was pathetic ad-nauseum, there was no substantial action or secondary situations to hold interest and I found myself just not caring what happened..... because, Duh! You KNOW they will end up together with a baby in the end anyway.... so the \\"how\\" just didn't matter. This is the first time I have ever been able to let a book go without finishing it. I found Sherrilyn Kenyon's Born of Fire MUCH more interesting and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Emma Holly has an absolute genius for both telling a compelling story that is both romantic and erotic. She uses lush detail and draws compelling characters. I can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Imagine Victorian London with some modern, even ultra modern technology. Now add in the fact that it is at war with demons and populated with fantastic creatures from dreams, and now you have the setting for Demon's Daughter. A government agent, Adrian, has made himself a deliberate pariah, implanted with demon powers though he is human. Outcast from both groups, when he is injured in the line of duty, his only comfort comes from Roxanne, a half demon woman whose greatest fear is herself. Fearing what her demonic heritage makes her does not stop her from falling for Adrian, but it does give him pause. Consorting with her jeopardizes his career, but also could put them both at peril, thanks to her father, a powerful demon with dark motives. Of course, this is also a highly sensual novel, albeit overly graphic, relying on explicit images rather than emotional, evocative subtlety. With less anatomical descriptiveness, this would be an excellent book, built on an intriguing premise that would appeal to lovers of urban fantasy; and if you can ignore that aspect, it still might be.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Just like the title says...thinly veiled soft porn under a very weak layer of fantasy. She should write for the skin magazines and not even be considered an author in the SF&F genre."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Inspector Adrian Phillips consented to demon enhancements to better allow him to keep the peace in Avaar, a city not unlike Victorian London. However, his decision to further his career cost him his marriage. So when he's brutally beaten following the trail of an abducted child, he never expects his savior to be Roxanne McAllister, the daughter of a singer known for her sexual conquests. What starts as a chance meeting blossoms into something more as Adrian finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into Roxanne's life. But a man like him wasn't cut out to be a husband, and Roxanne has secrets yet to be uncovered.A long-time fan of Ms. Holly's work, I love her well drawn characters. Her vivid settings make you feel as if you're there, and the action never stops. I loved the way the story unfolded, the secrets growing deeper and the world more convoluted with each turn of the page. This is a novel that really drew me in until I didn't want to close the book until I finished. Real emotion tugs at the heart strings, and even the secondary characters are well drawn. In a world this rich and vivid, I only hope Ms. Holly visits it again sometime soon.Fans of fantasy and romance will find much to praise here, for her fantasy world is vivid and rich with description. This setting easily meshes with Victorian London, until it feels more like an alternate history rather than a wholly separate world. Little snippets from journals start each chapter, again further realizing the setting.A great read. You won't be able to put this one down. My only question - when is the next book coming out?"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Emma does it again- marrying the oddest worlds into one unforgettable steamy tale. Demons in Victorian (sorta) London with enhanced humans doing battle with them... and having hot sex to boot? Very few people could pull this off (name one besides Holly?) but this author does it with style. It was too quick a read, but very enjoyable.

Bravo, Emma!"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I picked this book up because a friend of mine had read it, and told me about it. She described it as, \\"Victorian, only not\\", and I think that's a pretty apt, if short, description. Emma Holly gives us two main character who are flawed, but not in an irredeemable way. Holly also has a flair with showing us the internal conflicts her characters are going through. This book is definately adult in content, but the erotic content compliments the main story, instead of overwhelming it.

Why? The authors attempts at erotic tension fell flat for me. The two main characters are in such a state of arousal when they first meet I'm surprised they can walk. This state seems to continue throughout the book to a ludicrous degree. What the author considered 'exciting' and 'erotic' frankly just made me groan.Also, I was bored with the whole orphan subplot. Not a big fan of kiddies in my romance novels. Yes we get it. The heroine is a saint for looking after two orphans. Can we get back to the main story now?Sorry, I hate to go against the tide which is obviously a very popular novel, but Demon's Daughter bored me and I found the 'erotic tension' ludicrous. 1 Star."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I wont go over everything said already but this was a great book.

Oh yeah and the sex scenes whewwwwwwwww hmmmm yummy ok so try this book it was great!!!"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I have always marveled at Emma Holly's exquisite use of erotica in her novels. I have enjoyed almost all of her work and had looked forward to reading more. I enjoyed Strange Attractions and couldn't wait to read The Demon's Daughter. This novel's unique brand of romance, erotica and fantasy enthralled me from beginning to end. Imagine a setting that is similar to Victorian London but with futuristic technology and demons inhabiting the earth. You get the city of Avvar and demons that feed from human life force with sex. Inspector Adrian Philips is one of the best police officers out there. In order to tackle both humans and demons, he implanted demon strength into his system and has suffered major prejudices because of it. It even destroyed his marriage. However, his life isn't the same after he meets Roxanne McAllister. Strong, independent and uninhibited, Roxie seduces him to new heights. But his romance with Roxie could cost him his career, especially after he finds out that she is the illegitimate daughter of a powerful demon, a demon her human mother had had an affair with. There are various twists throughout the novel.The sex scenes in this novel are very hot and tangible -- branding it with the signature Emma Holly romantica. The building of tension and scenes centered on seduction reminded me of Beyond Seduction, but the difference is that Roxie, i.e. the woman, is the seducer in this one. It is so nice to read about a sexually confident woman in a romance novel for a change. I loved the scene in the bathtub and the first encounter the most. The overall story is quite intriguing and the characters are well developed. But I couldn't help picturing the demons as aliens of some sort because of their silver eyes with no surrounding whites. I also couldn't help but notice that this novel could have easily been a regular Victorian romance with all the social obstacles and other aspects that this one possesses. I understand that Holly wanted to be creative and write something a little more different, but the demons came across as unnecessary fillers at times. Other than that, this is a great novel. Emma Holly has once again illustrated the reasons why she is one of my favorite romantica authors. I cannot wait to read her future projects. In the meantime, I cannot recommend The Demon's Daughter enough."},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"Honestly, I didn't know what to expect with this book.

I am happy to report that Ms. Holly did an excellent job of creating a parallel world that just happens to have demons in it. I couldn't put the book down. The romance was excellent and this being an Emma Holly book the sex was divine. I have to say that the first kiss was one of the best first kisses I've ever read and I've read a lot off books.

The writing is so far above what we usually get in this genre! It reads like fine poetry. You have to enjoy a little twist on reality -- the world Ms. Holly has created is very similar to what we know of 19th century England, but also different in intriguing ways. But the developing relationship between Adrian and Roxie is much more important than the unique setting. The supporting characters are all unique and interesting and well-drawn, and help make this a totally enjoyable read.The love story is one of the best I've ever read. The intimate scenes are incredible! I have to read it again, I can't get enough! : )"},{"Title":"The Demon's Daughter (Tales of the Demon World, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big fan of urban fantasy books, and I do get what the author was trying to achieve with this one, it just didn't hit the mark with me. The introduction of a race of \\"demons\\" who have already developed a whole modern society with modern inventions into the human world of Victorian Era England is an interesting premise and I do give the author credit for such a different plot. But, that aspect of it really fell flat for me. It almost seemed like the modern technologies were there only as a convenience to the author. How is a demon diplomat going to contact his prince in the demon world? I've got it! I'll just give him a video conferencing machine. Need to hold the heroine against her will? Just say there's some kind of \\"device\\" that can be put on the door to magically keep people out and muffle all sounds coming from the room. Want an erotic bathtub scene? Just give the heroine a modern bathroom. You don't have to explain how she could afford to come by such technology, it's fantasy afterall. Yes, I get it. It's fantasy. But, for me, fantasy has to also make some sort of sense, and most of this didn't at all.Now, it could be that the whole thing didn't work for me because I just didn't care for the author's writing style at all. It seemed kind of juvenile in a way. In many parts, I felt like I was reading a YA book, and not a sophisticated adult urban fantasy. I agree with those who've said the sex scenes were a bit much. Not that I have a problem with sex scenes....I love a good sex scene. But, these just seemed over the top. The dialogue seemed out of place, not only in the sex scenes, but throughout the book. I can almost get behind the idea of modern technology in Victorian England because of the plot the author devised, but Victorian characters using modern dirty talk? Again, seemed out of place. Even if they can now use modern appliances, they're still Victorian era characters and should talk that way.So, bottom line for me was that although the premise of this book was interesting and had promise, the execution left a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Forest","review":"James F.

I think that the Socrates Cafe concept is a great idea. Let's bring philosophy back to the people, but let's be realistic. Phillips hopes that his readers will be so moved as to begin a chapter and set off pursuing knowledge and an understanding of their world. But he doesn't touch on the potential problems and pitfalls of the program until the end of the book (in the FAQ section for those interested in beginning a chapter). And let's be realistic, the purpose of this book is to promote his group.Still, it's a good read that promotes not only philosophical dialogue, but also social improvement. And, if nothing else, it'll hopefully get more and more people interested in philosophy."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Though this might sound like someone being a punk or anarchy it truly is not. Christopher Phillips has written a wonderful book on how the journey of asking question can be more a learning experience than gaining the answer.The whole idea of the book is to keep asking questions. From any question that is posed there lies more question that need to be answer. Because answers are only part of the story. Mr. Phillips shows this by giving many examples of how philosophers throughout the ages have questioned the people that came before them, but also their contemporaries.The great part about this book is that at the end Mr. Phillips shows how to go about setting up a Socrates Cafe of ones own with the same ground rules that he uses. There is also a link to his web site were you can find already established Cafe's.This book is for anyone who is looking for an interesting book on philosophy and language that anyone can understand. At the same time there are things here that philosophy major could gain a greater understanding learn something new."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This is a philosophy book, but different from other philosophy books in many ways.First, this book is for common people and all people,not just for those who teach and study philosophy at college.You do not have to crack your brains to understandthe terms and expressions in this book.Instead, you can taste and smell a variety of lives,reading the dialogues, discussions and stories in this book.Second, this book is a drama.One day a successful journalist put an end to his job,and started a new life,taking a courageous step towrad a journey of planting philosophy across the country.He calls himself Appleseed of philosophy.Third, this book is a virus.The virus of passion for truth, story, the virus of childlike curiosity.This virus may infect readers, turning them into a voracious questioners.This virus may go beyond that andtransform readers into &iexcl;gadflies&iexcl;, which may irritate the establishment or society."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"I really enjoyed this book when I read it for the first time in tenth grade. Looking back on it, however, I see it now as a bit...well, a bit childish. The world of thoughts and opinions is much deeper than the bottom of a coffee cup.It seems now, even then as I was reading the book in tenth grade, that Phillips has oversimplified complex matters. His whole philosophy, as put forth in this book, could be summarized easily in one sentence: \\"Let's all be happy because philosophy is cool.\\" This is a gigantic simplification of the real issues at stake; namely: What is being? Who are we? Why are we here?He leaves out the actual history too; historical mentions are scanty and not worth noting. He idealizes Socrates and his contemporaries; in his book they are very \\"Americanized\\" versions of what the actual men were probably like, their real likenesses adapted to fit the cultural norms of contemporary North America--when in fact they were part of a totally different culture which he didn't even mention (As one who studies anthropology, this really irked me).And, on top of this, he never really says anything. Somewhere near the end of the book, he asks why we should philosophize, and answers it by saying \\"to be better people\\" or something like that. But then, why should we \\"be better people\\"? Instead of exploring these real issues, he kind of vaguely says that they exist--and then recounts a meeting at a cafe (or a prison or school, the locations vary) where, once again, people with very \\"American\\" mindsets talk about their experiences and try to delve into the issue.One other problem is the length and difficulty level. It's just too short and too easy of a read to answer, or even attempt to begin to answer, the problems Phillips claims he is devoted to. For example, in one of the dialogs someone remarks that Phillips' wife has just \\"crossed the language barrier.\\" There are two problems with this: First, the \\"language barrier\\" is never defined and like many other issues, just another abstract concept, now given a \\"philosophical\\" dimension.Secondly, the barrier that is \\"crossed\\" in his book is between Spanish and English. Guess what people, those two languages are not very different. I am a budding linguist and nearly fluent in Spanish, Japanese, Arabic (Modern standard with a specialty in Saudi and Iraqi dialects), and am familiar with many other languages (one of which is ancient Greek, the language of Socrates). The \\"barrier\\" between Spanish and English just isn't very big. If a language barrier does exist between two given languages, it 1) is more related to culture and 2) can be crossed once the new \\"culture\\" is learned.And lastly, there is one other problem, which is the biggest of all.HE NEVER ACTUALLY CITES PLATO. You know, he could have written the book completely on what he's read about Plato and Socrates rather than what he actually did read of Plato's works. I couldn't believe that Plato's works weren't cited in the references section. He does mention a few, but they are relatively unimportant works like Gorgias and Euthyphro--I think there is only ONE mention of the Republic, without which Plato would have been an obscure philosopher, like Heraclitus. This is like talking about J.K. Rowling but never mentioning Harry Potter. When other philosophers are discussed, their views are oversimplified.Looking back, this book poses serious problems historically, linguistically and anthropologically.It was okay when I read it, a few years ago. I've grown up since then."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"this book is very cute but does not have any real substance. the idea to travel around and discuss philosphy is beautifull but if you are looking to read a book that will help you venture deeper into philosphy, this is not it. the book has some nice, fluffy conversations. the main idea of the book could have been summed up in a page, which is &quot;ask more questions.&quot; so if you are looking to read something in line of &quot;zen and art of motorcycle maint.&quot; this is not it but if you are looking to read a easy to read, fluffy book about philosphy then go for it.Also, at times this book gets way to idealistic without any regards to true facts of life that human beings have to deal with. I mean, can a person with a family and kids travel around discussing philosphy without getting paid for it?can a person quit their job and go pursue their dreams[as the book suggests] without any regard to taking care of their families? way too idealistic at times!!!!"},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Phillips does what he says he'll do in this book: he introduces (or, reintroduces) Socrates to the general public. Yay! Like many, I had to take philosophy in college, and, like many, I was totally turned off by the overly-academic, self-absorbed philosophy professors presenting the material. Ick, and double ick. I found the material to be interesting, but not the people teaching the material.Socrates Cafe helped me to back up and regroup, however. I've been using Socratic methods in my classroom for a couple of years, and the results are phenomenal, because kids are their own best teachers in many ways. Phillips re-awakened my interest in discourse, and helped me to focus my questioning a little better.This book is, above all, accessible -- which was the entire point, I believe. Some have described it as pedestrian, to which I think Phillips would probably say, \\"Thank you.\\"Nice job, good read, a little slow at the end."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"i can't speak for experts but for a firsttime philosophizer like me who wanted to get his feet wet in the field and know about Western philosophy, reading this book was a great experience, giving me just the taste of philosophy i hoped for without lots of intimidating jargon.

It is written for the ordinary man. You do not have to be a student of philosophy to understand this great book.

It will make you rexamine your life and the things you once held as true. Who knows, maybe it will change you."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Where does \\"everyman\\" go in this world for reasoned, open, and enlightened conversation outside an academic setting? The filtered, abbreviated, and sanitized output of the media and Internet sites hardly serves as a replacement. Into this vacuum stepped the author, a former journalist, enamored of philosophers and philosophizing, who decided to facilitate Socratic discussions in all manner of locations, but mostly cafes and bookstores. Of course, Socrates, an Athenian of the 5th century BC, was known for his penetrating questioning of the assumptions of the leading citizens of Athens, a habit which little endeared him to them. This book consists of a rather meandering look at the author's hesitant start up of this enterprise, simplified re-creations of several actual question and answer sessions at a variety of locations, and various pertinent philosophical points from philosophers of the past and from the author.The questioning process at these discussions is pretty much ad hoc with honesty being the only requirement for asking or answering. Among the questions asked were \\"What is here?\\"; \\"What is home?\\"; \\"What is silence?\\"; \\"What is a friend?\\"; or \\"Why is what?\\". It is simply assumed that a group of near strangers who meet for two hours once a week, or less, benefits from kicking around these various, often vague or obscure, subjects. He doesn't address the impact of the disparity in backgrounds that such an assemblage is likely to have. The discussions can deteriorate into an endless series of not necessarily connected questions with limited results.It is striking that virtually none of the topics presented for discussion in the book are controversial. Does the author suggest that politics, religion, economics, media, justice, war, etc are of no interest to people who attend his cafes. If these subjects were broached, how would that affect the functioning of the groups? The author asks \\"What is a church?\\" in one group. What if he had asked, \\"What is the basis of religious belief\\"? One suspects that Socrates would have gone right to that. There is not the sense that the author is after the truth in quite the unrestrained manner as a Socrates.The author notes that ideas and conversation are essential to a democracy, however, neighborhood gathering places located in the midst of our sterile, zoned housing tracts are virtually non existent. These Socratic cafes could easily be seen as inadequate, artificial alternatives to real community gathering places. It's hard to imagine the people in \\"The Great Good Places\\" by Ray Oldenburg devoting much time to \\"Why is what\\" when so many real world issues having community impacts need to be addressed.The author disappoints in another way. Many authors have web sites, and he is no exception. In this case it is for his institution, the Society for Philosophical Inquiry, which supposedly supports 300 dialogue groups. But one can find no evidence of these groups anywhere on the entire web site - very strange. From reading his book, one would think they would be front and center on the site. Perhaps there are legal issues. Instead those who access the site are given several means of buying goods or joining the SPI for a fee. It's disheartening to find an emphasis on the Socratic Caf&eacute; name as a brand for sale. [Note: It turns out that the list of local cafes is for sale also. Socrates is rolling over in his grave.]At first glance, Socratic cafes seem to be an unqualified good - and they are as far as they go. But there is a certain amount of doubt as to whether that model can play a relevant and important role in public discourse in this era of isolation and spin. The book is unwilling to address any shortcomings of the concept, which is rather ironic given the author's insistence that he is \\"seeking Socrates.\\" The autobiographical elements of the book are interesting, but there is an element of self promotion that lingers."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This is a book for the ages, mark my words.The author engages people of every disposition and predisposition imaginable in tough-minded yet sensible and compassionate philosophical discourse.Making no claims or pretensions to *be* Socrates or to do precisely what Socrates did, the author clearly is a practitioner par excellence of an incredibly viable version of the Socratic method which he has evolved himself.And he also has taken the Socratic ethos to heart -- specifically, that any line of inquiry should be followed as far as is possible within the limitations of a given discourse, that even the most mundane questions and concepts can bear rich and surpising fruit, that everyone deserves respect and has a unique world view that they can and should articulate, and that the facilitator of such discourse (in this case, Chris Phillips) invariably learns oh so much more from the other participants than they can from him.Phillips' empathy and respect for other inquisitive people, combined with his own broad and deep thinking, is nowhere better displayed than in the section of his book entitled &quot;Why is what?&quot; where he tackles in an eminently creative and critical way one of the most pressing questions of our time: is there a Holy Grail of substance, and irreducible simple? A master of interrogation, the author offers up no easy answers to this (or any other) question, but rather prods the reader to come to his or her own conclusions.An amazing book, all told."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This book works on at least three levels. The first level is an episodic description of the author's progress in evolving his life goals; primarily the goal concerning the establishment and growth of &quot;Socrates Cafes&quot;. These are groups of people meeting on a regular basis to discuss philosophical topics. The second level is a discussion of philosophy (admittedly just Western philosophy but that's a good start). The third level is perhaps best described as a Socratic dialog concerning the methods required to facilitate discussion groups such as those that he facilitates.In many ways, for this book the sum of its whole is less than certain of its parts. This is not meant to be disparaging but, to explain, the first level, which carries the book's narrative, is interesting but not totally absorbing. I would have enjoyed the book just for this level alone; particularly those sections where the author uses his experiences to illustrate a point. I particularly enjoyed the discussion concerning the nature of community which was sparked by the author's experiences at a church with no central religious belief - &quot;When is a church a church?&quot;. The third level is also interesting in that one can imagine attending a Socrates Cafe and it was interesting to see how such a discussion is facilitated.Both of these levels are interesting and would have been sufficient to produce a good book. However, and what I mean by the parts exceeding the book, is that on a number of occasions I was prompted to put the book down and think carefully before I continued. This did not happen on every page but sufficiently often for me to take some time to read what is a fairly slim volume. My particular favorite was the discussion concerning the theme &quot;Why is what?&quot;. Another favorite was the discussion concerning the North American constitution and Declaration of Independence. These episodes turned an enjoyable book into something of great interest.My only criticism is that the book is short (and that fact that the closest Socrates Cafe is too far for me to visit)."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"For a book about Socrates, it is very &#34;light&#34;. It gives you a sense of what Socrates was about, what he did and how we can do it.

I know at least a small handful of them already have.This book has caused me to think, over and over again. The author, Christopher Phillips, writes beautifully and masterfully tells his story in so many different ways.When I first picked the book up I just thought it was going to be some light reading, however, since I've started to read the book I have found quite the contrary. I can only read a story at a time, because each story leaves me pondering and thinking and philosophically wondering the many questions that are not floating through my own head.I recommend this book to any and all readers who are interested in something new, something invigorating, and something that will leave you utterly breathless.I have grown to love this author, for the great things he has done for me by simply writing this book. Worth every penny if not more."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This is a good book -for the first chapter. After that it doesn't speed up at all, it just seems that Phillips has the whole book on cruse control going 50m/h the whole time (not really slow, but not very exciting either). By the end of the book, I was pretty bored. Phillips only manages to travel in circles while at the same time continuously dropping the same plug for his Socrates Cafes and expressing his oppinions on why philosophers are better people. (Then again I guess Plato did pretty much the same thing as well, so maybe it achieved its purpose.)Don't read this book expecting answers. You won't find any. The questions that are asked arn't meant to have answers. The dialouges in the book only bounce around from person to person with each person asking another question that in turn is answered with yet another.I love philosophy, and I love the way Phillips wrote the whole book with his love of the question in mind. I just think he could have done the same thing with a book half as long, then maybe I wouldn't have minded it so much."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This is a very thought-provoking read. The Socratic method makes it breezy and accessible. Certainly not one of those worthy-but-dull introductions to the subject.I would also recommend Stephen Law's THE PHILOSOPHY GYM: 25 Short Adventures In Thinking, to go alongside this - you get a deeper (and zanier) take on philosophy from Law, though also in a very entertaining package.The two books make a great complimentary pair. I gave both to my son who is getting into the weird world of philosophy for the first time and he just gobbled them up. I'm told there's good evidence that philosophy is excellent at sharpening up the thinking skills, especially of the young, and I must say it seems to be working..."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"A valuable reminder of the perennial futility of all philosophical pretensions to 'inquiry'. The book does a good job illustrating how one must perforce get sufficiently fed up with dualistic blather before delving into the scientist's and mystic's perennial way out of the rathole of all such puerile 'inquiry', as shown in, for example, the allegory of Socrates' Cave, and of course, 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'!"},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"I love the idea, but I have to wonder...yr average everyday folks just don't often care to ponder great thoughts, they don't quest for epiphany...I just have to wonder if all of these amazing discussions and illuminating insights from the most improbable sources actually happened as depicted in the book.You could probably get away with it on a college campus...in a coffee house...maybe in an open-minded church setting. I just have a hard time seeing these kinds of scenes actually happening in the regular old world.Maybe I'm just cynical, but I wish I'd bought a pizza and a six-pack instead of this book."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"In my opinion this book only has an attractive title. I so wanted to hear the opinions of the Socrates Cafe people but the freelance journalist writer was more focused to reveal what was revealed a thousand or more times by now in other books. At least he's got his book published and that must be some sort of achievement."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Though this book may seem for the &quot;common people&quot;, it is really a waste of money. I think Socrates would be embarrased to have his name on a book of a sophist."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend 15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This book is the fascinating story of a young man imbued with the love of philosophy, who wants to bring philosophical thinking into the lives of more people. So, in his words, as a Johnny Appleseed of Philosophy, he begins going to book stores, coffee shops, elementary schools, senior centers, even prisons, to hold philosophical jam sessions. With a little advance notice, he can usually draw at least a small crowd. Sometimes he's surprised at the numbers of people who show up. He introduces himself, and asks what questions the folks in attendance would like to discuss philosophically. Suggestions are made, and soon a free wheeling, yet Socratically disciplined conversation begins, typically among people who don't know each other, and who are perhaps from very different backgrounds, occupations, and worldviews. With Chris playing the role of Socrates, and teaching by example how we can all play that role - the role of a seeker after wisdom who is willing to question everything in search of the truth - he ignites philosophy in a place where it may never before have happened. He teaches and he learns. And he moves on to the next opportunity for creating philosophical community.It's quite a story. This is a man on fire to help people think more deeply about their lives and experiences. And a man willing to go wherever he can to make this happen. Throughout the pages of the book, he comes across as an idealist who is willing to do what it takes to see his dream come true. And the book consists of stories from along the way. We get to sit in on discussions all over the place, in a prison, or in a school. We are allowed to listen in on people's ruminations, reflections, and efforts to articulate their deepest beliefs. We overhear polite disagreements and witness collaborative efforts to get at the truth. What is the examined life recommended by Socrates? How can we live it? What is the best sort of life to live? And how do we get our bearings day to day, whatever we happen to be doing?The conversations can veer from the practical to the theoretical, but always the voices of real people break through. I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole book, and it's rare for a new book to hold my attention like that when I really should be reading three others I've already started.Take a look at Socrates Cafe and you may find yourself drawn into its great conversations like I was. And somewhere up in Platonic Heaven, Socrates himself may smile."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"The book started off in a very interesting fashion. The dialogues he initiates are interesting. They also have some enlightening answers. Not to mention rational thinking, a very under-used part of the mind, is given an arena to exercise itself. However, I felt the second part dragged. Or as a family member described it, &quot;he turned into his own commerical.&quot; The more I look back on it, the better that statement seems to describe later sections of the book. His writing is for the most part good. His aim is admirable. But in the process the book became bogged down and uninteresting. I also think the premise that truth can be arrived at through conversation is an untenable one. It can map out exactly what we are talking about and the complexities of the issue, but not much more than that. I don't think the book has anything lasting about it. It merely seems to reflect a trend to bring philosophy into the pragmatic, everyday world, such as Alain de Botton. I would recommend Botton's work as opposed to this, which has much greater insights into everyday life using traditional philosophy. If more people take this route, philosophy can be saved from word games and deconstruction, which even Derrida himself said &quot;can not be a method and should not be one.&quot;"},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"I was blessed to go to a reading-signing conducted by Chris Phillips, who also facilitated a live Socrates Cafe. I was astounded by how his dialogues in his books don't just mirror his live dialogues, but tie in all these wonderful threads with great thinkers across the disciplines from the past and present, while Phillips himself weighs in critically and creatively -- Socratically, I guess he'd say -- on so many timeless topics. He shows what a sham it is to create all these artificial divides between the disciplines, he shows how art and poetry and the hardest of the hard sciences are all intertwined, and how we can reveal hidden likeness between so many things by joining him in his exhilarating pursuit to question, question, and question some more in a decidedly Socratic way. My favorite vignette of all from his book is &quot;What's Love Got to Do With It,&quot; where he recounts movingly the story of how he met his wife at a Socrates Cafe; in fact, she was the only one who came to that particular session -- they discussed the question, &quot;What is love?&quot; -- and they ended up marrying one another! It's so beautiful, and all the sections of the book are deeply moving, penetrating and insightful. Best of all, Phillips never talks down to his readers. Rather, he prods us to think through our own unique answers to life's great questions. What a gift he has given to us. Already, thanks to his book, I'm asking myself, and answering more fruitfully, &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;WHo can I become?&quot;"},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"The only people who won't like this book are academics who have made their discipline irrelevant and sophists who have made their discipline a laughingstock. They'll feel threatened by the new and invigorating and exhilarating life Phillips breathes into philosophy. Phillips shows in a way that I have not seen before in a modern philosophy book that philosophy isn't merely about asking certain questions -- What is truth? What is being? -- in the way questions are asked. So it is that via his mesmerizing version of the Socratic method of philosophical inquiry, Phillips explores in a profound and yet sweeping way in &quot;Socrates Cafe&quot; such questions as &quot;Why is what?&quot; &quot;How can an intelligent, sensitive person get stuck in a lousy job?&quot;, &quot;What is home?&quot; and &quot;What is silence?&quot; He has recaptured the tradition of unendlingly novel and illuminating philosophical exploration that sadly has gone by the wayside for the most part since Socrates' lifetime. This book is for everyone who wants to push their thinking, for everyone who wants to better answer such questions as &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;Who can I become?&quot; Thank you Christopher Phillips for bringing philosophy back to the people and for having the courage of your convictions in presenting such a compelling alternative to the narrow, unimaginative thinking that passes for philosophy today in books by academics and sophists."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This book provides us with an easey forum to run through some of the life's most basic and yet not so often thought or talked about questions. What is home? Granted it touches on some philosophical subjects which certainly have been covered in more depth in 'proper' philosophy books, however this format allows the reader to think about the questions and have a private discourse by reading what others have said and thought. Its a very friendly book on philosophy, and thats what philosophy on the surface should be.I loved and and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in having an entertaining yet thought provoking time with some of the people at the Socrates Cafe."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"This is a great little book that is part Robert Pirsig, part Robert Fripp, part Gurdijeff, part Plato. I mean this in all the highest forms of flattery. Phillips presents philosophy as something lived and to be lived. It is a bit like taking the Socratic pursuit of Thinking, throwing it in Heideggerian fashion into being and then asking for questions in most unacademic places. Christopher Phillips has &quot;rescued&quot; Thinking from its academic brackets in the process.It is also Chris's story. Interwoven with his wonder at the remarkable observations of children, senior citizens, prisoners, men and women he meets in cafes is the story of his life as well. So, at times I thought of Robert Pirsig, at times King Crimson diarist Robert Fripp. Elements of Gurdijeff's MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE MEN are given uncanny twists: sometimes it is a Mexican kid from the mission district in San Francisco, sometimes a white collar criminal who realizes too late how and whereby he messed up his life. Some of the people are looking for Truth, be it emotional or spiritual truth. Sometimes unexpected answers are uncovered. At all times, Phillips recognizes that this is as close to the real deal as Philosophy can get.This will not satisfy the academic who believes that sophisticated answers are found only in the in-bred world of the ivory tower. There is no Wittgenstein upheaval of Western Thought, no Quine like analyses of the logical positivistic framework. Nope, just folks thinkin seriously about their lives. Somehow because it is not a task for profit and career, it is all the more genuine. Fripp once noted that the professional (musician) when confronted with an abyss will play what he knows, while the amateur will exceed what he knows because he doesn't know to stop. That's what is at work here. Phillips will draw historical analyses as points are made, but the references are really beside the point. He has done something remarkable, or perhaps the thinkers he has encountered have done something remarkable: they have reclaimed the Socratic dictum of an examined life for themselves, and as such, they have stood up, pointed the way out of the cave to the true light.This is a book to cherish, and to be enjoyed by all ages. I've just finished it and have given it to my 11 year old niece in St Louis. I suspect we'll have much to talk about. Thank you, Chris."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Christopher Phillips has written an engaging, if somewhat over-simple book describing the project of his middle-age and, apparently, the dream of a lifetime in being a Socratic teacher.The book describes how Phillips left his life as a free-lance writer for the even more unstable and risk-driven career of teaching people how to question and how to think -- about philosophy in short. And question Phillips does, in cafes, bookstores, prisons, schools for at risk children, old-age homes, and anywhere else he can find people who are willing to question and discuss.It is only late in the book that we learn some of the &quot;why&quot; of Phillips' own quest- how he grew disatisfied with his professional, and apparently personal, life as well and come to the conclusion that he needed to devote himself to an activity he deemed worthwhile. He became a Socratic questioner, went back to school to earn several masters degrees in process, and found himself a wife from among his students. The chapter in which Phillips describes his quest and finds his wife to be is for me the best in the book.The Socratic dialoges themselves are a mixed bag on subjects that range from trivial to serious with comments that range from insightful to trite. The dialogues are less than truly Socratic in that Socrates generally coversed with one interlocutor at a time and kept the discussion focused on the matter at hand as an aid to approximate the truth. The procedure and comments in the book are, alas, to undisciplined to stand with what Socrates had in mind and seem at times to degenerate into bull or rap sessions.No terrible harm in that. Some people, old and young, appear to be genuinely moved and interested by their first attempt to think clearly about important matters. If only a few people learn to think and to study deeper than they might otherwise have done, Phillips's efforts will be amply repaid.There is a too easy criticism of academic philosophy in the book which, however, is understandable given the nature of the author's goals. There is good discussion of contemporary American thinkers such as Walter Kaufmann and John Randall. Most importantly, of course there is the discussion of Socrates and his great student Plato, and on the influence they have exerted since their times on anybody who has grappled with their thought and learned to question and love the life of the mind -- which is the life of the heart and the soul when schooled.This book is hardly the last word in philosophical thinking but it does not claim to be. May it awaken readers to a sense of wonder and reflection and thought."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"I bought this book upon the suggestion of a friend so I'd have something relatively easy to read on a flight. It not only fulfilled its intended purpose but also proved to be intelectually stimulating and thought-provoking. The author cleverly worked in mini-lessons about a number of philosophers and explored a variety of philosophical subjects. My main criticism is that the book only skimmed the surface; it didn't go very deep into the issues. (For a book that does present the basic arguments and definitions regarding issues of philosophical contention, try Mortimer Adler's How to Think About the Great Ideas.) I do recommend this book, as long as you don't expect too much from it."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"It's hard not to admire the enthusiasm of Christopher Phillips in his efforts to revive interest in philosophy among a wide variety of contemporary persons. Questions arise, however, as to just how socratic his modus operandi is. He declares he's no self-help guru, for instance. Yet is his readiness to descend to tears and therapy rather than ironic tough-mindedness, this is exactly what he ultimately most resembles. His repeated disinclination to answer questions put by an interlocutor and his preference instead for returning the question to its asker strikes me as even more guru-like and unsocratic. Finally, his eagerness to avoid extended one-on-one question and answer encounters in the presence of a group, preferring rather the role of the &quot;facilitator&quot; who gets everyone talking, reveals him more as the unwitting heir of the flattering John Dewey than of the &quot;offensive&quot; Socrates who claimed to know nothing, but was able to show smug others that they knew even less."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"\\"Philosophy is boring,\\" it is so often said. And, really, who cares what a bunch of dead, white, bearded guys thought anyway? Well, forget acedemia and its recondite intellectuals. Philosophy was meant for the open air of the agora, and the cocophony of voices and opinions that come with it. Only there, amid the diversity and freshness of life, can we discover contemporary issues and depart on altogether new philosophical vistas. With this book, and the Socrates' Cafe movement in general, Phillips has done the seemingly impossible -- he brought philosophy back down to earth. He made the business of philosophy public. Like a roving Socrates, he has taken to the streets, nursing homes, middle schools, cafes and even the prisons of America -- all in search of the question -- and in his wake you will find a storm of discussion. The results are phenomenal. Socrates' Cafes are popping faster than Star Bucks! It would seem that everyone has a knack for this ancient art. Quick, easy and highly rewarding, this book is sure to ignite or rekindle your philosophical passions. It certainly did for me, anyway. Good for both beginning interlocutors and the most advanced philosophical heavyweights."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"Frankly, the idea of philosphical discussion isn't a bad one, but what this book leaves out- both in the author's personal narrative, as well as the dialogues- speaks volumes for what is wrong with philosphical discourse in this time and locale.First, Philips devotes not one word to non-Western philosophies, which is amazing considering that the guy has an M.A. in philosphy. The fact that these philosphies are absent from the discourse means most importantly that the concrete application of one's &quot;love of wisdom&quot; is absent from this book.That means, among other things, that Philips sees his &quot;Socrates&quot; synthesis as somehow superior to those who lead a &quot;mundane&quot; life. Unfortunately for Philips, it's the &quot;mundane&quot; that provide the means for him, directly or indirectly, for him to hold is cafes. (If perhaps Philips had been familiar with Eihei Dogen, he'd have seen the &quot;mundane&quot; in a different light.)The book seems therefore to offer little real insight - despite the claims in the book- into Philips himself. Yeah, he had a mid-life crisis. Yeah, he thought his life wasn't &quot;exciting&quot; enough. Yeah, he got educated in Western philosphy and started being a &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; disseminating Socratic methods. But that's no answer to the concrete problems that many in life face- probably including Philips himself. Ultimately, he's not much to emulate. Philips' Socratic method is limited, it seems, to ideas only- not actions, and that makes this reader feel that the whole enterprise is kind of impotent.Along a similar line, another thing that's absent from this book is any major take on deconstruction and other post-modern trends. One might suspect the former is absent because of the devastating criticism of Plato made by Derrida. Regardless, it's a gaping hole in the book.Still, as I said before, any book that gets ordinary people to think about things- and question their beliefs, is hardly a bad one. For that alone, I give it 3 stars. Its embedded tutorials on great Western philosphers are quite good too. Still, if I were to introduce anyone to this particular area, I'd still start with Russell's History of Western Philosphy."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"That's a pretty \\"interesting\\" thing for Phillips to say, at least.And, the real Socrates (read I.F. \\"Izzy\\" Stone's \\"The Trial of Socrates\\") isn't waht Phillips accepts him as. Phillips does admit in passing that Socrates was pretty much an anti-democrat. (That's what got him convicted; ignoring the Athenian civic gods - not the Olympians - was the official legal entree for that.)But, Phillips doesn't query the Platonic figure any more. (He also doesn't tell you that the Socrates who briefly gets written up in Aristophanes was purely for comedic value.)This gets to Socrates' battles against Protagoras and other Sophists.Phillips accepts at face value the Platonic winner-written history that the Sophists were elitists.Actually, if anybody in this issue was an elitist, it was Socrates. He did, as Phillips alluded Socrates could do at times, have preconceived stances (think Jesus vs. Pharaisees) and his \\"socratic dialog\\" was often rhetorical.Since Athens had no lawyers, and you had to argue your own civil - and criminal - cases, skill in rhetoric was invaluable. And offering to the hoi polloi was egalitarian.This book might halfway deserve a 3-star, but, if Phillips can't get his own protagonist correct, and doesn't care to try, it doesn't deserve more than two stars."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"I got this book as a present from a friend who knows me very well. He knew this kind of book would interest me and as a matter of fact I was very exited and could hardly wait to start reading it. I am share the authors ideas about DOING philosophy instead of writing long, unreadable analytic essays about esoteric topics which are far from what philosophy SHOULD be about.My first sense of disappointment started upon reading the authors introduction. Phillips says more than once he does not want to be a Guru, or to tell people how to live their lives, but unfortunately that is exactly what he does (try replacing the term 'Socrates cafe' in the introduction by the term 'meditation' and see what you get...). However, my enthusiasm for the 'concept' of the book made me overlook this issue and keep on reading. However it didn't last long enough to get me through the book. Eventually I did not finish reading it. It could be interesting having a philosophical discussion in different and 'original' contexts, however it is non-the-less important to have a discussion worth reading - i.e. saying something more than the obvious. I think Phillips understands this point, and this is the reason he did not write down a log of his conversations.The few discussions I read were all superficial. They raised a few questions regarding the topic at stake, but never took more than the first step in understanding even the question itself. I admit my disappointment could be a matter of my high expectations from it, and from thinking it is not just another trivial 'introduction to philosophy' book - because as such it may be very interesting.Maybe I will get to reading the end of the book someday, and maybe that day I would understand that I missed the whole point of the book, and it was I being superficial and not the book, but till that day arrives my disappointment from the book remains..."},{"Title":"Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy","review":"dispense with flatulent slogs through Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance, bloated icon of hippie intellectualism.Read this instead.

These stories will particularly appeal to readers because Newman tells them in part from the point of view of lay Americans, relying on fan letters and newspaper reports of listener demands."},{"Title":"The Rig Veda (Sacred Writings: Hinduism, Vol. 5)","review":"This is a convenient single-volume reprinting of a late-nineteenth-century (1889, revised 1896) translation, obviously out of date but not hopelessly obsolete; and so far the only complete English-language version of the whole of the \\"Rig Veda,\\" (very roughly, \\"Verses Knowledge\\"), over a thousand hymns, grouped in ten mandalas (\\"circles\\") or, roughly, books (but they are traditionally conceived of as heard and recited, not written).It was edited -- that is, selected and introduced -- by Jaroslav Pelikan, as part of a Book of the Month Club set of \\"Sacred Writings,\\" of which it was Volume 5, \\"Hinduism\\" (forming a companion volumes of sacred texts of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Confucianism, and Buddhism).The Rig Veda, or Rg-Veda Samhita (the \\"r\\" with an under-dot; Samhita means \\"collection\\"), is generally considered as the oldest of the Four Vedas, the basic canonical \\"texts\\" (officially transmitted orally) of ancient India, which are regarded as sacred by all orthodox modern Hindus, and even heterodox sects; the other three being the Yajur- (sacrificial formula), Sama- (chants), and Atharva- (a priestly class) Vedas. (This is, it must be said, something of a circular definition; traditionally, \\"Heretics\\" are those who deny the authority of the Vedas, and other Indian religions, such as Buddhism, are included in the category.)Conventional dating puts the composition of the contents between about 1200 and 900 B.C.E.; a little leeway on either side may be needed. But recent claims for millennially greater antiquity can't be reconciled with the evident relationships to other languages, and are often \\"rationalized\\" adaptations of the pious view that the verses are eternal, and self-revealing, manifesting to human and divine Sages in every cycle of existence, so that giving them a date is pointless.There are additional \\"Vedas,\\" including the medical Ayur-Veda, of lesser status, and, confusingly to the uninformed, several huge bodies of literature which are also called by the term (like the restricted and general uses of \\"Torah\\" in traditional Jewish discourse). The Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads, originally at least formally commentaries on the Samhitas, are also Vedas, which is easy enough to grasp, and the classical epics (Mahabharara, Ramayana) are often classed as a \\"Fifth Veda.\\" But a variety of mythological and legal texts, not all of them considered truly canonical by all Hindus, are often rather vaguely \\"Vedic,\\" too.Indeed, it seems that an Indian politician who announces that a policy \\"is in accordance with the Vedas\\" may be referring to something somewhere in any one of a vast number of texts, or to none in particular. (American parallels to such vague claiming of religious sanction may come to mind.)This is outlined in most books on Hinduism, or Indian civilization or literature; there are also many advanced treatments. A fascinating survey is offered in Barbara A. Holdrege's \\"Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture\\" (1996), which details traditional concepts of the status of the Vedas and the extensions of usage, in a comparative context.Western scholars generally prefer to use the term as narrowly as possible, and tend to give the most weight as evidence to the Rig Veda, pointing out that the other three are either liturgical arrangements of its verses (\\"ric\\" = verse, hence the name), with ritual or musical instructions, or a re-arrangement of hymns with some limited new material (the Atharva Veda).The hymns were traditionally preserved by oral recitation and memorization, and writing them down was long considered a sacrilege, but elaborate checks seem to have preserved the archaic language -- better called \\"Vedic\\" than the systematized Sanskrit of later times -- with remarkable accuracy.Outside of a handful of words and phrases on cuneiform tablets they are the oldest form of any Indo-Iranian language, and rival the Hittite texts (of the extinct Anatolian branch) as the oldest extant Indo-European literature. The somewhat less archaic Avestan Persian, itself of uncertain date, and a limited number of Greek words and sentences in Linear B are the closest examples from ancestors of other, living, Indo-European languages of similar antiquity. In Griffith's time, only the Persian evidence was available.The language is regarded as extremely difficult, not least because the vocabulary has become encrusted with later associations, but the lyric beauty of some portions survives translation.I have reviewed Wendy Doniger's translation of 108 of the 1028 hymns for the Penguin Classics (re-released in 2005, as \\"The Rig Veda,\\" originally published in 1981 as \\"The Rig Veda: An Anthology,\\" by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty), and have considered some of the interpretive issues there (in slightly different forms for the two editions). I cannot too highly recommend it as an introduction to modern Vedic studies, and a charming translation in its own right; although some feel differently about its approach to a sacred text.The present translation is radically different on several counts; extent, choice of English style, and age of scholarship. All must be taken into account, along with the fact that this edition does not include all of Griffith's supporting material.The first publication of an English translation of a substantial part of the Rig Veda, by H.H. Wilson, began in 1850, with the sixth and final volume in 1888, and it deserves the respect due to the work of pioneer. At the time Wilson started working, the main guide was the inherited tradition of interpretation in India, incredibly important, brilliant and truly scientific on the grammatical and phonological side, but also pietistic, and committed to the view that they were an a-historical revelation. This was combined with the still-emerging science of comparative philology, itself being created on largely Indian foundations, and a mixture of Christian (and disapproving) and Romantic (and partly uncomprehending) views on the nature and history of Indian religion.This edition, however, being based on the 1889 translation of R.T.H. Griffith, revised in 1896-1897 (two volumes), had the advantage of (among other advances) starting with Max Mueller's critical text (edited 1849-1874; second edition, four volumes, 1890-1892). That text was so good it is still considered a standard class-text edition in American universities (or, to my knowledge, was in the 1980s), and remains a basic reference.The Griffith translation aimed from the beginning at being complete; although some passages, and even hymns, considered too offensive for the Victorian public, seem at first glance to have been omitted, Griffith tucked them away in an appendix, offering Latin renderings, and sometimes H. H. Wilson's pre-existing English. (Griffith may have been prudent, rather than prudish. A few decades later, translators of the early volumes of the Loeb Classical Library cautiously turned Greek into Latin, and Latin into French or Italian, in order to conceal sex and other bodily functions in \\"the decent obscurity of a learned language.\\" The results for say, Ovid, were rather amusing.) Elsewhere, Griffith instead offers euphemistic or evasive translations.Less happily, Griffith's translation was also under the influence of Mueller's \\"Solar Mythology\\" interpretation of the long-enigmatic poems, itself based on a major Sanskrit commentator, although, fortunately, modified in a \\"Nature Mythology\\" direction which was less Procrustean in stretching the evidence. This approach was common in his time, and not without some merit; how much it influenced parts of Griffith's translation is made evident in his generally extremely valuable notes, identifying names of gods and humans, plants and animals (not always correctly), and supplying information and cross-references on dozens of other topics.There is one feature which some will find puzzling, or frustrating, especially when trying to locate references found elsewhere. Book VIII has, in one traditional arrangement, an appendix, the \\"Valakhilya,\\" which Mueller inserted among the usual 92 hymns instead, with the numbers 49-59. Griffith put them in their alternate position, at the end of the \\"Mandala,\\" but with Mueller's numbers attached as well. They are cited both ways; so those aware of the situation have a good chance of finding the right passage.Although the running notes and two brief appendices were included in this one-volume Book-of-the-Month Club edition in 1992 (a version I have used for years), it very notably omits Griffith's index. That made digital versions, which are searchable, very helpful; notably, if one was regarding it only as a supplement, the inexpensive Kessinger version, despite some manifest defects on other points.The English of the translations is not only formal, but pseudo-Biblical, signaling a \\"reverential\\" approach to Griffith's original readers, but probably just annoying to most moderns, and an obstacle to some. Griffith's work is seriously out-of-date on some levels, including both changes in linguistic theory and a vastly expanded knowledge of ancient India through archeology. His ideas about mythology and religion are, as mentioned, obsolete by several generations; although the most overt expressions of these have ideas were banished to with the notes, they did influence his translation, and should be kept in mind.However, it does offer completeness, and frequently reflects traditional understandings of the hymns; so it retains considerable usefulness if used with caution."},{"Title":"The Giant Book of Sudoku Presented by Will Shortz: 300 Wordless Crossword Puzzles","review":"This Sudoku treasury has 60 each of \\"Light and Easy,\\" \\"Moderate,\\" \\"Demanding,\\" and \\"Beware!

The object is to fill in all the subdivided blocks with numbers in order. Spiral Galaxies is worked on a grid but with no numbers; the object is to draw symmetrical tiles that completely cover the board. Alternate Corners is another numberless puzzle; the object is to draw a line through all squares on the board, turning at certain cells. Snaky Tiles is another spatial puzzle with numbers as reference points. End View asks the solver to put letters in the puzzle so that each row or column has all the letters. Certain rows and columns have letters at the margins; those letters are the first letters in from those margins, as if the puzzle was turned on end.These other puzzles I feel are a nice little change from the sudoku mindset. I don't know if I'd want a whole book of Snaky Tiles, but a couple here and there are fun.The Sudoku puzzles are on the same scale as Sudoku Easy to Hard, the other Shortz book of puzzles. The book is nicely laid out with one puzzle per page and plenty of room to work them and make notes.The only downside of this book is that it is a little thick for casual solving; it doesn't fit in a pocket.

The \\"suspense\\" in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Having read Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer before I read this one...I expected more. I am happy that this was not my first Deaver novel, I may not have read anymore of his works!!The story was weak and slow."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"The non-stop action and drama of this absorbing novel demonstrate the remarkable courage of a special group of children and teachers, against all odds.The book is filled with in-your-face maniacal perpetrators, the bravery of local police, sheriffs, hostage rescue team members and hostage negotiators.Delightfully, it portrays the innermost thoughts and feelings of the hostage negotiator.The plot spins you through a roller coaster of emotions, mainly, the plight of the hostages but also of the synergy between the hostage negotiator and the most courageous woman of the group with her clear, yet surreptitious, conveyance of important details.Above all, it demonstrates the sheer bravery and strength of this group of young children and their teachers, who rise above their unique traits, to fill the reader's imaginationwith a richly detailed portrayal of good versus evil.I've been a fan of Jeffrey Deaver's books for quite some time, most notably his series of books that feature Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs.

Don't expect a mystery. As a horror story writer, Deaver keeps us wishing away action scenes that won't go away. Their inevitability builds despite readers' determined hopes against evil. As a thriller writer, Deaver delivers the victories for the good guys, too.This book needs to be read in one sitting, to prevent too much questioning of the details. Some threads display a realism that will challenge belief while a reader remains gripped in the action. A weird potential relationship between the gorgeous female assistant and \\"one of the guys\\" doesn't make sense until you check your watch after the end. And the mutual, unrequited crush between a hostage and the negotiator needs perspective. A few other subplots provide contrived action. Distressingly escalated interdepartmental infighting and add layers of complexity and tension, with some permanent cost to credibility. More-than-strained press relations compound this distress. The emotionally satisfying resolution to the horrors doesn't bear too much retrospection, either.Deaver writes with a verbally vivid, emotionally rich style that provides gripping psychological tension without an undue focus on trivial details. If you're a fan of thrillers or horror stories punctuated by brief, outrageously intense action scenes, put A Maiden's Grave high on your list."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I have only just lately started reading Deaver's books so I have a lot of catching up to do.

It's a novel that should have been a script. Paced like a film, described like a film, dialogue like a film, it feels like A Maiden's Grave missed it's true calling.It's a great story, just not as a novel."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This is not a nice novel. It's reminiscent of Shane Stevens' Dead City, and Andrew Neiderman's Pin. It deals will pure evil, and the terrible toll it takes on those who dare battle it. I can't say I enjoyed the read. The novel is long, 400+ pages, but the read was relatively easy (but not painless). It's the subject matter that is disturbing: three nasty, despicable felons, scumbags, (one, the leader, Lou Handy, of course from West Virginia where I'm from) hole-up in an old meat slaughtering plant threatening to kill hostages: eight deaf girls and two of their teachers. The novel appears to be about the ensuing police barricade and the negotiation, headed up by Arthur Potter, to gain release of the deaf girls. But it's more than that. I don't want to spoil your \\"fun,\\" but all is not as it seems. This book made me think about what the author was trying to say and for that reason it was memorable to me."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Although Jeffery Deaver is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE AUTHORS, this was my least favorite book that he's written since the mid 90's. His books usually have many twists & turns, but for some reason, this book was slow for me. It's been a long time since I read this book but it just didn't hit me like most of his books do! I see that others really enjoyed it so I may have just not been in a book reading mood at the time!!! If you've read some of Deaver's earlier books/series, namely, the \\"The Rune Series\\" or the \\"The John Pellam Series\\", and did not enjoy them, please do not judge him by those books. His writing style changes completely with the \\"Lincoln Rhyme\\" books and if you like mystery & suspense, you will LOVE the \\"Lincoln Rhyme Series\\". I recommend that you start at the beginning though because it enables you to get to know and appreciate the characters so much more as they grow & develop throughout the books! I also really liked \\"Praying for Sleep\\", and \\"The Devil's Teardrop\\" is probably my favorite Deaver stand alone book. I wish he'd do a series with the characters from that book!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I had to read a book for my Deaf Culture class and out of the wind I chose this one and I couldnt have chosen a better book to read!

I look forward to reading more of Jeffery Deaver books, Im hooked!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I hardly got any sleep last night thanks to Jeffery Deaver. I picked up A Maiden's Grave and couldn't put it down. This book has more twists and turns than a New Jersey go-go dancer and the characters practically reach out, grab hold and won't let go. I'm heading out to buy the rest of his books and looking forward to spending more sleepless nights at the hands of this master storyteller."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Tense, engrossing, believible. Just what any suspense novel should be. But Maiden's Grave is much more than just a suspense novel. Great characters, exellent plot and dialogue, a truly masterful read. If you're interested, catch the movie version, Dead Silence starring James Gardner, it's just as good."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffery Deaver does it again! I would compare him to Dean Koontz in the ways that he really gets you involved in the characters in his books. Jeffery Deaver as so many little stories going on at once with each of the characters in his books. You can really feel what the characters in his books are feeling and going through. This story was so amazing how the law enforcement has to try to feel and know the mind of the criminal to know what, when and how to act or say to them. You can feel their stress levels go up as they try to predict the criminals next moves and try to negotiate with them. Jeffery Deaver has some surprising twist at the ends of his books. You will really enjoy this book. You must read this"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I know this book got a lot of good reviews, but I would give it 2Stars. I found that the hostage plot made the novel a chore to read. Perhaps my opinion is this way because I prefer a good murder mystery when the killer/s are completely unknown. Don't get me wrong, there was a twist at the end, but not a big one. A good novel for anyone interested in long hostage negotiations, otherwise try something else."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"As a crime fiction writer with my debut novel in its initial release who also teaches in a rural high school, I found Jeffery Deaver's A MAIDEN'S GRAVE fascinating. Eight students and two teachers from a Kansas school for the deaf are taken hostage by three escaped convicts. Negotiations soon commence, and FBI negotiator Arthur Potter does his best to free the hostages. A war of wills ensues, and Deaver has a great book on his hands. His plot, with a surprising twist at the end, is first-rate. His characters are believable. His setting is too perfect. I recommend A MAIDEN'S GRAVE highly."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I enjoyed all of Deaver's books, but this one is the best. It is less gruesome, less involved with the minutiae of forensics (which I find fascinating) but somehow more literate."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Another thriller from Deaver! This was hard to put down. The characters were vivid, the plot full of twists. This will not disappoint loyal Deaver fans."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Mr. Deaver is an excellent writer, evident in his flowing, non-stilted prose and sense of pace. The last section of A Maiden's Grave contained the best writing, with its dark, fast-paced build up to the surprising climax.Certain aspects took away from the book, however. Some of the characters, such as Special-agent-in-charge Hendersen, seemed almost uncessary to the story; in fact, Mr. Deaver builds up expectation of a new subplot involving Hendersen, then lets you down, almost as though he had forgotten all about him, only to bring him back later for convenience to justify the character's existence. The two technical agents assisting the main character Potter seemed interchangable in personality -- Mr. Deaver could have combined the two into one character. The romantic blossoming between Potter and Melanie seemed also a little bit forced, without much explanation, forcing the reader to take it for its face value.Despite the small flaws, the novel wows the reader with its rich realism and fabulous dialog and the intricate plots and subplots. It's an enormous feat given that the novel takes place virtually in one place in less than a 24 hour period. I highly recommend it to anyone. A Maiden's Grave transcends the thriller genre. It's an excellent fiction, period."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Yikes, being a Deaf educator and a Deaf person myself, I read this book straight through. I hated having to go to school and not know where the book went! Mr. Deaver has an incredible insight into people with malfunctioning brains...wonder why. He did a fair job on research concerning Deaf people, and certainly he captured my own parents' fears concerning people taking advantage of my own deafness. Luckily, I've never run into anyone like Handy in spite of my neuroscience degrees and hope I never will! As a Deaf person and one with a failed cochlear implant, I wish he had been a little more careful about his presentation of what a cochlear implant can and can't do. I realize he tried to be fair in presenting the militant Deaf side and the feelings of those who hearing was lost over time, like mine was...but the cochlear implant will not help the person feel better about themselves if they are taught they are somehow not fit to be in society without hearing of some kind. But enough of the lecture...otherwise the book was outright frightening because of the fact that something as horrible as this could happen. I just hope Deaver doesn't feed any wackos out there new ideas!

Unfortunately, this novel simply isn't the same calibre of the Rhyme books.The plot involves the kidnapping of several young deaf girls who are held hostage at an old slaughterhouse in Kansas. The main character in the book is Arthur Potter, an FBI hostage negotiator; he's accompanied by the standard techno-geek, the mousey assistant who faithfully logs info on the bad guys, and the stunningly gorgeous ex-model assistant Angie. For fans of the Rhyme series, you'll recognize this Amelia Sachs-clone immediately...the only change is the hair color.The villains are interesting, but not enough is shared about them to keep this reader interested. Most of the book is spent slogging through countless scenes of tech-talk, political in-fighting, and the developing &quot;relationship&quot; between one of the deaf women and the hostage negotiator. This plotline alone strains the credibility of the book.All in all, it appears that Deaver has done his research, but the plot is hackneyed and too drawn out -- I've even lost count of the number of times the hostage negotiation team &quot;bursts into applause&quot; at the slightest &quot;accomplishment&quot; of the hero, Potter.If you like police procedurals, read A Maiden's Grave. If you want an engaging novel, you'd be better off reading the Lincoln Rhyme series. And for the ultimate hostage negotiation novel, check out Robert Crais' &quot;Hostage&quot; -- that was a phenomenal read!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This was the first Jeffrey Deaver book I read so far and it is only the third book he wrote. I was sceptical if it is worth reading because the plot of a hostage taking did not seem do be really thrilling. It was a pleasant surprise that the book is well written, fast paced with good characters and is not boring at all.It also had some good twists in between and a surprising ending.On the other hand it did not really keep me glued to my chair reading for hours.Also what I did not like was the \\"love affair\\" between FBI agent Arthur Potter and the deaf teacher Melanie Charrol since it was not believable, it did not make sense nor contribute anything vital to the story in my opinion.I wonder how more recent Deaver books are which feature his \\"normal\\" main character Lincoln Rhyme. They are said to be very good so I might try one of them in the near future..."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Another great book by Mr. Deaver. Even though it did not have Lincoln Rhyme it was still great fun to read. As with all of his books, there are always some twist and unexpected things and this book is no exception. Just when I thought I knew it all Mr. Deaver throws something at me to keep me off balance. A fun read but not up to The Bone Collector status. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"i thought the book was really good. there's only one problemwith it and that's the rape scene that was way to descriptive. i wishhe wouldn't have put that in, it spoils the book. it bothers me alot to read that kind of thing, because then i'll have that image in mind for some time. besides that i thought the book was one of his best. it had well written character, a good plot, and not a bunch of technical terms they spend pages explaining to you.

I hope that Mr. Deaver writes more like this one. All of his books are wonderful so if you liked this one read them all!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I read roughly 90 books per year, all fiction, and generally in the same genre, and this novel has remained on my top ten list for many years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I found it to be gripping from cover to cover, and could easily have stayed up all night in order to read it in one sitting. Despite this being one of his &quot;early works&quot;, I still believe it to be his best. He manages to produce real fear and suspense without cheap thrills and gore. The characters are well drawn, and easily understood and related to. And hey! My wife loved it too. We keep a copy in our &quot;library&quot; to loan out to friends, and probably always will. We don't typically read a book twice, but we will both do so with this one. Guaranteed. Hey, and it's really cheap!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"A gripping thriller, ideal for a long train journey or flight. What makes it stand out is its compassionate and intelligent portrayal of the world of the Deaf (with a capital D). Any run-of-the-mill writer would have used deafness as a McGuffin without taking it any further. Deaver's sensitivity makes his book stand out from the rest of the pack."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"In the past month I have become the number 1 Deaver fan. I have read every book I've been able to get a hand on. A maiden's grave is another great novel by Deaver. Its unbelievable to read with intricate detail how a hostage situation is supposed to be handled.This novel makes you think about how you would react in that type of situation, and makes you realize that although your life is certainly very valuable to you it is not neccessarily as valuable to others, and not just the bad guys. After reading this novel you'll think twice about who the good guys really are because the people you think are trying to help you are maybe just trying to help themselves.As with other Deaver novels the main situation is resolved with about forty or fifty pages left and that is when the fun starts. With Deavers novels you read the whole novel waiting to get to the final fifty pages because that is really when the novel turns from good to great. In the last fifty pages you always find something you overlooked but was there the whole time. This book has a great heroine in Melanie and you will be cheering for her during the novel particularly at the surprising end when you will applaud that for once the ending is exactly the retribution you would have hoped for.There is one setback I should mention, this is the first Deaver novel where I found at least some of the plot twists to be predictable. For once I actually knew what was going to happen. But this aside the book is very good and you will find it very entertaining and aside from a few details it is unpredictable, which is the Deaver trademark."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I've spent this past spring and summer reading, among other things, Jeffrey Deaver's suspense novels. Having finished A MAIDEN'S GRAVE last evening, I'd like to share a few impressions:If you have to go to work early in the morning, do not read this novel at night. If the fear of what will happen to the next hostage doesn't keep you up, sheer interest will.Atmospheric at the threshhold of tolerance, sharply etched characters, and a plausible plot join forces to create a novel that's destined to stay on the shelves for years to come.The battle of wits between Art Potter, the dean of FBI negotiators, and the leader of the trio of escaped convicts who've kidnapped a busload of deaf students and teachers and holding them hostage at an abandoned slaughterhouse, is one of the most harrowing on record. Just when you think the conflict has been played out, Deaver turns the knob back up to ten and the game begins all over again.My two problems with this book: That the lead bad guy, Lou Handy, wasn't delineated well enough, and his accomplices mere cardboard cutouts. However, Deaver handles expository material skillfully and the multiple POVs that the story requires, always a risky venture, is equally satisfying because of the demands that they place on the author.Problem #2: The blossoming romance between Arthur Potter, a world-weary middle aged widower and Melanie Charrol, the deaf teacher who opposes Lou Handy and his henchmen, a romance based on only one glimpse and a mouthed message between the two, is not only implausible, it's downright pathetic.However, equally as good as THE BONE COLLECTOR, A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is another Deaver book that deserves a sequel."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"My mom loaned me this book (she reads all of his books) and I loved it! It was so intriguing and suspenseful. I loved the characters and even the characters flaws that caused them to want to be \`top dog' in the rescue/investigation. Immediately after I read it I was ready to read it again, but my mom wanted it back. LOL"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"In one way, \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" is a pun, one that is explained within the book of the same name. More seriously, however, a maiden's grave is what principal character Melanie Charrol faces if she doesn't survive a harrowing experience in this novel.Melanie is a teacher at a school for the deaf. On a field trip, the bus she is in along with students and teachers is hijacked by three prison escapees, led by the vicious Lou Handy. Although the police catch on rather quickly, they are not fast enough to stop the escapees and their hostages from hiding out in an old slaughterhouse.The bulk of the story is the hostage situation and a game of wits between the clever Handy and the coolly professional FBI negotiator Arthur Potter. Potter is good at his job, which entails not only dealing with the crooks but also the press and local law enforcement, all of whom think they can do the job better. Potter's emotional detachment isolates him from others, particularly when he starts referring to the hostages as being as good as dead. His rationale is solid but it doesn't endear him to others.As time goes by, however, Potter - despite his better judgment - starts to get emotionally involved, especially with Melanie, who clearly becomes the best hope for the children trapped within. There is a limit, however, to what either Potter or Melanie can do; Handy is running the show and he has his own agenda.A Maiden's Grave is filled with the sort of taut suspense that is Deaver at his best. As is typically the case with Deaver, there are a few plot twists along the way, and even if the \\"big\\" twist is a little more obvious than intended, it doesn't diminish the quality of the story. If you want an exciting page-turner, Deaver delivers with this book."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I started and stopped this book about 3 times, due to other circumstances. But once I got momentum going...WOW. A true thriller, with a little violence tossed in.I thought it was better than The Bone Collector, and on par with The Coffin Dancer (another great book).Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book i believe is one of Jeffery deavers best books. It is a book that you are unable to put down beacuse you are always wondering what is going to happen next to each of the characters. The story line is amazing!!! If you do not like any of his other books you will definately like this one and get hooked on it no problem. It is one of the books you must read by Jeffery Deaver.!!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is what every trashy thriller should be. It's the kind of book that you'll want to read undisturbed at one sitting, while telling the boss, spouse, kids, pets, or whatever, \\"Buzz off!\\" I wish I could award more than 5 stars.The plot is seemingly straight forward enough. Three cons escape from a federal pen in Kansas, hijack a bus carrying two teachers and eight young female students from a school for the deaf, and hole up in an abandoned slaughterhouse on the bank of the Arkansas River. The leader of the Bad Guys is Lou Handy, a smart, amoral and vicious felon that describes himself as \\"cold death\\". And you know what? He is. And what's he going to do with that pliers, screwdriver, wrench and hammer? And is his girlfriend, Pris, going to show up? (Handy is one of those horrific sociopaths that, in our nightmares, lurks just outside our bedroom window in the darkness waiting for us to fall asleep so he can drive a stiletto into our eyes for flipping him off on the freeway that day.) Surrounding the hidey-hole, the local, state and federal team of cops is led by Arthur Potter, a fiftyish and out-of-shape FBI agent, who also happens to be that agency's senior hostage negotiator. Arthur is the Common Man's hero, just your regular shmoe doing a job that he's extraordinarily good at.The strength of this superb novel rests in the distinct individualities of the adversaries, and the non-stop tension as Potter must deal not only with Handy's demands and deadlines, but also with the separate agenda of Kansas state law enforcement that illustrates the saying, \\"We've met the enemy, and they're us.\\" As a bonus, author Jeffery Deaver, if he did his research right, perhaps gives the reader an insight into the culture of the Deaf. (I mean, how many hearing-impaired people do you know? To my knowledge, I've never met even one.)But certainly the most engaging character of A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is timid and frightened Melanie, the youngest of the two teachers, and who's also deaf. By the end of the story, she's evolved into another person entirely - one that'll leave you stunned.A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is, hands down, the best thriller I've read in a long, long while. I can't recommend it enough. Of course, as I told The Boss to pound sand when he caught me absorbed in its pages instead of preparing the quarterly P&L; statement for the stockholders' meeting, I'll now have much more time for reading."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"A great read! I was facinated with the deaf theme, never having read one of this type before. It makes you think about how scary this could really be."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"After reading The Bone Collector, A Maiden's Grave was extremely disappointing. The hostages were not very strong characters and spent the majority of their time either crying or feeling sorry for themselves. Characters like that certainly make it difficult to stick with any book.The only interesting portions of the book were that of the hostage negotiator himself, how he negotiated with the hostage taker(s) and the internal politics that he comes up against and confronts while trying to do his job.The book does take a surprising turn at page 376 which makes the reader feel semi-rewarded for sticking with the first 375 pages of a ho-hum storyline."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"The man is good. That was my first thought after finishing A MAIDEN&#8217;S GRAVE. If you want to learn how to plot a novel, then you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a better author to learn from than the master himself. And he knows how to tackle damaged characters, not just emotionally damaged, but physically damaged, scarred to the point that you&#8217;re only left with pieces, and the pieces don&#8217;t seem to fit together the way that they should.This novel is filled with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, taking what could have been just a classic negotiation story and flipping it on its head. It takes a frightful, horrific situation and turns it up a notch by having a group of deaf hostages, and the three hostage takers that are unwilling to communicate with them. And then it adds local politics and multiple task forces for good measure, with each group having its own agenda.The characters sometimes take a backseat to the story, but I still felt emotionally invested in what would happen next. This proved to be a good read, along with having a certain amount of unpredictability to keep things interesting.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Great characters. Fresh storyline. Deaver twists. Fun read with an antagonist you can't despise enough. Just when you think you got it, try again."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This is going to be ultra short. I'll disclose now that I have not yet read The Bone Collector, since most other reviewers compare his books to that one.To put it simply, this was the first Deaver book I read and his best. The best characters, the best plot, the best twists and turns, the best 'hold on to the edge of your seat' feeling, the best information. I love that about Deaver. That he researches before he writes. I always come away from his books learning something. I learnt the most from this one.To me, it's also the best 'high'. Every Deaver novel I've read since this one just doesn't give me the same level of high as A Maiden's Grave does. And I've since noticed he is very formulaic (is that even a word? If not, it should be), which becomes predictable when reading his books. Three quarters of the way in you know there's going to be a big plot twist. Regardless, I love that every Deaver novel is so unbelievably easy to get into, and each read seems to take a few hours - that's how much I fly by the pages in his books.For me, this is his best, and the others that I have read simply don't compare."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"It took me a while to get into this book, it seemed a bit slow to start off, but got better as the book progressed."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book is a well crafted, tense, taut, gripping thriller which never lets up and which offers revealing insight into a hostage situation and also a subplot on the deaf culture.

Some Deaver novels are better than others. This was quite good. Plot moved along well and kept me interested throughout the novel.

I hoped he wouldn't do it... but yep, he created a love interest between middle aged flabby Arthur and young vibrant Melanie, whose infatuation with him is based on a fantasy that he's Abbe L'Epee who died in 1789. And may I add she's giving him the come on a matter of hours after the villain was holding a knife to her virgin genitals. Yeah, that'd put you in the mood."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Once again I was thoroughly entertained by the writting skill of Jeffery Deaver. The book contained a combination of both drama and surprise to satisfy my every wish."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"A hostage situation, set in an old slaughterhouse that is dark and sinister and smells of death. Bad enough already! But to have the hostages deaf children and their teachers was genius as the whole communication aspect is turned on it's head.I found the characters compelling, even the bad guys!Having finished it, I feel I have far more understanding of the complexities of a hostage situation and far more insight into the experiences of the deaf.A thriller that stands out!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This nail biter of a thriller involves a hijacked schoolbus carrying eight deaf school children and two teachers. Sound familiar? Mary Willis Walker's &quot;Under the Beetle's Cellar&quot; develops a very similar premise. Both books even include an asthmatic among the kidnapped children.But in Deaver's skillful hands, the story works again. The two protagonists are Arthur Potter, senior FBI negotiator, nearing retirement, and Melanie Charrol, a young, timid deaf teacher whose lonely passion is music. The three kidnappers are prison escapees who have already killed three people before holing up in an abandoned slaughterhouse with the terrified hostages. Potter works against time to get inside the head of their leader, Lou Handy, and derail his threat to kill one hostage every hour until his demands are met.Meanwhile, state officials have their own agenda, as does the press, and their machinations ratchet up the suspense in several different directions. And, inside, Melanie fights her fears, holding onto an image of Potter (who she has glimpsed outside) as inspiration, and works feverishly to save at least a few of the girls.Deaver's characterizations - the outbursts of rebellion and tears among the children, the gleeful coldbloodedness of Handy, Potter's feverish analysis and risky gambles, Melanie's terrified bravery - hurtle the plot forward, while the slaughterhouse atmosphere is dank and cold, and the action is non-stop, right up to a couple of switch-back twists at the end."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I have enjoyed every Jeffery Deaver book I've read, so I ordered this one on a whim. I'm glad I did--it's a real page-turner. If you've read some of the other reviews, you know the basic story--deaf girls being held hostage by bad guys.Mr. Deaver draws his characters well, and each one has strengths and weaknesses. Some of the hostages are survivors because they're always on the lookout for ways to survive, while others give up without a fight. The bad guys are really bad but the good guys are surprisingly normal. There are no supermen in the story, only regular people responding to a bad situation as best they can. And just when you think it's safe to breathe again, the suspense builds anew.That's what makes Jeffery Deaver's books so extraordinary. Sometimes I get the feeling Lincoln Rhyme is a little too superhuman, but all of Deaver's books are like intricately woven tapestries that tell stories with richly colored detail."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"It is a simultaneous blessing and curse that more people have probably seen the film adaptation of Jeffery Deaver's novel A MAIDEN'S GRAVE than have read the book. This is not unusual; in a less harried age viewers would, I think, be more likely to seek out the novel that was the subject matter of the &quot;Based on the novel&quot; tag that would come appended to the beginning, or end, of a film they enjoyed. This is unfortunate; while A MAIDEN'S GRAVE was a fine film adaptation, there is nothing that can compare to climbing into the lounge chair, cracking the binding on this book, and then restricting movement for the next several hours to the eye, the, hand, and the mind.A MAIDEN'S GRAVE and PRAYING FOR SLEEP are the two novels that really, really &quot;did it&quot; for Deaver; they set the tone for his later books, particularly the Lincoln Rhyme novels, which have brought him the fame, fortune and notoriety that he so long deserved and that was so late in forthcoming. THE MAIDEN'S GRAVE tells a story over the course of 400-plus pages (in the mass market paperback edition) and a little over 18 hours that contains all of those elements that make a Deaver book a DEAVER BOOK: sleights of hand, plot twists, and a suspense level that is ratcheted upward every page or two.Oh, one other thing. Deaver has become well known for building his novels around topics that you want to know more about but have never had the time to delve into. The Man very kindly does the research for you and drops factoids here and there, but never gratuitously. So it is that when, in A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, a school bus carrying students from a school for the hearing impaired is hijacked by a trio of murderous escaped convicts, the reader learns much more than sign language. There are some pretty ferocious political and cultural differences within the hearing-impaired community, and even some class differences based on impairment etiology. Deaver does a masterful job of bringing these out within the subtext of his story, and making them matter as his story unfolds, without tearing and straining at the plot fabric. That one fact alone would make A MAIDEN'S GRAVE a masterful work.But...but...there is a lot more to this novel than the hearing-impaired subtext. When it is learned that the bus has been hijacked, and the students kidnapped and held hostage, the politics involved in the containing and resolving of the situation have enough plot lines for an entirely separate novel. Arthur Potter is the FBI's very best point man in the area of hostage negotiation. Potter approaches every hostage situation as a homicide in progress; those responsible must be apprehended and the damage contained. The jurisdictional disputes among federal, state, and local authorities, even when the line of authority is at least theoretically clear, function more to endanger rather than protect the hostages.What is so remarkable, however, is Deaver's ability, in the midst of jurisdictional chaos, to plausibly create an improbable love affair from afar between Potter and Melanie Charrol. Charrol is a teacher of the hearing-impaired, and one of the hostages. Though she and Potter have never met, and have seen each other only from a fleeting distance, they begin, incredibly, to work together to resolve the situation and to save themselves --- and each other. The result is a tale of suspense and, yes, romance, that is somehow rendered believable. I doubt that anyone but Deaver could ever carry it off.Whether you have seen the film version of A MAIDEN'S GRAVE on HBO or not, the novel, and the reading experience, are not to missed. It is a work to be read, reread, and shared.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book is so very well-written and descriptive that it gave me chills.

This is a real crackerjack of a mystery novel, folks... chock-a-block full of interesting characters; a tightly knit, thrilling plot; and enough twists and turns to keep even the most hard-boiled reader of mysteries squirming uncomfortably from start to finish.On a cloudy, blustery, uncommonly cold early July day in rural Kansas, at a lonely highway crossroads, a simple traffic accident has just resulted in the murder of two innocent people. Three hardened criminals have captured a school bus with eight deaf school girls and their two teachers on board...Amidst wind-buffeted, golden Kansas wheat fields, FBI negotiator Arthur Potter must begin bargaining for the release of the hostages. For hour after tense hour, Potter calmly, but with a growing feeling of desperation, tries to win release of the hostages By now, the young girls are being kept in a room with an incendiary \\"booby trap\\" installed. As Potter continues his negotiations, some of the girls decide to take matters into their own hands, with frightful results...\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" is the first of Jeffrey Deaver's books that I've read, but it certainly won't be the last! This is wonderful storytelling all the way! Deaver brings us a completely believable, well researched, and thrilling plot; \\"good guys\\" that, despite their manifold flaws, are easy to root for; and \\"bad guys\\" that quickly earn our enmity.Deaver immediately grabbed my attention on the first page of the book, and never let go. In quick succession, I was transported from a school bus making its way along a deserted highway, to a cemetery where Arthur Potter is tending his wife's grave and two FBI agents approach with a new assignment, and then to a Kansas crossroads where a collision between two cars results in cold blooded murder. Soon Deaver had me completely engrossed with his straightforward but vivid prose. For many hours I was unable to put \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" down... I just HAD to find out what happened next...Deaver's characters are rich and detailed. The \\"good guys\\" aren't without their flaws... The \\"bad guys\\" are evil personified. I wasn't able to find a single redeeming quality in any of them throughout the book's 419 pages.Deaver's treatment of the subject of deafness is worthy of a great deal of praise. He spends a great deal of time describing the plight of the eight school girls and their teachers, and in all cases, his hearing impaired characters are treated with compassion and accuracy. In no case is there any evidence of stereotyping in Deaver's character development. Deaver should be commended for his research, his compassion, and his sensitivity in dealing with the subject of hearing loss.\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" is not your typical crime thriller/mystery novel. It has a highly innovative, well crafted, and exciting plot, and superbly drawn characters. Folks, this one's a real, honest-to-goodness, barn-burnin' page turner. I loved it... and, I think, so will you!!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver is the master of suspenseful page turners, and this book delivers. Like Lincoln Rhymes, the lead character in this book is not a lovable guy. Art Potter is a hostage negotiator whose only goal is to get the hostage takers to surrender. When he is called in on a case where 8 deaf children and their teachers have been abducted, the choices he makes often seem cold blooded. Yet we are rooting for Potter to succeed in ending the stand-off.Writing a book where most of the characters are deaf could not have been easy, but Deaver seems to be able to get into the psyche of a deaf group of young girls, and write great &quot;speaking&quot; parts them. We are very in tune with the girls, and most especially the teacher, Melanie, whose character undergoes a metamorphosis during the captivity.Deaver is the master of the &quot;I didn't see that one coming&quot;, and he does that again here. Just when you think everything is over and done, he shoots you right back into the action.My biggest complaint with this book was the ending, certain things seemed out of character. It seemed a little pat. Regardless of that, the book was well worth the roller coaster ride, and puts me in mind of another of Deaver's books. Read this one, and you'll be &quot;Praying for Sleep&quot;, for you are certain to be up all night, worried about those hostages."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This was the book that made me a diehard fan of Jeffrey Deaver. I had just seen the Bone Collector and say that is was based on a book. So I went to my local library which didn't have it in at the moment. They did have this one though and from the moment I read the first few pages I couldn't put it down.The story just grabbed me because it was something I hadn't read before from one of the main characters being deaf and how she was able to overcome her handicap inspired me. After I read this book i had to have more."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Lots of twists and turns, never a dull moment. However, development of main charcter falls short of credibility at ending"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This Book is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I raed this book in two days and I am not a person who reads a lot but this book is so good in my opinion, I gave it to some of my friends and they all read it just as fast as I did if not faster. This book is filled with suspence, action, turns and twist and the plot is really well written. I also really enjoyed the story line it was very intriguing."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver never ceases to satisfy. As usual I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This has to be one of the best thrillers i have read; I finished reading it within 24 hours and then couldn't stop thinking about the characters. Even though I didn't find the 'love story' between Arthur Potter and Melanie to be at all credible this didn't spoil the story for me. Highly recommended if you're looking for a good page-turner that makes you think."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I, like most Deaver fans, started out with the Lincoln Rhyme series books and got addicted. I have also read a lot of other books by Jeffery Deaver outside that series and have thoroughly enjoyed them all... until I started reading A Maiden's Grave. The first 50-70 pages or so are so crammed with vital information about each and every person involved in the story that I found myself having to look back at the beginning to remember who was who. I understand that each character needs to be introduced within the first couple of chapters, but in this one, the hostage takers have nicknames and the negotiating teams can't decide whether they are going to call each other by the first name or their last.The story itself is very interesting and I learned a lot about hostage situations and what they involve. One of Deavers best attributes is that he does a lot of research about everything he writes about which gives a sense of confidence that you know he's not stretching to truth to make his story better.Once you figure out who everyone is and the stage is set for the negotiating, the book gets very good and I couldn't put it down. The only other thing I didn't really like about A Maiden's Grave was that I found it to be very predictable. Even the twists and turns that Deaver is so popular for I saw coming from a mile away."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I could not put this novel down. I actually saw the movie before ever reading the book. The movie has a different name and is actually somewhat old. It played on T. V., and was really good. Well, what a surprise for me to lift this novel and began reading about the same bus ride, the same outlaws, and the same holdoff. Of course the novel is always 10 times fasinating.Deaver is a fantastic author was a well of talent."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book was amazing one of the best I have read so far form the author. It was a book that you could not put down for second because you always want to know what is going to happen next. This book is a book that you can not put down and is a brilliant insight into how you negotiate with the hostage taker to get out the hostages all in one piece. The characters are amazing in this book. It is nothing like any of the other books he has written!!!!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Deaver's love of excruciating detail has certainly exasperated many readers caught in his exciting stories: come ON!! Get on with the story!!!I am not going to spoil the ending of this novel for you (you're welcome). Simply allow me to say, the plot really picks up just when you think all the dust has settled.So find a comfortable chair for the long haul, and happy reading!PS: If you read at night, you will probably want to turn on ALL the lights."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"readers may be surprised to hear that I believe this to be Deaver's best novel. I know, The Bone Collector was great,and they made a movie out of it, but if ever there was a high action suspense novel that should have been brought to the screen with big name actors, it's A Maiden's Grave. It has it all! I won't get into playing critic here, but I will say that I read over 100 suspense novels per year, every year, and this book remains one of my all time favorites. Don't start reading it unless you're prepared to stay up all night."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"The claims on the books cover don't lie - The story grabs you and won't let go. You will want to read this in one sitting. Perfect for airplane reading - the hours will fly by. In addition to the non-stop plot, Deaver has created characters that you really come to care about, in a very compressed amount of time. A light read - great if you need a break from heavier fare. First rate entertainment."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver uses all his genius to unfold a tale of thrills and unharnessed suspense. His characters are sharp in detail as we delve deeper and deeper into personalities.The main theme is about several felons holed up in an old slaughterhouse. Their hostages are deaf children and their teachers who try their best to overcome and survive this horrific experience.The felons are brutal, yet clever. And their negotiator is Arthur Potter.Arthur Potter who has been a negotiator for many years and has to try every trick that is up his sleeve.He has to get into the mind of the leader , Brutus, and know what the answers to his questions will be before he even asks them.But that is just the basis of this fascinating tale. Deaver unfolds each and every character in a stunningly clever manner. The sub-plots and secondary characters bring pathos, fear and thrills by the minute.I found myself living the anger and terror of the girls...living the surpressed anquish of Potter....plotting with him to bring the hostages out and keep everyone unharmed. And yes, I found myself in the 'cold-death' mind of Brutus. I applaud Deavers for a remarkable story-line, fascinating characters and for his genius in unraveling a mixed tale of truly mesmerizing pathos, terror, greed and high emotions."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I contend that although not as good as his more recent novels, 'A Maiden's Grave' is still a very fun book to experience. With Deaver, you don't just read him, you 'experience' his writing because he has the uncanny ability to transport your thoughts and feelings to wherever it is he wants you to go. In this novel, he takes you to the scene of a kidnapping of a bus of girls.Now whether or not Deaver has done his research on kidnapping negotiating or not, I have NO idea...I CAN tell you it sure seems as though he has. At first glance, it seems that one could not manage to pull and entire novel out of the situation this novel presents you with, but not only does he do it, he gives you situations you would have otherwise never have thought about. It was obvious from the get-go that Mr. Deaver has put a lot of thought into this story, and the outcome is much more than just a kidnapping and just a negotiation to solve the situation. 'A Maiden's Grave' is not Deavers best thriller, but if you enjoy fast moving stories with more meat than your average porterhouse steak, this book ought to satisfy your hunger."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Eight young deaf girls and their teachers are abducted by three escaped convicts and held hostage in an abandoned slaughterhouse. Arthur Potter, senior hostage negotiator with the FBI, is called to the scene. He soon finds in Lou Handy, the convict in charge, a diabolical adversary. Deaver is at his best when describing police procedure in detail without complex jargon. Excellent juggling of multiple scenes and varied characters."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I accidentally stumbled upon this book one day and expected nothing from it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book had a gripping storyline that made me keep coming back for more.I always like to get into a novel and share with the characters what they might not know. I found myself doing this agian and again. I went from frustration at the actions of the DA and anger at the fugitives and what they were doing.It's a wonderful book, I highly reccommed it. From other reviews, I am going to read some of his others next."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I made the mistake of reading this book on an airplane flight and couldn't help but gasp out loud as the plot made some shocking turns. Flight delayed? Who cares! This book was terrific. I have since read all the other books by Jeffrey Deaver"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I was excited to begin this book, as I had read &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; and loved it. After I got into &quot;A Maiden's Grave&quot; I found myself searching for any periodical to read to avoid finishing &quot;Grave&quot;. Deaver does a great job with narrative, making you feel as if you were there. The problem was that the plot dragged on and on. I felt like shouting &quot;let's be done with this, already!&quot; There also seemed to be a sense of hopelessness that pervaded the storyline - that doesn't make for enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Deaver has portrayed Deaf individuals in A Maiden's Grave in exceptional clarity and realism. Being Deaf myself, and a Teacher of the deaf, I was delighted to see the realistic portrayals. Deaver at times includes people with disabilities in his writing and he is to be congratulated for putting his characters in real roles and not patronising people with disabilities. He has an insight into people with disabilities and is refreshing to see this awareness.Truelly educational reading as well well as exceptional on the edge thriller material!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"In &quot;A Maiden's Grave&quot; Jeffery deaver spins an excellent tale of the hi-jacking of a school bus carrying 7 deaf girls to Topeka.

I think it is the best of Jeffery Deaver's books. I highly recommend it to all my friends."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver's mind is an interesting place. I'm not sure I would want his dreams after reading this book and The Devil's Teardrop. I also know that I will always look at a hostage situation with much more insight and understanding as a result of having spent 419 pages with the FBI's top negotiator, Arthur Potter. The bad guys are really bad. One of them (Handy) is really deviously clever. You don't ever want to be held hostage by him. The plot twists and turns as deadlines arrive and hostages are in peril, not only from their captors, but from some of the misguided politicians and law enforcement folks on the good guys side. Through all of the plot changes, Art Potter keeps his eye on the target. And just when you thought it was over...it isn't. If you are looking for an author to keep your interest and attention...Mr. Deaver is your man."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver has the uncanny ability to step in and out of the skin of Lincoln Rhyme, the hero of his major series of work. Unlike many authors, who stop a series to branch out into new fields, or others who continue only in the same vein, Deaver takes breaks from the rhythm of Rhyme, sidebars into completely different and compelling plots, and still comes home to entertain with Rhyme again!\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" may just be my favorite Deaver novel. From the title pun to the complete curveball that is thrown at the end of the story, Deaver never stops compelling you to turn the pages.Set in a gruesome slaughterhouse, where escaped prisoners have taken their helpless girl hostages (many of whom are deaf) AMG lets you get inside the minds of some of the hostages, of the captors, and of Arthur Potter, the FBI's main hostage negotiator. All of the characters are flawed, in rich and sometimes curious ways. While stretching the tale, Deaver transports you to the scene as you can visualize what it would be like to be one of the hostages. Friends tell me that Deaver has done phenomenal research into the world of the deaf, in order to be able to describe what life is like for them, and how the camaraderie of groups of hearing-impaired people can sometimes be a burden, when one decides to become more involved with those who hear. Odd intricacies of plot background are a hallmark of Deaver's stories....but this one is hard to put down.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffrey Deaver is well recognized for his visciously violent mind.

The plot is very strong, with many twists. The setting is almost another character in this book. The descriptions of the slaugterhouse make this a disturbing read, and helps the reader see horror these girls go through. The dialogue is excellent, as is typical of Deaver. Most author's wouldn't attempt to write dialogue that included 9 deaf characters, but Deaver pulls it off in stunning fashion.The only thing that kept this book from being my favorite Deaver book was the characters. They are all very strong and very well defined (especially Melanie, Arthur, and Lou), but there wasn't one that I could identify with.Read this book. It is excellent, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. But also don't miss my personal favorite Deaver novel The Devil's Teardrop."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I'd have to consider myself a \\"newbie\\" to Jeffrey Deavers, as I've only read four of his books, but am definitely a fan. His writing is intense, the stories draw you in from the beginning and won't let go, and the endings are always full of surprises. Well, that's what I thought about all of the books, except this one - Maiden's Grave - it didn't grab my attention but let me wander for about 50 or so pages. When the action did pick up, it was intriguing and then lax - definitely not a book that you couldn't put down on the coffee table. This one actually took me a while to finish.The story begins with a busload of deaf students riding along the highway between the Kansas wheat fields. The reader isn't sure exactly what they're doing, except they are going to a type of recital, the purpose of the trip is eluded to but never clarified until much later in the book. The bus comes on the scene of a fatality accident so the bus driver and teacher leave the bus to see if they can help the victims. But this wreck was no accident, and the students and adults are soon thrown into a nightmare.Three escaped convicts take the eight deaf students and two adults hostage and hold them in an abandoned slaughterhouse a few miles from the accident scene. The leader of the thugs, Lou Handy, is intelligent and seems to have thought of all possibilities. The other two are more hard-core - Shepard Wilcox is young and doesn't blink if he needs to kill someone; \\"Sonny\\" Bonner is a child rapist who's gazes toward the girls gives everyone the creeps.The FBI sends in their best hostage negotiator, Arthur Potter. He's personable and sincerely cares about the captives. Also trying to help rescue the girls is a variety of local law enforcement agencies who are all trying to come up with their own rescue endeavors and don't want to work as a team. In addition is a local politician who is more worried about how he'll look on camera than helping these girls.When initial contact is made, Handy tells Potter that he'll kill one girl an hour unless his demands are met, and so the story goes...I learned a lot about hostage negotiations in this book - they never give in to the \\"taker\\" and only appease him/her until they can find a way to get the hostages out. But the trick in these negotiations is making the \\"taker\\" think they are going to give in and meet the demands.The character development was, as always, excellent. The depiction of the abandoned slaughterhouse made my skin crawl with the descriptions of bloodstains and stench of decaying flesh (ewww!). The story flowed well, it just wasn't as action packed as The Bone Collector, The Coffin Dancer, or The Devil's Teardrop.I often found my mind wondering why. (Ok, here are specific details from the book, so if you're planning on reading it, please skip this paragraph!). Why did the bus driver get raped? Why did the girls keep repeating part of the poem that was to be delivered at the recital - was it pertinent? Why did Arthur fixate on the young schoolteacher and begin to have intimate feelings toward someone he'd never met? There were just too many questions without answers for my taste.Overall the book was a good read, but I'd put others ahead on your Must Read list - save this one for a time when you've run out of \\"great\\" reading material and are delving into the \\"good\\" reading material."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"There are many novels written with kidnapped children as their central story line, but this book certainly leads the pack and stands out as a gut wrenching thriller. A Maiden's Grave is an interesting take on hostage negotiations and Deaver really makes it work. You feel the tension the hostages feel and the pressure the negotiator goes through. You can feel the terror and bravery of the characters. It is so wonderfully well written that the story is almost palpable. I look forward to reading more books written by this author. Great thriller..."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I found this book to be very intense and nerve wrecking. Deaver keeps the reader at the edge of their seat (is that only a movie watching term?) and eager to find out what happens next.I liked the general ending a lot (the last 50 pages), but the very ending seemed kind of far fetched - meaning the way Deaver concludes the story of the bad guys. Also, the romance between the deaf assistant teacher and the negiotiator was beyond stupid and should have been left out."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"It was a while ago that i read this book, and it was my first of Deavers. Since then i have bought every single book he has ever written, and have read all but a few of them.This is simple an outstanding book. it is the best hostage thriller i have ever read, and that i expect i ever will.Deaver mounts the tension beautifully...every now and then it gets so high that you literally feel it as he lets a little of the tension out...it's a wonderful display of suspense writing.Deavers characters are vivid, and his characterisation is wonderfully subtle. they are well rounded and very human. Arthur Potter is a compelling hero, and his &quot;invisble&quot; relationship with Melanie is brilliantly done. the way they feel connected to each other during the hostage negotiation even though they have never met is wonderful. I felt very moved.As well as being a very suspenseful book, this is also an extremely emotional one. there are times when you really feel very sorry for the characters, and an insipid hate for their characters. I felt particularly sorry for poor Donna Hawstrawn. I really wanted this book to keep going, just so that i could see if she would be okay...there are also a couple of moments in the book when you might be moved to tears. there are some devastating events, which really tug at you.Deavers portrayal of the Deaf is completely unpatronising. He is extremely good at writing about people with what might be termed &quot;handicaps&quot;, and in this case i think he was at hsi most sucessful. He wrote about it in such a way that you did feel slight sympathy, but moreover you felt proud of these people. Also, i felt a strange but strong urge to actually really try and get a feel for what it might be like to be Deaf...This is a brilliant book, with a good twist at the end. good characters, emotional writing, stunning suspense, and an excellent hostage thriller. Deaver is simply the best."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"When you start reading a book and you can't put it down.When you regret that you are not reading it because you have to do something else.When no-part of the book is boring (here I have to accept that the last six or seven pages of the penultimate chapter (pages 370-376), after the hostage release, are boring, but you must read them to understand the book's finish).When you can't guess what'll happen in the next page.When everything you read could be true.When you think that the book is already finish with a fairy tale end and you have to read 40 more pages to read an excellent end.With all these points, the book deserves SIX stars.And I almost forget that you'll learn very important things about the Deaf people."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book was great! I have read &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; and &quot;The Coffin Dacer&quot; also, they are equaly as good. The characters in this book are great! I am now searching for another Deaver book. These books are the greatest, he has very astonishing plot twists and ending. I hope to see more Rhyme/Sachs books. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers with unpredictable plot twists and excellent characters. The only thing that I disliked about this book was the fact that it had to end."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I just loved this book! Of the books I've read by Jeffrey Deaver this is my favorite. I have recommended it to several friends. It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Eight deaf girls and their two teachers are taken hostage on a lonely, deserted Kansas road. A merciless killer and his friends with no pity. A hostage negotiator fighting to get the girls out alive. This is the starting of A Maiden's Grave. The girls are from a local school, their teacher is Melanie Charrol. The killer is Lou Handy. And then there is Arthur Potter, the FBI's senior hostage negotiator. It is a battle of wills as Arthur struggles to get the hostages out safely, while Melanie takes on their captors in a desperate fight to keep her students alive. A skillfully wrote book, flawlessly put together."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Jeffery Deaver is nothing short of amazing in his ability to keep the readers attention. He has in fact perfected his craft. &quot;Maiden's Grave,&quot; is a book you will not want to put down. It is enhancing to all of your senses and the imagery will truly take you there. Actually the first book I have read by Deaver I have read everything I could get my hand on since. If you enjoy true crime books, you will love this. Although it is fiction you will feel it is real."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I thought I was a Deaver fan before this, having read Coffin Dancer and others, but A Maiden's Grave is definitely one of the best books I have read this year. The characterisation of Arthur Potter is excellent and the girls' strength during their ordeal will make you go from feeling sorry for them (for being deaf) to forgetting the disability and concentrating on how strong the main character is. Deaver's explaination of the Title of the Book is a particularly poignant scene."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This was the 2nd Deaver book I read and it is the best so far. A simple premise that is so thick with tension I had to stop reading to calm down. Escaped convicts hijack a bus full of deaf students and the fun begins. The negotiations and give and take of the main characters were great. When you find out what is really going on you will be shocked! Great novel! Now I've got to see the HBO movie based on this, DEAD SIILENCE."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"Having read the Bone Collector and Praying for Sleep I was eager to acquire more of this author's books and when I read A Maiden's Grave I was not disappointed. There were times that I couldn't put the book down and then there were times when I had to put it down to retain my sanity as it scared me to death. This book is so real that you feel that you are there - the politics and &quot;game playing&quot; by people in power was right on the mark. What a great book from a great author (so far). I am looking forward to reading The Lesson of Her Death and The Devil's Teardrop and anything else that this author has to offer."},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"I was up till 3am last night finishing this story. Very suspenseful, but a little predictable. I am curious about his other books that dont' involve Lincoln Rhyme. Can they hold my interest the same way that The Bone Collector did?"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"While there have been many novels written using a bus load of kidnapped children as their scentral story line - A Maiden's Grave certainly leads the pack and stands out as a gut wrenching thriller. You can feel the terror and bravery of the characters. I hope the Mr. Deaver writes more like this one. All o fhis books are wonderful so if you liked this one read them all!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"As with all of Deaver's books, I was at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I felt it was realistic and believable. I don't understand how many other readers felt otherwise. As a rebuttal to some of the other reviews, I'd like to address a couple of points. The use of the word &quot;STOAT&quot; was only used by one character, a deaf teacher, and her young charges simply followed her lead. I am sure a deaf person could sign the word 'stoat.' I don't feel that the use of the word should detract from an otherwise pleasant read. As far as the other reader saying that all the hostages did was cry was also incorrect. There were strong sympathetic hostages (Susan, Kielle, and Shannon), and the others were simply young and scared. To think that they shouldn't be scared under the circumstances, is like asking for fantasy instead of reality. I'd recommend this book to anyone, and let them judge for themselves regarding the above. Jeffery Deaver has never come close to disappointing me, and I'll read anything he writes!"},{"Title":"A Maidens Grave","review":"This book did not hold my interest at all. I was going to try to get through the whole thing, but halfway through, I found myself skipping paragraphs to get to &quot;the good stuff&quot;. But, there was no &quot;good stuff&quot;. Not recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"Betrayal of Trust: Sex and Power in Professional Relationships","review":"As a victim of pediatric doctor-patient sexual abuse, I'm always glad to see this covert issue discussed. However, this book, did not provide enough information to help in my case. Of the few texts I've discovered of this issue, abusive mental health professionals are explored more often than doctors who give physical exams. The sections dealing with abusive mental health professionals and clergy are excellent. However, Betrayl of Trust could have discussed abuse within other doctor-patient relationships more thoroughly. Issues such as appropriate, feasible ways of seeking legal retaliation (which in my experience is none), problems of limitation statutes, and the dangerous possibility of posting the medical abuser's name on the world wide web are neglected. Though the book did not provide much useful information for me, I give four stars to the authors for having the courage to write on these important matters."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Trust: Sex and Power in Professional Relationships","review":"Sexual exploitation is a subject that is difficult to understand for many, yet is one that needs to be discussed in both the professional and general public areas. the authors outlined the topic and explained in detail an easy to follow approach covering the issues in each segment with detail.

The sections are Environment, Nutrients, Rooting Medium, Hormones, and Cuttings. The book contains several hand sketches.The book is well written and covers many fundamentals about growing plants indoor. Also, it's original information. This book is not just a re-write from Van Patten's other book, &quot;Gardening Indoors with HID Lights&quot;. It is completely different information. All new writing.This is a solid beginner's guide. Although, the book does make the process sound way too simple. In my first attempt, all my cuttings died. Yes - I did follow the instructions. But it's not as simple as it first looks. It takes several attempts to get good at propagating plants.I wish the book had a troubleshooting section.

The recipes are incredibly easy, and they are hearty and satisfying enough for a very cold climate. Plus, you can make them in great big quantities if you like, sometimes all in one pot, so that you can spend less time cooking and more time... EATING! And the recipies are definitely worth relishing. This book has the best nut loaf recipe ever. The one drawback is that it's in the 1970s tradition of vegetarian cooking,which includes alot of dairy and eggs. Some of the recipes are vegan, and those are very tasty and hearty and warming, but in general this is probably not the best book for vegans.

Many vegetarian recipes require exotic ingredients, but most of the recipes in this book use ordinary ingredients, herbs, and spices.

The majority of the soup recipes (and several other recipes throughout the book) use boullion instead of vegetable stock made from fresh vegetables. In addition, while \\"Boboli Pizza\\" is quick and easy, I do not consider it to be a gourmet recipe.

From Summer Rice Salad to Stuffed Zucchini, Maple Walnut Pie, Hungarian Noodles and so much more, the dishes offer a wide range of delights and the one-page recipes are laid out in such a manner that ingredients are not listed all at the beginning, but rather each ingredient is listed at the point in preparation in which it is added to the dish, the better to prevent mistakes.

The chapter titles say it all. From Ignorence... To Truth; From Injustice... to Justice; From Despair... to Joy.Shapiro is not afraid to wag his finger at the reader in his interpretations of the prophets, inviting us to step out of the darkness and into the light in his own imitable interpretation of those terms. As such, this text has a decidedly strident tone that is not found in some of his other works. But we can still find his uncompromising non-dualism in Hebrew Prophets, even in the prophetic garb.In this work, Shapiro psychologizes the message of the prophets, but in a very Jewish and Universalist framework. As such, there is something for many different types of readers in this well-written book."},{"Title":"The Hebrew Prophets: Selections Annotated & Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)","review":"Rabbi Rami Shapiro is the author of many Skylight Path Publishing books. He writes well and although his books are on somewhat arcane subjects about spirituality and the Bible, he is clear and easy to follow, and he adds interesting information. This book contains selections from the writings of various prophets. Rabbi Shapiro sees all the prophets giving the same message in different words using their own metaphors, a message to act morally. He writes: \\"The prophets are challenging you to say \`no' to your most basic instinct, the instinct to stay put. To stay put is to allow yourself to become static, unchanging, and rigid. It is to reject God's call to move inward and free yourself from the idols that bind, blind, and condition you.\\"He paraphrases, rather than translating, as shown in this example from Jeremiah 2:13:The One Who Is says:You commit two errors:First, you forsake Me, the Source of living waters.Second, you dig for yourselves broken cisternsThat cannot hold water.The Jewish Publication Society translation is:Saith the Lord,For My people have committed two evils:The have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters,And hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,That can hold no water.He places his version of selections from the prophetic books on right hand side pages and his interpretation on left hand pages. He devotes two thirds of a page explaining this statement from Jeremiah.Every translator and commentator of ancient documents inserts his own personal ideas, worldviews, and theological inclinations into his or her work consciously or subconsciously, especially when the translator purposely paraphrases, as Rabbi Shapiro does, instead of a literal translation. Rabbi Shapiro's understanding of God may appear to some readers as pantheistic. He writes in the introduction to this volume: \\"I believe that God is all that is, even as God is greater than all that is. I believe that your relationship with God is analogous to the relationship of a wave to the ocean. The wave is not other than the ocean and yet the ocean is so much more than the wave. God does not dwell in you, above you, outside of you - God is you. When you realize your true relationship with God, you feel connected to all reality and discover that you are connected to all being in, with, and as God. This awakening compels you to act justly, compassionately, and humbly: the very ideal the prophets so highly value.\\"Whether one agrees with everything Rabbi Shapiro writes or not, all readers will gain information and insights by reading this volume."},{"Title":"GUNS ON THE EARLY FRONTIERS: A HISTORY OF FIREARMS FROM COLONIAL TIMES THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE WESTERN FUR TRADE","review":"I loved this, it read fine, was FULL of info that I didn't have,.. who knew that the .22 caliber short became the most popular cartridge shortly after introduction? Interesting!From the back cover..GUNS ON THE EARLY FRONTIERSI this is an account of the guns which in the hands of Indians, trappers and soldiers helped shape the history of the American West, Much more than a descriptive record of gun types the volume also relates the guns to the people who made sold and used them, and to the momentous events of westward expansion that were often strongly influenced by the gun trade.Guns on the Early Frontiers is concerned particularly with the arms used in the West during the first half of the nineteenth century, but since the guns used in the earlier settlement of the eastern half of the continent were the antecedents of the western arms these too are discussed together with the significant European influences that affected both the mechanisms of guns and the politics of the traders of guns.This volume is notable among gun books for it's thoroughness in identifying the guns used on America's moving frontiers and for it's careful and objective documentation.

I 'lost' this book many years ago but the plot haunts me to this day.I saw previews of the made-for-TV movie in Montreal in the 80's and as an armchair sailor was intrigued. I watched it for the swashbuckling and fell in love with it for the plot. The movie was low budget but the plot and dialog were brilliant. I was compelled to read the book, which of course was even better.Later I spent 8 years cruising the Bahamas and Caribbean, earned my commercial captain's license, and ran charter boats for a living, but this plot still stays with me, and I recount it to people all the time as probably the most captivating sailing yarns I know.Most maritime survival adventures focus on the strength of human will and cleverness over the elements and that's pretty much it. The better ones combine salty tales with intrigue and fascinating character development. The poorer ones simply recount the events of a struggle against the sea. Some I have read are hopelessly boring in spite of being true stories of a life-and-death struggle.This story has the salty intrigue in spades, but it really serves as a brilliant setting for a lengthy and gripping dialog on the paradox of faith. If you're a sailor you'll love it. If you're a theologian, or intrigued by the phenomenon of religion and faith, you'll love it.It reminds me a bit of C. S. Lewis' \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\", which is a much more masterly allegory of two characters pitted against each other on the subject of blind faith vs. pragmatic realism in a setting where lives depend on the result. \\"Lost!\\" is much simpler, but the dialogs are no less thought provoking and poignant.In spite of the lackluster title, the writing is simple and very well thought out.

It's an easy, fast read.In my mind it's a hidden gem because nobody I have ever known has ever heard of it, and yet it was a very formative book for me while I dreamed of cruising. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"\\"Lost\\" is the true story of Bob and Linda Tininenko and Bob's brother-in-law, Jim Fisher, whose plan to sail to Costa Rica ends in disaster. Their trimarin flips over during a storm, and for more than two months the three of them lives on nibbles of food, sips of water and hope. There were times I was so angry at Jim that I wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into him, but Bob actually tried that and it didn't work. People like Jim scare me, and what happens in this book is an example of the consequences of a belief in God that leaves no room for compromise. For example, when Bob lights a signal fire, Jim freaks out and says that Bob is interfering with God -- he believes God will save them without any action from them. And Jim throws away their water-distillation kit because he believes that it would interfere with God's plan. Yet Jim is also a sympathetic character, a man of principle, and a deeply caring person. That's one of the things that makes this book a compelling read."},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"I nearly read this book straight through, but for another reason. I met Bob Tininenko as we were boating together, heard his story and then found the book.As someone who has a deep abiding faith in God, I found his brother-in-law Jim's approach to faith foolish, ridgid and destructive. I think that says it all.Bob still bears some of the effects of this terrible experience, but he has gone on to live and love life. Bob is a man of honor who loves those around him and still loves the water... and he is a pretty good fisherman too."},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"Read this book in one sitting. Bob Tininenko - if you are out there please know that you are an inspiration to all of us. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"Tommy Thompson was a truly gifted writer and his death is a keen loss. His books have always been outstanding and this one is no exception.During the summer of 1973, a young married couple and a friend go for a sail that results in disaster. Bob and Linda Tininenko are an intact unit and they travel with their friend James Fisher depart from the West Coast to sail around the world.Days after their departure, the boat \\"turtles,\\" that is, turns upside down. The trio are forced to spend the next few weeks at sea, trying to survive. Bob and Linda have each other. Jim is clearly the odd member of this trio. A religious zealot, he insists they all limit their conversations to Bible-themed topics; he lies about misplacing the supply kit; he lies about ever having the cheese balls that Bob threw to him to save from water destruction. Jim becomes increasingly erratic and irrational. Linda's health deteriorates to the point of death. Bob's account of burying Linda at sea is heart wrenching and devastating. Linda was pregnant when she died. Her death was the death of two.Jim and Bob end up squaring off for survival. Impatient with the man's religious ramblings, Bob more often than not leaves Jim to his own devices. The trip results in even more tragedy when Jim, too, dies at sea.Bob, as sole survivor is left to heal with the multiple wounds of Linda's death, the death of their unborn child and with Jim's loss. Battered and emaciated, Bob regains his physical strength in a hospital where his amazing account of his sea disaster is recounted. Bob is a likable, credible reporter and one cannot help but share his pain as he recounts the ordeal of 1973."},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"I'm so glad to find this book again. I have the original copy my mother had and passed onto me. I have read this book over and over again over the years and it is getting pretty used.

He is an amazing man and I'm so lucky to know him and his loving family. He is so interesting to talk to, funny, sarcastic, and a joy to be around.

This true account of three people lost at sea in a capsized trimaran has several themes going on at once.

On the other hand, I became so frustrated with Jim Fisher that, as another reviewer has stated, I wanted to dive into the book and shake some sence into him!That is the way this book is. Once you start reading, you will become so involved with the lives of these three people, that you will not be able to put it down. It is way more than just another true adventure story.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Lost!","review":"I haven't read this book but I am going to buy a copy. I didn't realize that a book had been written about Mr. Tininenko's odyssey at sea. He taught me Washington State History when I was a student at Lower Columbia College in 1972. I still remember reading the newspaper account of their rescue and was sad when I heard that Jim died shortly after their rescue. I hope that despite all the loss, he has been able to go on and have a fulfilling life.One thing that I thought about at the time I heard of his rescue was how he reacted once he smoked his last cigarette. I remember that he smoked quite a bit during the three hour class.update: I was able to get a copy of the book. I felt it was well written and quite compelling.

I thought it was pretty good but the story dwelt too much on the conflict between a man who was deeply religious & a man who used to be.

I didn't laugh once from the first to last page. Why? Because I think this is really a fair depiction of much of what went on in day to day Native American life on the Reservations of North Central Montana at that time. And it wasn't (and isn't) funny or pretty!!! However, the view and appreciation of their circumstance has changed radically in Montana over the last 40 years.

Germany's population boom, from 49.2 million in 1890 to 67 million in 1913, its military roots with the crucial Prussian Law of Siege July 4th 1851 - the military take over of state activities in preparation of war, respectively, to Bessel, were the reasons for all irrational decisions that included the subsequent declaration of war and with a rising death toll. Irrational decision-making, also led to neglect of agriculture causing widespread malnutrition - as farmers were employed in the military, thus handicapping food supply, and inefficient high tech manufacturing - as under-skilled women and war-cripples were employed as replacements. Due to this, asserts Bessel, skilled war weary soldiers, in large numbers began joined ranks of the industrial workforce: awaiting the end of war. Maintaining that war weariness, which led to voluntary demobilization, helped the unprepared Demobilization Commission in stabilizing the situation: as most soldiers had already joined civilian ranks, Bessel argues, Germany was able to avoid a political revolution. The planning commission, had foretold this political upheaval; fortunately it never happened, as voluntary demobilization, argues Bessel, had commenced sometimes during the war; thus saving the commissions from its ineffectiveness. Rise in consumerisms, to Bessel, had also been overlooked by the commission, and this soon led to hyperinflation that combined with the Versailles Treaty, gave rise to public resentment. Resentment, claims Bessel, was also present in the cultural-economic sphere where it was felt that introducing women and children into the workforce had sowed the seeds of moral decline. The fear that mass culture was destroying the aesthetics of the society, in spite of the fact that price control and rapid economic mobilization had led to stability, was mounting to an almost revolutionary level. This revolutionary atmosphere, moreover, would be intensified with the continuing fall in real wages and the inflated fiscal deficit. The fall in real wages along with the government's inability to further subsidize companies to provide mass employment, to Bessel, had resulted in an alarming fall in living standard, and a serious housing problem by 1928. Combined with falling living standards, the opposition towards the role of women and children in manufacturing during the war and after (moral decline), to Bessel, led to the fall of the Weimar republic. In spite of the failure to address socio-political causes to hyperinflation, Bessel, does a good job in outline demographic causality that led to the failure of Weimar democracy. His work through Germany's provides detail structural picture rather than immediate political and cultural events that could lead to the fall of a democracy. Germany After The First World War is a masterpiece that gives insight into a nations sociopolitical scene and highlights how the working class would get disillusioned with democracy."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"This is a disappointing book of epic proportions.This book spans, literally, thousands upon thousands of years of Krynn history. What dozens of books covered before, this book tries to cram in a couple hundred pages. A what cost? The space to add critical aspects of writing such as pacing, detail, characterization, etc.The dragons are all identical. Not a single dragon has its own personality. We are told by the narrator that some are selfish, or rash, or compassionate, but we never see this in the dragon's actions. Many of the dragons, in fact, do the opposite. Most of them show themselves to be foolish, stupid, and hopelessly naive, even after they have been world-wise and battle-hardened by centuries of life on Krynn. As a nitpick, all the dragons go by their human use name, despite never knowing humans.The evil dragons are completely over the top. If you enjoy layered, complicated villains with unique personalities, motivations, and a personal history, you will not find it here. The evil dragons are just evil, with no reason for it, and it is only violent evil: mutilating sheep and burning down fields as opposed to the sneaky, plotting evil we are reminded they are both capable and fond of in other books. For a decent example of this, check out the Dragonlance novelThe Black Wing (Dragonlance: Villains, Book 2), which gives the back story of the dragon Khisanth (Note that the dragon has a dragon name in her own mind, not a human use name.) The dichotomy between the good and evil dragons is strained, pounding you on the head just in case you didn't get that the dragons worshiping the Queen of Darkness are the bad guys.The battles fall flat. All the action in the book is identical: the dragons square off mid-air, blast a few spells at each other, claw for a while, and then the good dragons flee in convenient mated pairs to lick their wounds and repopulate the species. The fights lack details, drama, suspense. And at the end, even though the Chief Bad Dragon is killed, there is always his/her son to carry on their evil ways. The war in The Dragons doesn't contain the epic battles, the tides of battle, the rise and fall of morale and tension that the other Dragonlance novels do; it remains in stasis.Overall, this book suffers from every malady known to literature. Poor characterization, including 'perfect' characters; pacing issues; lack of any kind of detail; thin plot; one-dimensional villains and heroes; gratuitous info-dumping; and unmoving action. Somehow a Dragonlance novel made dragons the most boring thing on Krynn. Vastly unsatisfying.And I so wanted to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"Tells more than enough about the old dragon ways and is the most dramatic and heart warming novel yet.

The reader should have some background in the DragonLance world to fully appreciate the book."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"I read this book for the first time years ago when I was a young teenager. I had already read the Chronicles and the Legends series so I knew enough about the Dragonlance universe to understand what was happening.I just sat down with this book again and finished it in 3 days because I could not put the book down. Douglas Niles does a fantastic job of bringing to life the characters in the book. While there are other races noted in this book, dragons (obviously) take center stage. From the time Crematia is born to thousands of years later, the novel focuses on the emotions and actions of dragonkind across Krynn.The only knock I have on this book is that it is too short to get everything into one novel. 300 pages is just not enough for a book of this magnitude especially considering a large chunk of the book is dedicated to Crematia and the chromatic dragons as well as Darlantan/Aurican and the metallic dragons. After their stories ended the stories of their children and grandchildren begin. To be honest, the entire book could have revolved around Crematia, Darlantan and Aurican and 300 pages still would not have been enough.All in all this is a fantastic read and one I will come back to time and time again over the years. Even 10-15 years later I am still reading about the dragons and getting drawn into their story."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"Before reading my review, i have to say, First and foremost:Read the Dragonlance Chronicles series. Period. All of Dragonlance flows from these books. Trust in the tens of millions who have. Read it first, if your still interested in Dragonlance, wait and come back to this one. Without reading Chronicles beforehand, this novel may not make too much sense, and will loose most of what makes it interesting.Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy Gift Set*Strongly Suggested reading.This book by Douglas Niles is based on that foundation, and furthermore one can tell that is is also from his previous work on The Elven Nations Trilogy. This book also makes references to Richard A. Knack's \\"The Legend of Huma\\". While these books aren't necessary to follow 'The Dragons', I firmly believe your grasp of 'The Dragons' will be more complete, and as such, make it more enjoyable to read.The Legend of Huma (Dragonlance: Heroes)*Suggested readingThe Elven Nations Trilogy*More Dragonlance backgroundKinslayer Wars (Dragonlance: Elven Nations Trilogy)*only novel in trilogy by NilesSome notes to new Dragonlance fans and potential readers:If you are one of those people who has read Chronicles and other books in the Dragonlance world, you may eventually wander out and see what else is out there. There's some good, bad and ugly. Being a huge Dragonlance fan, I've read many of the books, and this one by Douglas Niles to me, stands out as in the top tier of Dragonlance stand-alone novels. He was apart of the initial Dungeons and Dragons team that put Dragonlance together. That original team is where you'll find some of the best work.The Dragons by Niles to me is a very interesting book. Most of the main characters in the book are Dragons. And if you know Dragonlance, you know that Dragons aren't just dumb beasts, they are the chosen of the gods. Intelligent, powerful, heroic or cruel.Keep in mind much of the information in the book was published in various Dragonlance Dungeons and Dragons source books, which is not really as accessible with the general public, so this is how the world of Dragonlance gets published, in another more condensed and audience friendly format. Niles has simply summarized much of that lush amount of information and composed a group of characters that fit into the established timelines and histories from the Dungeons and Dragons source books and novels by Weis & Hickman.If you know much of that information, you'll find the book both interesting and find yourself admiring how Niles has weaved his own characters inside that history. Not an easy task if you think about it.Okay, so you've read Chronicles, hopefully. You've read Legends, hopefully. Reading The Legend of Huma is a good idea before this one. Now you're wondering where to go, and there are a lot of avenues and a lot of authors and some of it is only so-so.One can easily follow the flow of time as penned by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman. I suggest you read reviews of Chronicles to get a firm understanding where this world heads.=============SYNOPSIS & REVIEW=============Synopsis:The book basically starts early in the creation of Krynn (the world in which Dragonlance takes place) and tells of the birth of both good and evil dragons by the pantheon of the gods that rule the world. It's through the dragons that the gods of evil have waged war after war to dominate that world, and only has the power and sacrifice of the dragons of good kept that threat at bay.This novel is lenient towards the tale of the good dragons, or dragons of metal (Gold, Silver, Copper, Brass and Bronze), and particularly so to Gold and Silver dragons, and subsequently a few generations of them. We get to know several generations of Golds and Silvers and evil Red dragons that live for hundreds and thousands of years, their offspring, and all of the major wars in the history of Krynn they fight in and what becomes some very personal battles in their midst, with vengeance and rivalry being passed down for millenia.Review:I think that as far as helping us to relate to dragons, Niles does well. Some people will utterly miss this connection and find the book uninteresting. I can very much see that happening to some people, and I think a few reviews reflect that. Buy this book because you love the Dragons of the Dragonlance world. I found myself very much liking the story of the Gold and Silvers and there mastery over the brown metal dragons, and how they barely survive in battle after battle with chromatic dragons who always greatly outnumber them.The only downside to me is that the novel is that it covers so much of a time period, and often broadly that we don't get to know characters very well. You may find yourself wishing you knew what happened in the span of centuries, because some of the characters become so interesting. A lot of character appearances are brief, which kinda stinks because of few of the Dragons, both good and bad, were pretty damn cool. Thinking about it, this book could have been huge. I mean, huge.Rather, we get to know how they live, die, and how those different kinds of dragons generally behave towards each other (again, leaning towards the good ones). This is good and bad. The good is we get a really interesting perspective on the history of Krynn's wars, magic and other events, the bad is it is fairly brief, and seems to get more and more brief the later the novel goes, almost as if Niles was running out of pages and had to wrap up faster. I can't fault him for this as a mass-market paperback is supposed to be around 300-400 pages.But keep in mind that the book is in \\"The Lost Histories\\" and I believe the purpose of this Series was to provide a large amount of background information of various Dragonlance subjects in a small size.What I read, I really liked. Although the time is brief with a few characters, they were done well. We feel for the good and are fascinated by the bad. Reading about dragons battling in the sky was pretty cool. If the entire novel was about lets say, a single generation of dragons, it would've provided for some epicness, the direction of the book is different. And that was okay to me.Bottom line,4 out of 5 starsPros:Short but sweet on a few characters.Interesting perspective of the history of the Dragonlance world, from the beginning to the 'present', which is the time of the Dragonlance Chronicles series.Interesting characters, on the good and evil sideSome good battles. Death, Destruction. woohoo.Good standalone Dragonlance novel.Cons:Sometimes too short but sweet on a few characters.Minor inconsistencies and some liberties with the Dragonlance world, but they are acceptable and not really detracting.More of a summary in some areas, leaving you wanting more.Some poor chapter illustrations.The latter part of the book seems to summarize more and more.Because it was written in the 90's, it does not cover the history of more recent books by Weis & Hickman, such as Dragons of Summer Flame, & The War of the Souls trilogy."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"The Dragons is a great read, and a necessary one for fans of the Dragonlance world.

People who want to know about the history of Dragonlance's most focal race will love this book, which spans over 8000 years of history from the beginnings of the world to the defeat of Ariakas at Neraka. Even better: THE DRAGONS is not only an exceedingly detailed &quot;history&quot; book, it's also a finely written novel in its own right. Of all the rich Dragonlance books, THE DRAGONS probably has one of the largest casts. Some four or five generations of the firstborn race are detailed, starting with the children of Paladine's daughters and finishing with the evil great-grandchild of Takhisis. It's recommended that you read &quot;Aurora's Eggs&quot; from THE DRAGONS AT WAR anthology before this book, because the first chapters pick up right after the short story. The best part is, both stories are great reads on their own, even better together but hardly necessary for enjoyment. Douglas Niles has quite an ability to juggle viewpoints, perspectives, and also gloss over important events without making them seem frivolous. For example, whereas other books can spend chapters on the Cataclysm, the dragons are unaware of the immense armageddon wreaking havoc on Krynn, and thus Niles appropriately makes little mention of it. The effect at the end is of one long, arduous journey completed-but a journey that was enjoyable from the start. Also a testament to Niles is the fact that despite having so many characters (he does appear to make some small lapses, however, in numbers and mentions) he never lets the focal dragons slide. Any other author might fully develop the evil Crematia and leave her descendants form-letter characters. But the development of each personality is full, although at the end, there are a handful of weaker characters. THE DRAGONS is also excellent in how much history it spans. THE LEGEND OF HUMA (Richard A. Knaak) is retold in the viewpoint of the dragons, including the adored silver dragon Heart. The stories of the exile of the three moons of Krynn, the creation of the evil draconians, the exodus to northern utopia, and the return to ancestral Kharolis are only a few of the incredible pageantry one will find in this book. Unfortunately there is also plenty of death, too, so much that it becomes predictable in the end, and this is probably the biggest flaw I can find with the book. Otherwise, it's a shiner. At the last page, it feels like Douglas Niles has written a 1000 page book, not a 300 novel. A definite must read."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"This novel takes on the incredibly difficult task of covering the history of Krynn from the perspective of both the chromatic and metallic dragons in a three hundred page novel. I am sure like other Dragonlance fans, the unique insight of the dragons that lived and fought through the First and Second Dragon Wars and the War of the Lance was a welcome supplement. The author however, could not have given the topic justice unless he constructed a thousand page tome for the immense time span. As it was, I felt as if I was reading bulletpoints. The author allowed me to develop contempt for the villans but the climaxes came too quickly. The sudden death of major characters left me dry and wanting. The romance you are supposed you build with a character and the crooked grin one gets when the villian finally meets their end or tinge of heartache when a hero tragically dies is missing from this novel. Sadly, the author could only work with what he was provided and was forced to move on and tell us of the continuing saga of the fallen victim's progeny. Douglas Niles is a talent author, but I think any writter would have struggled to fit 10,000 years of history and three wars into a three hundred page book. With that said I would only recommend this book to those who are fans and quite familliar with the Dragonlance world and who has aleast read the Chronicles Trilogy and the Legend of Huma."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER...IF YOU HAVE NOT READ \\"THE LEGEND OF HUMA\\" AND \\"THE KAGONESTI\\" DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!

You can really see how close the dark queen really came to winning the dragon wars, and the war of the lance.It also goes into detail how the gods cast their lots into the battles so that evil would be defeated, and how they were punished for bringing back the powerful spell magic back to the land.Now, I had one beef with this book. in \\"The Legend of Huma\\", \\"Huma\\" fell in love with a female silver, named \\"GWENNITH\\"....and of course this was the dragon who loved him, and who he rode in the final battle of the \\"War of the lance\\". Now here is the problem: in \\"Dragons\\" she is mentioned...and they call her \\"Heart\\". How the writer could miss this seemingly small, BUT VERY NOTICEABLE DETAIL, is simply beyond me.Problem 2: In this book they mentioned \\"Humas Compaings\\", and conquests..once again THE WRITER OVERLOOKS ANOTHER SMALL, BUT VERY VERY NOTICEABLE DETAIL...Huma was never on any conquest or campaign...from the time he got to the front lines, he was immediately swept into one mishappen adventure to the next, and was only in contact with the rest of the nighthood only a handful of times till his death in the end of \\"Legend\\"...HOW COULD HE THEN BE ON ANY CONQUEST OR CAMPAIGN LEADING TROOPS TO VICTORY OR GLORY WHEN HE WAS NEVER AROUND THEM???This brings me to a point repeated over and over...AUTHORS NEED TO READ EACH OTHERS WORK SO THAT THEY DON'T MAKE THESE KIND OF MISTAKES.If you can see past thses flaws, then don't miss this book. It is amazing!! A true epic, a crown jewel in the DL series..But thats my opinion, I could be wrong... -Jon"},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"If you're wondering how things are with the dragon race of Krynn, then this book is all your answers in one! While reading other books in the series you may wonder what's going on in the background with the dragons. Well, this book will tell you everything about the dragons of Krynn. Its really cool to see the story of Krynn through a dragon's point of view!"},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"I loved this book. ANYONE who loves dragons at all will likely view this book as I do. This is probably the book that got me reading any Dragonlance book I could find. I don't think I'll ever understand how Niles is able to take a reader and make them see things from his chacaters' perspective. The personalities of each individual dragon, as well as the attitudes of a particular color of dragon make this book worth reading by themselves. The fiesty Blaze, contemplative Aurican, talkative Smelt, and excitable Darlantan are probably the most memorable characters I've read about. The book starts off at about 8500 years before the Cataclysm and goes on till about 321 years after the Cataclysm. It tends to focus on the silvers(Darlantan, Callak, and Lectral) and reds(Crematia, Deathfyre, and Tombfyre) while shunting the other colors of dragonkind off to the side except for maybe the golds. But the intricacies of the main characters' personalities more than make up for this. For those of you who are still incredulous, buy the book for yourself and read it."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"... A must read for any Dragonlance fan. This book covers the history of Krynn and I am not kidding! There is so much information in this book and it's an easy read. You love the anticipation of the upcoming Dragon battles. But, if you read this book before any other Dragonlance book, well let's say that the last few chapters spoil the Chronocles plots. But read this fantastic book!"},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"This is the first book that brought me into fantasy reading, and it is one of the greatest I have ever read. The author, Douglas Niles, has created the most amazing, spectacular, and awe-inspiring fantasy world I have ever read. I got so into the book that I was constantly thinking about. The Dragons are magical and too mystifying for words to describe. If you ever read at least one fantasy book, make it this one."},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"I have read several DragonLance novels and enjoyed them immensely. When I picked up a copy of The Dragons, however, I was acting as a dragonlover, rather than a fan of the series. It is an epic about good versus evil, and provides a unique opportunity to study and get to know several dragons from their earliest days as disoriented hatchlings, to their last, as majestic beasts, sailing the skies that are theirs by birthright. The Dragons, written by Douglas Niles, is a must for any tru dragonlover!"},{"Title":"The Dragons (Dragonlance Lost Histories, Vol. 6)","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago and I still vividly remember every aspect. In fact, it was one of my first DragonLance books,and when I dove in, the plot and story was fantastic.

A little disappointed in that. Should have read the reviews closer."},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","review":"This is the conclusion (well, sort of) of the Ebenezum trilogy. Here Gardner overcomes his slight roughness from \\"Multitude,\\" and returns to top form.Vushta, City of Forbidden Delights, is gone: demons have dragged it down into the Netherhells, and with it any hope of a cure for Ebenezum. Only a few wizards are left in what remains of it. Guxx Unfufadoo plans to invade the upper world. And, perhaps worst of all, two of Wuntvor's girlfriends have found out about each other!What can be done? Wuntvor must lead a special expedition to the Netherhells, consisting of Hendrek, Snarks, Norei, and Cuthbert the talking sword. (Ebenezum is absent for most of this adventure) Among the problems: Commercialization has hit the Netherhells (much to Snarks' horror), Guxx plans to take over the world, Vushta is in the slimy hands of the demons, and Wuntvor has this magical hat that keeps spitting out ferrets, flowers and scarves...The lunatic funniness of this one is too good to be described. The Netherhells are a hilarious spoof of the generally-accepted vision of hell and demons, coupled with a few sly jabs at commercialization and massive construction. We also have the climax of Wuntvor's very complex love life (I was afraid those girls were going to duke it out over him). We even have Cuthbert, a cowardly and fastidious talking sword who listens in from inside his scabbard and squeals in dismay when used to kill an enemy. And Wuntvor's army of ferrets is too hilarious for words, as is how he manages to mass-produce them (\\"Yes! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! No!\\").The characters are still fun! (Hard for any author to keep up) Wuntvor is required to grow a little more in this book, since he has to LEAD an expedition, rather than bouncing around with his master. Snarks and Brax are three-dimensional in a delightfully two-dimensional manner; as is doom-speaking warrior Hendrek, and the psychotic Dealer of Death (yes, he's back, and he's squishing demons). The weak link is Norei, who doesn't have any of the quirks of the other characters. But if you bypass her, the cast is just perfect.As ever, it's sparingly-written; we aren't overloaded with detail or unnecessary dialogue. Parents can utter a sigh of relief, since this trilogy is fine for kids. And any kid or teen who's read fantasy (or even fairy tales) will laugh themselves silly, just as well as the adults.Wonderful conclusion (sort of) to the Ebenezum trilogy. (Reprint \\"Song of Wuntvor\\"! I want more of this kooky little universe)"},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","review":"As with all the other books included in the much-lauded 'Ebenezum' series, this book does not let the reader down in the least! Each character is beautifully represented by Mr. Gardner, who shows his remarkable grasp of a world knocked slightly askew...one might draw parallels between this work and Douglas Adams' 'Hitchiker's Guide' series. A truly remarkable book on it's own, and much better when you read it's predecessors! Definately recommended reading!"},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","review":"&quot;The field needs more humorists of this caliber,&quot; says Robert Asprin on the first page. Indeed! This is definitely better than Asprin's Myth.This is the third book in a trilogy, and I haven't read the first two, but Craig Shaw Gardner does a commendable job in introducing the characters and their problems. Sure, they are caricatures, but that's what you'd expect from this kind of parody.The good thing about the book is that it has a plot, that keeps moving, and things build upon one another. The story returns to things you've seen before, and there's some sense of anticipation. Why am I all enthusiastic about this? Because Asprin's Myth books lack these features.So there it is - a book with silly characters, that encounter silly situations, and handle them with all the required seriousness. That's a good recipe for some laughs. Although I didn't get the &quot;wow, this man really understands what people are about and how stupid they are&quot; feeling that I get from a Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett book, the book is enjoyable, mildly funny, and manages to keep the interest level high (unlike some Pratchett books)."},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","review":"I bought this book when it first came out 20 some odd years ago, and of the 1000+ books I've read, this is still one of my all time favorites. I drag it out every few years and re-read it, and it still makes me laugh."},{"Title":"A Night in the Netherhells","review":"You can't get through this book without cracking up laughing somewhere during it. I've never heard of Gardner before I read this book. Some people might not like it because they think it is far too silly. I'd say they are a bunch of prudes anyway. The adverage reader will love this book. If you like monty python and douglas adams you'll might like Gardner. It's not a typical fantasy book it makes fun of the genre.

Moore is a writer of immense talent and though he is not well known in this country, if he continues writing novels as rich in intrigue and atmosphere as WAITING FOR THE LADY, his moment will come. Writing in the vein of W. Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, Ernest Hemingway, and a dollop of Joseph Conrad and DH Lawrence (to mention the first that come to mind!), Moore knows how to sculpt a tale of intrigue while informing his reader about strange and exotic places and the turbulent histories that influence his choice of story line.Sloan and Hart are two longtime artist friends living in Thailand who stumble on a series of photographs associated with a dying promise that the photographs will be returned to the mysterious lady captured in an odd way. They two have co-authored (Sloan as a photographer, art as a writer) a book on the Chin people of Burma, a group of people known mostly for their tradition of tattooing the faces of the women with spider-like tattoos), and all indications point toward re-visiting their old haunts. The two travel to Myanmar (as Burma is called today), encounter old acquaintances who offer clues as to where their trek will best follow, and soon they are joined by Sarah - a woman writing her PhD on the tattoo symbolism of the Chin people! Sloan and Hart are also motivated on this trip to uncover Ming china, a source of potential fortune for these worldly guys. How the history of Myanmar influences their journey and leads the threesome into bizarre circumstance is the mode of intrigue and page-turning story that results.Moore is at his best in creating situations and atmospheres and writing with an eloquent style: \\"Nothing is fixed in the past or the present. What we call actual emerges from a fog of many possibilities. Until we observe an event, the forces are fluid, everywhere at once, neither here nor there, diffused and open-ended. It is only afterwards that the witness gathers evidence and only then can anyone say that the event ever happened in precisely that way.\\" If Moore has a flaw that could bear correcting it is in his tendency to become sidetracked by either words or events or tangential information that at times stops the story's propulsion.This is a fascinating read, one that educates as well as entertains. When Moore elects to be comedic, he does so with aplomb, much in the way Shakespeare used comic relief to allow his audiences time to breathe from the dramas. Christopher G. Moore has written 18 books and if they all approach the quality of this novel, then he most assuredly deserves a wide audience in the USA. Where are the readers from the film studios scouting for terrific ideas for adventure films......? Grady Harp, August 05"},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"If you are looking for a standard contemporary history of Myamar (Burma) you should look elsewhere. But, if you are interested in Asia and the souls, some of them lost, who populate the region \\"Waiting for the Lady\\" is the book for you.Mr. Moore works on a very large canvas splashed with laughter and tears. His landscape draws on the political intrigue that contiunes to swirl around Myamar's pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. But the book is more. It deals with the poignant memories of the Pacific War that remain at best just below the surface throughout most of Asia, and is peopled by a cast of characters running the gamut from a newlywed Burmese couple who can't keep their hands off of each other, to a blind fortune teller, to haplass smugglers, to military intelligence goons, to folks in the countryside just trying to cope in a poor country run by a repressive regime, to a mysterious young tattooed woman who holds the key to long unanswered questions who just happens to make her first appearance in a long-lost photograph. That Mr. Moore's narrator and his best friend are both Bangkok-based expats trying to keep their heads above the proverbial klong water, financially and morally, only spices up the tale.In \\"Waiting for the Lady\\" Mr. Moore has offered up a unique snapshot of not only a country little known and understood in much of the world, but also a richly emotional look at its people.Mr. Moore's knowledge of the region and that that he is not afraid to take chances, and pull no punches, when dealing with cultural and social challenges richly rewards the reader. As Mr. Moore has shown in his numerous previous books, he is a literary novelist who disguises his art as entertainment. A ruse that works well.Put down the history books and socio-political studies and pick up a copy of \\"Waiting for the Lady\\". Those who know Asia will nod their heads in agreement. Those who don't may be surprised. For all it is a very good, and enjoyable, read."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"I have been a diehard fan of Chris Moore since 1992 and that love never dies, particularly when you have the intellectual pleasure of reading something as striking as Waiting for the Lay. I think that even though it's not quite the same as a Vinnie Calvino PI novel or the Smiles trilogy, it's still one of his best books.I've also never encountered one of Chris' novels where the story is done in first-person narrative but in this case, it works quite well as far as I'm concerned.I have to admit that Patricia Naylor's commentary wasn't too pleasing because I think in many ways, she missed the entire point of the main character being the way he is. Is he a questionable, none-too-successful American expat living in Bangkok who might not necessarily be your best friend? Of course he is but that's what I think helps to make this tale unfold so beautifully--he's a hero who isn't and the time in Burma matures him greatly. No, he's no Vinnie Calvino or the expats living at the Thermae but that's half the appeal, liking a man you normally wouldn't like.Then too, I guess Patricia must have seen a different Burma than what I encounter in Tachilek every time I do a visa run from Chiang Mai. Yes, indeed, the Burmese people are beautiful people who do their best to be open with you but I think Patricia has missed the grim reality that Burma is one of the most repressive hellholes on the planet and this is through the direction of such organizations as SLORC which cheerfully torture, rape, imprison, kill or use \\"inferiors\\" to step ahead of the army troops to \\"find\\" landmines along the borderlines and within the Golden Triangle. That's the Burma I know and I honestly feel Chris has covered it as truthfully as he can while still staying within the parameters of the story itself.It's because of his skills that you get the story that hooks you on Page 1 and carries you through to the end. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants a revealing glimpse into Burma (it shall never be Myanmar to me unless Aung San Su Kyi wishes that herself as the legally-elected ruler of this country) as well as characterizations that may upset you but I promise will never bore you."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"I have to admit Christopher G Moore is my favourite contemporary writer. \\"Waiting for the Lady\\" was a slight departure from my previous experience of his work both in terms of characters and locations. However it was certainly no disappointment for that. As always there is a bitter-sweet edge to the narrative but the charm for me of this book, as with his whole body of work is the insight into the minds and the culture of South East Asia.\\"Waiting for the Lady\\" goes a little further than Moores other work in exploring the dark side of the region and in particular the politics. It is not a polemic. It uses the political backdrop as the background for a very good yarn which adds to the tension and emotion.Moore's work follows a tradition of writers such as Hemingway and Greene. It works on different levels. \\"Waiting for the Lady\\" does the same. It is political but not overtly. It describes the psyche and the soul of the place and those who inhabit it but again in a subtle way, as a means of context setting. Above all though it is a great read.Anyone with a sense of adventure and an empathy for this part of the world will I am sure find this book enthralling."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends WAITING FOR THE LADY as a hot & sweaty introduction to Christopher G. Moore's supercharged tales of smuggling, politics, sex & mayhem in Southeast Asia.WAITING FOR THE LADY is enigmatic, often lyrical & a gripping read! High (if not noble) adventure in an exotic land!& if you like it, do check out all his other books -- he's a writer with far too little exposure in the Western World."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"Waiting for the lady, a thoroughly enjoyable read and another classic from a very talented writer. Christopher seems to average a book a year for the 22 years he has lived in Thailand and that is some achievement. Time is split between half the year researching for the book and the other half writing it.Waiting for the lady is in actual fact based in Burma (or of course now Myanmar). Perhaps I struggle with change as Burma still sounds so much better to me or it could be an age thing. The novel is full of passion, very amusing in places and sometimes sad, but never dull.I want to pick up more on the cultural aspect of the book, rather than the story line. However the story line is based around two old friends called Sloan and Hart, an Artist and a Writer/Pool room hustler of Bangkok bars going to Burma to carry out a promise made to return some photos strangely found by Sloan to a lady. In between they hope to create a fortune by uncovering ming china and are joined by Sarah a lady writing a PHD on body tattoos of the chin people.Politics of the area, but not too heavy, history of the area, the right amount to be informed and some fantastic childhood reflections and walks down memory lane from the main characters.Having spent a lot of time in Southeast Asia myself I especially enjoy the way Christopher Moore blends the different cultures and characters in the book. It is his knowledge of the region and the regions cultures that kept me enthralled throughout. Although set in Burma, you get insights in to the cultures of the Burmese, the Thais, the Japanese, the Americans and the British.Being an English man and having been married to a Thai woman for 100 years, I mean 24 years, I love those cross cultural break down moments and believe me they can happen in an instant. Christopher Moore has always had the knack of capturing them superbly.The sort of thing I am referring to is the Westerner flying off the handle then wishing he had not. One of my favourite parts that left me roaring with laughter, because I could relate to it so well was when Sloan married to a Japanese woman arrives home with loads of shopping. Sloan the American loved to do the cooking and dutifully with warmth in his heart ventures out to get all the ingredients required to cook for himself and his wife.Sloan returns and gets out of the taxi with bags full of shopping and sweating profusely from the weight of them. Sweating and completely loaded up makes several attempts to get the keys in the door and turn it. Finally he gets in the door and is told by his wife to remove his shoes before venturing in as this is Thailand. Sloan explains that the bags are heavy dear, I am sweating and obviously looking for his wife to override this very cherished tradition on this occasion. His wife is having none of it and still insists that shoes are to be removed. It is at this point you either do as requested and life will sail on smoothly or you flip. Sloan aims a kick at the oscillating fan and frightens the hell out of the dog and it all ends very messy in deed. This of course leads to the evening being ruined, that magic moment between a man and a woman turned in to a non speaking, backs to each other in bed situation.The problem for us men in general is that we can have a 10 minute fit and forget about it, but you can be darn sure the lady will carry it on a lot longer, if not very apologetic an Asian lady can take it to the grave. With me it's always a ''why did I do that reflection''. Christopher Moore captures these moments brilliantly and others in Waiting for the lady. In fact he captures these moments brilliantly in all of his work.If you have an affection for the Southeast Asian region and enjoy a good novel, especially a novel that really brings the characters to life, then I highly recommend ''Waiting for the lady'', in fact I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Waiting for the Lady","review":"I just finished this book and really enjoyed it!

Thanks so much for this resource of hope!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I had just read Ms. Beattie's famous/infamous \\"Codependent No More\\" and was inspired by her revolutionary ideas: I didn't have to depend on others for approval; I didn't have to base my self-worth on how helpful I was to friends; I didn't have to over-react to everything that happened in my life; I didn't have to think negatively about myself; if I didn't cause the problem then it wasn't my responsibility to fix it.As a teenager about to enter the \\"real world,\\" it seemed all I heard from others was what I was \\"not\\" doing right. I should know more than I did and be more grateful for what I have; what college did I want to attend? Why wasn't I more ambitious? What's more, I was odd for being frightened by the fact that the world as I knew it was about to fall apart when all my friends moved away to college. Apparently, if what teachers told me was any indication, life would only get more difficult as I took on the responsibilities of being an adult. Melody's book gave me something that I so desperately needed and could find nowhere else: compassion.\\"Codependent No More\\" was so comforting that I wanted to \\"live\\" in its pages. I felt I had entered a new world, and I didn't want to leave. I wanted a way to remember everything I had learned from Melody Beattie about \\"owning my power\\" and being compassionate with myself. I wanted a way to \\"stay on track.\\" I wanted a \\"guide,\\" something of a daily ritual to keep myself mindful of the liberation she had introduced me to. To that end, I sent Melody Beattie a letter thanking her for her work and asking if she knew anything about \\"Codependents Anonymous\\" groups. I was honored to receive a reply, and she directed me to the national headquarters for CoDA. I began to go to the meetings at the now closed \\"Journey's Bookstore\\" in Beaverton, Oregon, and that is where I found this book, \\"The Language of Letting Go\\". These meditations helped keep me focused on what I had learned, and the meetings allowed me to share what I had learned. And this all enabled me to do what I had wanted: \\"live\\" in the pages of Melody's compassion.Melody is a poet. These meditations are not \\"scientific\\" or technical, and they are not even really \\"meditations\\" per se - they are more daily reminders, notes from Melody, on how to find happiness within oneself, and how to be compassionate with oneself when such happiness seems impossible. There is no \\"fancy\\" language that will necessitate a dictionary, and no unattainable goals are suggested. There are no come-ons to suggest that your life will not be complete unless you buy her other books. These meditations feel like letters from a friend, a friend who enjoys her life and is happy to share her personal insights and situations she has learned from; that is one of the most enjoyable things about this book, the personal stories Melody shares. There is no \\"finger pointing\\" in this book. I very faithfully read one meditation per day during the remainder of my last year of High School, and it made life bearable and gave me hope that things would get better (they did). The underlying message of this book could be: breathe, smile, relax, let go.If you are looking for a structured way to practice what you have learned from Melody's other books, I would recommend these meditations."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I had been thinking about buying a book on this topic for some time to further my self improvement process.This book is about so much more than letting go. It is also about personal power. When you let go of something, it loses its power to control you, and you move forward with your life in a more empowering way.This book is set up with daily meditations on different issues. If you were to open any page at random, you would probably find something very useful. It is easily read, and as you read can feel the shift in your perception, as these simple to follow principles make a lot of sense.If you are like most people, there are plenty of things you need to let go of, and you probably have no idea what some of these are. The first step is to identify that a change needs to be made.Here are many ideas you can use to improve your life. There are too many for me to list in a review, but here are a few biggies:Attachment, guilt, blame, seeking appoval, codependency, fear, doubt, controlling, family issues, perfection, martyrdom, denial, grief, anger, victimhood.You replace these non serving beliefs with something more empowering, as you start to practice detachment, self approval, develop an abundance mentality, an attitude of gratitude etc.There is a principle in psychology that if you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always gotten.So,let go and move forward. Imagine how pleased you will be when you have made a lasting change in your life. All lasting changes in your outer reality are accompanied by changes in internal perception.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I'll admit it -- I read this book through a crisis and a time of life that saw transitions everywhere. And while I'm still reeling from pain, and disbelief of the events that have happened to me in the past few years, I am already so much better from reading this book.When I find myself tempted by defeating behaviors, reading one passage reminds me why I don't want to continue down that road any longer.The funny thing is, I never saw myself as a codependent or as an addictive person. It doesn't matter what type of turmoil you're going through -- this book WILL remind you of a better way of life.It truly is a lifeline. I keep a copy at work and am discovering I'll need one at home to. If you struggle with any type of negativity, this book can help remind you that it's really going to be okay."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I have owned a copy of 'The Language of Letting Go' since its original publication in 1996 and am still finding it useful and pertinent to my daily living. I bought the book at a time when I needed some guidance and this book provided this and more. It has allowed me to understand that what I feel is both normal and natural and that I should not deny emotions and thoughts that inevitably surface.I have suffered from post-viral depression, stress from studying, loneliness and yes, co-dependency. Melody Beattie, in this book has helped me to realise that I shouldn't try to push my fears and needy emotions aside. Rather I have come to realise I should just let the feelings go, and realise I can't control everything in my life.I am still using the book, not everyday but when I feel I need to. Inevitably I find what I need in each daily meditation. This has always been a daily tonic to me.Recently I lent my book to a good friend who is going through a very rough time - She was involved in a bad car accident she was told she should have died in. Since that time she has suffered from an eating disorder and has tried to push her closest friends and family away from her, afraid that she could hurt us with her pain. I know this book has helped her enormously, she told me so. Now I'm buying one for her. I think this is probably the best gift I could give her."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"If I could only have one book throughout my life, this would be the book I would choose because it has made me feel so good! I was given this daily meditation book by a friend in 1992 and it is the first book I have ever read EVERY day! No book has ever made me feel so good about being me. The short, daily meditations lift my spirits and let my heart soar. They have let me enjoy being just who I am and loving it. Most of us deny our true feelings and supress who we really are. This delightfully written book reassures us that our feelings were designed by God and are o.k. to feel. When God gives us a feeling, it is his way of preparing us to have that need met. This book helps your spirit soar and helps you become the person God intended you to be.I give this book as graduation, birthday, and anniversary gifts to those special people I love. I am now ordering another copy for me, too, as I have worn mine out from reading a short meditation every day that always makes me feel better! The author may not be an angel, but she definitely has connections that will touch your heart and soul!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I found this book not long after joining Al-Anon and establishing a daily devotional time. I was stuck in a long term emotionally abusive relationship and attempting to escape it. The Language of Letting Go showed me I deserved to be happy. It gave me so much hope for a better future. I still read it daily, its my bible. Thanks Melodie, this book helped me create a life!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I bought &quot;The Language of Letting Go&quot; when facing major loss, thinking it was a book about handling grief. It was one of the best mistakes I ever made. I am more grateful for this single volume than for my entire library of 3,000 other books, and daily experience more benefit.Melody Beattie's book of meditations is a guidebook for life. It's about holding on to what is meaningful, and letting go of that which can only continue to hurt us. The meditations, one for each day of the year, seem to be divinely inspired.No matter what pain you feel, these meditations are a healing balm for a wounded heart. Melody Beattie's clear and simple writing addresses the difficulties of living, loving, caring, surviving, being gentle with one's self, making mistakes, learning to detach with love, and finding balance.During a year in which I experienced major loss, and mounting stress, caring for several family members with major illness, and coping with my own, &quot;The Language of Letting Go&quot; was my lifeline. This book helped me regain a sense of perspective. In times of great despair, it has been a lifeline.Imagine reading one book for five minutes each morning or night, and literally having it change your life for the better. This is that book. &quot;Language of Letting Go&quot; is clearly written, accessible, and direct. I recommend it to anyone experiencing pain, confusion, despair, depression, loss, anger, frustration, and grief. It will help you find your way.A personal aside to anyone put off by use of the word &quot;God&quot; in books about recovery. For many of us, the word &quot;God&quot; was used to shame us as children, when hearing it or seeing it, we still cringe. A fixed belief in the limited view of God we received in childhood is not necessary to understand and benefit from the meditations. I use a phrase that has meaning and relevance for me: wherever a book says &quot;God&quot;, I use &quot;The Assembly of Higher Powers as I Understand Them&quot;.&quot;Language of Letting Go&quot; is appropriate reading for anyone desiring greater clarity of thought. I suggest that you will rediscover yourself within its covers, being loved, and recovering long-lost hope. This book can help you find peace of mind, and restore your courage to face each new day."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Having read the book 5 years ago, I still pick up the book everyday, especially when I feel those codependent controlling emotions resurfacing. The book literally saved me from myself the self-defeating behavoirs of trying to control life. It has changed my life. My book is falling apart from use, it is my daily spiritual guidance and encouragement. I couldn't live without it. Thank you from a very codependent who was brought across that bridge into the light. This book has saved me, in financial crisis', in my love relationship, in every aspect of my life. It has taught me that I cannot control life. My screen saver here at work says, &quot;You cannot control people or events... trust, believe and let it go, just let it go&quot;! This book is powerful, a life saver."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Co Dependent No More helped me greatly. It was like a slap in the face and a big wake up call. So I had to buy this book as well! Because ,I could not let go of relationships in my life that had died long ago. I was obsessed with any and all people,upon knowing them for two minutes. This guide is very inspiring and helpful,helps you get through the day. Melody's books were suggested to me by an excellent Therapist."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book of meditations gives you inspirational thoughts to begin your day with. A must read for anyone dealing with codependancy issues. In her words, Melody Beattie gives me a spoonful of wisdom every morning; a tonic to support me all day!

I happened to be in Barnes and Noble with her when she bought Melody Beattie's book, and after perusing a few of the passages, I bought one for myself. What a difference reading The Language of Letting Go made (and continues to make) in my life.I've bought and given away several copies of Letting Go since that night in the bookstore in the hope that my friends will benefit as much as I have from these sage words of \\"gentle\\" advice and reminders that we deserve \\"the best that life and love have to offer.\\" A few of my personal favorites are the reminders to be patient and realize that timing is perfect, that it's okay to say \\"no\\" sometimes and equally okay to say yes to what feels right and good, and that we are responsible for taking care of ourselves.The realization that we are being divinely led and that we need to trust our Higher Power is reinforced throughout the book. Anyone interested in growth and self-care will benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I personally believe in the power of daily practice of meditation and focussing on the moment at hand.

What a life saver!!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book gives words of wisdom and meditations/affirmations for the co-dependent for each day of the calendar year. It's like having your very own therapist on your nightstand at your fingertips at all times. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the multiple references to God and your Higher Power. If you're into that, it's a 5-star book, if you're not, just improvise. The book's worth it."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"My husband was going through a very difficult period last year.

(Ha) really, though, i just can't imagine anyone wanting to put themselves through that kind of hell everyday. i think that we need to spend more time reading the many powerful novels that are out there - ones that let us laugh, cry and celebrate all the aspects of life's ups and downs. i think the book was written in the best intentions and with a true desire to share and help another individual and commend the author for sharing difficult times and pointing to faith based values for salvation. we could all use more of that in the world, but it just struck me as TOO, well, maybe boring is a good word, ...wallowing. i saw a lot of wallowing. also, all the separateness and disconnection may have been too much. it just doesn't feel healthy. probably said like a co-dependent, right?!!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I didn't read this book, I didn't keep the book (paperback) because I didn't save the package it came in and didn't know who I had chosen to order it from and it didn't cost enough for me to make a fuss over.

Soon after graduating, I found another copy at the local library back home and started checking, then rechecking out that same worn copy. Even if you're not in a formal recovery or 12-step program, this book is a goldmine. It contains dfferent ways of thinking about the self, about others, about life. If you're at all overly attached to other people, allowing them to control you, or submerged so deeply in others' needs you've lost your own self, please get this book. If I hadn't gotten this book, it's doubtful I would've made it into my first meeting. THANK YOU, MELODIE."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"The book is great. Melody Beattie is a wonderful writer and this is now my second book.

As I was reading this book, it reminded me of the book, Pulling Your Own Strings, by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. To this day, I still refer to this book when situations arise. Letting go is difficult for me in some situations and yet, in others it is not an issue. However, when it comes to family, that's when you over look so many things. If it was a friend, a co-worker, or even a stanger, bingo, you realize that person is not good for you, it's toxic, and you let go. It's is simple as that. Needless to say, with family, why is it so different? Finally, you reach a point and realize this is it, that the toxic is so bad, your miserable, you communicate with them and express your feelings, and nothing different happens. So you take it upon yourself to do what is best for you, and finally, let go. The book brings out what you need to read, knowing that your taking care of yourself. Albeit, I have not finished reading this book, yet I know it will become another one of my reference books of the future. As we all know, life will have its challenges."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I'm finding this book very close to heart.

These snacks of emotional strength give fuel for positive meditation.

She's made that all-important connection with the Divine and it's clearly coming through in her writing to assist us in our woes. When no one else is around to help ease the pain, open this book for an insightful pep talk and affirmation/meditation that will take the edge off your fear. The best way to use the book is to sit quietly (first thing in the morning is very good), take a few deep breaths and ask, &quot;What's going on with me???&quot; You'll be amazed when you open right to the appropriate passage."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book has daily reminders of what I learned in Codependent No More.

Its focus is on the present. It breathes freshness into each weary soul. It becomes the medicine for the heart and provides tools for change. Putting it in a class with self help books is too pop culture, almost degrading. It stands alone; it shines brightly. I've given this classic daily book of meditations to all those whom I love."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"My sister gave me this book after my husband left me. I was absolutely devastated and very, very depressed. And while I ended up with several \\"self help\\" books to read during this difficult time, this is the book that bacame my bible. I had it with me all the time. It has been highlighted, written in and many of the pages are turned down. It gave me hope and helped me to hang on and believe in myself. I have since given this book to any friend who is suffering a loss of a relationship. Nowadays I look at it fondly and \\"remember\\" the those days when I felt so very lost and lonely. I thank God my sister sent it to me when she did. It was a great comfort. I do prefer the original cover on the book that I have...yellow with little birds on it. I will always treasure this little gem."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This is the best book ever if you are looking for good orderly direction with a spiritual twist.I have given this book to at least 5 of my friends when they are going thru a break up, loss or any kind of trouble in life.

Very easy to read and gives solid daily advice.Priceless and well done, Melody. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I bought this book along with another of Melody's. I think she is a very caring and understanding person and this book gives me daily readings to keep up my spirits and know that I am not alone and I can fix my own problems.

I read from it every night and it only takes a minute or two. Nothing really earth shattering, but it just reminds me of things to think about to achieve the goal of letting go of unhealthy attachments, expectations, relationships, etc. Sometimes I feel like it was written especially to me; sometimes it doesn't really apply. But overall, this book is supportive and encouraging."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"The book that I ordered was for a friend. When I ordered it the rating of it's condition was good; the book arrived in \\"outwardly\\" good condition but when I opened it there was a very personal and romantic inscription written inside the jacket. It seems to me that the seller A. reduced the rating/price and B. Checked the book more throroughly.At that point it was too much trouble to go through the return/refund so I made a joke about the cover in my inscription to my friend and gave it to her.One other problem: the mailing return address on the package had a name that did not match the sellers name/business on line.

If a person's still looking for \\"softer easier ways\\" to keep from putting in the necessary due diligence, to live a life that's free from delusion and disillusionment...and crutches; go ahead and keep grabbing at straws and twigs...but, it might be best accompanied by a willingness to try and \\"fake it til you make it\\" and see the light of reality isn't another train at the end of the proverbial tunnel.

It's the only one that will. \\"Just Do It\\".I bought this book to send to someone, but after reading the back cover, upon its arrival, I was sorry I'd ordered it.

This book gives you the support to keep your life uncluttered. I am now starting my second year of reading it every day. I highly recommend it and have given it to others. Her new book \\"More Language of Letting Go\\" is along the same lines and equally as good.

This is a book that I keep on my bedside table and read the daily meditation before falling asleep at night. It's a great way to end the day on a positive note since the writings are self-affirming and positive.If you have read any of Melody Beattie's books on co-dependency and are familiar with the topic, I think you would enjoy having this around as a short, simple way to live the concepts on a daily basis. Very much geared toward the philosophy of 12-step programs and actually incorporates the steps and the concept of a higher-power into the readings."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"It is a very good book.

The readings are insightful, and go hand in hand with another great read &quot;The Courage To Change&quot;. I've yet to discover why Alanon has yet not recommended this book?! Trust me, this is one of the best daily readers you can get!I like this book so much, that I've given SEVERAL away as gifts to those that I love dearly. To this date, I've NEVER received a single complaint, only compliments on the depth and wisdom, of the words written by Melody Beatie. So, if you want a great daily reader, then I HIGHLY recommend this book. On yet another note, I just purchased &quot;More language Of Letting Go&quot; so, as soon as I've read a bit of it, I'll post my comments here.Ciao All!!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I have tremendous admiration for Melody Beattie's books. THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO is a particular favorite which I use daily as a source of connection with my Higher Power, and has been an important resource in my fledgling recovery from codependence and my desire to have healthy, loving relationships. There is a meditation and suggestion for each day of the year, making it possible to consider issues of recovery &quot;one day at a time&quot;. It takes a great deal of courage to face codependency and begin a program of recovery; THE LANGUAGE OF LETTING GO is a valuable tool to use in the process."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book was incredibly inspiring and helpful. It is the first self-help, take-control-of-your-life book that has ever really worked for me. I bought it at a time of turmoil when the deaths of several people close to me had me in a very *down* state of mind. I have also found it valuable in dealing with other people, not necessarily my own problems--of course, other people can be one's problems. Beattie manages to give us thoughts to live by in a non-religious yet spiritual context that is very appealing and very practical."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"The Language of Letting Go was recommended to me by my husband's rehab counselor in 1994. I've read it cover-to-cover twice and have since bought at least 6 copies for friends and family. Don't start at the beginning. Flip through the book and let grace lead you to the inspirations and encouragement you need. I know recovering alcoholics who rave about this terrific handbook. If you're looking for a book to start you on your path to sanity or one that will nudge to along when the going is grey, this is it."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I purchased this book 'by accident' over five years ago and I still read it almost daily. I was looking for some kind of (self-help) book to help me get myself back together after ending a relationship with an addict. This book has taught me A LOT about myself and I suggest it to anyone that wishes to repair themselves rather than someone else. Each daily may not be exactly what's needed that day but you can find one that will help you renew your own strength and heal."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book tells you what it really means to let go and what happens if you truly let go. Many times we think we have let go of something in our heads but we are just in denial. Our heart has not really let go. This book has helped me overcome some of the most painful experiences in my life. If you want to really understand what letting go means, I'd also recommend \\"The Ever-transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato. After you read this book by Toru, you will feel very free and understand how life is actually quite simple and extremely beautiful."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book has been a life saver and sanity saver for me the past two years. Just when I'd think I was hopelessly disfunctional, I would pick up this book and read something uplifting, profound or comforting. It is based on great spiritual values, yet never crams any dogma douwn your throat. The book lets you explore spirituality in your own way, at your own pace. It should be required reading for everyone!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I own an original copy and have used it year after year being it's not dated. When you are ready to get real with your recovery issues, even the hard ones, this one digs in the dirt. In short, she gets to the heart of the matter in a \\"real\\" way.I have also found that the daily meditation's address something thats going on around me in some form. I don't have to like it! BUT, most of the days I do have to \\"own it\\" because I know it to be true. I need a calender of each meditation to stamp on my forehead to remind me daily.Beattie is tuff and real but most of all positive and compassionate. I own many of her books and cherish each one.I also like that I can use this book time and time again. Worth the buy."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Written for those recovering from codependency, these meditations are inspirational for anyone who yearns to step out of the patterns that keep us stuck in unhealthy relationships. Beattie is gentle but clear in urging the reader to move on."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I used one of the readings in this book and one of the readings in its sequel, \\"More Language of Letting Go,\\" as the topics in a recent 12-step meeting I was called on to lead. I was a little bit fearful about using these books, as this was not a meeting of the 12-step program that might be most naturally associated with Ms. Beattie and her writings (although a close cousin). The second person to speak up after I opened the meeting for sharing confirmed my belief that these books were \\"spot-on,\\" and so I have chosen that as the title of my review. (You know who you are, should you ever read these words, and I thank you once again.)I first discovered this book just over two years ago when I experienced the first temporary break-up with my partner, a break-up that would happen several more times over the succeedings months and only recently happened in such a way that I intend to be permanent. At the time of the first break-up, I turned to this book for reassurance that I was not a bad person for wanting out. Now, two years later (and having discovered the sequel in the meantime), the affirmations I'm finding in it are much deeper and much more positive affirmations.Of course, it's obvious from the title of the book that these little readings, usually about a page or so in length, are directed most specifically towards those who have decided that \\"letting go\\" is an appropriate response to a particular person, place or thing in his or her life. And it's amazing how often Ms. Beattie says things that I have personally experienced, although often without sufficient insight at the time to realize that I was experiencing them. It's as though she has the ability to put my feelings into words.For me, the hardest thing to do when reading this book is to restrict myself to the reading for that particular day. I have finally given up. When I feel the need to, I just read on or skip to a different section of the book. I am always encouraged by what the author has to say.I gave \\"The Language of Letting Go\\" five stars because that is the maximum I am allowed. If it were up to me, I'd give it a hundred. This book and its sequel are the best of the many meditation books I have been through. Most enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I been clean and sober now fr 12 years .I bought this book in 1988.

My therapist told me about it and I bought it thinking it was just another \\"self-help\\" book. Boy, was I wrong. This book is a life saver. I've had my share of tragedies in my life, but recently, three big ones...one being my 24-year old college senior with his whole life ahead of him, fell off a cliff and suffered a traumatic brain injury. During the darkest days of my life, living in a city 2 hours from my home for over a month, praying that my son would live and that if he did live, that he would be able to live a normal life, this book was a Godsend. And the fact that I'd had this book for several years before where it had helped me through other dark days really helped prepare me for this. When you read the meditations every day, or as I often do, look in the back index for topics relating to the particular issue I'm having that day, you REALLY feel an overwhelming sense of peace and serenity. I don't know what I'd do without this book. I think EVERYONE should own this book! I'm buying it today for my 18 yr old daughter who is struggling with codependency. I hope it helps her as much as it did (does) me."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This is a great book for everyone.

It just seems to give me the perfect message for each day. Very easy reading...simple and to the point. Most readings are one page or less.

This book is much better than regular therapy."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Although I just started reading this book in April 2009, I've found it to be very helpful in starting my day with a positive and soothing message. I believe that it is written from an Al-anon angle, but works fine for an AA angle as well. The book covers many topics (via a daily passage /reading)that are potentially difficult for those in recovery (and those who don't have a program as well). I highly recommend this book to anyone (in a program or not) that is looking for a daily meditation book to help them deal with everyday issues (internal and external) that are beyond their control. The book avoids religion yet remains very spiritual in an easy going, no nonsense (non-new agey) manner."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book has chaged my life, it is a must read.

Not something you did or something you are, but the way you relate to the rest of the world? Maybe. If you think it might be, this is the book for you. During one of the darker times of my life, one of the times I feel I learned the most, I would make 30 minutes every morning to sit down with this book, read the entry for that day, and then write some notes about it in my own journal. Some days, the book didn't have anything to say to me. Other days, I was crying as I wrote my own notes, finally understanding some point I'd been stuck on for years. Yeah, the stuff she writes sounds kinda cheesy from time to time, but that doesn't seem to detract from its helpfulness."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This is a book everyone can benefit from, but especially those struggling to improve their relationships and working toward a joy-filled life in spite of their circumstances."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I read the meditations every day and could not do without them.The book was delivered very qiuckly and arrived brand new in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Accessible.

I love it."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This was a helpful book, but would be something to pick up on a daily basis and read everyday for it to truly sink in, depending on your need of course. Some of it was stuff I already knew but wasn't willing to admit until I had someone essentially telling me point blank and some of it was kind of like- duh. Could really help a person out, paired with a Christ centered recovery program!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has lost a relationship especially for any reasons beyond their control, because this book will help in the letting go process of the loss of the relationship."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I love this book! As I read it year after year, I continue to be powerfully encouraged to continue my journey of personal emotional and spiritual healing and growth. I put it down for a year or two while I read other self-encouragement books. When I picked it up again, I felt as though I had never read the book before, as it related to my current life experiences that progress with my growth journey, causing me to see it in a new light. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Ms. Beattie offers depth and encouragement to life's daily problems and adventures...

He has been reading this author's book for some time now, and loves the everything. Her books are great for helping you to find and heal yourself and deal with the people around you. The fact that my husband has read almost all of her books cover to cover says alot because he doesn't enjoying reading.

I highly recommend this book!John D. Moore, MS, CADC---Author of Confusing Love with Obsession"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"The Language of Letting Go is the most gentle, yet inspiring, meditation book I have found. The author provides page after page that nudges the reader to become his or her best self. I would recommend this book to anyone with issues of co-dependancy; read it religiously and the words will change your life."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I have had this book since shortly after it was published. I cannot tell you how many I have purchased for friends and family. Now I have just purchased one for my granddaughter. Whenever I find myself, and sometimes others, at a point of conflict I turn to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; for comfort and solace and just good sound thinking. Melody lives at my house!, in my head and in my heart. Her ability to verbalize her connection with God, her soul and her circumstances is phenomenal. No one should be without this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Melody Beattie's book &quot;The Language Of Letting Go&quot; is a tender caring work of art.Gently she speaks to the spirit inside of us and lets us know that it is ok to be ourselves.Something most of us are not use to doing, something we need to be allowed to do.Her words are those of one who has tasted of the emotions that she shares and her advise is like sweet honey to the reader.Sometimes what we need is just someone to say, it's ok to be you! The author does this and more.A very well written meditation book that will soothe many that read the words between the covers of this work.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I had to write to counter the review that suggested this book was unhealthy and wallowing. Maybe all the other positive reviews would be enough to counteract it, but I figured another wouldn't hurt. In short, this book is practical, positive and helpful, and very much consistent with core Christian teachings (and other faiths as well). I'm usually skeptical about these books, but I find the daily readings to be uncannily relevant and consistently helpful."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I first read through this book of meditations in 1990 and have since had to buy three more copies to replace the ones I gave away to friends and family! When life becomes unmanageable, we need books with &quot;handles&quot;, i.e., practical advice on what to do when the grief/pain/anger/conflicts have left us too confused to think straight. Melodie doesn't tell us what to do, but provides unusual insight into navigating deep emotional waters and coming out on the other side in better shape than we went in. I return to this book over and over for the &quot;reality checks&quot; it provides. Today I am ordering yet another copy for myself, and a back-up copy to give away. God bless Melodie!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless, at some certain point, reality has to be accepted, and you need to move on. You can only suffer for so long.This book is both a crutch and a companion. It can be a guide. It is certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book is more than wonderful in it's wisdom, gentle strength, affirmation of self and deft perceptions. It has offered much sage, useful and worthwhile nuggets of pure lovliness and hope. I have started 2 different groups that use this book to discuss and make big changes in their life. Melodie Beattie certainly knows of what she speaks -- and her knowledge/wisdom resonates with many."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I love this book and bought additional copies for my sister and a friend.Each day you get a simple yet profound message of positivity that really uplifts my spirits.I am so happy I found this book."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"Everything I have ever read by Melody Beattie has been very helpful, and inspiring. Her book, lessons in love, broke my heart, as it did hers, but her recovery from even that, shows that she has angels guides that speak through her, to help all of us. I will always love and appreciate her generous inspriation, and I thank God for bringing her into my world. She is a blessing, and her books are very helpful, inspirational, and healing."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"If you have an issue with codependency this is the book for you. A simple daily reader that gives great inspiration to heal your soul, while giving you faith and tools for action."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"I have had this book for years and it will always be part of my collection of favorites. I counsel victims of domestic violence and have incorporated some of the readings in sessions and the women love the inspirational words of wisdom. I myself discovered Ms. Beattie's books when I was going through a bad time in my life. I never thought a book could help me but it did. I can honestly say Ms. Beattie's books changed my life. I just bought the Melodie Beattie Bundle for my Kindle which consists of four books, Co-dependent No More, Beyond Codependency, The Language of Letting Go, and More Language of Letting Go. I'm happy!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"In the early months of my sobriety, I called my sponsor one night after a fight with my husband. She took out this book and read a small reading from it, and it resonated so strong with me that I purchased the book for myself. Since then, it's been an invaluable part of my daily meditation. When I need a little insight on a particular topic, I look in the index and usually find the strength I'm looking for. After reading this book for almost a year, I think it's for more than just people in recovery. It's for anyone that cannot depend on themselves for strength, love, guidance. I have a family member going through some hard times right now, and there is a lot in this book he could really benefit from."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book really helped me get through a time in my life when I thought I would rather die than live.

It's another book that I find extremely inspirational. You can open the book to any page and find something meaningful and profound...something that can really help to give you perspective on your life. I stumbled across this book in a second hand store on a day when I was feeling very sad, and I randomly opened the book to a page and immediately felt better after having read a few words. This writer has truly created something inspirational, helpful and meaningful. This is another book that I will keep handy and read when the mood strikes me. A very positive and uplifting book."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book is not just for 12 step recovering. Everyone can benefit their lives by reading a little everyday.

I have had some mental health issues and found the book excellent for self-reflection, gaining a more positive self-image, and for taking actions to help myself to keep daily focus.

All is positive and helps a person free him or herself from whatever holds them back from satisfaction with life."},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"A must read and a must read daily for those that love someone who suffers from an addiction!"},{"Title":"The Language of Letting Go","review":"This book of Melody Beattie daily meditations is great nourishment for the Codependent soul!

The Girls' Guide is no-nonsense but heartfelt, guaranteed to guide even the most chronic bad-boyfriend/breakup/behavior prone women to succeed in moving on. Thanks for the help!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"No really- this book is awesome. I did laugh and cry, it's true, but mostly I felt sort of relieved to actually feel normal! I recently went through a pretty horrific break-up (thus staying anonymous for this review) and have been feeling like the local lunatic and as though this experience will never end... This guide is written by someone who clearly empathizes with my experience and it really does offer some great, funny, smart, and compassionate advice. It supports &quot;girl-power&quot; without being &quot;anti-man&quot; and just gives a little perspective. I would highly recommend this for women of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I bought this book for a friend who was recently dumped (over the phone, no less!) She was inconsolable, but somehow Ms. Hirsh's words seemed to get through. At first, all she could handle was the great lists of movies to watch, songs to listen to, etc. But she eventually read the whole thing and is a whole new woman, even more confident than when she was with her idiot ex-boyfriend. Thanks for bringing my friend back from break-up hell!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"delphine hirsh is brilliant. she takes her experiences and makes them like identical with my experiences. i don't know what i would do w/o this book...OMG! my boyfriend broke up with me the day after we made valentine's day plans. my sister showed me this book and it brought me from down in the dumps to feeling good again. thank you.- Back From Hell"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I bought this for my daughter..she was having a difficult time when she and her boyfriend had a brief first, break up. I actually enjoyed it too much...she was too busy crying! :)"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"There are a lot of books out there about helping you deal with a devastating break up. Some take a psychological perspective, helping you analyze what went wrong in the relationship. They help you understand the WHY of it all. Others take a more philosophical or spiritual look at your heartbreak. They can help you find meaning and purpose in what you have endured. This is not that book.This is a book that talks to you like a friend, acknowledging how crappy you feel and agreeing that it sucks. It helps you think of ways to get out of work for a few days while you wallow and explains exactly why you shouldn't call him. It gives you a comforting hug, then shakes you awake when you're ready.It's all about YOU. Helping you focus on what you need to do to get better, feel stronger and eventually be happy and ready to move on."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"Bought for a friend.

Was received quickly."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I'm not a big fan of self help books but I was really impressed with the great, timely, practical advice this book provides.

It's the coping techniques that are so helpful!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This book helped me greatly recover from my broken heart.

She had gone through her own break up and now it was my turn. It was a great way to help me realize so many things about my lost relationship. It wasnt a bad breakup but it did leave me with a hole in my heart and many questions left unanswered. This book tells you how to not do those things that you oh so want to do like calling your ex just because you miss his voice or stalking him. My breakup isnt your typical breakup because I see my ex everyday and thats what hurts the most. I know it wasnt my fault and this book helped to realize so many things but at the same time I couldnt help but wonder why. It helped but at the same it hurt to hear the truth."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"Anyone who is going through a rough break-up should read this book!

Has some great advice for getting through rough patches, some tips and a bit of humour to help cheer you up!!! And most of all encourages you to look after yourself which is not foremost on our minds when we are hurt and miserable!!! This book is a lifesaver!!!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This reads like 1,000 other articles that I have read in women's mags at the dentist's office.

Ms. Hirsh remindes us that breakups are something we all go through and it is also something we can quickly get over if we have the right attitude. The book made me want to bond with my girlfriends, pamper myself and turn the whole ordeal into a positive, even fun experience. I ate anything I wanted, went to the spa, shopped with my friends and rented all of the movies the author recommended. She helped me realized that breaking up can actually be fun. Next..."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be a funny look at how to deal with a breakup. The cover certainly inspired me.Unfortunately, while this book is not horrible, there is nothing new in here. The humour is limited and the advice is standard. Pretty basic stuff."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"The tone of this book struck me as all wrong. I think deep down this woman is very selfish and self-centered, although she pretends to be concerned about others. She repeats herself often, and this book is simply not funny. I have a good sense of humor, but I didn't laugh even once. All of the other reviews go on about how funny this book is. I simply don't get it."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This book is complete fluff. Don't get me wrong, I like fluff as much as the next gal, but this is not even amusing fluff. It's just words on the page."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I found this book to be repetitive and boring. I bought it because I thought it would make me laugh, but I never reallycracked a smile. It does not contain a hint of originality."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is going through or recovering from a breakup. It is not a step-by-step guide to recovering from a breakup -- that would be so boring and I doubt anyone in a breakup state of mind would feel inclined to read or pratise it. Instead, the author offers you her friendship and support as she holds your hand and walks you through your ordeal, starting from the First Few Days where all you are required to do is Just Keep Breathing. There is no trace of preachiness or holier-than-thou-ness in the book. Instead, you feel that the author is going through the pain with you. But at the same time that she offers you her friendship, she is also there to ensure that you do not wallow in too much sadness and die of a broken heart (no man is that worthy!). She props you up when you trip over and encourages you to press on, like when you make that call that you know you shouldn't and she has told you not to and why not. In addition to the sound, practical and pragmatic advice, what distinguishes this as an outstanding book is the empathy and forgiveness that comes across. With some quiet humour and lots of common sense, you are encouraged (and sometimes pushed along) to continue placing one foot in front of the other day by day, until you yourself recognise that by doing this simple act (and continue breathing), you are already moving on and getting better. The author has done a wonderful job. She surely has been there before and knows what she's talkiing about. She's now back as a friend and supporter -- yours. Get this book!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This book really hits the nail on the head for so many topics. It's funny, practical, and a great resource for any gal dealing with a break-up.

Thanks to the author!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"Only a week ago I was sitting at home crying hysterically about my latest break up, and now I am even able to face him at work. All thanks to Ms. Hirsh. This book was a gift sent directly from heaven. It gave me confidence to pick myself up and get back out there."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"Ususally I shy away from self-help books but the cover caught my eye and I ended up browsing through it &amp; realizing that it would be a huge help to me during this really hard time. I was only dating my boyfriend for a few months but for some reason I am having the hardest time getting over him, so when I started to flip through &quot;The Girls' Guide To Surviving A Break-Up&quot; I knew that it would soothe and help me, and it has. Because the writing is really funny and the author seems real (you can tell she's been through it too) and her advice is so good and empowering, it's given me a glimpse of hope and made me feel like I will move past this (and him). I highly recommend this book to anyone feeling heartbroken and blue. This is a GREAT book that has helped me so much in such a short amount of time. Thank you Delphine Hirsh!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"After recently being &quot;dumped&quot;, I luckily found this incredible book. It is easy reading (all I was capable of at the time of the breakup) with practical examples of many of the emotions I was feeling. One of the best parts of the book is that it gives helpful hints on how to react to those emotions without embarassing oneself. I laughed and shed a few tears with this book. I found myself re-reading the book over and over to gain insight into my previous relationship and finding ways to move on. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"Picked this book up yesterday on my way out of New York - having just had a classic New Year's Eve disaster break-up.

Thanks for the help Mrs. Hirsh!"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This hilarious book doled out useful and supportive advice and served as a solid, dependable, loyal and amusing comarade to me during a difficult time. It really helped me feel less alone during a period that felt horrible.Full of tips on how to not only appear but actually be less crazy during this emotional period as well as how to handle different people and situations in life, it also contains helpful lists of distractions. I especially appreciated the chapters devoted to putting my life back together. Being reminded to take care of myself in general and how important it is to nurture body mind and soul helped put me on the road to restructuring a good life -- maybe even better than before the break-up.For the laughs, the much-appreciated intelligent tone and for the solid advice that extends to any woman, I will be reccommending this to all my girlfriends-- especially those in the throes of a nasty break-up."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"After reading this book it becomes obvious why the author is, as the blurb says, &quot;the veteran of many break-ups.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"A good companion to this book is The BreakUp Workbook - a commonsense guide to getting over your ex. While Delphine really does a lot to help you to get through the days and nights, there's no interaction. Go to brokenheartedgirl.com and sign into the forum so you can speak with other broken hearted girls. While you're at it, you might like to purchase The BreakUp Workbook - which will also help you get through the days & nights."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"This book is excellent. It was tremendously helpful to my friend in a very difficult break-up. Ms. Hirsh has great ideas and what strikes me most is that she had a real sense of the pain involved in a break-up (especially for a twenty- or thirty-something woman) and she writes with compassion, but also a wild and supportive sense of humor. It can be a very caring gift to a friend in need since the best thing you can do for a friend in addition to support her, is help her to feel ok on her own -- this book is a kind of security blanket and guide for how to inch back to full selfhood after being sideswiped by a break-up."},{"Title":"The Girls' Guide to Surviving a Break-Up","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Hirsh's book. Sensible, chatty, often hilarious advice from a savvy writer with a biting wit. Girls of all ages will feel like they are talking to a best girlfriend.

As for Marnie Quinn whose review is &quot;spotlighted&quot; above, I'll give you ten-to-one that she doesn't really exist.

Van der Valk links the melancholy story of Luciene Englebert with the fate of a secretive man found dead in Amsterdam. A sad and gripping story that inspires deep satisfaction in the reader."},{"Title":"Gun Before Butter","review":"Nicolas Freeling is one of those authors, like Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine, & Phil Rickman, who deserve a wider audience.The \\"Guardian\\" newspaper in his obituary noted \\"the question remained as to whether he was really a crime writer or a straight novelist who chose to use crimes as a forcing house in which to examine questions of personality, propensity, even national characteristics, under abnormal conditions.\\"It's interesting to see a distinction being made between \\"crime writers\\" & \\"straight novelists\\" as if crime writing were a lesser discipline. It could be argued that the traditional structure of crime fiction offers an opportunity for the writer to distill the extremes of character & behaviour within a strict framework.Freeling is an expert, a skilled writer & observer who extends our knowledge of humanity. His characters are believable & his sense of place is unsurpassed. Rather than the black/white, wrong/right scenarios of many crime writers, Freeling's mature & sophisticated worldview encompasses human frailty without descending into an amoral universe.The murder is solved - but there's no punishment for the killer. Or does the punishment wait in the killer's future, which is spelled out in the book? The policeman hero, Van der Valk, relies on his own sense of morality rather than that of the judicial system.The author sets his characters firmly in their society & time, in this case in the Netherlands in the early 1960s. He never puts a foot wrong as he relates the story through the viewpoint of Van der Valk. We're with the policeman as he discovers the character of the murdered man through his house, even his choice of soap. Another main character is gradually woven in through contact with Van der Valk & loose ends are neatly threaded together by the end of the book.Freeling's lyrical, intelligent writing easily transcends the occasional hiccup in the plot, & Van der Valk is a likable protagonist. Freeling wrote a series of books set in Amsterdam, followed by another series set in France, which are more complex & less traditional crime fiction. All are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Gun Before Butter","review":"Freeling mimics Simenon's \\"Maigret\\" in his Van der Valk character but misses Simenon's simplicity of touch and dialogue. Rather, Freeling finds his own entertaining voice in the atmospherics of Amsterdam, the countryside of Belgium and the mid sixties tension between the Dutch and Belgians. With two to three strong characters and believable dialogue, this mystery ends with a sensitive tragic love story in the last twenty pages but hiccups in the middle with the implausibility of Van der Valk solution to the crime."},{"Title":"Gun Before Butter","review":"This was the first Freeling book I've read. It's an easy read, and the characters and situations are very interesting, even engrossing. However, the book is driven by a string of highly improbable coincidences. A drunk just happens to remove the license plates from a car. The detective just happens to keep running into Lucienne on odd occasions and critical junctures. The detective just happens to be struck by a painting hanging on the victim's wall. Lucienne just happens to be in a location where some Italians just happen to be talking about the victim's wife, in a language Lucienne just happens to understand. The victim just happens to withhold from Lucienne his crucial conversation with his wife. Van der Valk didn't solve the mystery, the solution just happened to fall into his lap (with some loose ends that are never explained). So after following an interesting enough tale, one is left with a strong feeling of dissatisfaction."},{"Title":"Los Miserables (Spanish Edition)","review":"It is a masterpiece of the universal literature. How Victor Hugo tellus about the french revolution and all the new ideas and concepts which brought it to all of us. The life of the characters with all their problems and neccessities, the amazing way to describe the character circumtances and their internal thoughts (in and out at the same time). After reading this book you will not be the same and you'll never see in the same way all the needed people, specially children. I encourage you to start reading this book.

Love it!"},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"This is an entertaining murder mystery, probably the only one ever written set backstage in a Burlesque theater. Gypsy Rose Lee was the most famous Burlesque dancer of her day, and also famous as an intelligent and classy woman. She was the toast of society offstage, and this books shows some of what made her company so enjoyable.A lot of the material is semi-autographical, and used in greater depth in her wonderful autobiography &quot;Gypsy&quot; (later made into a musical and movie). The rest is pure backstage burlesque, the strippers and their rivalries, the sleazy management, the likeable baggy-pants comic, even the crew.Not a great book, but an enjoyable one, and about the only glimpse you'll ever get into the real-life world of burlseque."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book. I also have the film \\"Lady of Burlesque\\" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy. However, although Gypsy Rose Lee \\"stars\\" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested. I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women. In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost \\"pre-code\\" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling. I found myself bored and wanting to read something else. It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.My conclusion: Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination. Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes. They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read. To use an apt cliche: mediocre fare."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"First: I can't speak to the typographical errors, because I own a different edition, but typos are incredibly annoying, so you might want to poke around for something like the 1984 Penguin paperback, which I have.Now: This is great fun! It's not the great American novel, but it's certainly well-enough written. She sympathetically illustrates the interesting (and now bygone) world of burlesque theater with observant touches, a fully developed wry voice and a few bawdy winks. Absolutely soaked in atmosphere.I read a lot of mysteries and I'll admit the murder mystery plot is no great shakes, but I really have to give credit to her writing. I was reminded of Kinky Friedman's detective fiction, which like this is based on a semiautobiographical protagonist and displays a love for the scenes of the city -- and like this has the occasional truly felicitous description.As for the depictions of women, yes, many of the performers (male and female) snipe at each other and fight, but there is also an undercurrent of intelligence and camaraderie that comes through clearly. Gypsy and friend Gee Gee have a closeness whose texture feels both casual and real; the women are (mostly) street-smart and funny and *modern* in that way that can almost seem anachronistic to today's reader. But that's the beauty of it: This was really written at the time by somebody who knew that scene inside and out, so you know it's grounded in reality.Again: It's not great literature, it's even a bit cartoony, but it's a real kick."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"This is a highly entertaining vintage mystery. The re-release features an afterward by Rachel Shteir, who wrote the wonderful \\"Striptease--The Untold History of the Girlie Show\\". The plot is semi-autobiographical, which lends it an authenticity that most pulp fiction lacks. I was a bit prepared for some of the details, having read the autobio \\"Gypsy\\" previously. The cover art is a reproduction of some original art, which makes it a nice book all around. A great book to read poolside in Las Vegas wearing your best movie star sunglasses."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"Love the book, a hard-boiled, silly little frolic. And I am grateful to The Feminist Press for reissuing this and others (I also enjoyed In a Lonely Place and Laura). But their cheapness in putting the book through Spell-Check rather than hiring an actual proofreader killed much of my enjoyment. SO many typos! Strangler/stranger, beer/been, form/from--the sort of thing a proofreader will catch but Spell-Check won't. For lack of maybe $200, all of the books in this series come off as amateurish. Not quite the tribute to the authors that was intended!"},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"i loved it, i've had others borrow it and they loved it too. you really feel like a fly on the wall of the world created by gypsy rose lee."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"I love that the Women Write Pulp people have reprinted this title. When I was a girl Gypsy had already hung up her G-string, but I loved Gypsy's talk show. My parents were slightly alarmed, but I found her amazing in a way I couldn't put words to at that age - brassy, ballsy, and uncowed I would say now. But I found this mystery very tough to get through. The writing left a lot to be deisred and unlike some other pulps it doesn't move along very well. Still I love that it's out there and it's historical/hystorical value makes it worth a look."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"Great book written with humor and flair by the one and only Gypsy Rose Lee!

Gypsy Rose Lee, author, stripper, and amateur detective is on the case, mostly to try to keep from being murdered herself. The cast of characters are also the cast of the theatre, as well as other employees, and they are quite the colorful bunch!

The mystery kept me guessing, even (especially?) with so many possible suspects!"},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"An interesting book written by an inexperienced but intelligent Gypsy Rose Lee. It' hard to follow the story line with all the characters she introduces at different times in the story. It's very choppy, seems to omit information necessary to understanding the flow of events and leaves the reader wanting much more character development. With that said, I did enjoy reading the book if only because it was the first novel from a legend."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"Originally written in 1941 this is about a murder at a burlesque house and a bunch of strippers involved with it. The police try to figure it out but Gypsy Rose Lee and the fellow strippers will ahve to figure it out themselves.Needlessly convoluted and pretty poorly written. What's frustrating is that this has some well-written passages and interesting characters but then it just gets confusing and/or dull. Lee was obviously no author. It is a somewhat interesting look back at burlesque houses (which are long gone) and the people who worked them but that can't support the sloppy writing and confusing narrative. This was considered pretty risque back in 1941 but todays it's tame and silly. Some people love this (look at the other reviews) but i found it pretty bad."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it."},{"Title":"The G-String Murders","review":"I had to take a look at this book just like I did Rachel Shteir's previous book \\"Striptease\\" to see if the online reviews were true. Sadly, they were. Like \\"Striptease\\", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter. Gypsy Rose, I guess we both made the same mistake: trusting someone like Ms. Shteit to help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to pull it off."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"I first became a Murdoch fanatic in my 20s, and would gobble up her books like Oreo cookies. At the time I was dazzled: nobody wrote like her, with precise descriptions of physical and psychological terrain alike. Nobody made me laugh with delight with descriptions that were comic without being mean spirited. (I'm hard pressed to find a writer as brilliant.) In the past, I recommended this book to others with rave reviews-all the while certain that I had a lock on what it &quot;meant.&quot; The characters alone are a hoot: You've got the Machivellian Julius, the sassy but silly Morgan, the calm but fuzzily ineffective Tallis. But there's also Rupert-whose writing a tome about philosophy and seeks to enlighten others. Add to that Simon, his gay brother, Hilda, Rupert's loving, slightly plump and aging wife. We don't really see her interior at all, and yet we know her, a droll, sweet and self-satisfied woman, and one who is about to face the shock of her life. The great characters and qualities that make ALL her books amazing are especially evident in this novel, with its sparkling wit, bold situations, and dryly humorous dialogue. Just to give you a taste, in one chapter, a character's clothing gets cut to shreds by an opponent,who leaves his foe literally naked and defenseless. Magically, this &quot;scene&quot; works and seems entirely believable. Few writers can pull that off. On a more serious note, &quot;A Fairly Honorable Defeat&quot; was always my favorite because of what it had to say about loving someone (e.g., truly noticing another and acting in their interest along with your own) vs. &quot;using&quot; them for whatever reason or out of whatever weakness. What it has to say beyond that, I'm not entirely sure. Not that a lack of knowing interferes with the pleasure of reading. Besides, Murdoch the story teller is saying something different than any of the pompous things that come out of the mouths of MOST of her characters. All I have to say is, in this one, don't underestimate Tallis. Happy reading."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Iris Murdoch's novels are addictive. Since a friend gave me a copy of \\"The Bell\\" a few months ago, I've read almost nothing but Murdoch--11 novels in all. In fact, I checked out six at one time from my university library so as soon as I finished one I could start on another. I've become a chain-reader. This one may be the best one so far. It's certainly the most chilling, if not the most riveting. It's a good place to start for the uninitiated because it's so incredibly engaging and entertaining, althougt not necessarily fun. All of the basic Murdoch elements are there--the complexity of love and life; the overwhelming essentialness of love to life; the frailties, faults, and follies of basically good people; the way the lives of good people can be wrecked by both their own carelessness and by intentional acts of evil; and despite all of this, an odd optimism that life is good and that all will be well. ... Julius is even more frightening, however, because you will recognize in him someone you know or have known. Although there are no monsters, ghosts, or serial killers, the book is as suspensful as any of the popular horror or crime novel that routinely makes the bestseller lists today. And no \\"romance\\" writer alive knows more about love and sex than Murdoch. I always finish Murdoch's books feeling unsettled but strangely satisfied and always awestruck by what she is able to do with plot, characters, ideas, and words. Put down your Stephen King, your John Grisham, or your Danielle Steel and pick up this book instead."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"The scene is London, c. 1970, set among a group of friends and family members in a fashionable London suburb. They are urbane, intelligent, intriguing people who have their share of quirks, obsessions, and blind spots. There's Rupert and Hilda, the blissfully happy married couple; Hilda's sister Morgan, a fun-loving academic undergoing a midlife crisis; her estranged husband Tallis, an eccentric caring for his dying father; Rupert's brother Simon, in a loving yet stifling relationship with a man named Axel; and Rupert and Hilda's son Peter, a delinquent, aimless college dropout. Although filled with concerns, their lives are basically stable until the appearance of Julius King, an old acquaintance who sets upon them with the goal of destroying their lives. He does this to prove a point: that human beings are inherently distrustful, inconstant, and easily manipulated. He further wishes to demonstrate that suspicion can be induced with the slighest, subtlest insinuations, and that people are perfectly prepared to believe ill-conceived rumors over reliable knowledge. In a remarkably brief time Julius unravels these people's lives and replaces their love and trust with cynicism and despair.Mudroch's novel suggests that certain people induce evil for pleasure, and further that the society we live in breeds such behavior. Unfortunately, she's probably right. Julius has great fun manipulating the puppets he plays with, that is, until they remember that they're not puppets but real people with their own consciousness and choice. As always, Murdoch's prose is expert and often gorgeous, her pacing measured, her characters fully realized and oddly plausible. At its beginning the novel reads like a late 60s sex comedy and seems light, almost giddy, compared to some of her other work. But she very gradually alters the novel's tone so that its true horror sneaks up on you. Murdoch spares no detail in conveying her characters' emotional deterioration, and it's more chilling, I think, than anything Stephen King ever devised. There's substantial hope at the novel's end, but getting there is a deeply unsettling process.Finally, this is a book about relationships, one of which happens to be gay. Murdoch doesn't make much fuss about Axel and Simon being men, although their homosexuality isn't trivialized, either. In giving them equal status with the novel's heterosexual couples Murdoch accords more dignity to gay men and their lives than do the authors of many gay-themed novels, which this really isn't. The result is heartening and inspiring.Very strongly recommended."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Brilliant! This novel has everything I look for in a truly great book: complex characters, deft plotting, luminous prose, and profound insight into the human condition. Iris Murdoch knew what it was to be human. She understood our aspirations and longings, our blind spots, our frailties, and our capacities for love and betrayal. She's the only writer I know of who can hold her reader's rapt attention throughout a novel in which the action consists almost entirely of dialogue between the various characters. (If you think that sounds boring, believe me, it's anything but!) In this age of high-speed internet, cable tv, and the unending pursuit of distraction, that's no small feat!I recommend this novel unreservedly. I started reading Iris Murdoch a couple of months ago and since then, have read no other fiction. This is the sixth of her novels I've read and my favorite to date. If, like me, you want fiction to illuminate the human condition and to give you more than an enjoyable way to pass a few hours, then give yourself to Murdoch. She's deepened my thought, sharpened my wit, and made me more compassionate, while holding me spellbound and fascinated at every turn."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Easily one of my favorite novels. I've never understood why this isn't ranked more highly: I suspect it's paradoxically because, with this book, Murdoch got as close as she ever got to realizing her mozartean desire to be profound and entertaining at the same time. As someone else said, below, this is about as accessible as she gets.But the themes are as universal as ever, and the questions of the value of honesty are questions I've returned to again and again. Amongst friends who have read this book, the characters and situations have become standard reference points, which is a rare thing.Julius alone should make this book compulsory reading. You will find yourself trying to deny him just as much as anyone in the book. And when he has the last say, it's chilling."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"After reading Iris Murdoch's A Fairly Honorable Defeat, I had the oddest sensation of imagining what my own life would look like in her hands. I find this story of two marriages, tinkered with by an enigmatic magician so absorbing that I just spent the entire weekend reading it. Does anyone know if Julius King is a personification? I am now reading Iris Murdoch's book The Fire and the Sun. I like the part where she says that Plato &quot;...was impressed by the way in which artists can produce what they cannot account for...&quot; Whenever I read one of her novels, I find myself going to the library to find out what she was talking about."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"If you've never read, Iris Murdoch, start here -- A Fairly Honourable Defeat is perhaps the most accessible of her more substantive novels. It's engaging, funny, deeply affecting, and provocative, with a plot that can be appreciated on many levels. No one need be daunted by the novel, and everyone will be entertained by this allegorical tale of the battle between good and evil."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Iris Murdoch is a master at creating the world for the reader.

These are wickedly Birtish characters each full developed and weaved together in a black comedy of human error and shortcomings. I was engrossed completely at every turn."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Iris Murdoch's novels cannot be fully appreciated nor savored in all of their richness without some awareness of her philosophical concerns.This is the story of Morgan, whose return to London after a love affair in America with the sinister, mysterious and seductive (in every sense of the word) \\"Julius,\\" brings her to the home of her sister Hilda and that sister's husband, Rupert. Their troubled son Peter makes an appearance; and Morgan also encounters her good but estranged husband, Tallis; and a lively circle of friends appears as well, including the gay couple Simon and Axel.But then Julius returns. His seemingly quiet entry into the lives of these flawed, but oh-so human people, wreaks disaster and tragedy.Dame Iris underscores and dramatizes her concern with the nature of evil as the expression of the human tendency to be seduced by the glamor of power and intelligence into abdicating simple and obvious duties of humanity. She illustrates her notion of love as a kind of powerful attention (or Kantian \\"Achtung\\") and an immersion in the reality of the moment and the Other; and goodness as the absence of selfish immersion in fantasy and escape or \\"muddle,\\" and involvement in \\"concern\\" (Heidegger) or \\"engagement\\" (Sartre) with the pain of others.This is a brilliant and wise book."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"This was my first experience with Iris Murdoch's fiction, and I was not prepared for the tragic ending, given a generally light and mannered tone that preceded it. Throughout the wonderfully inventive plot turns, I had no doubt that the rat Julius would receive his comeuppance in the end. Instead, the sad unraveling of so many decent characters forced me to re-evaluate the meaning of the whole exercise. I thought I was reading George Bernard Shaw and ended up with Ibsen instead.Despite this incongruity, &quot;Defeat&quot; was a highly engaging story, with memorable characters and lots of moral and philosophical ideas. It would make an excellent stage play, and was so dialogue-driven it would hardly require adaptation.Murdoch is a gifted writer, and I'll eagerly read her again, but not with the same innocence I brought to this one."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"This is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read.

Murdoch is insanely humorous yet disturbingly dark in putting to doubt the comfortable belief in a lifelong commitment, like in marriage. It takes a while at the start for the story to heat up, but once it takes off the book proves to be hard to put down. One hopes the cunning and deceitful Julius King is purely fictional, but a nagging touch with reality shows otherwise. Can there be a lifelong commitment?

Highly recommended and very readable."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Here Murdoch explores the complications that arise from the assumption that we are the heroes or heroines of our own life-dramas rather than part of a larger drama in which we are merely walk-on extras. A play within a play within a play is represented: Morgan dresses up as a girl dressed up as a boy, trapped in Julius's flat. Simon and Julius eavesdrop in a manner reminiscent of Jacobean revenge drama. Comic misunderstandings proliferate.This book makes us think about how all our life -emotions, beliefs, obsessions..- is only a byproduct Language, or the lack of it. Isn't love really a result of Communication; and isnt Hate the result of inability to communicate? Can a witty nihilistic Teaser wreck the lives of innocent people just by dismantling their emotions verbally?Most often, our difficulties to discern what we want from life are really just language problems, a tragic lack of skill that results in the impossibility to master knowledge about our actions and their consequences.The reader is left with a vision, both tragic and comic, of what happens when we try to fit other people into preordained roles our own dramas. Only those who try to communicate openly are redeemed from the dishonour of contemporary life. As Murdoch suggests, the only true defeat is being deceived by words."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Iris Murdoch (1919-199) wore two hats: she was an Oxford don who taught philosophy writing on that recondite subject as well as winning plaudits and fame as a bestselling novelist. \\"A Fairly Honorable Defeat\\", while not one of her best known novels, still provides a rich reading experience. The novel is written for mature adults and its themes of love in many incarnations (sexual, parental, homosexual) will keep readers flipping through all 412 small printed pages.Murdoch is known for liming complex human beings. Included in her large cast are:Julian Knight-A concentration camp survivor who carries on an affair with Morgan.Morgan-She is wed to Tallis but is unfaithful to him. During the course of the novel this mantrap has romantic feelings for Rupert; his son Peter; and the puppet master extraordinaire Julian King (she had an abortion of his child while living with him in the United States.Rupert and his wife Hilda.

He is a sympathetic character.Simon and Alex. Simon is the homosexual brother of Rupert and the lover of Alex who works in British government.A surprise tragedy ends the book. The plot reads like an intellectual soap opera. Some will not find the \\"bang\\" worth the buck of reading this long book. For other readers it is the journey that makes Murdoch's works worthwhile. She is good at:a. Exploring the inner thoughts and motivations of her characters.b. Using symbols-e.g. the dead hedgehog in the pool which is a foreshadowing of a major character's death in tha same pool.c. Excellent setting of scenes and a poetic use of language in painting her character's personalities.d. An ability to draw the innerconnection of her characters lives. Some readers will have trouble and grow irritated by the many plots and characters one is asked to keep straight. Murdoch is not an easy read!The book's most important character is Julian King who plays tricks on the characters through the use of switching letters. He is a manipulator and a monster.Murdoch works among the elevated milieu of well to do intellectuals. This material is rarefied and will not appeal to many readers. Those who enjoy her novels will like this well done effort."},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Of course Iris meant it to be bitter and nasty, a satire on upper middle class life and love in London in the 70's. I found most of the characters rang hollow. And Tallis' squalor and his annoying father seemed artificial and overdone. Having said that it was an interesting read. Not one of her better novels. Dare I mention that it does not compare favorably with some of the better Muriel Spark novels?"},{"Title":"A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)","review":"Murdoch is good at using a conventional structure of narrative to explore pressing dilemmas. She does this very well in this novel, but more than in some of her other novels you are more conscious in A Fairly Honourable Defeat of being drawn along a philosophical argument. The characters are lively and entertaining. You will really enjoy the story and it will provoke you to think about the ways in which we view relationships. But you will probably also become conscious that you must sympathise with the monster and mistrust the faithful hero. I felt at times a need to forget, but the way in which the narrative is structured you are not really allowed to do this. Unfortunately, this characteristic of narrative doesn't function in the same way as it does in Angela Carter's fiction. A main conclusion you draw from reading this novel is that if commitment is something that is fixed it is already lost. It is a lesson that is tragically learned in this novel."},{"Title":"Investing in Miracles: El Shaddai and the Transformation of Popular Catholicism in the Philippines","review":"I loved this book. It was written with sensitivity, thoughtfulness, and openness.I learned so much about the poverty in the Philippines, about this nutty religious revolution [el shaddai] that gets poor people to give their money to a modern day Elmer Gantry who is laughing all the way to the bank. I also learned a lot about beliefs in demons, devils, angels, etc.. What a bunch of nonsense. Of course the author tries her best to be nonjudgemental, to paint a fair portrait of this religious culture with respect and interest. She shows that this religious movement isn't all bad; it does seem to give people hope. But is is false hope, of course. The book ends with a dramatic climax as the author witnesses an El Shaddai leader abuse and berate a woman -- blaming her for all the troubles in her life.This book was top-notch cultural anthropology. It was very well written, very intellectually-satisfying, and really painted a moving portrait of these poor people who are so desparate that they will give their last pesos to \\"God\\" in hopes of a few breaks in life."},{"Title":"Investing in Miracles: El Shaddai and the Transformation of Popular Catholicism in the Philippines","review":"Ive required this in class and students respond well to it.

In this book you'll find recipes that come from Japanese, Indonesian, Indian and Thai roots as well as American eclectic innovations. The author has included main dish, soup and dessert recipes.I'm not a vegetarian, but have been pleasantly surprised at how satisfying the dishes are. I never thought that vegetarian dishes could be so good. Rice is, of course, the common thread that ties all of the collected recipes together and the author has devoted the first chapter of the book to educating the reader about the different types of rice and how to prepare rice in a foolproof manner.What I loved about the book is the way I changed my eating habits by getting hooked on the simplicity of the one-dish meals contained within, the flavors of the dishes (incredible) and the way I felt after eating (full, but not stuffed = more energetic).This is my current favorite cookbook."},{"Title":"Rice and Spice","review":"I think I have every one of Robin's books, except the Apocalypse Chow one.

The texture of the pages, the uneven edges, the old world style type--made me feel that I was opening a treasure of sorts. It was like I was opening an old scroll of secrets yet untold. My impressions were correct. Credo is definitely a treasure.The Apostles Creed is the oldest and most widely accepted creed within the Christian faith and Credo sets out to explain it like no other book has ever done. Not only does it tackle why the Apostles Creed matters, but it also breaks it down point by point. Pritchard even goes so far as to show why we should believe the creed and what it means to our lives. I was not only drawn to his arguments, I found myself nodding my head constantly in agreement.Each section ends with questions that can be used to further study the creed individually or as a group. I honestly think this book would be great for churches to use to study the creed and why it is important to our faith. Those new to the faith and those that have been Christians all of their lives will enjoy this book. It made me look at the creed in a whole new light. It isn't just something I say at the end of service anymore. It is a statement of my belief in God, in my salvation through Christ, his resurrection, the Holy Spirit, the forgiveness of sins, and so much more. I agree with Pritchard that some things are not negotiable and you must believe in certain things to actually be a Christian. Our faith is founded on truth and it means something to believe in the tenets of Christianity. The creed reminds us of that.I highly recommend this book and will consider it required reading for my children as they grow in their faith. As Christians, we believe in something worth dying for and Christ is the cornerstone of everything we believe. Credo expresses that in a fundamental and powerful way."},{"Title":"Credo: Believing in Something to Die For","review":"As Christians, what do we believe? If we can begin to articulate our beliefs, do they have any impact in our lives? In Credo, author Ray Pritchard looks to the Apostles Creed as an exceptional answer to these questions. He gives three reasons we should to this creed: \\"First, it is the oldest and most widely accepted... Second, it offers a broad survey of Christian doctrine... Third, the Creed offers a radical challenge to the skepticism of this generation.\\" (17)After introducing the Creed, each chapter examines it line-by-line, resulting in 19 chapters ranging from 7 to 13 pages each. Each chapter explains what is meant in each line, ways we can understand it, and what it means for our lives. The importance of practical application is made apparent throughout the book. \\"This is more than a doctrinal statement. It's a declaration of your personal commitment to what the Creed says... The world will not be moved by a halfhearted commitment to things we don't really believe.\\" (207-8)Ray Pritchard does an excellent job explaining what's at stake in each part of the Creed. For example, in discussing the virgin birth, he explains that \\"in order for Christ to be our Savior, three conditions had to be met: He must be a man... He must be an infinite man... He must be an innocent man.\\" (63) He doesn't shy away from the most controversial part of the Creed- the idea that Jesus descended into hell. Instead, he thoughtfully describes what it cannot mean, what it might mean, and what it must mean.Not only is each doctrine thoughtfully addressed, but application is made by asking what difference they make for us. In covering the practical issues as well, Ray Pritchard does a great job making the Apostles Creed come alive, which is necessary in a Christian culture that's forgetting its roots. Credo recommits these ancient truths to our hearts and minds in a meaningful and accessible style."},{"Title":"Credo: Believing in Something to Die For","review":"I would recommend this book for study, teaching or as preaching resource. It opens the door for going beyond the pages and finding passion about words that can become rote."},{"Title":"Personality Judgment: A Realistic Approach to Person Perception","review":"By the mid 1980s in social and cogntive psychology, the idea that people were generally quite good at accurately reading other people's personalities, and figuring out the causes for each other's behavior, lay in tatters. A great deal of research on errors and biases (by folk like Nisbett and Tversky) apparently revealed that ordinary human cogntion was beset by a huge range of invidious social judgment biases including the underutilization of base rates, the fundamental attribution error, belief perseverance, overconfidence in social judgement, and sheer statistical incompetence, to name but a few.One of the most influential figures in psychology in correcting this bleak view of human social cognition is David Funder. His sustained theoretical and research program has shown that people are frequently surprisingly accurate in their personality readings. More tellingly, he has ducumented many of the conditions under which people can be expected to produce accurate attributions, and when they are are likely to go wrong. In the process, he has also produced some critical theoretical advances in explaining how personality attribution works in the real world.Funder's new book provides a concise summary of his work and theory. It is beautifully written, in a breezy and lively fashion (rare features in academic treatises). It is also provocative and erudite. Well worth a read for any student of human nature."},{"Title":"Over The Teacups","review":"Love it....Love it!

The detailed appendix focusing on Dickinson and Pulication, notes, works cited and an index of poesm are all helpful.But the gist of this book is in its contention that Dicksinson was NOT exclusively a post-modernist poet. She combines literary history, contemporary feminisit literary theory and more to make her points. Intriguing!"},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"Saw it on the bookshelf, grabbed it to buy it for my son who really liked the movie, opened it, returned it to the shelf. You don't buy a book like that for the story -- you buy it for the story and the pictures -- it's a book for younger children after all -- and you hope that the pictures will bring back the fond memories of seeing the story on big screen. But this book is so modestly illustrated that it seems totally unrelated to the film. Even the characters look different. All excitement and all that underwater magic are gone. 'Toy Story' -- from the same series of Disney books -- is illustrated much better."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"Received this book as a gift for our 4-year old son. He hasn't seen the movie (maybe that makes a difference?), but he loves the pictures and the character. Our friend thought she was buying a quality product from Disney, and so did we, until we tried to read it. I am so disappointed! The movie may be better, but this book gives the impression that a couple of people spent half a weekend pasting together a few shots from the movie, then wrote a little descriptive text and called it a day. There are 2 major faults: 1) several scenes from the movie were obviously just described in the book. They make no sense within the plot, they are literally BORING, though the animated scene may have been appropriate. They are too short to build up any sort of suspense, climax, etc.. An example is the jellyfish scene. 2) The story jumps around, from scene to scene. This distracts and confuses my 4-year old, who is used to logical sequences, a beginning, middle and end in his other books. Sorry, Disney, this book is a loser..."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"Big disappointment. The illustrations are very poor. Nothing like the computer animated graphics in the movie. The characters look like the impressionists version of those in the movie. Bruce the shark is practically unrecognizable, neither is Nemo or Dory. The story is ok, too complicated for a younger child to follow."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"I am glad we got this book from a library because now we can give it back. It doesn't make sense. I think they assume that anyone reading the book has seen the movie and can fill in the blanks. But something called a storybook should have a full story.It starts with a mommy and daddy fish running into a barracuda. On the next page there is only a daddy fish. Obviously, we are supposed to infer that the mommy has been eaten. I guess they thought that saying so would traumatize preschoolers, but you cannot imply things to a preschooler, they won't get it. My four-year-old had no idea what happened. \\"Where's the mommy fish? Why doesn't it say what happened to the mommy fish?\\"It skips back and forth and changes scenes a lot. I have not seen the movie, but I can only guess that they are trying to include references to the best parts, possibly the musical numbers, more than they are trying to follow the plot. Also, the daddy fish is later attacked by sharks then the sharks show up at the end like they're all pals and I have no idea what happened there."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"If you're looking for an exact copy of the film, this book is not for you. If you're interested in a folk-art/classic Golden book inspired piece of art this book is definitely for you. Contrary to what a couple of reviewers refer to as substandard illustrations, this book was illustrated by an experienced artist with a great understanding of animation and it saddens me that the Disney company does not give the artist the credit he or she deserves. Like most Disney books, the credit goes to the Disney company not the individual that did the work. My two-year old daughter absolutely loves the movie and she equally enjoys this book. Sure, its a quick read, but we usually read through it a few times in each sitting before we move onto another book. The only complaint I have about this book is it's length. I really would have liked more pages to flip through... just for the artwork.If you want an exact copy of the film, watch the film. Don't look for it in a book. If you want a simple book to read to your young one and appreciate a nicely illustrated book, give this one a chance. It deserves it."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: A Read-Aloud Storybook","review":"My 4 year old granddaughter loves looking at this book since she really likes the movie."},{"Title":"Representative men: Seven lectures","review":"this is one of my favorite Emerson works. It opens itself up to so much, talking about his theories of influence, precursing everything from queer theory and gender transitivity to Harold Bloom, and it is a poem, too. It's beautiful. It offers his thoughts on the most diverse materials, gets into the most detail on his Hindu readings, gets very brave in \\"Swedenborg.\\" But ... for a 165-page book? Delbanco's intro is boring and useless. Don't even READ it before you read the book. It'll be like watching an educational video on yeast infections before watching a porno. The index is a kind of neat feature; it's cool to see how many men are mentioned how many times. For example, the most obvious 'omission' in the book, JESUS, is mentioned only 5 times in the book, but he lurks throughout in so many ways. I love the book, but think the edition is a huge ripoff. However, it is difficult to find all these essays in one volume without buying a \\"complete works\\" or something, and they are ALL good and work together as a complete 'book,' one essay building off the prior in subject and time, going from B.C. to the nineteenth century, from Plato to Napoleon and Goethe."},{"Title":"Representative men: Seven lectures","review":"Great men are those who inspire new great men into being. So Emerson understood in his seven portraits of human greatness. The poet Shakespeare and the philosopher Plato, the skeptic Montaigne and the mystic Swedenborg,the man of the world Napoleon and the writer Goethe.Of great men he said,\\"Nature seems to exist for the excellent. The world is upheld by the veracity of good men: they make the earth wholesome. They who lived with them found life glad and nutritious..... We call our children and our lands by their names. Their names are wrought into the verbs of language, their works and effigies are in our houses, and every circumstance of the day recalls an anecdote of them.\\"It is interesting that of Emerson's great men two would certainly be in question today. Swedenborg does not have the followers in our day that he had in Emerson's. Napoleon today can be considered in these terms only if we are also willing to discuss the horrible aspect of conqueror- great- men and the millions of dead that come with the conquests.Emerson a sublime argument for his conception of ' the great man', of the unique character who makes a gift to Mankind no one else has or can ."},{"Title":"Tough mercy: Lost in despair, we found ourselves at the orphanage","review":"This author spent several years of his childhood in an American orphanage, and describes his experiences there in detail.

I really enjoyed the writing style as well as the pictures and history of the authors journey from orphanage to becoming a Doctor."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Kings","review":"Like all of Wells' work, which I have read all but one of, the story is written with simple characters. None of Wells characters seems to grow much, and they make major decisions at the drop of a hat. Characters fall in love without actually having spoken to one another, and the romance is usually non-existant.The story was an intersting enough tale, that could have been helped with more character dialogue. Another 50-100 pages might have made the story truly good.I give the story 3 stars, based on the fact that the concept was good, but the character development and interplay was poor. As with most of Wells's work, it is more suited to a Junior High or early High School student than an adult.If you like strong character development and dialogue...skip this book. If you like a basic tale without too much of the above, then by all means, read it. Personally, I need more to really enjoy a book."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Kings","review":"Yesterday's Kings is the story of two races: the Kandarians and the Durrym. The Durrym were forced out of their ancestral lands by the iron-bearing Kandarians so there is little love lost between the two peoples. The Durrym made a new home for themselves across the river, which they use as a barrier to keep the Kandarians out. There they shape nature with their magic and are involved in their own petty clan disputes. Little do they know that the Kandarians are looking at their border with greedy eyes. The Kandarians are running out of room for their people and the church has found a way to cross the barrier to the Durrym world.Cullyn is a simple woodsman whose greatest desire is to buy himself a fine horse. He lives in the forest in harmony alone and does not really understand the village people. When Lofantyl, a Durrym, befriends him, Cullyn begins to see the Durrym as people instead of traditional enemies. Lofantyl falls in love with Adris, Lord Bartram's daughter (a border lord who keeps the Durrym out of Kandaria). He risks everything to visit her in the keep and is captured. Lofantyl's kinsmen come and rescue him and kidnap Adris. She is in love with Lofantyl, but not sure if she can be happy among the Durrym. Lofantyl's father, Isydrian, doesn't like Kandarians, but he is hoping that the Kandarians will attack so that he can send them to his enemies and take over their land.Meanwhile, back in the forest, the priest Per Fendur has found out that Cullyn was friends with Lofantyl and intends to torture information out of him. Cullyn escapes with Laurens, a guardsmen, and seeks out the help of Eben, a half-Durrym, half-Kandarian wizard. They escape over to Durrym land, where they fall into the hands of Isydrian's enemies. There Cullyn falls madly in love with the lord's daughter and becomes champion for a battle of arms to win the lord's daughter and to somehow make peace between all of the warring factions.It was a little frustrating to read this book, because it had so much potential to be much more than it was. In many ways, this is the classic tale of Britain and the fey folk who lived there before men with iron chased them out. Except here, the fey folk simply relocated and are still a force to be reckoned with. The plot was fast paced and kept the reader interested, but there was little or no character development, which was disappointing. Cullyn and Lofantyl fall in love literally at first sight and are willing to go to any means to be with the woman they want to wed. Cullyn, as the main character of the story, was the least developed ironically. He goes from being a simple forester who has never even held a sword to a champion in Durrym where he jousts and swordfights with a battle trained Durrym. This is weakly explained as his being the syn'qui or someone whom fate revolves around. Also, it would have been nice to get a little more information on the different cultures and how magic differed between them as it grew to be important to the story, but was never really explained.This book will be enjoyed by new, younger readers of fantasy and those looking for a quick, easy read in between longer, more detailed fantasy epics."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Kings","review":"Many years ago, people crossed the sea and using steel armor and swords to defeat the indigenous population, the Fey. Forced to retreat, the Fey also known as the Durryn, crossed the Algador River and set up a magical shield to keep the Kandorians away from them.Centuries pass and the Kandorians vastly multiply needing new land. The current King and the Church unite to find a means to penetrate the Durryn barrier.Cullyn lives in the forest, wanting nothing to do with the Kandorians and their ever-expansive requirements. He refuses to sound an alarm when he meets and befriends Lafantyl, the son of a Durryn Lord. Cullyn allows Lafantyl to use his home as a place to rendezvous with a border lord's daughter. When the Kandorians discover the trio's activities, they move forward expecting manifest destiny to enable their latest expansion.The Angus Wells realm is similar to that of medieval England and France except that in his world the Fey is a force and not just mythical legends. Cullyn who enjoys his simple, back to nature existence becomes the catalyst of events between the Kandorians and the Durryn thus, providing readers with a hero for those who enjoy Beowulf, the Hobbit tales and similar high fantasy novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wages of Sin","review":"I must urge regular readers of Matt Braun to be wary when approaching this novel .Originally published under the pen name of Tom Lord in the mid 1980's it is what is euphemistically and erroneouly referred to as an \\"adult Western \\"which is to see it features copious amounts of anatomically explicit sexual couplings and is a great deal more graphic than the average Braun novelIt is part of a series featuring Pinkerton agent \\"Ash Tallman \\"and there are parallels between him and an earlier Braun hero \\"Starbuck -both are essentially spies at work in the West tracking down the bad guys .Tallman works with a female partner ,Vivien Valentine \\"who shares Tallman's bed as well as being his professional partnerThe setting is Texas in the Reconstruction era.

I didn't want the story to end. The story of Father Damian Modeste/Agnes was brilliant and the characters throughout the book very vivid. I will read all she has written."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"This book starts off really promising, interesting and off-beat. But half way into the story it looses its zest. Too many complicated characters that are not fully explored show up. Too many story lines and issues that never get addressed fully. The last part of the book becomes quite boring and disoriented. It is a great story but I think the author was too ambituous in its scope and therefore ended up with many half-told stories. The only story that comes to somewhat of a closure was that of Agens/Father Damien. The rest of the characters remain in limbo. It was a dissappointing read after such a great start. I had a hard time keeping up the interest to finish it up."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"&quot;The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse&quot; is Erdrich at her best. While I find all her works amusing and entertaining, works to be savored and not just read, Little No Horse pulls together the best elements of her talent. There is passion, death, humor (both subtle and blatant), excellent characterization, and a plot that is tightly bound from beginning to end while loosely juggled between various character points of view. Her characters, whether central or peripheral, are believeable, understandable, and in some ways ordinary while carving out a niche in the extraordinary or mysterious. There are wonderful tales within the larger story. Tales that are crafted well in themselves but always work towards enlightening the pathway of plot or character development. The book begins where &quot;Tales of Burning Love&quot; left off, but quickly moves back to 1912 so that those with little or no experience in Erdrich's novels need not worry about being left out. &quot;Little No Horse&quot; is both prequel and sequel. Entertaining on a surface level, but it also brings to light many issues worthy of reflecting on long after you are done reading. A true work of art."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I'm going to have to reread the six novels that lead up to one. If Louise Erdrich never writes another novel about the folks in and around this fictional reservation she would have given us one huge and marvelous tale, encompassing the lives of characters who not only become the people we feel we've known (or, at least, wish we had known) but people who we feel have become our teachers: ones who teach us to see what is important; teach us to see grace and providence when things become irreversibly fouled up.&quot;Little No Horse&quot; is a strange place. I won't go into too many details, but it is a place where women over age seventy still have enough sex appeal to make men obsess (sexy enough to make priests want give up the call) -- reminiscent of the women of the Old Testament, particularly Genesis.In &quot;The Last Report At Little No Horse&quot; Louise Erdrich wrote less of the first person narratives -- which seemed to dominated the first six novels of this series -- telling the story predominately in the third person (my own opinion is telling a story from a third person perspective is much more difficult to do right). You need only open any page in this book to discover the work of a master wordsmith. Beautiful."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Although I have long been an Erdrich fan, I have to say that this book stands alone as one of the most beautifully written novels I have read in a long time. From a bear baptism to an ugly Virgin Mary to a death by flatulence, this book is alternately funny and poignant.Louis Erdrich continues her tradition of intelligent, respectful and captivating writing with this book. Rather than elaborate on the specifics of characters and background in this novel, I will just say that this book gave me an overall sense of a writer who has found peace and come to appreciate life's joys."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I have enjoyed this author since her first book, Love Medicine. That said, I think The Last Report on the Miracles of Little No Horse is one of the best stories in the realm of storydom - an engaging novel about commitment and love. I did not want it to end.We learn in the first pages that Father Damien is a female once called Agnes. Agnes/Father Damien has a passionate life ride and the good fortune to befriend and be friended by many wonderful characters. All of Agnes' loves are intriguing and inform her choices. These include the music of Chopin and a drowned piano. Agnes' respect for the Ojibwe people influences Father Damien's belief that the Four Directions are as sacred as the Trinity and must be incorporated into all blessings.My favorite character, the trickster genius, Nanapush, teaches Father Damien how to survive in practical ways, as in how to make snow shoes and how to unnerve an opponent in a game of chess. Father Damien is generously helped by Nanapush to regain his commitment to the living world in a sacred Ojibwe sweat lodge ceremony. Their discussions about the concept of the Catholic Devil, as opposed to the Ojibwe devils ( some good, some bad), the Ojibwe concept of \\"not time,\\" and that even a pair of old pants can harbor spirit are wonderful passages to read and read again. Nanapush introduces the Father to a spirituality of wit and compassion and bone deep wisdom that causes his Agnes self to hope in her last breathing moments that she might bypass the devil she fears has conscripted her soul and even bypass the Catholic heaven for the Ojibwe version of the after life that she has learned to prefer as the most hopeful final option.The character most will loathe, Sister Leopolda, the Puyat, is the best literary example of spiritual materialism I have had the good fortune to discover. Save us all from the Leopolda's of this world! And save us all from becoming her!! Let us hope that the canonized saints will not have to recognize her as one of their hierarchy and then be forced to reconsider their own worthiness!!! Leopolda is the product of terrible abuse. Her treacherous nature, however justified, is a great challenge to the harmony Father Damien so valiently strives to maintain. Their encounters are also passages to savor and return to. When Leopolda wants to repent, beware.The irony of confusing material wealth and power over others - or even painting one's nails with a laquer called \\"Happiness\\" - in hopes of achieving perfect happiness permeates the novel. Ribald humor and miraculous serendipty are artfully balanced with sobering and historically true natural disasters and crimes of human disregard for our first people and the land. Above all, this is a joyous tale of one tormented soul's journey to beatitude.Thank you Ms. Erdrich."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I had a lot of varying reactions to this book, but in the end I'd say it's worth a read with a big caveat that you'll need to get through what I found to be a pretty uninteresting and eventually inconsequential beginning. The book follows former nun Agnes as she transforms herself into the deceased (though no one but her is aware of it) Father Damien, newly installed priest at the reservation of the title. The story moves back and forth in time between the start of her transformation and the near-end of it as Damien is being questioned by another priest with regard to possible sainthood for a reservation women. The story also slips aside to offer many digressions and stories within stories involving other characters and the history of the reservation people. The wealth of characters and shifts in time make this a relatively complex read and I 'd recommend reading it in as few sittings as possible so as to remember who is whom and when and where. For those who may find it difficult to read quickly, there is a helpful genealogical chart inside the front cover (or at least, there was in my edition).While the Agnes/Damien character needs to be set up for us and motivation created for her to take on the role she does, I found this opening section (about 60-70 pages) relatively uninteresting and at times overwrought in its writing (in particular its description of music and sex). I usually give a book 40-50 pages before considering giving it up, and had this not been a book for my wife's book club (we like to co-read and discuss) I'm not sure I would have continued. I'm glad I did, but the story really didn't hold any interest for me until Father Damien appeared on the reservation, and even then it didn't really get compelling until about halfway through. From that point on it steadily strengthened and the last (well, almost last) sections I found utterly beautiful.Father Damien becomes more and more interesting, more and more human, more and more compelling a character as the story moves on. Several other characters are equally strong--natives Nanapush and Mary, young Lulu, an apprentice priest--but others are too vaguely drawn in relation to their importance to the story; it would have made for a stronger book to have had them drawn a bit more fully.Stylistically, the book has many beautifully evocative passages, but just as many overwritten passages where the prose goes over the top. Luckily, the best writing comes at the end, drowning out some of the memory of the bad.There is a nice tight thematic structure to the book I thought, centering around religion and love and sin and obligation, with nearly all the stories, main and side, touching upon those subjects.While the structure is complex, with its shift in focus and character and time, it isn't overly so and not all that difficult to follow. Though many of the digressions were entertaining and also thematically connected, a few of them seemed out of place in tone and style, almost as if she had a few extra short stories lying around and decided to toss them in. Part of my negative reaction to them may be due to the fact that I have not read Erdich before, and it seems these characters are well known to fans of hers. Perhaps they enjoyed seeing more of them, but I could have done with less.Overall, the book has some major weaknesses: a very slow quarter and only somewhat better second quarter, some over the top language and metaphor, an unnecessary endnote section (I'd prefer the book ending two chapters earlier), a relatively uninteresting \\"hanging question\\" (will the woman be sainted or not, who murdered one of the reservation people years ago). But in the end, the character of Father Damien and Erdich's penultimate section filled with beautiful language and thought redeems the book. Recommended with caveat, and if you find yourself putting it down early, try skipping ahead and trying again."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"The sacred and the profane. Faith and eroticism. Earth-drying sunlight and earth-rending flood. Night and day. Heaven and Hell ... could any of them exist without their opposite?In her new novel, \\"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse,\\" Louise Erdrich weaves the intricate and the uncomplicated into a story that is, by turns, extraordinarily tangled and beautifully concrete. Opposites dependent upon one another.Maybe it's because Erdrich writes in sacred circles. Families, generations, places, events and individual characters swirl among her various novels. The Turtle Mountain-Pembina Reservation, which sprawls across the Red River halfway into North Dakota -- the setting for \\"Love Medicine,\\" \\"Tales of Burning Love\\" and other Erdrich tales -- is again the crucible where Erdrich re-mixes the lives of the Nanapush, Kashpaw, Morrissey, Mauser, Pillager, Lamartine and Lazarre families. In her work, you'll recognize Faulknerian rhythms: a northern plains Yoknapatawpha where the Sartorises, Snopeses and Compsons are known by Ojibwe names, where voices shift like sand.In circles where the literary air is more rarefied, Erdrich's juxtaposition of disparate concepts might be called *Manichean* -- relating to an ancient spiritual belief that life is governed by an endless battle between equally potent forces of good and evil, neither of which can ever annihilate the other. That's one way to look at it. But while her writing invites a number of interpretive methods and philosophies, it is Spartan and simply human, more Cather than Faulkner. In environs where landscape is less influential to life, readers might see only Manichean metaphors in rivers, forests and blizzards; in the West, it's just the way things are -- starkly contrasted depending on the time of day, the angle of sight, or the weather. The place that is good by day might be evil by dark. It is not just the stuff of Erdrich's writing, but her life, too.The pivotal event in \\"The Last Report\\" is a Dakota flood that not only sweeps Agnes away on the lid of a piano, but also represents her spiritual evolution -- her ordination, if you will -- into Father Damien. A heaven-sent event, delivered by the Muse of Metaphor into the fervid imagination of a writer in need of a symbol? In fact, it is a scene inspired by the 1997 flood on North Dakota's Red River. It is certainly an apt spiritual metaphor, but it is also a simple account of how fortunes are so swift to change in the Western landscape. Pick your poison, dear reader: Mysticism or reality. They both work.The part-Ojibwe Erdrich, like indigenous writers Sherman Alexie and Leslie Marmon Silko, deftly blends mysticism and dark humor in a complex, compassionate amalgam that, when burnished, not only reflects the Indian experience, but human existence in any color, at any moment in time."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I loved this book! My favorite of Erdrich's books is Antelope Wife, but &quot;The Last Report...&quot; ties for second with &quot;Bingo Palace.&quot; I would say Last Report is one of her finest works. Great character development, depth, insight, and many doses of humor. Much of the humor in this book seems to be directed at the ways in which people interpret and understand Catholicism, but it also can be seen as an extention of how people understand their own circumstances and make meaning of them. A definite must read. Sort of felt a little like reading the John Powers books (Last Catholic in America, etc.) plus all that we have come to love and respect from Ms. Erdrich."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"N A ONCE INNOCUOUS river, during the 1997 North Dakota flood, helpers rescued a woman in a billowing white nightgown floating by on the lid of a piano. Fascinated by this aquarelle image, author Goldberry M. Long wrote of a distressed heroine, Agnes, climbing on top of her piano and floating away to a new life.Further inspired by the image, the author, Louise Erdrich, started work on this intriguing and beguiling new novel, written during the flood. Louise Erdrich is of both Ojibwe and German-American heritage. This unusual duality surfaces frequently in her creative writings, as with Father Damion Modeste (a modest devil?) a near 100 year-old character in her story. Writer Erdrich states in an interview, &#65533;Modeste&#65533;s character begs the question, Are the personae we deliver to the world intrinsic to us or assumed by us?&#65533;Father Modeste&#65533;s faces a dilemma; the Vatican wants to enquire into the background of Sister Leopolda, a candidate for sainthood. Only Damion knows of her ability to perform miracles, yet remaining capable of evil. For years he wrote directly to the Pope concerning his parish and included details of the miracles occurring at Little No Horse.However, he withheld essential facts until his last report. It reveals the unusual situation concerning Sister Leopolda and thundering facts concerning himself.Characters from Erdrich&#65533;s previous works feature in the book. Gerry Nanapush appears in an uproarious sequence involving a mousy moose.In addition to its sizzling plots and powerful set pieces, we learn much from this book about Turtle Mountain Ojibwe culture. Its roots appear in ancient Manichaeism, a religious dissension that built on Christianity and tried to make its practice universal. It died out around the 5th century but revived in the 20th when its ancient scriptures resurfaced in Turkestan and Egypt.Erdrich&#65533;s style makes for great extracts, several from this book appeared in The New Yorker"},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Louise Erdrich creates a fascinating tapestry in her novel The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse. The characters are slowly woven in and out of the story until an intricate work of beauty has been created. This is a story of a search for hope and faith that begins in an unusual manner. It begins with Father Damien writing for answers from Rome as he has for many decades. It is revealed that Father Damien is not who many believe him to be, but the question remains, is Father Damien the person that God needed Father Damien to be. The tale then steps back into how Father Damien arrives at Little No Horse, where many people enter into the tale. When Father Jude, arrives to investigate whether Sister Leopolda, a nun at the convent in Little No Horse, really deserves consideration for Sainthood the past is unwrapped layer by layer.The questions of faith, suffering and sacrifice are examined, when does one supercede the other to elevate each to a higher level of love and true caring.The story started out very slowly but, halfway through this novel, each page became a gem and when the story had ended it was a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Another reviewer has likened the Erdrich oeuvre to one vast novel. The epic in this portion spans most of the 20th century with the Anishinaabeg &amp; chimookomanag on the fictional Little No Horse Reservation in North Dakota.

Not as laugh-out-loud funny as \\"Bingo Palace,\\" \\"Last Report\\" does have its moments: death by fertile Red River farm mud; the jesting wars of NoDo Catholics v. Lutherans: after going somewhat daft at the loss of her companion and being seen naked by neighboring farm children whilst feeding the chickens: \\"That episode with the chickens made the gossip table rounds. People put it off to Berndt's death and an unstringing of her nerves. Still, she lost only a Lutheran (piano) student or two. She continued playing the organ for Mass ...; \\" and how, through a series of misadventures along the processional route of the Feast of the Virgin , the statue of the Blessed Virgin comes flying \\"into the house of seven of the most notorious drunks in Little No Horse, who lay groaning at that very moment for whiskey. ...

Through Damien's own writing and a variety of different perspectives, Louise Erdrich tells the story of a most unusual priest. The story develops in disjointed recollections and anecdotes that are sometimes difficult to piece together. Gradually, Father Damien and his congregation on the reservation of Little No Horse come vividly to life. This book has complex, quirky characters, tremendous humor and great tragedy.

The character of Father Damien Modeste is well developed. Found the transition from a nun named Sister Cecelia to Agnes, the live-in common law wife, to Father Damien Modeste fascinating. As she develops her persona as a priest one can't help but smile or chuckle out loud. While she operates as a priest she doesn't fool many of the tribal people who get to know her/him well.Father Damien takes his role as priest at the reservation seriously. As he gets to know individuals in the tribe he makes many friends. Nevertheless, his mistakes haunt his dreams. He writes to the Pope letter after letter seeking advice and/or forgiveness. No answers arrive. Still he continues, year after year.There are many humorous episodes in this book. My favorite, the one with the moose who drags the aging Nanapush in a boat around the reservation, makes for much laughter. Erdrich's descriptions of that incident had me picturing the entire episode. And, when Nanapush comes to life not once but twice at his wake I laughed again.When the aging Father Damien has a visitor to ascertain whether an Indian woman is due for sainthood he is puzzled why the Pope sent such a low level ambassador. As he visits with Farther Jude, Modeste finds himself reliving parts of his life. Especially poignant for him was the time spent with Father Gregory Wekkle to whom she was attracted physically. They fell in love and spent their evenings making love while during the days they went about their priestly duties. For me, the humanness of Agnes/Father Damien is so realistic.Another important aspect of this read is the insight the author gives the reader into the Ojibwe culture, beliefs, mindset and humor. Father Damien's encounters with the talking black dog are an example. There is so much to this novel that I could do it again.

This is a many layered reading experience with much about the lives of native Americans in the twentieth century, comic scenes to make you laugh out loud, moments of intense passion, and spiritual theme throughout reconciling Ojibwe spirituality with Catholicism. The novel begins with Father Damien at an ancient age being visited by the younger Father Jude Miller who has been sent to interview him about the possible sainthood of a nun from the reserve, Sister Leopolda, finally Father Damien is compelled to revisit events of the past and to tell his story.At times Erdrich's writing is more like poetry than prose, though the different stories were beautifully told it was all somewhat disjointed for a novel, hard to keep track of the characters. What really held my attention was the idea of someone living as the other sex for an entire lifetime, this is what makes this book unique and unforgettable for me.

This was different. Agnes takes us on a journey through her life in various forms. There is a little bit of everything in this book. A love story, a mystery, and comedy. It was a little slow to begin with. But after the first chapter, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"The true miracle of Little No Horse is the fact that its leading character, Father Damien Modeste, a simple priest on a remote Ojibwe reservation, should glow with a radiance of spirit that is truly rare in fiction. It is hard to write about goodness. Truly good people whom we might admire in life tend to come over flat and two-dimensional on the page, even a bit smug. Marilynne Robinson inGILEADis one of the few authors who have managed to paint a totally sympathetic portrait of a good man with very few dark colors at all. Graham Greene made a career of revealing goodness in unlikely places -- the whiskey priest inTHE POWER AND THE GLORY, the adulteress inTHE END OF THE AFFAIR; the contrast is what makes it work, especially given Catholic doctrine that one act of grace can redeem a lifetime of failure.Louise Erdrich takes this one step further by making her priest an impostor. We learn on page 8 (and the book jacket) that Father Damien is not a man but a woman, Agnes DeWitt, who takes the clothes of an accidentally drowned priest and continues his journey to the reservation. Though seeking only temporary respite, she stays for a lifetime; the novel consists of Agnes' memories as a very old woman. Or Father Damien's, I might say; Erdrich uses both names and both sets of personal pronouns, as Agnes is a woman to her private thoughts, but totally identifies with the priest in his public duties. Father Damien is visited by Father Jude Miller, an emissary from the Vatican enquiring into the life of an Indian convert, Sister Leopolda, who was thought to have performed miracles and is thus a candidate for sainthood. Damien knows that the situation is much more complicated, bringing into play the family histories and rivalries among the Ojibwe people he has come to know so well. As the enquiry proceeds, the violent ecstasy of Sister Leopolda's personality is contrasted against the quiet goodness of Damien's own, until by the end Father Jude wonders if he has been investigating the wrong saint.The book also reminded my of Willa Cather'sDEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, about another Catholic missionary on Indian lands, in that case in 19th-century New Mexico. Erdrich gives her Father Damien the same good-humored common sense as Cather's future archbishop, and the same freedom from doctrinal niceties. But she goes further, calling upon her own Ojibwe heritage. Not only is her Damien not a priest at all (nor entirely celibate), she gives him a growing sympathy with the Ojibwe belief system so that he is also a strong force for good among those who never convert. Yet this is never at the expense of the Catholic faith; Agnes is clearly capable of direct communication with God, and several episodes in her life come close to being true miracles, as when she plays Chopin in an empty church to a bemused congregation of serpents. And her Father Damien has religiously performed the sacraments, especially that of absolution: \\"forgiveness as a long, slow, soaking rain he had caused to fall on the dry hearts of sinners.\\"A remarkable book -- radiant, sensual, often funny, sometimes exciting -- but not quite perfect. Not having read Louise Erdrich's other novels in the same setting, I found some of the entanglements among the Ojibwe characters difficult to follow, given the many ways in which the members of a few families can interact in marriages (sanctified or otherwise), parenthood (admitted or otherwise), and deadly rivalry. The family trees so nicely calligraphed on the end-papers are scant help. But, though complex, it is a wonderfully rich world that Erdrich re-creates. A God that does not embrace it as fully as any churchbound flock is no God at all."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"If you yoked Faulkner with Garcia-Marquez, and anointed them with the comic hijinx of John Irving, you would experience a sense of Louise Erdrich's poetic, visually imaginative power. She interweaves a traditional pagan mysticism with Catholic catechism, the animate with the anthropomorphic. The central figure, Father Damien Modeste, is a Catholic missionary priest who, since coming to the Little No Horse reservation in 1912, has fluidly blended the customs of the Ojibwe people with the Holy Trinity. Through his eighty years there on the reservation (he is at least 100 years old now), he has integrated the spiritual faiths into a potent hybrid, a mystic fusion that also informs the book's imagery, without a shred of proselytizing. Father Damien takes great pleasure in forgiveness, in absolving all of people's sins at confession.Many of Erdrich's characters develop over time in her Argus novels, with intricate histories and relationships. Father Damien was a peripheral character in past books, such asLove Medicine,The Beet QueenandTracks. Erdrich's use of the multi-narrative voice and nonlinear storyline brings specific characters in and out of focus at different times and in different books. In LAST REPORT, I could sense the full lives of characters such as Nanapush, Damien's closest friend, who came with a full history by the time he was introduced in this book. It is difficult to review this novel without mentioning some surprises about Father Damien's identity, which is shared in the first several pages. However, I leave that to the reader to discover, and will give very little plot point information.Father Damien is now at the end of his life. He has been writing letters to the Vatican asking for spiritual guidance for half a century, awaiting a reply, persevering in this quest. When Father Jude shows up, it is not for the reasons Damien is hoping for. Rather, Father Jude has come to interview the cleric and others because the Vatican is considering Little No Horse's deceased Sister Leopolda (the Puyat) for sainthood. The Sister is inexplicably bound up with some reported miracles on the reservation. However, she was also a treacherous woman responsible for the tragic fate of several people. During the investigation of Sister Leopolda, Father Damien's extraordinary life unfolds.Erdrich's prose is so dense and dynamic that you can extract any line and see multiple images expanding. Her sentences are not merely strung together to get to the next one. Like beautiful poetry, the journey of a single phrase can make you pause and shudder. Her sense of character is not limited to the sentient and her depiction of place contains a blend of what is now and what is ancient. I am still revisiting passages just for its supple beauty. Erdrich is an alpha-female writer; the robust writing/story doesn't depend on sentiment or emotional manipulation, but rather on singularity and strength. Flinty, brutal, feral, mystical, and inflammatory, this book is a postmodern world of the supernatural and earthly, intoxicated with great passion and love, deep sorrow and regret. And occasionally, it is hilarious.I observed immediately that Erdrich's narrative keeps the reader at a certain distance, but it's the same way that the moon is at a distance when we gaze upon it. Too close and we would lose perspective. Within the chapters are subheadings that could rightly be their own vignettes and character studies. The structure reflects Erdrich's fealty to oral storytelling --the Native American tradition of language and the land, of birth and death, of revenant spirits, and the eternal cycles of nature. Father Damien's letters to the Vatican and his interview with Father Jude weaves the disparate narratives together, and shows the reader his candor beyond the cloak of secrecy.I can see a higher power inhabiting the nun's fingers that channel Chopin; in the heart that beats in its cage; brittle old bones buried in the earth; the broken bits of sun flashing through the trembling leaves; a cold fat moon of an early frost; the long shadow of a life."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I just picked this book up recently and was instantly drawn into the storyline. I could not stop reading it.

Great reading! :-)"},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Such a great conclusion for those of us that have followed all of Erdrich's books and watched Father Damien in the background of them all.

However, I labored with this book. Maybe it was too long, maybe the main character, Agnes, was too unbelievable. Erdrich gave her the voice of a wizened educated old man/woman. But her past indicates otherwise. And if you're Catholic, you will definitely have issues with this book. The story jumps around a lot leaving you desperate for her to tell a story, any story so that you can become deeply involved. I would recommend Love Medicine or Beet Queen if you are new to Ms. Erdrich."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Unbelievable story with very effective, if often disturbing, imagery.

Quite dark.I would only recommend this if you really had lots of time on your hands and nothing better to do."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"This was kind of a strange story. As in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, I found myself most intrigued with the story's central protagonist. While Fidelis Waldvogel and Delphine Watzka were central to &quot;The Master Butcher's Singing Club&quot;, Agnes Dewitt, aka \\"Father Damien Modeste\\", was the strength of &quot;The Last Report on the Miracle of Little No Horse&quot;.Although I found Agnes's tale intriguing, I found the rest of the story kind of disjointed. The other characters just didn't blend together for me. Although I saw how Agnes began to accept the religion and customs of the Ojibwe people, I would have liked to see more about their customs. Overall, I felt a bit bored by much of the story. I definitely liked &quot;The Master Butcher's Singing Club&quot; better."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"This book was off to a good start, but quickly lost my attention and interest. The main character, a former nun, meets tragedy after tragedy, and eventually assumes the identity of a young priest, sent to spread God's word to the residents of an Indian reservation. She is so obscure, as are many of the characters in this book, and was impossible to relate to. My mom and I both read the book, as did the eight dedicated readers in my book club, and out of the ten of us, three actually finished the novel. And even those who finished didn't like it because of its confusing storyline and bizarre characters. I made it to page 100 before I threw in the towel and moved onto a different novel."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I found this book to be good but also slightly flawed.I read it for a class (a University English class) and have been blown away by all the books so far but this one hasn't quite hit me the way some of the other novels I've read for the course did.It started out great, I was really intrigued, but then sometime after page 100 I lost interest and just wanted the book to finish so I could write my paper and be done with it.I really wish though that the book said somewhere on it that it is basically a part of a series. Until I came to the Amazon website and read a bunch of reviews I had no idea! Maybe reading more of her novels would have helped me get through the novel better in the first place!"},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"In a few words: Boring. Overblown. Pretentious and unrealistic. Poorly written. Clumsy, clunky sentences.Give me a break! A few wonderful visual images do not redeem hundreds of underdeveloped characters, unfinished story lines, and poor editing, and chalking it up to &quot;circular Indian thinking&quot; is ridiculous.I give two, as opposed to one, stars due to the potential of a great story---ie, the author has imagination. Beyond that, I don't get the hype."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"The story starts well but the main character's transformation from Agnes to Father Damien feels fabricated and fictional. What is Agnes's motivation for suddenly taking on a male persona, apparently on a whim, and maintaining that for the rest of her long life? Why does she do this?Real transgendered or transsexual people are vivid observers of gender presentations in others and put a great deal of thought into transition. No such observations or struggles were reflected in this tale. I could not shake my initial feeling that this was all fictional pretense. There is no denying the author's skill to create some beautiful passages, but I don't feel she succeeded in creating a convincing transgendered character.Perhaps those unfamiliar with transgendered people will imagine this is realistic."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"My title is taken from a review of this book by the New Yorker's Daniel Mendelsohn -- like him, I feel as though Erdrich's much-touted \\"lyricism\\" and endless invocations of grand, sweeping emotions are pretty hollow, that there isn't much behind or beneath them: neither real feeling nor real artistry. And what do her quasi-mystical aphorisms actually mean? They are often just plain nonsensical, like something out of Monty Python. Take this one: \\"Time is a fish, and we are all of us swimming on its fins.\\" It's as though she's trying to sound very wise and \\"deep\\" without being either."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Erdrich has the gift, no doubt about it. Her story line, characters and prose combine in this book to make a feast for the senses. She can make us smell the stew inside an Objibwe cabin, hear the pounding rush of the Red River as it sweeps St. Cecilia/Agnes DeWitt off its banks and into the next phase of her life as the missionary priest to Little No Horse reservation, feel the hot breath of the Devil in dog form and taste the burnt coffee that one of the Kashpaw women constantly pours for Agnes' new persona Father Damien. While not a Roman Catholic, I can see why some might not entirely enjoy this book, which explores not only what it means to be a woman living a man's life, but also what it means to be a priest. The conclusion Father Damien comes to in the end is very different from church doctrine but will probably resonate with many questioning Christians of whatever stamp.Erdrich follows and enlarges upon old trails in this book, filling in details of the main Little No Horse families. We meet up again with Nanapush, the charming trickster of \\"Tracks\\" and \\"Four Souls\\", and find out how he acquired his wife Margaret, we see Fleur Pillager again and find out what happened after her marriage to the lumber tycoon came apart, and what became of her daughter Lulu and her new son are on the reservation.The main story concerns Sister Leopolda/Pauline Puyat and an Papal Inquiry into her possible sanctification. The Papal Emmissary (Father Jude) arrives on the reservation in 1996 seeking confirmation of the miracles and holiness of this possible new saint. Father Damien abhors Sister Leopolda and struggles to make Father Jude understand why making her a saint would be sacrilege. But while this portion of the book is fleshed out very satisfactorily, Erdlich weaves many smaller stories throughout, holding our interest all the time.I felt better about life itself after reading this book. I hope you find the same beauty and grace in it."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"This is the most marvelous story of a woman who felt she was needed as a man rather than as a man, so she became a Roman Catholic priest and missionary to a group of Ojibwehs (Native Americans) in northern Minnesota and North Dakota and in southern Manitoba. Curiously enough, most of the people she served knew she was a female who had a secret and compelling reason be their priest, and she was accepted by them as the priest she thought she had become.Louise Erdich created a most unusual life with this book, one I will want to read several times."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I loved everything about this book, especially the opening sequence of events regarding Agnes, they were so clever and imaginative.

This was the first book I have read by Louise Erdich and immediately became an avid fan of her writing style.The characters are well developed, the story is interesting, and the style of her writing is sometimes breathtaking. I find it rare to come across a book that captures my attention so quickly, then most importantly, maintains it. Every moment reading this book was enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I bought three copies as gifts for friends. All Louise Erdrich's work is wonderful but I think she is really at her best here.

Yes, it was confusing and long. This is not an easy read. It would be best be appreciated by mature individuals who are really good readers. I experienced moments of difficulty with this book, but Ms. Erdrich is such a **breathtakingly** good writer that I found myself pulled into being interested in her characters and her story.

Bravo, Louise."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"Last Report falls in the category of books for me that I would term 'perfect.' The characters are richly drawn, the writing is deft and lyrical, and the storyline itself is an amazing journey. Erdrich has proven herself again and again as an accomplished writer. This is the book (imho) that puts her solidly in the 'literature' category. She explores many of her favorite issues of faith, spirituality, doubt, regret and redemption. This is a book that resonated deep in my mind (dare I say soul?) with scenes that have revisited me long after I finished reading it. Beautiful, disturbing, at times funny, haunting. In short, a perfect book."},{"Title":"The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse","review":"I'v read other books by Erdrich and had a hard time getting into them. This was different.

It gives true insight into the lives of most Japanese women, and how women in general are treated in Japan."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"My main impression of this book is that it would have made an excellent (long) magazine article or series. It seriously needed some editing to hit the highlights instead of going on and on with details. For instance, the whole storyline of the trees being razed for a parking lot, and the way the author could never fully understand it, was quite tedious. That being said, I did read an advance copy of the book, so it may have improved before publication. (I still think it would have been better as an article)This book does provide a great peek into an ordinary life, and I've come away with a different view of certain aspects of Japan. I was surprised to learn of how the teenagers fight with their parents, and dismayed to see how much time the Japanese man spends at work instead of with his family (or anything else, for that matter)."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"via mariko, a japanese woman, the author, liz bumiller, provides insight into japanese society: family and intimate relationships, economy and work, government and politics, healthcare and medicine, education, and religion.not a bad read, if you want to know about the personal troubles of a japanese woman and how these minor troubles relate to the major social issues of japan."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"This book about Japanese society is written from the point of view of an American. It is highly readable and enjoyable, but here and there are typical American's biases. If you want to know why American's way of living is different from Japanese's, this is the book for you.

In this book Elisabeth Bumiller interviews a Japanese women and her family, friends and others linked to the family to give a very detailed picture of a Japanese family from 1991 to 1992. We get to join festivals, sit in at PTA meetings, visit mobsters, learn about local politics, find out what family issues the Japanese have and even the family's view on America and international events.NOTE: The author has very strong views of her own and will state them, but don't let that get in the way of the rest of the book. She digs up a LOT of information and makes it clear that while the Japanese might have different ways of thinking or doing stuff, they do have some of the same goals, dreams and fears."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"This book takes a personal look at Mariko, who is a wife, mother, and daughter in modern-day Japan. This book cuts through typical Japan-bashing rhetoric, and provides an intimate look at Japanese family life during a time when familial roles are being challenged and re-defined almost daily. This behind-the-scenes view of family life is one that few non-Japanese get to experience.I particularly enjoyed how the book illustrated the rhythm of Mariko's daily life over a year's time. The book shows how Japanese women have much more freedom of expression and independence than men which is quite contrary to what most westerners believe."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"This book provides glimpses of the lifestyle of an average Japanese housewife. Written by a journalist rather than an anthropologist, the author explores the life and important events of Mariko over the course of a year. Through the author's interviews, we learn the history of the family and the views of Mariko, her husband and children on such topics as family life, parenting, and work. As a journalist, Bumiller is quite interested in Japanese opinions and attitudes about current events, so Mariko and her family explain some of their complex feelings about the U.S. We visit the children's schools and work places, and see where they go on vacation. Along the way, Bumiller also interviews prominent Japanese who are in some way connected to aspects of Mariko's life, such as politicians, the head of the mob, and a talk show host. By the end of the book, readers are familiar with many details of average Japanese family life, something that would be unattainable unless one were to either grow up in Japan or live for long enough in Japan to develop close friendships with locals. But even Bumiller points out that she has only scratched the surface, and there is much about Mariko's life that we can never comprehend just by reading a book."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"After having lived in Japan for almost twenty years it was a pleasure to read The Secrets of Mariko. Most books portray the Japanese with an overdose of stereotypes and generalizations so people who are not familiar with Japan can get innacurate ideas. By interviewing Mariko and her family and acquaintances in depth, the author of this book managed to come up with a fairly accurate portrayal of modern Japanese life. @@Even though the interviews took place in the early 1990's@and Japan has changed since then, a reader can get a pretty good idea of what life is like for many Japanese families today. Mariko's family situation is, of course their own and is unique in many ways. The family's attitudes and ideas, however are not unique.

The author does a fantastic job of observation into the life of a &quot;typical&quot; Japanese housewife. The book gave me a deeper understanding of one aspect of Asian culture that I couldn't have learned otherwise. At times, the reading lags a bit because of its ordinary-ness but at the same time it is the ordinary day to day struggles that Mariko encounters that makes the work so engaging. I recommend it highly to anyone that is willing to spend a day reflecting on something other than themself."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"I have just finished this book, and found it thoroughly enjoyable in a sober sense. Each chapter gave me something to think over; the book left me with a deeper understanding of Japanese culture and the way relationships are intertwined in that nation.As I am studying Japanese, I may have found this book much more interesting than someone who has no particular interest in Japan. That said, if you have an open mind and interest in the culture, there's a good chance you'll love this book as much as I did.At times, it seemed the author was a little too self-seeking. I would certainly hope she has kept in some form of contact with Mariko, and perhaps passed on some royalties from the book - given the massive amount of time Mariko and her family spent with the author (she did give Mariko's family a gift at the end, but to me that didn't seem enough).Aside from that, the book was a real eye opener and I couldn't put it down.Bear in mind the author spent time with Mariko between 1991-1992, so by now there will certainly be some cultural discrepencies and perhaps attitude changes."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Mariko: A Year in the Life of a Japanese Woman and Her Family","review":"This book isn't anything spectacular but I felt it was nice to enjoy, light reading if you're interested in Japan. There's nothing really technical about it, and the conclusion you come to is pretty typical of what you read of most Japanese literature.

I certainly will use some of Mr Liggett's methods when working with my sports clients.However, being over 10 years old, this book deserves to be revised. His insistance on using only a hypnotist with an advanced medical degree is a bit old fashioned. Certainly one needs to work with a qualified hypnotist who knows how to handle special situations that may come up (like how to handle an abreaction) but there are many well trained professional hypnotists who can do this work without being a Psychologist; perhaps even better. At the time of this writing he doesn't seem to recognize the National Guild of Hypnotists either.A very good book for all those who want to work with sports mental-conditioning.

It turns out that Mr. Liggett is an older gentleman who is pictured inside the book. I guess some professional in 'marketing' felt that the younger man's picture would help sell the book.

This book had a great mystery. Kept you on the edge of your seat wondering who was really doing what. Just when you though you had it, you got thrown by some other factor that just pops up. It had me until the end, and that was a damn good twist. No wonder I couldnt figure it all out. As the story goes deeper and deeper, more pieces fall together. Not enough to figure out the whole mystery, though. The author did a great job of stringing the reader along.As far as romance in this novel, well, there is not much. Yes, we have the two main characters who are \\"together\\" but not much attention is really drawn to it. This is a book where romance takes a backseat to the mystery and suspence. Not what I look for, I go for the ones where the mystery and romance are as equal as possible. But overall it was a good read. The mystery part of this book is awesome. There are all kinds of twists to the plot. But there is almost nothing to contribute to the romance part of it. There is one love scene and that is not that great and the rest are left to your imagination. The couple also had an almost phony feel to it. I cant put my finger on it, but some of their interactions were missing something I think.For mystery readers and those who like suspence to keep you on the edge of your seat, this is so for you. But dont get this thinking it is along the lines of older Linda Howard for example. Its not. I gave the book four stars because the mystery was so good. The romance part just falls under my personal preference.

I fell in love with her historical romances (Samantha was the first I'd ever read) and admit to being somewhat apprehensive when I found out that she was changing genres.

Well, I truly had nothing to fear as her romantic suspense efforts have proven to be getting better and better and this book is no exception.Without going into a detailed synopsis (this could give away some key aspects of the suspense and than possibly ruining the read for some) suffice it to say that Ms. Kane took extreme care in setting up and executing her storyline. Characters a key and important part of any story are wonderfully dynamic. Taylor and Reed the romantic leads in this page turning story are wonderful complements to each other. Not only were they likable characters, I truly cared about how their romance was going to develop and in which direction it would go.Although readers may divine who the killer is early on in the story this in no way hurts this read. I must admit to guessing right up to the unveiling. I'm sure fellow readers will be totally caught up in Ms. Kane's latest effort. This is one author that I highly recommend and suggest that you not only check out this read, but her backlist as well.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Just thought it was an average mystery. Very little romance. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on Amazon have already did that. I had problems getting into the characters. I just felt like she didn't truly explore them and get you to feel what they were feeling. I enjoyed some of the plot twists but one of the reviews here had kinda ruined it for me, but it was also easy to figure out. I liked the premise of the radio talk show psychologist host. I was hoping that Ms. Kane would go into that area more to heighten the mystery thriller part of the book. As for romance, there wasn't any build up to that and you didn't feel their instanteous attraction either. Just wasn't believable. I will definitely try another one of her books just because of her plot premise. Don't want to buy this book. This is strictly a library checkout book."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Insert favorite cliche about sound and fury signifying nothing here. Kane's book is talky like a soap opera, has idealized but unrealistic characters, and plenty of sex appeal but little in the way of an actual mystery. In fact, this particular book is evident from the first two chapters; its conclusion surprises no one who was attentive. Language is bare, tepid. She sells millions of books. That this seems to be in contradiction with the quality of the book is a paradox I have learned to tolerate."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Tony nominee and Obie Award winner Linda Emond gives another award worthy performance as she relates a story which is part every woman's nightmare and part every woman's dream.How would you feel if you had already been the victim of an attempted rape and then opened your email one day to find a terrifying one line message: \\"I'll be watching you....\\"? Probably every bit as frightened as protagonist Taylor Haltead. A psychologist and radio talk show host Taylor is well familiar with the seamier side of life, and now it seems that this darkness may engulf her.Cousin Stephanie's boyfriend, Gordon, attempted to violate Taylor in her own apartment. She was saved by the ringing of her doorbell. (When an attempted rape is the opening scene, you know you're in for a fast paced listen!) Not too long after this attack both Gordon and Stephanie are killed in a boating accident. Or, so it appears.Taylor is being stalked, but by whom? Gordon does have a twin brother, Jonathan; might he be the one. Soon, Taylor is consumed by fear and runs to handsome attorney Reed Watson for protection, solace (and great sex). At this point, she doesn't know who she can believe or if that really matters because whoever is after her is coming closer and closer.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"I liked this book for the most part, but a few things bothered me.For example, at one point a character is sorting through an overnight case, striding to the bar and pouring a scotch at the same time. This happens more than once--characters doing three things at the same time in an impossible manner. Also, some of the action scenes are awkward. I mean it's hard to visualize characters moving in some of the ways written for them.Taylor Halstead is assaulted by her cousin's boyfriend hours before the boat he and her cousin are on explodes. Several months later, she begins receiving messages from an unknown culprit, a culprit who seems to be taunting her from beyond the grave. Her ally is Reed Weston, a lawyer who represents Taylor's attacker's brother.There are some rather obvious clues as to the culprit's identity, but there are also a lot of other things happening to distract and entertain.Taylor is a decent heroine, but she grew a bit irritating to me. I won't go into detail so as not to ruin the story. Reed Weston is an intriguing hero, but became a little too much, too quickly--he falls in love right off the bat, he's a little too mushy for my taste, and ends up virtually helpless. Overall, though, these are two characters a reader can cheer for and care about.This is book kept me entertained. The villain is a daunting character and the suspense and mystery runs fairly high throughout the tale.I'm looking forward to reading Ms. Kane's WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this story. This story started out with a bang and frankly there were no dull moments throughout. Taylor, a radio psychologist starts getting stalked by an unknown man. She has her suspicions on who it could be but nothing is for sure. She meets Reed, an attorney, when she is asked to sign some papers. Anyhow, they hit it off and start dating. There are conflicts because he is attorney to one of the men that could quite possibly be her stalker. As I was nearing the ending of this book, my heart was actually racing.... An incredilby difficult book to put down. I give it 5 stars...easily."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"After barely escaping a sexual assault by her cousin/roommate's lover, Taylor wakes up to the news that her beloved cousin and her lover Gordon Mallory were killed in an explosion on board his yacht.

Then out of the blue, she is contacted by a law firm that wants to settle her cousin's share of a fraudulent business scheme that Gordon cooked up and his family wants to make right before it gets press attention.When she meets with the lawyers, she runs into an exact replica of Gordon, but it is actually his identical twin brother, Jonathan, who takes an immediate liking to her. She also meets Reed Weston, and idealistic corporate lawyer who is ready to move out on his own. He also is attracted to Taylor, and immediately takes the time to ask her out. With Reed, she feels something she has never felt before - protection and love.While Reed and Taylor's relationship develops, Jonathan is convinced that she and he would be a better duo, the stalker continues to close in on her, and more murders occur.

It is a good read."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Unfortunately I just didn't really like this book. I've read all of Ms. Kane's books to date and I feel like she should just stick to the regency genre and leave the contemporary mystery/romances alone. I've found that in all of her contemporary novels everything just seems to work out too perfectly and the romance seems really blah.This book was horribly predictable and cliche and it left me wishing I hadn't wasted the time to even pick it up. I knew right away who was stalking her and the romance part of this book seemed so contrived that it was really sad. We didn't get to become emotionally invested in these characters at all. One minute they meet, are incredibly attracted to each other (supposedly), and are expressing their undying love for each other without any sign of internal conflict at all. The dialogue was weak and didn't flow well and the mystery was tepid at best. And the whole date, place and time at the beginning of each section was annoying and distracting and didn't help the flow of the story at all.I'm sorry to have to give Ms. Kane a bad review because I really have enjoyed many of her regency novels but this one just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Albeit the book's well and fast paced and will have you on the hook, it has one too many coincidences. The phone calls at the exact time and the intercom buzz exactly before the attack, among others.The book is also very predictable. Since the first quarter of it you'll have an inkling of who's the bad guy. But since the middle of it you'll be sure, but you'll've to keep reading to know how he did it. What I'm trying to write here is that this book has its botches but even with those you won't be able to close the book till you finish it."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"I had a really hard time getting into this one. And that really stinks since I had it on back order for so long. For some reason, I just couldn't get into it, or get a good feel for the characters. It seemed really boilerplate in places. And frankly, the ending was really obvious. I mean, it's been done before (like just about everything else out there). I finally skipped a good chunk of the front and moved on and was able to read the mid section. Then, when it dropped off again, I just skipped to the back. (I did go back and read those skipped sections to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was like returning to a soap opera after two years to find the exact same plot line.) Trite and obvious prose in places, this is a story that has potential but falls short of what I expect from this normally fantastic author. (sorry Miss Kane!!)"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK, IT REALLY LOOKED GOOD. ONCE I STARTED READING I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.

That should have ended her ordeal, but it only began it. Weeks later, a stalker attaches himself to her, and then she sees the man who assaulted her, Gordan Mallory. However, it is not Gordon, but his identical twin, Jonathan. He is as determined to get to know her as she is to avoid him. Then, the terror begins to escalate; people are murdered, and Jonathan is the best suspect, placing the new man in Taylor's life, Reed Weston in a most difficult position. He finds himself acting as defense attorney to the man she fears.**** From the outset, the suspense will hold you on the edge of your seat. This is not your standard good twin, bad twin book- it is much more complex and well done than that. Andrea Kane has definitely made her mark as a queen of suspense. ****"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Making friends is difficult for some while others jump eagerly into each new friendship. Since I find myself in the former category, I am always delighted when my risk pays off. Discovering a new author can be much the same. While others have read and enjoyed New York Times bestselling author Andrea Kane, I had not yet made her acquaintance. I am so glad I did because Romantic Suspense is one of my favorite genres, and one can never have too many good writers from which to choose.I'LL BE WATCHING YOU begins with a brutal assault scene. It will remain seared in your memory throughout the book, never letting you forget the heinous nature of the enemy. Taylor Halstead is a vibrant, caring psychologist who works with families and adolescents during the day and hosts a call-in talk show in the evening. She shares a Manhattan apartment with her cousin and best friend, Stephanie. Taylor is beautiful, bright and self-sufficient, until her cousin's boyfriend tries to rape her. The attack is foiled when Stephanie arrives back to the building and buzzes the bell from downstairs. Gordon Mallory, the attacker, leaves Taylor bruised and handcuffed to the bed, warning her that he will be back to finish what he started.Though Taylor frees herself, it is too late to warn Stephanie, who sets out for a weekend aboard a luxury party yacht with Gordon. Before Taylor can recover from the attack, word reaches her that there has been a horrible accident; the yacht has exploded and all aboard have been killed. Taylor is grief stricken. Even the demise of the evil Gordon does not compensate for the loss of her beloved cousin.While dealing with her pain, Taylor begins to receive threatening phone calls and emails from someone who has made her the object of his obsessions. Suspense fans will not be misled but the author uses clever techniques to keep this from being too simplistic, and most readers will be kept guessing until the last quarter of the book.The romantic component is provided by Jonathan Mallory, Gordon's twin brother, who tries to convince Taylor that he is not like his sibling --- that he would love and appreciate a woman like her --- and by Reed Weston, a successful attorney who takes an immediate protective approach, although being Taylor's big brother is not his ultimate goal.I'LL BE WATCHING YOU has all the ingredients you could hope for in a Romantic Suspense novel, and Andrea Kane has gained a new fan.--- Reviewed by Maggie Harding"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"BEWARE: Contains spoilers!!I really enjoyed this book. It was one of those that you just don't want to put down once you start it.The plot was excellent. I was thoroughly hooked. I was pretty sure right from the start that Gordon hadn't been killed in the boat explosion. I sort of expected it from just reading the back cover. So I wasn't surprised he was the bad guy. Still...she does an excellent job making the reader wonder if just maybe it is Jonathan. It was the way she wrote the sections with the bad guys thoughts. They were so vague and and written in a way that it really sounded like Jonathan. The fact that Gordon was Dennis was a total surprise. I never expected that.I loved Taylor/Reed. They were so great together. And what I really enjoyed about this book was that they had a \\"normal\\" romance...if you discount the bad stuff going on. I just mean that in a lot of books, guy and girl meet, fall in lust, screw like bunnies, fight their real feelings, plot resolves, they break up, then finally admit feelings and get back together. But in this book, the characters meet, date, fall in love, and stay together. I enjoyed that.Rating: 4 / 5"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Andrea Kane's new romantic thriller, \\"I'll Be Watching You\\" is reminiscent of a Mary Higgins Clark murder mystery. Taylor Halstead, the spunky and gorgeous heroine, is a psychologist who also provides counseling to her radio audience on her call-in show. Her best friend is also her cousin, Stephanie. When a sudden and unexpected tragedy turns Taylor's world upside down, she fears that her life will never be the same. To make matters worse, Taylor is assaulted and threatened by a vicious sadist who promises to come back and finish the job.Soon, Taylor begins to get strange and frightening phone calls and emails; she is convinced that she has a stalker. Coming to her aid is Reed Weston, a hunky attorney who represents the family of her former assailant. Although Taylor finds it hard to trust any man after what she has suffered, Reed becomes a strong and stable presence in her life. Can Taylor and Reed find her stalker before he returns to complete what he started?\\"I'll Be Watching You\\" is a serviceable escapist suspense novel. It has some fairly explicit romantic encounters, which you won't find in Mary Higgins Clark's books. The story held my interest for the first half of the book, but a cheesy ending, several doses of hackneyed dialogue, and one too many predictable plot developments diminished my reading pleasure. There is little character development and no depth to distinguish \\"I'll Be Watching You\\" from the many other novels of its type that are published every year."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"A mysterious e-mail turns Taylor's world upside down. She is a radio talk show psychologist who had been threatened by a person who tried to abuse her in her own apartment in New York and, it seems, is playing tricks with her mind and heart. She observed the real programming on WOR 710 am in New York City so as to be able to appear authentic in the way one of those unique individuals handle difficult callers.She proves what I've often advocated, that most novels are factual. She admits that she \\"strives to convey every nuance and detail as authentically as possible\\" and uses knowledgeable authorities in all of the subject matter in qustion. She advers that \\"any departure from reality is 'my responsibility' -- a literary license she avails of only when it's absolutely necessary.\\"Some of the action has nautical settings which she researched to make it appear as real-like as possible. \\"Radio is the theater of the mind.\\" As Eddy Roy once said to me, 'the mystrey of radio' as you can't see what's happening, so you must use your imagination. It's better that way, as t.v. has sated us with reality shows which are ad infinatum.She says she is incredibly lucky to have such a family who offers creative input, enthusiastic support, and a reason to believe. They put her in touch with the right people at the right time.The e-mail threatens, \\"I'll be watching you.\\" The man who tried to assault her was killed in a yacht incident, or was he? Could it be his twin brother who is intent on scaring the wits out of her and keep her living in fear.Ms. Kane has written numerous romances and suspense thrillers including her first RUN FOR YOUR LIFE (in 2000, main character, Zach Hamilton), WISHES IN THE WIND, MY HEARTS DESIRE, and WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME. This was a good read. As mysteriously scary as Sharyn McCrumb's IF EVER I RETURN, PRETTY PEGGIE-O.

It's the kind of book you could put down at any point and not miss the characters or wonder what happened to them. You know what happens to them and who did it to them almost from the very beginning. AND, you didn't really care what happened to them because they weren't likeable and you felt no sympathy.I see this author gets good reviews on many of her books, so I might try another.

I had never read anything by this author before and while I didn't hold out high hopes, the plot looked decent.The story first introduces us to Taylor, a psychologist living in Manhattan with her cousin and best friend Stephanie. One day she comes home to find her cousins creepy boyfriend Gordon hanging out by himself in the apartment. Taylor tries to get away from but fails. Gordon begins to rape Taylor but is stopped by Stephanie coming up to the apartment, before strangling Taylor into unconsciousness, he promised to come back and finish what he started sand says in the meantime \\"I'll be watching you\\". Later that night though, Taylor receives a call that Gordon's yacht which he and Stephanie were supposed to be on has exploded and there were no survivors. Taylor tries to get on with her life after this but weeks after the explosion ( and meeting Lawyer/Love interest Reed Weston), she begins to receive mysterious messages and phone calls in the middle night, all echoing what Gordon had told her before: \\"I'll be watching you\\".The basic plot really wasn't too bad. While I don't think the ending was shocking by any means, Kane does keep you guessing for quite awhile. I know a few scenarios went through my head while reading ( one of them turning out to be correct). The near rape scenes are...more graphic than I expected ( what I found odd is the near rape scenes were more graphic than the actual love scenes) but effective in proving what a creep and seriously disturbed man Gordon Mallory is.I have to say too that Reed probably is one of the best heroes I've read about in a long time, I really enjoyed how he was written but I found the character of Taylor to be kind of \\"blah\\". She is a nice smart woman but there is really no fire in her which I would've liked to see.Overall I recommend checking it out. I will definitely be checking out Kane's other books."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"Psychologist and popular radio personality Taylor Halstead's world was violated when Gordor Mallory - her cousin Stephanie's wealthy, sadistic boyfriend - attacked Taylor in her own apartment. When his assault was interrupted, he swore he'd be back to finish the job.

There is nothing that points to who is harassing her -and Gordon is dead.I am a fan of Adrea Kane's work - I have read most of her books. This is the best yet. While I like to think I can figure out the mystery before the author makes it plain, that was not the case with I'll Be Watching You. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"While the book was suspenseful enough to keep you interested, it was extremely predictable. The culprit's identity was easy to figure out early on, and the ending of the book explaining everything went on way too long.I also really didn't care too much for Taylor or Reed...their romance seemed forced and unrealistic. And I particularly hated the happily-ever-after epilogue -- it drives me nuts when an author puts a whole slew of unknown characters into a scene and overpowers you with dialogue where every single character must have a say or a role."},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"School psychologist and talk show host Taylor Halstead is dismayed to see her roommate and cousin's boyfriend Gordon Mallory in their apartment when she gets home from work. Her shock turns to terror when he attacks her. He stops when her cousin Stephanie buzzes him in the lobby that she is ready to leave. He tells Taylor he'll be back to finish what he started. She reports the attack to the police but before they can investigate, the boat Gordon and Stephanie is on blows up, killing both of them.In the course of settling her cousin's estate, she meets Reed Taylor, a sexy attorney who makes his attraction to her obvious. She also meets Gordon's identical twin Jonathan who makes it very plain that he too is attracted to her. During this same period, Taylor realizes she is being stalked by a very dangerous man whom she believes is Jonathan. Reed becomes her protector, but when Jonathan is arrested for a double homicide Reed agrees to defend him. Taylor doubts whether their relationship could hold up under the strain because the stalker is getting more threatening.Andrea Kane's hardcover debut is a smashing success, establishing her as a powerful thriller author. There's a growing sense of foreboding that readers can actually feel as the strange e-mails, and terrorizing phone calls hint that this stalker will not be stopped until he accomplishes his goal to have Taylor. The romantic sub-plot between Reed and Taylor is beautifully developed and plays out believably. Readers will be watching Andrea Kane after this delightful new year treat.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"I'll Be Watching You","review":"I enjoyed this story. Had a good plot and interesting characters.Worth reading."},{"Title":"Free Will: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction","review":"Professor Ilham Dilman's book on FREE WILL is undoubtedly one of the most comprehensive historical and philosophical studies of the subject to date. It is virtually an intellectual odyssey into a realm of the human mind that has continued to challenge the greatest thinkers and sages for well over two millennia. All the most significant landmarks in this long course of philosophical history are covered in a most lucid and engaging presentation.The backdrop of the discussion is indeed vast - ranging from the works of the Greek greats (Homer, Sophocles, Plato and Aristotle) through those of the great thinkers of Christianity (St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas), and of modern philosophy (Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, Kant and Schopenhauer), down to the works of some of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century (Freud, Sartre, Wittgenstein and Simone Weil). The book begins by asking a question that appears fairly simple despite its profundity: &quot;What is free will and in what way is it distinctive of and grounded in human existence?&quot; The answers to this question, however, have been anything but simple, as we soon realize in going through this extensive examination of views which span the whole spectrum of the freedom versus determinism question.Among the sources of this problem of freedom and determinism, Professor Dilman identifies the roles of &quot;chance and necessity in human life&quot; and the &quot;apparent incompatibility between human free will and the general law of causality.&quot; Indeed, he is quite on the mark in claiming that the book could well have been entitled &quot;Human Freedom in a World of Cause, Chance and Necessity.&quot; After all, we are &quot;flesh and blood beings&quot; in a physical world ruled by causality, and we are members of a society shaped both by the cultural forces and historical necessities, while at the same time being subject to the vagaries of chance throughout our lives. It is in the midst of all such limitations, the author claims, that we are to &quot;find our share of the freedom of which we are capable as human beings&quot; (p.7).The overall position adopted in this book may best be summarized in the succinct statement made several years ago by the non-professional philosopher Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India: &quot;Life is like a game of cards. The hand that is dealt you represents determinism; the way you play it is free will.&quot; Of course, the real problem is to decide what aspects of our lives fall under each of these categories. By sorting out these various aspects in the workings of the human mind, Professor Dilman has greatly advanced the scope of the discussion on this subject.More than a hundred years ago, in his paper on &quot;The Dilemma of Determinism,&quot; William James had provided one of the best pragmatic recipes in his well-known observation that if we are free, our first act of freedom ought to be to affirm that we are free. The arguments for free will provided by Professor Dilman indeed constitute just such an affirmation of freedom. By predicating human freedom on self-knowledge, his inquiry into free-will shows us that such freedom implies responsibility, not a license for irresponsible expressions in words or deeds.I think it was Bertrand Russell who once said that when he wanted to read a good book, he would write one himself! It seems that Professor Dilman has done the same. My only regret is that this book did not come out some years ago before my retirement; it would certainly have been on the required reading list for my course on Philosophical Psychology.Professor Dilman's book will be of great interest to all fair and broad-minded scholars in philosophy, psychology and literature. It may also be highly recommended for the general readers interested in a broad-based examination of a central psycho-philosophical issue.Mohammed Mujeeb Rahman, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Free Will: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction","review":"I had to read this book for a class on the subject of free will and was appalled by Mr. Dilman's biased account of many of the most prominent philosophers and their views on free will. The chapter on Plato is GROSSLY mistaken and wrong. Mr. Dilman constantly reads into the philosophy things which simply are not there. He is obsessed with Simone Weil and attempts to work her &quot;moral gravity&quot; into every chapter; there is no evidence of such in Kant, Schpoenhaur or Plato despite what Mr. Dilman attempts to say. DON'T buy this book if you are looking for an unbiased and accurate account of the history of free will."},{"Title":"Record Time","review":"At a party hosted by Gamble Records CEO David Gamble, guest Kylie Rogers uses the first opportunity to escape the boredom of the lout with her by climbing out a window.

At fist David is delighted to see her again but when costly errors begin appearing in accounting David wonders if his new hire, who he is attracted to, is trying to destroy him.Though tracing a red Mustang does not seem so difficult, readers will enjoy RECORD TIME, an amusing romantic suspense novel that is a top ten hit for Beverly Brandt. The lead couple is a delightful pair and the support cast, especially her sister, propel the story line forward. As the plot moves briskly between industry intrigue and humorous romantic interludes, both sides of the tale blend nicely together to provide an enjoyable novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Record Time","review":"Kylie is a likeable heroine with a heart of gold, however she always finds herself in some sort of klutzy mess, giving the book a slapstick-type of humorous edge.

She kept introducing different characters, and a couple you could never see the purpose of brining in to the story line, but overall very enjoyable.Kylie is an adorable doofus, and David is a tight, I can't love anyone, because of my awful childhood type.

They stand on branches as well as on the ground, the better to reach fruit in the trees. For our earliest ancestors, living in areas of mixed trees and grass, shuffling between trees would have been more efficient than dropping to all fours.Stanford reminds us that evolution is not a straightforward progression towards something better, but rather a natural product of what works best for the animal's ability to reproduce. Where upright posture favored feeding and energy conservation, it persisted, with a gradual shift to greater bipedalism.Bipedalism led to everything else. He theorizes that walking, by increasing efficiency over distance and freeing the hands, created better hunters, and the high caloric, protein diet helped fuel the expansion of the brain. He outlines the hunting strategies of the modern ape and how these may have evolved in early hominids.Again and again he returns to the modern ape to compare behavior and anatomy, similarity and divergence, throughout the hominid fossil record. Bipedalism is an anatomical trade off. Our broad pelvis, backbone shape and large gluteal muscles give us stability and forward efficiency, and free the lungs from coordination with stride (eventually permitting speech), but decrease climbing ability, make childbirth difficult, and deliver a baggage of back problems.The history of hominid research is one of many stories and few bones. Stanford traces this history, showing how new finds give rise to new, frequently opposing, theories, how the same scrap of bone can be described in starkly different terms by equally eminent and adamant scientists, how psychology, imagination, ambition, and graduate schools have as much (or more) to do with evolutionary views as hard evidence does. Stanford also looks at bipedalism in the big picture - dinosaurs - which had a wide range of bipedal habits without developing speech or big brains.The writing is clear and well organized. Stanford (\\"Significant Others,\\" \\"The Hunting Apes\\") paints a picture of an Africa teeming with variously bipedal hominids, most of which went extinct comparatively quickly. Others, made powerful by their two sturdy legs, spread out into the world, leaving fossilized remains to prove it. Then there's us, the last wave out of Africa, and the only ones left (according to mitochondrial DNA evidence). Are we the best? Or just the last ones left standing? A fascinating, concise and intelligent book."},{"Title":"Upright: The Evolutionary Key to Becoming Human","review":"Craig Stanford's \\"Upright: The Evolutionary Key to Becoming Human\\" is a brief, easy and informative read. I've enjoyed Stanford's previous efforts, and this volume was no disappointment. He approaches the subject of human evolution from the perspective of a researcher studying living great apes, particularly chimpanzees. As such, he takes a distinctly different tack than students of bones and artifacts might. Stanford's discussions of anatomy involve comparisons of the differences between ape and human anatomy, followed by brief presentations of how the hominid fossil record tracks these shifts. His presentation is relaxed but thorough, and his data are quite up-to-date. But it's his deep knowledge of chimpanzee and bonobo behavior, and the application of this information to ancient human ancestry, where this book shines.I was intrigued by Stanford's surmise that the initial impetus towards full erect bipedality may have been simply standing erect for brief moments while feeding and foraging. This seems awfully simplistic, yet not remotely inconceivable. (Leave it to evolution to take the boring way to get somewhere ...) Readers may wish to compare this view with that presented by Jonathan Kingdon in his book \\"Lowly Origin\\". I would observe, however, that Stanford's insistence that behavioral change precedes and drives anatomical change seems to leave the whole concept of mutations out of the loop.What follows is a minor point, but I must confess to having been annoyed by the occasional obvious mistakes encountered throughout portions of the book. Whether these can be placed on Stanford's own doorstep, or that of his editor(s), remains to be determined. But to encounter so many simple errors -- not only typos, but actual factual mistakes -- does make one wonder whether there are other errata that one might be missing. In any event, these mistakes led me to conclude that this book was generated somewhat hastily; that's unfortunate. [For the record: it's Giganotosaurus, not \\"Gigantosaurus\\" (p. 64); it's Hadrosaurus, not \\"Hadrosaurs\\" (p. 64); the hind limbs of Eudibarmus are longer than the animal's forelimbs, not shorter (p. 65); the first species of paranthropine (= \\"robust\\" australopithecine) discovered was Paranthropus robustus, not \\"Zinj\\" (p. 74); people were living in Siberia very near Alaska by ~19,000 years ago (the book states that this was not true until 16,000 years after 25,000 years ago, or 9,000 years ago) (p. 170).]Be that as it may, the book remains thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. One could wish for a little more editorial time and care to have been taken, and perhaps for a few more pictures of actual fossils. But these are minor quibbles. Students of human evolution will have much to look forward to from this volume."},{"Title":"Upright: The Evolutionary Key to Becoming Human","review":"Craig Stanford has studied chimpanzees for many years. He's seen them in groups and as individuals. He's watched them parading along tree limbs seeking fruit, or reaching up to pull branches close for harvest. He once saw one enter, then leave, a stream, \\"looking for all the world like a swimmer emerging from the surf\\". These studies have given him some insights to how our ancestors likely went from a four-legged posture to a bipedal lifestyle. It was a step of profound legacy for us. Bipedalism ultimately allowed humans to traverse the planet.Stanford's studies have resulted in a work that relies strongly on changes in hominin anatomy. Bipedalism requires immense changes in skeletal structure, muscle placement and use, the formation of the pelvis, and, of course, the formation of the foot. These changes must be incremental, he reminds us. Bipedal walking wasn't an overnight transition. It took a great deal of experimentation by natural selection to achieve it. The question of balance loomed large throughout the process. Our modern bodies have a centre of gravity straight up from between our feet - the chimpanzee's is well forward in its midsection. It took many evolutionary trade-offs to change from one type of body structure to another. As the modifications occurred over many generations, the creature carrying them must survive and reproduce to pass these traits on. Was each step suitably sufficient in its own right?In answering that question, Stanford takes us not only through the likely progression, but also reviews the scholarship attempting to explain them. He presents the views and counter arguments of the major thinkers explaining the human lineage. He makes clear that it took many years of study to recognise that bipedalism was the key to becoming human. To infer what slow, gradual steps were required to bring us upright from the paucity of fossils imparting information leaves many points unresolved. That gives researchers a broad spectrum of interpretations to offer, but few absolute answers. Stanford picks through the evidence and the viewpoints, then pronounces his verdict on the most viable scenario. He's clear on what he favours and why.Some of his judgments are severe, and no few of them are open to question. Although he offers little of the early hominin social scene, he's quick to dispose of those who have. His assessment of Owen Lovejoy's scenario of sex playing a major role in leading us to an upright stance is grossly misleading. He accuses Lovejoy of positing a single cause for this change, when Lovejoy's analysis is anything but limited in scope. One can almost sense Adrienne Zihlman at his shoulder as he wrote the passage. Zihlman, a fanatical opponent of \\"women's roles\\" in paleoanthropology, is also a sharp critic of Lovejoy. Among chimpanzees, the gift of love is meat. Although Stanford recognises the role of meat protein in aiding in the building of brains, it most certainly played a greater role in our social development than he assigns to it. This brevity is surprising in view of his earlier books.These shortcomings may be considered as no more than another academic dispute. That's only true in part. Bipedalism may be the significant foundation leading to modern humans, but there are other aspects of our lives today with roots in those ancestral changes. Why did we tend to pair off as mates when most other primates are male-dominated groups? Why did language evolve to give us enhanced communicative skills? What led us to use our bipedal skills to migrate so far, so rapidly? Stanford almost teases us with his sketchy explanations. Although this is an excellent summary of the issues and the personalities who have addressed them, it will take someone with a wider grasp and deeper insight to provide the most reasonable answers to how we became human.

Soukhanov looks at 365 words, divided into 13 subject areas (including politics, law, science and technology, sports, advertising media, and food), that have entered our language since the 1980s. Each section is preceded by an essay exploring how that aspect of the culture has influenced our language. Entries provide detailed descriptions of when and how each word or phrase was first used and discuss its meanings and implications. The book ends with fascinating analyses of the many ways in which new words come into being, including the formation of compounds, borrowing from other languages, acronyms, euphemisms, and the creative use of prefixes and suffixes. Word-lovers of all ages will find this book a delight for both reference and casual browsing."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Fairly good, but dated, mystery novel by Rinehart was actually the basis for the later old dark house mystery stage play, THE BAT, which she penned with Avery Hopwood. There is no Bat charcater in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE, but Roland West's first filmed version of the play (the silent one) depicted the Bat character in a bat-man type outfit that inspired Bob Kane to create his Batman for Detective Comics."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"The plot of The Circular Staircase is, like the staircase of the title, rather roundabout. There are a lot of elements in this novel--murder, embezzlement, robbery, and arson, just t name a few of the crimes perpetrated by the characters in this book. Rachel Innes is a rather prickly middle-aged spinster and the aunt of Gertrude and Halsey. After renting a house in the countryside one summer, in which ghosts are said to live, a man is shot dead at the foot of the house's circular staircase. The dead man is the son of the owner of the house, and he and Jack Bailey (a friend of Halsey's who also happens to be engaged to Getrude) may or may not have been involved in a bank scandal.Rachel, who claims that the detecting gene is in her blood, spends the course of the novel pursuing clues, most of which are red herrings. It turns out that every person involved in this story has a piece of the puzzle; and Rachel spends most of the story saying \\"if only I had known...\\" The \\"Had I But Known\\" plot is apparently pretty characteristic of Rinehart's novels, but in this book I kept feeling that Rachel as just moving in circles, never really solving any part of the mystery until the very last minute. Also, I didn't particularly care for the narrator of the story: Rachel is so sharp-tongued that she's actually rude to pretty much everybody at one point or another. Mr. Jamieson, the detective, is much more likeable, but he sometimes allows Rachel to walk all over him.Mary Roberts Rinehart has been credited with coining the phrase \\"the butler did it\\"--though the phrase never appeared in any of her mystery novels. Her books were bestsellers in the United States for a long while in the early 20th century, probably because they were so readable; certainly not \\"high literature\\" in an sense of the word. The Circular Staircase is a prime example of this; but nonetheless it works well as a suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Readers loved this \\"modern\\" Gothic thriller when it came out a century ago. Even the critics were charmed. Like so many bestsellers, however, The Circular Staircase fell into obscurity for decades. I was lucky to stumble upon a new edition in a bookstore. I'm also happy to see it's available on Amazon.How could anyone ask for a more delightful heroine? Rachael Innes, middle-aged spinster, is witty, feisty, wealthy, afraid of mice, yet ready for almost anything else - from hunting down ghosts to warding off attackers in the night. Stimulated by crime, she's like \\"a dog on a scent.\\"In her role as Aunt Rachael, she has successfully raised her dead brother\`s children to young adulthood. All they ask in return is that she take a house in the country for the summer. She foolishly agrees.Summer at Sunnyside turns out to be a series of bizarre and terrifying happenings. In the first few nights of residence there are ghost-like thumpings and appearances, culminating in a man shot dead at the foot of the circular stairs.This is only the beginning of the thrills and chills to come. The reader can look forward to bank robbery, grave robbery, abduction, mysterious characters with false names, ghostly intruders, veiled ladies, smooth-mannered villains, star-crossed lovers, and a very agreeable detective who lets Aunt Rachael do much of the work of detecting.It seems that Rinehart herself twice rented houses haunted by a poltergeist - and scoffed at the otherworldly phenonema just like Aunt Rachael!I highly recommend this book, especially to fans of vintage and classic mystery."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Nice mystery.

The book is confusing in that one minute the house they are at is isolated the next everyone has run off to town just blocks from the house!"},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Published in 1908, The Circular Staircase won't be what you expect: a hyperventilated Edwardian piece, loaded with implausible plot and purple prose. Our heroine, the middle-aged Rachel Innes, proves caustic, intelligent and quite humorous from the very start. Her well-meaning quarrels with her foolish maid Liddy provide great comic relief, and you won't find Miss Innes making the sort of stupid exercises in derring-do that get modern-day heroines nearly killed in today's mystery novels. Nor will you find Miss Innes melting into Victorian hysterics or melodrama. She's not afraid to hide evidence and thwart the police in her quest for the truth about the murder at her rented summer home. Despite being more than a century old, the novel doesn't feel dated at all, except for the attitudes to other races.Is the novel perfect? No. As other writers have pointed out, there are some plot slip-ups. And Miss Innes' attitude toward Thomas the butler, an African-American, while better than average for the day, will strike modern readers as appalling. That said, you'll thoroughly enjoy The Circular Staircase."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"It was kind of annoying how Gertrude, Halsey and the narrator weren't just open and honest with each other, but I really enjoyed the banter between the narrator and the other characters and it was an interesting read.

I cannot believe it was published."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957) was never a critic's darling and both her short stories and novels were repeatedly dismissed as \\"low brow junk\\"--but the reading public of the early 1900s adored her, and she had a very long and commercially profitable career. And although most of her work could be best described as \\"romance,\\" it is for her occasional mystery that she is best recalled today.Written in 1907 and published in 1908, THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE was among Rinehart's most popular works. Wealthy spinster Miss Innes is persuaded by her two wards--niece and nephew Gertrude and Halsey--to take a house in the country for the summer. But no sooner is Miss Innes and her fearful maid Liddy installed at Sunnyside then things begin to go bump in night, and murder is not far behind.THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is very much of its era: like many novels of the time it has a Victorian hang-over that shows in both its highly improbable plot and its determination to spell out every possible detail. Not a great stylist, Rinehart was never really able to shed these issues in any of her works--but if you are prepared to suspend disbelief and enter into the spirit of the thing THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is actually quite a bit of fun. There are sounds in the night, mysterious faces at the window, screaming maids, unexpected visitors, and all the rest. And the book would become extremely influential in an unexpected way.In 1917 Rinehart joined forces with playwright Avery Hopwood to adapt THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE to the stage, and when it opened on Broadway in 1920 as THE BAT it proved one of the decade's most durable shows, a mixture of mystery and comic cliche. The result was a wave of similar novels, plays, and films that not only cast a long shadow but which are still very much with us today. So wait until a dark and stormy night, pour yourself a cup of warm milk, and read THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE by flickering candlelight... and if you hear a noise in the furthermost part of the house, just tell yourself it's only Miss Innes making one of her ill-advised nocturnal investigations!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. The Circular Staircase was Rinehart's first published novel (The Swimming Pool was her last), but it is a well-constructed work in ever way. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an overlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. For some time it has been fashionable to dismiss the novels of Mary Roberts Rinehart as old fashioned. This may apply to superficial details -- such as gas lighting -- but it definitely is not true of the novels themselves which are timeless in their ability to hold the reader in a grip of mystery and suspense. The Circular Stasircase is one of the finest mystery novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"This is an enjoyable mystery in the classic mode with some deft turns. But it is completely unedited and riddled throughout with type-os and silly mistakes. Surely no person at the publishing house read this book before it was released; I'd go so far as to say no one bothered to use spell-check to detect ludicrous errors. In most cases, the correct spelling or usage is fairly easy to figure. In one, a &quot;Mrs.&quot; should have been a &quot;Mr.&quot; and that caused a bit of confusion. Readers appreciate these budget-priced editions, but couldn't someone at the publishing house give them a look after they've been scanned into the computer? Surely a summer intern in the editorial department might even have a good time reading this pleasant little mystery."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Two hallmarks of the typical Mary Roberts Rinehart (The American Agatha Christie) mystery include both a rich, aristocratic lady (usually single), and a large, spooky house -- this one features both. \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is one of Rinehart's better works, rating just slightly below \\"The Yellow Room\\" and \\"The Red Lamp,\\" in my opinion (I've read all her works). Here's THE STORY:A noble and older lady, Miss Innes, rents a remote and huge New England home for the summer from a local banker who has gone to California for his health. Miss Innes brings along her niece and her nephew (both of whom she has raised from childhood), and both of whom are in their early 20s. It's not long before the banker's son, a local rapscallion and ne'er-do-well, is mysteriously murdered at the base of The Circular Staircase. What was he doing slinking around in the house late at night? No one seems to know.However, the nephew and his good friend (a clerk at the homeowner's bank) both soon come under suspicion of having murdered the young man. In fact, the nephew suddenly and mysteriously disappears after he is involved in a significant late-night auto crash.If this all this were not enough trouble for Miss Innes, she soon discovers that her nephew's friend (the bank clerk) may have been responsible for an embezzlement which caused the bank to go belly-up, and this additionally manifests the total loss of the two siblings' huge trust fund... and her niece has fallen madly in love with this apparent thief and scoundrel!The house itself continues to generate a notable source of terror for Miss Innes along with her aged maid who is also her skittish companion. There are lots of bumps, screams, phantom-like apparitions, and nefarious other strange happenings as the long and eventful nights pass by. All this chaos causes the domestic help to leave as fast as Miss Innes can hire them. The local police detective seems befuddled by the overwhelming mess but Miss Innes resolves to stay in the house and to solve the mystery(s).There are plenty more spooky and strange happenings including a big fire, a furtive-acting doctor, the necessity to exhume a grave in the middle of the night, a pock-marked \\"veiled lady\\"... the list is almost endless. In other words, the plot is complex and the sub-plots are several.The chronological setting for \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is the Turn of the Century (from the 19th to the 20th). The book was first published in 1908, sold over a million copies, and was the premiere literary work that launched Rinehart into national fame as an author.\\"The Circular Staircase\\" has pretty much all that any mystery could offer to a reader, including the kitchen sink. Rinehart worked in just about every possible nefarious archetype and furtive activity that we ever see in the typical cozy murder. This one is like \\"The Hardy Boys\\" for adults and it gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"A few years ago, in my quest to meet all the mystery writers that have influenced the genre, I discovered Mary Roberts Rinehart. Her books may fall into the gothic romance category, but I love them for another reason. She spins a good mystery story, a \\"cozy\\" that lets us have a relaxing read without getting too graphic. But what I really enjoy is experiencing the modes/attitudes of the times she wrote about. Reading her books is like stepping into history, the day-to-day life of the wealthy and poor, and their concerns, big and small. Some of this lifestyle seems crazy to us now. At the same time, some of it is the same, merely in another form. If you follow her books, she tells a tale of how things did change for the elitist class, with characters and style along the lines of Mary Higgins Clark. The Circular Staircase was written in 1907. In many ways, it shows that people haven't changed that much at all in 99 years. It's not a serious read, but it's one that will engage you in the past and keep you up late, with a bowl of popcorn, to see what happens. If you're a Clark fan, you'll love this book, and be checking out the other Rinehart novels."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"A wonderful classic mystry, involving bloodless murders without murderer's intention. In detail nicely described complicated situations with a pinch of humor. Very well connected story dots. After reading it over 20 times, I still enjoy it. I wish they had or (will) make a movie on it."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Although her name may not resonate with the public today as much as it did a century ago, Mary Roberts Rinehart has most certainly left her mark on modern-day fiction. The originator of the so-called \\"Had I But Known\\" school of detective writing, Rinehart was, for many years, the most highly paid and popular female novelist in America. Her second novel (but first to be published), \\"The Circular Staircase,\\" which was released in 1908, when Mary was 32, featured a relatively new kind of crime solver, a no-nonsense spinster in long skirts and with an abiding curiosity; though certainly not the first lady detective, the character, Rachel Innes, certainly helped pave the way for many others (the website Wikipedia currently has a list of almost 400 fictional female sleuths!). \\"The Circular Staircase\\" has been turned into a film on three occasions, and in 1920 was transformed into a play, written by Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, called \\"The Bat\\"; Batman creator Bob Kane has admitted that the Bat character was an inspiration for him. Want more? Roberts' 1930 novel \\"The Door\\" is thought to be the source for \\"the butler doing it.\\" (Perhaps I should add here that the classic 1946 film \\"The Spiral Staircase\\" is in no way related to Rinehart's book, but was rather based on Ethel Lina White's 1933 novel \\"Some Must Watch.\\") Despite these influences and past fame, however, Rinehart was an unknown quantity to this reader, until I happened to read a very laudatory article on \\"The Circular Staircase\\" in the overview volume \\"Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books,\\" in which author H.R.F. Keating sings its praises. Fortunately, Rinehart's classic (in addition to the author's first novel, 1906's \\"The Man In Lower Ten\\") is in print today to entertain still another generation of readers.In the book, we make the acquaintance of Ms. Innes, who rents a summer mansion in the country with her grown niece and nephew. Strange things immediately start to transpire in the house: noises in the night, eerie faces at the window, a murdered man found at the foot of the titular staircase, the nephew's disappearance, holes bored in the walls, a conflagration in the stables, a man scared to death by a possible ghost, and on and on. Throughout these increasingly bizarre happenings, Rachel manages to keep her cool, only \\"losing it\\" when her nephew is abducted, she must witness a disinterment at the local cemetery, and when she is locked in a secret room in the house with the culprit responsible for MUCH of the mishegas...though not all; Rinehart's plot is way too complex to allow for a single, simple solution like that! In retrospect, to the author's credit, this labyrinthine story line, with its large number of characters, culprits and motivations, does indeed hang together and make perfect sense, although trying to recall who knew what and when may induce a major-league migraine. As one of the professional detectives in the book, Jamieson, puts it at one point, \\"It's a hash, that's what it is.\\" But Rinehart manages to keep control of her story fairly well...though not perfectly. At one point in the book, 48 hours are said to have elapsed between the staircase murder and Rachel's nephew's return to the house, whereas a careful reading reveals that only 24 hours have elapsed. Too, in one section of the book, the house's laundress, Mary Ann, packs up her bags and leaves in fright, yet is somehow listed as still working in the house five chapters later! Still, these are quibbles. \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is a wonderful story, well told by Rachel, our narrator. It is suspenseful, at times exciting, and builds to a tremendous windup in that secret room. And Rachel's acerbic relationship with her constantly flustered housekeeper, Liddy, by the way, is consistently amusing. Oh...as far as guessing the answers to the book's many riddles, my suggestion would be to not even try. This is not the type of mystery that sets out all the clues needed for a reader to solve the puzzle. Just sit back and enjoy the vintage ride, much like Rachel does in her 1908 Dragon Fly...."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Wealthy family goes to the country for a rest and gets more than it bargained for - and it doesn't include much rest!

It may change your church and make it a soul winning powerhouse if the Lord says the same.The book is written as if Charles Spurgeoun is lecturing his students on how to win souls and preach the Gospel. He goes into fine detail and avoids stale cliches and systems and scripts. Instead He implores His readers to get in touch with the Holy Spirit and do things the right way as God would have.

He has the best analogies and the best clarity of anyone I've ever read. This book on 'Soul Winning,' or leading sinners to the Savior is the best book I've ever read on evangelism... ever (and I've read quite a few). Why? Because it absolutely drives me to God. And that drives me to evangelize and be a 'soul winner.' This book absolutely rocked me, humbled me, and comforted me. It has reminded me of my own salvation and reminded me of the other salvations I have seen. The most shocking thing to me in this book was Spurgeon's absolute confidence that GOD would SAVE. He had full confidence because he knew the power in the message he preached and the God who worked through the message. It has filled me with so much wisdom and helped me to see my faults in areas I needed to see them. It heavily uses the word of God (it is Spurgeon after all) which pierces my heart. It is, I'd say, the best Christian book I've ever read in my life. MUST READ."},{"Title":"The soul-winner: How to lead sinners to the Saviour","review":"I'm surprised that this book doesn't show up on any reading lists at churches. It is awesome! Witty, thoughtful and biblically right on. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the analagies and reasoning he used to get points through.

God's grace is sufficient for us in ministry (2 Cor 9:8), but by all means, get this book and it shall be profitable to the reader as well as to the kingdom... and if you haven't done so already, grab his \\"lectures\\" as well."},{"Title":"The soul-winner: How to lead sinners to the Saviour","review":"There are many books on witnessing today, most of which are just a collection of prepared anwers to the most common objections of cultists, atheists and members of other religions. This approach may be good to sell books, but not to win souls, because it does not take count that every individual is different, and we have to adapt in order to be effective evangelizers.Spurgeon's approach is completely different. He does not give us a systematic approach to witnessing, but rather he simply explains what it means to win a soul, why it is so important, possible obstacles and so forth with so much heart, dedication and evident love for God's Word that after I finished it I was totally inspired to go out on the streets and tell everybody about the wonderful Good News of Jesus Christ.Every page is filled with personal stories, anecdotes and practical examples that make this book a pleasure to read.A must read."},{"Title":"The soul-winner: How to lead sinners to the Saviour","review":"I have long had problems with books on evangelism. Too much seems to hang in the balance according to feelings. How I feel about this or that, whether or not I feel like I ought to do such-and-such. Spurgeon unapologetically reminds us of every member of the church's responsibility to share the Gospel. Yet he provides very practical and surprisingly relevant advice for those who would wish to do so. This is the only book on the subject (outside of the Bible, of course) that has motivated me to go a-soul-winning. I would recommend it to anyone who is afraid of evangelism, a seasoned evangelist, or someone curious about this thing called evangelism. It speaks to all three and more in a timeless and accurate manner, without a hint of dryness; indeed, it's a pretty entertaining book to read overall."},{"Title":"The soul-winner: How to lead sinners to the Saviour","review":"This book should be read out aloud from cover to cover.

If you are looking for a humbling book that WILL kindle that spiritual fire in you, this is it. Spurgeon is a great author.

Romance, tragedy, personal struggle, action, violence, science fiction, drama. Although the writing itself may not to be up to par with his older-generation contemporaries, it is engaging, using many similes and symbolism.

Don't read ahead if you want to have the \\"secrets\\" of the book revealed to you while you read but if you want to know what you're getting into read this WARNING:There were a lot of creepy sexual episodes between children and adults, between relatives, with iron maidens (I kid you not), and they involved all kinds of combinations of sadism and voyerism. Which might sound good but it isn't, I kind of felt molested while reading this book, the sex scenes were more disturbing than erotic (a 13-year old niece using a strap-on device on her aunt for example). Also, I thought Elizabeth Bathory would be painted as a kind of deliciously wicked woman who's fun to hate and who you kind of have to grudgingly admire. No, she was just perverse and absolutely grotesque lacking in even basic human compassion and almost psychotic. And her descendant was bizarre, and the book had some weird fixation/obsession/fetishizing relationship with Jews. Maybe it's an eastern European thing, I don't know, but it all made me wish I could put the book down. I couldn't, which I guess is kind of an endorsement. I would justify a lot in the name of art but this is just perverse!"},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This novel starts out interestingly enough, but then seems to run out of steam. Cordrescu's idea of linking the past (Bathory), with present (the current problems in the Balkans as represented in the figure Drake), is solid. But as the novel unfolds, he barely scratches the surface of possibilities. The litany of horrors -- and there are plenty -- eventually leave the reader bored. The violence and sex become gratuitous when it becomes apparent that there is no progression in the story, and that what you're reading seems more and more like a cut and paste job. The last two hundred pages are torture (maybe that's the point). Still, you can find some good stretches in this book. But if you have something else on the shelf (King, Straub -- if its horror you want), I suggest starting there."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This book is a great combination of erotica and horror, plus an excellent plot.

The story within story set up didn't impress me, but he could have been worked it better. Historical details were Ok, perhaps one day I'll visit Hungary. The gory details were lacking. There wasn't enough anything - not enough gore, not enough history, not enough sex, not enough horror, not enough details; just not enough!

While it may beargued that the surfeit of sex and violence is precisely the point incapturing the excesses of so gross a personage as Elizabeth Bathory,I question why the author felt he also had to explore the kinks of themodern day narrator and his companions, all of whom seem to flirtwith an obsession for sex and violence reminiscent of their twistedancestor. The implication that they are all somehow reincarnations ofElizabeth and her victims, or possessed by their evil spirits, seems acontrivance, and the idea that we are supposed to glean somemeaningful historical significance out of this, or some revealingmessage about the current political state of affairs in Hungary andcentral Europe is a real stretch. Although Mr. Codrescu's style is fluidand precise, ultimately The Blood Countees had the faint odor ofauthorial self-indulgence about it and it left me feeling overwhelmed,exhausted and turned off. Malcolm Logan SelfFrame@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"As a graduate student in the area of Medieval and Renaissance Europe, I always go into historical novels with a bit of skepticism but also hopeful optimism. Codrescu's account of 17th century Hungary and the historical character of Countess Bathory met my optimistic hopes. The brutality, suspicion and general hardship of the time was obviously well-researched, as was the totalitarian power of the noble class which provoked peasant revolts like the one described in the book. The characters were possibly not developed enough, particularly the modern-day Count Bathory-Kereshtur about whom I would have liked to know more. But the complex psychological motivations of Elizabeth Bathory were developed quite well and in a chilling and descriptive manner. The descriptions of violent acts were perhaps a bit graphic, but relevant within the historical context for the period and place in which they occur. Overall a book definitely worth reading, but not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Codrescu is a talented and intelligent writer, one who understands that no amount of gore and violence can replace the magic of the true storyteller's art. What Elizabeth Bathory does to the young women who fall prey to her bizzare obsession is clearly secondary to why she does these things. Despite the rather lurid title, this book runs on taut psychological suspense.Codrescu's dual plot, or tale-within-a-tale, is presented in the frame of a courtroom confession. What propelled this reader through the book was not a tawdry &quot;whodunit&quot; conundrum, but a desire to see when and why the two plotlines would converge. Codrescu evokes character and place so skillfully that the reader experiences the same double vision as the characters themselves.The only real disappointment comes at the very end. After so much build up, so much allusion, Codrescu's denouement feels somewhat hurried, with a few threads left hanging, a few characters not quite fully utilized.Nonetheless &quot;The Blood Countess&quot; is a powerful, beautifully written novel steeped in real history and the darkness of the human heart"},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"While Codrescu's prose is clear and elegant, all those showy words can't conceal this novel's true, trashy nature. Countess Bathory is indeed an intriguing personage, but the story of her life is contorted by Codrescu's heavy-handed storyline and his unsuccessful attempts at weaving two disparate stories into one effective drama. The gratuitious sex and violence, while intended to be shocking, comes off as cheap, crude, and rather embarrassing. Those interested in the history of Countess Elizabeth Bathory should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"If nothing else, this story will remain imprinted in my memory throughout my life. &quot;The Blood Countess&quot; is absolutely the most graphic book I have ever read (and I've been reading horror/gothic/sci fi for a long time), and yet, through all my disgust and horror, I found myself unable to look away from the scene written before me. This, I finally concluded, was not necessarily because of the innate urge for humans to gawk at car accidents and watch Jerry Springer, but because I was curiously attracted to the mad genius of Elizabeth.Although the modern-day secondary story annoyed me with its shallowness and (mostly) irrelevance to the &quot;true&quot; plot, I truly admired the author's writing style, and the few moments of insight into Elizabeth's psyche touched me. Please, gentle reader, do not think that I would release a monster from its due blame - but I nearly cried the few times the Countess actually showed her vulnerability. How alone, how lost, how angry she must have felt to do such things! Her vision of reality was so skewed and disjointed that I felt I must mourn for the genius that could have done so much, but instead felt compelled to cause suffering.The use of sexuality is extremely powerful in this novel. In my darkest dreams and nightmares, I could never have conceived of such horrible torture, and at the same time the sexual naivete of Elizabeth. The fact that so many of her victims were tortured and murdered sexually simply adds to the disturbing image of the Countess. The reader can clearly see each point at which the Countess is faced with a glimpse of her own fragility and humanity - she wavers on the brink of self-understanding, then the madness rips it from her and she resumes her ritualistic pasttimes with a newfound viciousness.The author's perception of European witchcraft during this time in history is rather interesting - those who are familiar with &quot;The Burning Times&quot; as they are called in the neo-pagan communites may be shocked and horrified at the idea that women during this time had indeed incorporated the Devil into ther rituals and spells. It disgusted me, too, at first. A couple of things saved this plot-device for me: A) this is a work of (mostly) fiction, and B) It makes sense that after a few hundred years of being told that midwifery, herbal lore and women's spirituality was evil and wrong, that the women would come to believe it as well, whether they practiced it or not.On the whole, a great story with a lot of filler. It seemed to me as if the author threw the &quot;real-time&quot; scenes in to fill the story to novel-length. This, I found disappointing. I should have just skipped over these parts, because they seemed unrealistic and flat.I honestly do not know how much of Elizabeth's story is historically accurate. It may be that this novel is all fabrication and assumptions - but knowing nothing about Hungarian history, I found the intricate details fascinating. The story has a great flavor - although the explicit violence and sex may leave a bad taste in your mouth."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I understand the so-so reviews here, but I think most people are missing the biggest lure of this novel : Giving Bathory a face and motive. Because there is so little written and even know about Elizabeth, no one today can put even possibly begin to understand her or pass judgement. But this book gives her a story. I thought it was well written and interesting. Yes, there is graphic sexual and tortuous material, but to anyone who knows even the slightest bit of information on Elizabeth must realize that these aspects were primary in her life.The second plot including Elizabeth's ancestor was fascinating as well, Codrescu writes beautifully. This book is impossible to put down and humanizing Elizabeth. A good read all around."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This reminds me something of an uncensored Grimm's Fairy Tales, though far more graphic in nature (and without all the bothersome morality). No disgusting, bloody, pornographic detail was spared. More historical facts would have been nice, but let's face it: if Elizabeth Bathory wasn't such a disturbed and sadistic killer, no one would have ever bothered to research her life at all.The supporting characters (From Countess Bathory's time, at least) are truly fascnating and seem well researched. Her uncle, George Thurzo for instance, the magistrate who invented or improved upon several torture devices, can only be of the line of Thurzos at Emperor Sigmund's court during the mid-1400's. Her mentor, the Friar Silvestri, is equally interesting, though many of his exploits are obviously exagerated from hearsay.One wonders, though, why the subplot about the 'last of the Bathory line' is needed at all. The reader never finds out how Elizabeth lives beyond the grave or exactly what she wants with the character. It is, so far as I can tell, one big metaphor that never leads anywhere. I found myself skimming through every other chapter just to get to the parts about the real Bathorys.Nonetheless, while reading the book it is easy for the reader to discern what is fact, what is fiction, and what the author simply takes some artistic licnse with. I must admit that what I expected was more of a historical novel, but I have no regrets about reading it."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Andre Codrescu's &quot;The Blood Countess: A Novel&quot; first is a description of Elizabeth Bathory, the 16th Century Hungarian countess who ruled a kingdom in her warrior husband's absence. Elizabeth was an able administrator, but she is known instead for her brutal and mechanical fascination with depravity and torture. Elizabeth's obsession with youth caused her to torture and murder 650 indentured maidservants at her castle, often bathing in their blood to restore her own youthfulness.&quot;The Blood Countess ...&quot; also is the fictional interwoven story of Drake Bathory-Kereshtur, a journalist and direct descendent of Elizabeth who fled to the United States during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. During his return visit to Hungary after the fall of Communism, Drake becomes involved in a coup attempt to reinstate the hereditary Hungarian monarchy, and with his acquaintances Drake becomes entangled in Elizabeth Bathory's depraved heritage.Andre Codrescu's descriptions of depravity are troubling despite the current popularity of macabre entertainment (of which &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; is the tip of the iceberg). Yet Andre Codrescu is a craftsman and a wordsmith, and his own experiences with (gothic) Romanian culture are reflected throughout this fictional novel. Codrescu's descriptions of depravity create an atmosphere of hopelessness that reminds me of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; by Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. IMO this wonderful portrayal of hopelessness elevates &quot;The Blood Countess: A Novel&quot; from a good read to a brutal work of art."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"If you are anything like me, and were curious to read about the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory; this book is for you. The story is fictional but does contain some historical truth. This story follows not only Elizabeth's life in the 16th century but also her ancestors life in the 20th century. One who has more in common with her then he ever imagined.The story is vivid in describing scenes of sex and gore and may not be recomended to some readers. It is shocking even for someone who is not easily bothered by such themes. At parts you wonder how accuratly the author is describing Elizabeth's life but once you give the writer some liberty you can become enraptured in the story. Personally, any story involving such a wicked and baffling woman in history is going to have appeal."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I will not say that this was the worst book I ever read, nor will I call it the best. To merely shrug it off as &quot;mediocrre&quot; would be an injustice. So, I must elaborate. On the one hand, Codrescu is clearly gifted in the use of the English language. He brings forth delicate half-tones and nuances as well as straight-forward descriptions in such a way that merely reading this book becomes a pleasure, not for the content, but for the sheer beauty of the work. His talent for description and penetration into the soul of the character (and ergo, by extension, the soul of the reader), is such that the very tone of the book has a dark, burning beauty. However, that is not the whole of the novel, I would that it were. The characters, while beautifully portrayed, are two-dimensional. One gets too small a glimpse of most of them to really determine a relationship between reader and character. The plot suffers a dire fate as well. For all the exquisite language and description Codrescu uses to link the past and present, he does not quite accomplish it, and the two levels of the book stay separated. All in all, this book is worth reading. It is by no means a masterpiece, but the sheer beauty of the narrative, the magnificent descriptive imagery, and the dark, hauntingly hideous and tragic figure of Elizabeth Bathory that permeates the book make it well-worth ones time. I do not place it in the list of nominations for novel of the century, but in its genre, it is decidedly good."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I'm half Hungarian, and have been to Hungary many times. I'm 13, and I thought that this book was something I shouldn't have read! I feel that some of the sexuality was not necessary, but in a way, it explained some of Countess Bathory's actions. It was hard to finish the book (I read it in 3 days) because I felt disgusted and frustrated that Countess Bathory herself was not tortured as she had done to innocent girls. I threw the book at my wall a couple of times in disgust. This is a very disturbing book, and I don't recommend it to someone my age!"},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really enjoy Codrescu's essays on NPR, especially when they touch on topics pertaining to New Orleans, where I lived for five years. I also thought the subject matter had some potential. Unfortunately, he is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of his fellow New Orleanian, Anne Rice. The portrayal of the countess is really unconvincing. She wants eternal youth. Ok, so? She comes across as about as complex as the evil queen in Disney's Snow White. The &quot;present day&quot; subplot makes the game, Clue, seem like an Umberto Eco masterpiece of intricacy. For readers who want a complex representation of a reprehensible villain of the middle ages, go to Joris Karl Huysmans' La Bas for his depiction of Gilles de Rais, who made the Marquis de Sade look like a neophyte. Codrescu should stick to what he does best - write clever essays for NPR. He's no great shakes as a novelist."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Codrescu, though a vivid and graphic novelist who obviously took great pains in researching his work, can be a little TOO graphic at times for those of us who have an aversion to graphic, homosexual trysts. Skirting and toying with psychological explanations for Bathory's savage, perverse and sadistic actions, Codrescu DOES give forth many intriguing concepts, and artfully desribes the history with such detail that the book is swift-moving and you actually feel like you're in it. If you DON'T mind perversity and graphic verbal pornography (usually homosexual) then you should probably LOVE the book. If DO mind this stuff and can skim over these sections as I did, you'll find the piece very informative and quick-reading, darkly-disturbing and malevolent, but if you CANNOT skim these parts, do NOT buy this book, you will be offended and revolted, I can guarentee it. One reason I WAS able to get past these parts is that, unfortunately, they WERE a part of Bathory's history, an INTRINSIC part. I just wish that they were a little less graphic, I was able to skip them and get just as much out of the book... WITHOUT throwing it down in disguist! (I came close onc or twice.) One final nice piece about the book though is that it mentions the REST of Bathory's relatives, and explains THEIR different disorders and illnesses, which was interesting to see a hinting at a genetic explanation. Personally, I feel that this is a book that is VERY controversial and not &quot;toned-down&quot; or softened in the least, so you will have to make up your own mind on it. It DID leave me wanting to see if the court-case (present day) was real or a fabrication though... enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"And of course it's not. The story of Countess Erzebet(Elizabeth) Bathory and her cruel experiments, taken straight from the pages of Andrei Kereshtur's chronicles, at once mesmerize and revolt the reader.

While the squeamish might find this book too graphic, those with an intrest in true crime will find it a very unusual addition to their personal libraries."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Whether based on fact or not, this book presents a lot of questions on the nature of evil, and what turns human beings into monsters. Was it the age she lived in, what she saw and experienced, especially as a child, her loneliness, madness, or a combination of all of these? Give human beings enough pain and suffering, whether individually or as a whole, and they will dish it out themselves, in bigger and better amounts; is that what Codrescu seems to be saying? The author touches on this as being part of the very nature or Eastern Europe, ingrained forever. Unfortunately, this was not developed further. Perhaps that was the purpose of the modern day subplot, which by itself made no sense. Codrescu brings us through Hell, but never tells us why. What was his point...?

To me, it reads as merely an elaborated story based on an internet biography of Elizabeth Bathory. It almost seems like a Hollywoodized version of a book, changing details and such to make the story flow better. And a good third of the book doesn't even deal directly with Erzebet Bathory, but of some clunky trial. Is it interesting? Yes. Is it an easy read? Yes. Do you learn more about the Lady Bathory? Some. Is it worth spending money on? NO (unless its really really cheap). It seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history, but nevertheless, this is a bad novel. I give this two stars. It would be one star, but the simple fact that it is about Erzebet Bathory gives it another. Ugh."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Perhaps it isn't fair to blame the author for trying to pass off The Blood Countess as some sort of well-researched novel. It isn't.

She's quite infamous. You see, the Countess murdered over 650 young girls. She was said to bathe in their blood. This novel tells two stories, side by side. We have the tale of Elizabeth's life, filled richely with background history so maybe we can understand this woman's ways. The other story is of Drake Bathory-Kereshtur, a fictional descendant of Bathory who believes his last name will forever haunt him. The novel, rich with detail, moves back and forth between the past and the present. However, there is never really a SOLID connection made between the two. Yet, the author writes so well, it almost doesn't matter, for it's as if the stories could almost stand alone. It's a shocking read, but you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I was quite intrigued with the subject of this story, and it started off with a BANG! But it then proceeded to dwindle away. None of the characters seem fleshy, (especially the victims!!!), and l felt that l should really care about the 650 odd murders, but didn't because it was too clinical. I couldn't even read the last 100 odd pages, only flicked through, because nothing seemed to happen. I looked forward to reading this book much, much more than actually reading it. One of those that 'could've been' a good read."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I bought this book because I'm interested in the fact and mythos of the Countess Bathory. To be sure, I did expect a highly-colored fictionalized historical account, but not this...I kept reading long before I should have, mostly because I was expecting a Major Event in the conclusion of the (ultimately unnecessary) modern plotline. I should've followed my first urge and put it down -- it seems like the author couldn't decide how to end the book, and so he just ended it. A lot of side plots were left dangling with no real resolution, and I'm unsure whether this is a case of sloppy narrative or the author trying to convince his publisher to pay for a sequel.The historical plotline wasn't too bad in comparison, but not lacking in its own issues. Without being too graphic, it's painfully obvious that the author has never experienced some of the more extreme sex acts he writes about. Overall, this story reads less like a historical fiction and more like an extended dance remix of the author's personal fantasy.Blood Countess would have been a more credible tale if the first line had begun, \\"Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me...\\""},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This book is a confusing mixture. It tells the story of a rather fascinating human monster, but gives the reader no real understanding or empathy for any of its characters. The voices of the book are too removed, too cold. The countess tormented and killed her hundreds of young women with no interest in the reality of their lives and interests; the book chronicles the killings in the same manner, and thus fails to involve the reader. Even the parallel plot line of the modern-day Drake, drawn into the mystical world of immortal evil, fails to involve the reader closely. Too much blood, pain, and perverse excitement, not enough understanding. All in all, it was lurid and adolescent."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"If you were anything like myself, and were intrigued by the famous Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory; you would be interested in giving this book a chance. It is fiction so you can't read it as if it were a biography, but it does carry some historical truth to it. The story jumps from Elizabeth Bathory's life in the 16th century to the 20th century following one of her ancestors life. One who shares more with her then he ever wanted to.The story is very vivid in describing graphic scenes of sex and gore. Some parts were shocking even to someone not easily bothered by such themes. At parts you wonder how much liberty the writer took in describing her life and yet as you read on you become enraptured in the book and stop questioning what's realistic and what's not. Elizabeth Bathroy is such a baffling yet intruiging character in history that it's hard not to find this book appealing."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Turned offWhat begins as compelling and titillating finally wears the reader downwith all the overstuffed banality of pornography.

His story not only encompasses the anguish of a contemporary journalist, who bears a physical and professional resemblance to Codrescu, but the brutal history of Inquisition-era Europe, revolving around the Blood Countess, Erzebet (Elizabeth) Bathory. Both Codrescu and his protagonists are relatives of the Countess.Journalist Drake Bathory asks a judge to convict and sentence him to death for a murder he has committed. Anchored by his story, the narrative jumps from the courtroom to Drake's misadventures among contemporary neo-Fascist Hungarians, to the mazes of towers, passageways, dungeons, and stairways of not one, but several, including the &#268;achtice Castle, the exemplary creepy castle, where Elizabeth Bathory murdered an unknown number of virgins and spent her last days imprisoned in a walled chamber.It is possible that Blood Countess would be less compelling to a reader who did not already have some knowledge of the Countess's reputation and Carpathian geography and politics. I do wish maps of the region and castles had been included, but they are easy enough to find elsewhere.Codrescu's prose is exquisite and his book is a lush and bloody delight."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I borrowed this book from my husband when we were still just dating. I turned it over to him when I was finished and told him it should be burned. (Jokingly, of course) I am a horror fiend, blood and stomach-turning gore I can stand but some of the sexual encounters in The Blood Countess made me ill. (If the word 'incest' bothers you, run away from this book as fast as you can.)A few people on here were complaining about the historical inaccuracies, but a little leeway is typically given for HISTORICAL FICTION.I personally skipped every Drake chapter because the Elizabeth chapters were ultimately more interesting. The Blood Countess is beautifuly written, even during gore and sex scenes, and is as seductive and dangerous as Countess Bathory herself."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Just to give a brief example, the Peasant Rebellion led byGy&ouml;rgy D&oacute;zsa took place in the year 1514, forty-six yearsbefore Erzs&eacute;bet B&aacute;thory was born. Yet Codrescu has D&oacute;zsakilling family members of Countess B&aacute;thory in front of hereyes.The book is nothing more than anti-Hungarian propagandawritten by a (Romanian) with a politcal agenda.An earlier book by Codrescu, \\"The Hole in the Flag\\" was anoble effort, but \\"The Blood Countess\\" is disappointingto say the least."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"First off, Blood Countess is NOT a horror novel, NOT a vampire novel. Instead, it's part morbid biography, part political tract.There are two stories, told in alternating chapters. One is a fictionalization of true-life Elizabeth Barthoy's depravities (no supernatural vampire stuff, just torture). The other story is set in the present, as Barthoy's Hungarian decendent returns to Hungary to come to terms with his past.Codrescu has a dense, turgid writing style that makes for slow reading. And it's boring. Hard to imagine Barthoy's life could be rendered dull, but Codrescu manages it, despite his discomforting torture scenes. Too much \\"inner life\\" as his characters think about this or that, philosophizing and such, and not enough dialogue. And when there is dialgue, it's not crisp or pithy.Furthermore, Codrescu strikes me as dishonest and bigoted toward Hungarians.Dishonest, because the dust jacket claims that he's Hungarian, yet Codrescu is a Romanian name. In fact, his book about Romania (The Hole In The Flag) claims that Codrescu is Romanian. So which is he -- Hungarian or Romanian? Maybe it's just a case of publishers trying to slant Codrescu's bio to fit his book, but it's not an idle question, because Hungarians and Romanians have long suffered ethnic tensions and hostility toward each other.Reading the Blood Countess, I get the sense that Codrescu is a Romanian who doesn't much like Hungarians. His present day Hungarian character does much ruminating about the national crimes and sins of the Hungarian people. In fact, his Hungarian character sounds like a Romanian who dislikes Hungarians.I'm not saying which ethnic group has more to complain about. But I think readers should be aware of the animosity between these two groups, so they can take the Blood Countess's Hungarian-bashing with a grain of salt.Codrescu has also written a book on bigotry (The Devil Never Sleeps). But instead of preaching tolerance to others, he should do a reality check on his own animosity toward Hungarians."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to an informative historical novel about a truly terrifying woman. Instead what I got was a cold, dull, mildly pornographic tale.Don't get me wrong, I expected some pretty graphic stuff given the subject matter, but there were a few too many completely gratuitous sex scenes seemingly randomly thrown in. Even secondary and tertiary characters were given perverse romps in the hay. I know Codrescu is an intelligent man--you can't be an NPR commentator and be a dummy--but I can't help picturing him rubbing his hands and grinning lasciviously as he wrote this stuff.This is not the scholarly work you might expect--consider yourself warned."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I found Codrescu's account compelling and much of his prose beautiful and beguiling. The blood and other bodily fluids flow freely in this well crafted tale of gothic horror. I found some of the sex scenes a bit over the top, but then again nobody ever paid to read under the top. If you are looking for a fascinating and darkly lurid tale written in flowery and delicate language you've come to the right place.Much of the details are gleaned from history, some are creations of the author but nothing seems contrived. But in any case as a historian myself I found his efforts amusing and precious little amuses me at my age. A good read, interesting and enjoyable. I do recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I just finished this book and I must say, it's not like any other book I've read before. I have been interested in Elizabeth Bathory for awhile now, and this book was crazy! Although the book is fiction it is based on events in her life. The author didn't leave much to the imagination which led to some very graphic visuals, sometimes a little too much info. There is quite a bit of sexual content which I think was a little unnecessary and sometimes it seemed like he just wanted to throw it in there out of the blue. The story flips back and forth between Elizabeth's life and then a more current life of a relative who is pleading guilty for a murder he claims was due to his relation to Countess Bathory. I found myself almost wanting to skip every other chapter just so I could read about Elizabeth and not the other guy but in the end the author managed to tie it all together. I would recommend the book, but be warned it has some rather details passages."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"The Blood Countess is a spectacular read! If you are a fan of historical fiction and horror genres then this book is the perfect mix! Codrescu has a knack for stunning visual, and exceedingly graphic, detail. His backdrop is well researched and his main character well portrayed.Unfortunately, there is a down-side to this book, as seen by the 4-star rating, Codrescu has both a past and present take on the story, I suppose to add in the mystical element of Bathory's everlasting lunacy. The modern storyline becomes annoying and seems incomplete. Like another reviewer said below it is best to skip these parts, you won't miss anything."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"I actually thought about quitting midway through the book, but i was compelled to finish it through. The book's content is very gruesome, yet the accounts of it are true ... what gets me is &quot;how on earth could she have done what she did ...&quot; Well, towards the end of the book, it started to lose its luster ... the ending could have been better. However, I do recommend the book despite bathory's dreadful acts. In fact, it gives a person a little insight into d/s (lol)."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Sex and violence become indistinguishable in this perverted, albeit addictive, novel. I was embarresed to get so caught up in it; I only read it in private, so no one would come up to me and say &quot;Hey, whatcha readin'?&quot; The last thing I wanted to do was explain that once there was this countess who sexually tortured and murdered young girls, and oh yeah; she also sleeps with her aunt, dwarves, a big cat, her servants, and of course her husband. This girl also liked to watch people getting slowly and excruiatingly killed, a hobby she developed as a child. Then, in the present time, there's her desendant, who also gets excited by pain, both his own and others. He is terrified by his legacy, and in his final act of masochism, he begs a judge to throw him in the slammer and swallow the key. All of this, in case you were wondering, is drawn out for us in explicit, gory detail. While I guiltily enjoyed reading this well written trash, I felt kind of sick afterwards, and promised myself I would never again succum to such overwrought, voyeristic and sensational fiction again. So far I've kept my promise. By the way, I wonder if my half gleeful enjoyment, half throw-up reaction to this book has to do with the fact that I'm a female. I would love to get a male friend to read this, to see if he got at all sickened by it. Mabey I'm just a tittering girl who is too easily grossed out.

What could have been a profound philosophical delving into the desire for immortality and youth is, in Codrescu's unstable, showy prose, mere superficial shrieking, subsumed to the nuances of titillation and the flexing of the (rather useless) plot muscles.Characterizations are so &quot;clever,&quot; so unsubtle, as to make this reader roll her eyes; the writing is garish and unconsidered. Over half the book follows Elizabeth from age eight to age thirteen; then it's as if he suddenly remembered what the book was supposed to have been about, and we dash through the 650 virgins, with nary a philosophical tangent on the meaning of it all. Characters and plot points are left unused, even after we've been dragged along by their supposed importance, and this is, of course, supremely annoying. Not once in the entire book is the reader invited to ponder anything weightier than &quot;How long is this chapter, anyway?&quot;Codrescu is a second-rate writer. Don't waste your time on this; read Mary Shelley instead."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"Wow, this book was really good, yet the ending lacked something. The book goes seamlessly back and forth between the past Countess Bathory and present day Count Bathory. I really loved how Codrescu got inside the characters minds. The part about the notorious Blood Countess went into depth from her childhood, and how she became the psychopathic sadist who gained sexual pleasure from causing pain. I didn't feel he did as well with the story of the modern day Count, though. The ending should have lasted another 100 pages, rather than one chapter. The book built up to a climax then just stopped, which I found to be a major mistake. It built up to the Countess' murder of hundreds of women then just mentioned a few things in just the last chapter. I was quite disappointed in that, as I found the book to be excellent until the weak ending. I should put in a warning, though, as this book is not for young readers or for those who get offended easily."},{"Title":"The Blood Countess (SIGNED)","review":"This review is for the Dell Publishing paperback edition published in 1996, 453 pages.Andrei Codrescu is a poet, essayist, screenwriter, commentator on National Public Radio and edits the EXQUISITE CORPSE, a literary journal. He has published five novels. Some editorial reviews cite THE BLOOD COUNTESS, copyrighted in 1995, as his first novel, although he published REPENTANCE OF LORRAINE in 1993. Mr. Codrescu also wrote the words for Ersz&eacute;bet, an opera work in progress about THE BLOOD COUNTESS and the characters in his novel; the website Bathory.org/index.html has extensive information on the opera and the B&aacute;thory story.Ersz&eacute;bet B&aacute;thory, The Blood Countess, lived from 1560 to 1613 or 1614. A reasonable account of her life is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bathory, which notes that, depending on the source, she murdered from 20 to 2000 young women. In his novel, Mr. Codrescu mixes historical facts, medieval urban legends and his own inventions such as the CHRONICLES OF ANDREI DE KERESHTUR and a contemporary character, Drake Bathory-Kereshtur. The novel alternates between alleged events during the life of the countess and Drake's first person narrative before a judge in New York City.The first thirty pages of the novel suggest a literary fantasy genre, followed by the hopeful narrative of Drake, and then medieval intrigue with placid gore and limp erotica. There are hints of interesting stuff: the judge seems to have the hots for Drake, Susanna Forgach lives openly with her lover, Benezzo Gozzoli searches for his father, but alas, the author does not conclude any of his potential subplots. There are over 130 proper names in this story, and the author tries to parallel two in medieval past and narrative present, but his effort escaped me.

I began reading. It seemed a little slow at first but I soon found that I could not put it down. On chapter 3 the talons had a firm grasp and I felt like I was then and there an eye witness or \\"fly on the wall\\" as the story unfolded. I was transported to and fro in time sharing the driver's seat with the narrator. I felt love, fear and disgust all the while longing for more. This book is a drug and Andrei Codrescu is a brilliant pusher. His style comes accross as underground and rebellious as compared to other writers of the horror genre. Frankly, I personally wouldn't classify this as horror but rather historical fictional romance that just so happens to have a feared villianess at the helm. I've read some of the other reviews and yes, if you are moved by mass appeal mush and don't enjoy high brow metaphor or having to challenge yourself with unique vocabulary then this book is not for you. If you are a N.P.R. listener who has heard the author's narratives and believe this book may be in line then you may also be disappointed.

Most annoying of all, however, are the \\"current day\\" portions of the novel where the main character recounts his adventures to a court judge.

Collectively, the stories in \\"The Troll Garden\\" show the young Cather in the throes of an overtly Jamesian phase, with perfunctory nods to her later rural and Nebraskan subjects. While all are united by the theme of artistic genius and influence, none are about the artists themselves. Instead, they relate the dreams and delusions of the relatives, friends, hangers-on, and wannabes who associate with artists and either idolize or scorn them.The two most well-known stories are \\"The Sculptor's Funeral\\" and \\"Paul's Case,\\" both of which were left largely unchanged for their later versions and in Cather's 1937 edition of collected works. The first describes rural neighbors who vent their lack of appreciation for the achievements of an internationally famous sculptor when his corpse is shipped to his hometown for burial; \\"Where the old man made his mistake was in sending the boy East to school\\" is the verdict of one of the town's inhabitants. \\"Paul's Case\\" concerns a school-age boy whose flightiness and irresponsibility is exacerbated by the fanciful extravagances represented on the stage and by the glittering allure of celebrity lifestyle.Both \\"\\"A Death in the Desert\\" and \\"A Wagner Matinee\\" were heavily revised for their later publications. The first of these, filled with literary allusions and oddly detached from its Wyoming setting, benefited from the later changes, which tightened both the prose and the emotional impact. Its heroine is an opera singer dying of tuberculosis who recalls a lost love--a brilliant composer--in the unexpected appearance of his younger brother, whose own career never escapes the shadow of his sibling's renown. The 1905 version of \\"A Wagner Matinee,\\" in contrast, is far superior to its later incarnations, in which Cather had softened beyond recognition her portrait of a Bostonian woman transplanted to Nebraska who returns back East after thirty years of relentless drudgery. Although Cather's family regarded the story as a mocking and insulting caricature of her own aunt, the earlier depiction's bite and its leanness are what make it so powerful.The three stories that appear exclusively in this collection are \\"Flavia and Her Artists,\\" \\"The Marriage of Phaedra,\\" and \\"The Garden Lodge.\\" The first of these is the best; it concerns a society matron playing hostess to a gaggle of artists who take advantage of her hospitality but who can barely tolerate her pretensions. The story turns when a member of the company broadcasts his scorn for Flavia in a withering profile published by a local newspaper.Many of these pieces, in sum, should be read not simply for insights into the early development of a celebrated author; they are near-masterpieces in their own right. In them one can see a uniquely constructed literary bridge between the Eurocentrism of Henry James and the American realism of Sinclair Lewis."},{"Title":"The troll garden, (A plume book)","review":"This was Willa Cather's first published book which came out in 1905. I am singularly unqualified to comment on her entire opus, having read only one other book, and that when I was in grade school. The seven stories here certainly smack of Victorian era romanticism, that often dark and tragic force, but for all that most of them will strike you as sensitive, discerning, and very apt as far as human nature is concerned. The themes vary, but all center around people in the arts or those who lead, as Cather puts it, \\"tributary lives\\", that is, they pay homage to the arts. Perhaps that homage is a bit too earnest, a bit too cloying, for 21st century readers, or perhaps, as a first time writer, she overstated her case sometimes. Another common theme is the incomprehension of small town America towards artistically-inclined people. Thus, one escapes from the inanities of Podunk, or sinks in the mires thereof. Henry James later emphasized the theme of \\"old Europe vs new America\\" in many of his novels---Cather frequently takes up a similar strand, concentrating more on the difference between 'sophisticated East Coast\\" and \\"crude Center\\".\\"Flavia and Her Artists\\" may be the best story here---it is vivid and unlike some others, has a sharp ending. A social butterfly with cultural pretensions, plenty of money, and a tolerant, but somewhat philistine husband, tries to \\"catch\\" Manhattan artists,composers, dancers, and the like for her weekend parties and soirees at Tarrytown, NY. An invited French writer later publishes a mocking, satirical piece on the butterfly, but the husband and narrator hide the fact from the naive socialite. The upshot is that the husband takes it on the chin for no reason. In \\"The Sculptor's Funeral\\" a Kansas town can't fathom anyone different. We listen to their hickish, blind soliloquies of a town boy who went East to follow his art, but died. Only a local drunken lawyer (once the sculptor's classmate) and a horrified New England visitor understand. \\"The Garden Lodge\\" presents with considerable sensitivity an immensely practical woman who worked her way out of a ne'er do well, totally impractical family and married a rich, successful man. Now she wrestles for one night with a secret love which could 'bust everything wide open'. What's her choice ? There are four other stories as well, one, \\"The Marriage of Phaedra\\" I thought did not match up to the rest, perhaps because it is laid in England and Cather seems much better at American personalities. Sex, violence, and power do not play even a marginal role in Cather's writing; much more dreams, pretensions, failed loves and sunken ambitions. They are not modern tales, or at least, not in the modern style. But, if you're looking for some interesting reading, you could give these stories of a vanished world a try."},{"Title":"The troll garden, (A plume book)","review":"\\"The Troll Garden\\" by Willa Cather contains some of her earliest writing. She had published a collection of poetry titled \\"April Twilights\\" a couple of years earlier, and there are a couple of earlier short stories which are not included in this collection, but other than that this is the earliest example of her writing. \\"The Troll Garden\\" includes seven stories which deal with the subject of art, in some way or another.\\"Flavia and Her Artists\\" - This story was originally published in this collection. Flavia likes to put herself at the center of society by inviting noteworthy people to her house parties, though her husband, Arthur, doesn't fit in with them. In this case, it is a group which consists of several noteworthy people, including M. Roux, a novelist. It also includes Imogen Willard, the narrator of the story, who remembers Flavia's husband from her childhood. M. Roux leaves much earlier than the other guests, and when an article he writes satirizes Flavia mercilessly, Imogen tries to keep it from Arthur, but he reads it and then destroys it so that Flavia will not read it. The other guests are aware of it though, and when the subject of M. Roux comes up, Imogen believes that she notices a general agreement with what he had done. Arthur does not put up with their falseness though, and does to M. Roux in front of the guests what M. Roux had done to Flavia. When many of the guests decide to leave, Flavia mistakenly believes that it is her husband who has acted improperly.\\"The Sculptor's Funeral\\" - This story was originally published in McClure's Magazine in January of 1905. When Harvey Merrick's body returns for burial to the small town in Kansas where he grew up, the locals make fun of him, even though he was a famed sculptor. Only two people appear to truly grieve the loss, his student Henry Steavens, and his old friend, Jim Laird, who finally hears enough of the other's attacks on Harvey, and he lets them know exactly how much better Harvey was than any of them.\\"'A Death in the Desert'\\" - This story was originally published in \\"Scribner's\\" in January of 1903. This story centers on Everett Hilgarde, a man who is often mistaken for his brother Adriance, who is a famous composer. On a trip to Wyoming, he is surprised to see Katharine Gaylord, a singer who used to work with his brother, and who he knew and admired when he was much younger. They start to meet regularly, and he learns that she is fatally ill. He lets Adriance know of her situation, and his brother sends her a letter and his most recent composition.\\"The Garden Lodge\\" - Caronline Noble used to be a musician, and recently entertained a famous tenor, Raymond d'Esquerre. His visit has reminded her of her days when she was a musician, and less practical. She at first is opposed to her husband wanting to tear down the garden lodge where she spent time with Raymond d'Esquerre, but after reflection and a night's sleep, she returns to the more practical world which has become her life after music.\\"The Marriage of Phaedra\\" - The narrator, MacMaster, sets out to write the biography of Hugh Treffinger, a painter who has just passed away. He becomes involved in the dealing with his unfinished work, \\"The Marriage of Phaedra\\". Hugh Treffinger's valet and assistant, James, believes that Hugh did not want it to be sold, as it was unfinished, but an art dealer from Melbourne has offered Hugh's wife a lot of money for it.\\"A Wagner Matinee\\" - First published in \\"Everybody's Magazine\\" in February of 1904, this story is a wonderful story about a young man in Boston (Clark) who learns that his aunt from Nebraska is coming to visit. His aunt Georgiana lived in Boston a long time ago, and she loved music, so he arranges to take her to a concert. When she arrives, she is much changed and he is worried about how she will react to the event, as she seems to have lost all of what she once was. As the concert goes on, he notices more and more how it seems to be reaching her. A very touching story, and one of my favourites in this collection.\\"Paul's Case\\" - This story was first published in McClure's Magazine in May of 1905. This story starts in Pittsburgh, and opens with Paul meeting with the Principal of his school and the teachers that had him suspended. Paul's troubles don't end there, as he is drawn to the performing arts, ushering at Carnegie Hall, but his father isn't pleased with Paul's attitude, so he puts him to work at his company, while forcing him to give up his job at Carnegie Hall. Paul steals and runs away to New York to escape the life he hates. He watches the papers for signs that they know where he is, and when he sees them he is afraid of what they will do. He is resolved in what to do, and carries out his plan. This is an interesting story, and the comparison between flowers in winter and Paul's life is a good one.\\"The Troll Garden\\" is a relatively short collection of just seven stories, but is a very good collection, brought together by a common theme of the arts. Cather is best known for her pioneer type stories, and there is a taste of that in a few of the stories here, but for the most part these stories don't fit that particular style. A very good start to her career in literature."},{"Title":"The troll garden, (A plume book)","review":"The Troll Garden by Willa Cather. Collection of short stories.

While the writing and editing have remained high some such as \`eBay Hacks' have not really had great material. \`Spidering Hacks' is an improvement almost back to the quality I remember in the last contribution from Calishain, \`Google Hacks'.She and Kevin Hemenway have taken a fairly complex topic, spidering and scraping web sites and reduced it to manageable chunks in their hundred hacks. The writing has the same light, readable feel you can quickly grow to expect from O'Reilly. Certainly I have never found myself faulting their editing.There are some caveats. It seems that O'Reilly and Dornfest (the Editor of this book and the series) have fallen in love with having a hundred hacks and little in the way of an introduction. I think this may have been a better book if it was done as 90 \`hacks' and had a much larger introduction as the first chapters hacks are all too light and more truly introductory material such as how a HTML page is built and how to properly register your spider. Given that only someone with a fair amount of web knowledge is going to consider spidering a website in the first place then this early material is way too slight. From Hack 9 on it quickly gets down to useful and informative chunks in each and no longer feels \`lightweight'.This may be a reflection on trying to extend the \`Hacks' series into places it has to be forced. While the format worked well for Google and Amazon I felt the entire topic of eBay too light for a topic in this series and perhaps spidering is too heavy or complex. If this book had been written in a more traditional format some of my complaints would disappear.All the examples are in Perl and the serious part of the book starts with examples using LWP::Simple to grab a page before going on to LWP::UserAgent and much more complex requests using authentication, custom headers and posting form data. It also covers using curl and wget.Then it gets down to the nitty gritty of scraping using HTML:Treebuilder and HTML:TokeParser. This is all further expanded through the next few hacks until starting at Hack 39 through to 89 there are a good series of examples (perhaps a few too many). Finally there are two chapters on maintaining your collection and \`Giving Back To The World' which tells how to make it easy to scrape your site and using RSS.O'Reilly have a page for the book with ten example hacks, index, Table of Contents and errata and you can also visit hacks.oreilly.com for the same ten hacks with the possibility of more being added.As a whole this volume seems a little thin. If you've been doing the maths then you've realised that only about thirty of the hundred hacks actually give any details on building and running a serious web spider. Sure, a number of the examples provide good information on how to perform various tasks and some of the last eleven hacks are good to know but in all the book feels like it lacks solid information throughout. A bit more information on various crawling and page parsing techniques would have been good.After that criticism I'm now surprising myself, I'm going to recommend this book. This isn't a large field and when you consider that most other books on writing spiders and crawlers are less than practical and more than expensive \\"Spidering Hacks\\" has many good points. It's written for the practical Perl programmer, it examines several methods and gives lots of examples and while not cheap it's certainly inexpensive. Given that I found it both useful and inspiring the complaints above may be a little like nitpicking. I should also say that I found this volume immensely useful in writing my own spider and scraper (it gets a list of new books from the web sites of several publishers.) I have to be honest and admit that there are three publishers, O'Reilly, Addison Wesley and Prentice Hall, from whom I expect a decent standard and criticise a little harder when they move from that norm. If this book had come from SAMS or Wrox I may well have not looked quite so hard for flaws and been a little more generous in my treatment of the ones I found.That said, I recommend this book to you if you want a practical introduction to building a web spider in Perl."},{"Title":"Spidering Hacks","review":"The book has a nice collection of case studies on how to gather data from disparate websites. You might consider this as showing a simple way for you to use Web Services.Spidering is the way that search engines gather their data. But you do not have to be Altavista or Google to use spiders. Nor do you have to be scanning a large fraction of the Web. The authors demistify spiders. If you can follow their examples, then you get concrete instances of usage that might help your particular application.Thoughtfully, the examples are mostly written in Perl, with a few in Java. These languages should be familiar to many. Though even if you don't know them, the logic of the code can still be useful. (That is, you can treat the code as pseudocode.)While spiders are probably best known as being used by search engines, they are really only the starting point for the latter. The much harder problems start when you have the data amassed by a spider. Now you have to efficiently find correlations between the various web pages. You should be aware that the book does not discuss these with any significant depth. Not surprising, because these are outside the scope of the book. The examples do show how to use the data found by spiders. But most of these are for web pages that sit in a given domain. So the pages are closely affiliated in content and structure."},{"Title":"Spidering Hacks","review":"Once in a long while you get a book that inspires you with a lot of great small ideas. Spidering Hacks is just that type of book. The web has a wealth of structured and semi-structured that is just waiting to be mined with automated tools. This book not only teaches you how to get the data out of these sources, but gives you idea about where to look for information and what to do with it.This book demonstrates everything I like in a technical book. It not only describes how things are done. It also gives practical examples of how the technology can be useful in the real world, and presents them enthusiastically. It makes you want to go out and implement all of the ideas and to keep on going with some of your own.Nitpicks I have with the book are minor. The 'Hacks' format seems imposed, for example, hack #8 is about installing CPAN. I don't think that section should be left out, but I don't think it's a hack either. But hey, I don't care that much about the structure as long as it isn't an imposing flaw and the content within the structure is great, as it is with this book.Have to say, O'Reilly is on a roll with the Hacks series. They have all been fine books."},{"Title":"Spidering Hacks","review":"If you are a Perl lover and looking for a book to help you extracting contents from this huge resourceful Internet, this book quite fits your needs.

He shows you how to use Perl modules on crawling web pages, logging on to systems, extracting specific contents, and massaging data to your needs, across 100 different scenarios. Most of them are practical, but they don't cover much of the details, you have to read the programs listed in the book, which is quite painful for non-Perl people like me. In addition, it doesn't provide much of resulting screen shots after running the sample codes. Most importantly, the author tries to avoid the copyright questions by delegating URL links for readers to reference.

This book is about how to create programs that perform the functions of a web crawler, with most of the Hacks being written in Perl. Like the rest of the Hacks series, this book presents 100 bite-sized chunks of code or technique to tackle specific activities. In this book these range from the simple - how to download a set of image files - to the complex - cross-referring the output from one site with another to generate a third set of data. No matter what the complexity, each hack is clearly explained, with the code samples balanced with instructions, examples and notes on how to hack the hack.As already mentioned, the hacks in this book mostly use Perl, though scattered here and there you'll find some Java, Python and PHP. If you really hate Perl, then you will not like this book. On the other hand the authors assume only a rudimentary knowledge of Perl, and there is no requirement for any knowledge of network programming of any description. After the opening chapter which gives guidance of being a good spidering citizen (how to respect the sites you are taking data from), there is a second chapter which details how to create a spidering toolkit (how to find and install the site of modules that many of the hacks depend on).With a toolkit in place and a knowledge of good behavior, the book dives into the various hacks that are organized by topic: collecting media files, gleaning data from databases (with many examples for Yahoo!, Amazon, Google, Alexa and other popular information sources), maintaining your collections (more automation with \\"cron\\" or other scheduling tools) and a final chapter on giving something back (creating a web service, generating RSS feeds and so on).The bulk of the hacks are in chapter four, which looks at extracting data from databases. Aside from the obvious sources such as Amazon and Google, these including online banks, tracking FedEx packages and more. There are a range of techniques used to grab and filter the data, so even if a data source you want to use isn't listed, the chances are that one of these hacks can be refactored to do what you want.If Perl is not your thing then the very light sprinkling of non-Perl hacks probably isn't enough to make this a worthwhile purchase. If you're a Perl hacker interested in spidering there is a ton of stuff for you here without doubt. Also, if you are a student looking for a good supplement on building a web spider from scratch, this is probably not the book for you either, but the various hacks will give you some ideas on what you might want to do in your own spider if you wish to write one in a higher level language such as Java.

But how much of my work could actually be shortcutted if I was using the most recent Perl modules?"},{"Title":"Spidering Hacks","review":"I've always wondered what a spider was and now I know what a scraper is too. The book provides a lot of info and links. I've just started and am happy so far."},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"Anyone who has travelled past an Indian mound has been curious about the true origin of them, and who or what may continue to occupy them. This book presents an histoical point of view of the possibilities threading its way between a steamboat exploding on the Missippi River in the 1800's and more recent events in a rivertown in Iowa. The story moves quickly and the characters are compelling such that the reader wants the tale to continue past its ending. The past and present are tied together in the end in a credulous manner, and left me waiting for the next episode."},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"Ordinarily, I am not much of a fan of supernatural thrillers. But when the son of the neighborhood grocer wrote one set in our little hometown, my mother decided that I needed an autographed copy for Christmas. I could not have been more pleased with the gift.In his very first novel, Keith Schulz has crafted a suspenseful and clever horror tale set in the craggy bluffs and swampy islands of the Mississippi River surrounding a thinly disguised Burlington, Iowa. One might wonder just what sort of creepy setting a Midwestern river town can provide. I assure you that Schulz has used this unique setting as deftly as his predecessors used Transylvanian castles and Scottish moors. He takes full advantage of local lore, particularly the many prehistoric burial mounds that dot the bluffs along the river, to create a unique stage for terror and mayhem. The result is a gripping atmospheric story that is very much in the gothic tradition, yet fresh and original.At long intervals, the environs of \\"Bruders Landing\\" are threatened by a terrible menace lurking deep within the bluffs, a menace simultaneously as natural as the 17-year locust and as supernatural as a vampire. When the horror erupts again in the summer of 1956, the dark secret of The Gathering and their ethereal Keepers are remembered by only two elderly residents: a homicidal mortician and a reclusive woman rumored to be a witch. Suspense builds as a pair of teenage cousins, aided by an ex-Chicago cop running from his past, piece together the town's horrible secret and frantically work to prevent a bloodbath. If you are a fan of the genre, I recommend this book to you; if you're not a fan, I recommend it even more highly, as a most engaging read. This book is definitely &quot;a keeper&quot;!"},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"For fans of dark mysteries, KEEPERS OF THE RIVER is a welcome surprise. More and more this genre is littered with worn-out plots, undeveloped and uninteresting characters, and mediocre writing. Not so with KEEPERS! The author has come through with a riveting pageturner that transcends the genre. He has developed a complex plot that is completely original and filled it with believable people I cared about. Then he put the reader in a setting, the Upper Missippi River valley, that is highly atmospheric and perfectly suited for a good creepy read! To add to our enjoyment, the story spans a century, which lets readers experience the steamboat era and revisit the fascinating 50s--and it works! The ending leaves things open for a sequel...I hope so!"},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"What could possibly happen in a small Mississippi river town that would cause suspense and death over many decades? A very exciting trip from the 1800s to present day made more interesting by the author's use of time changes. The author is clearly familiar with both the menacing and tranquil aspects of the river. This is fiction but I am sure almost everyone who has been through a small town in America will relate well to the characters in this book.Even more exciting is that this is the first book by Keith Schultz. Hopefully we have more to come."},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs, the mounds, the islands and caves of the river. The author did a nice job of taking me from nostalgia all the way to the occult. I loved the mystery and dark secrets of the river.Schulz has a bit of Stephen King lurking about. Are his \\"keepers\\" of the same breed as Kings \\"low men\\"?If you have been to the river read the book."},{"Title":"Keepers of the River","review":"\\"Keepers of the River\\" is a page turner. It's a mystery with plenty of action and good dialogue...something you would like to see in the movies.

I was in junior high school then, and being able to pick out this fact or that fact was quite an accomplishment for my age group. This book was quite long, and the amount of feats and facts was in it was a challenge to go thru, but still manageable at under 500 pages. Nowadays, the Guinness books have all sorts of stuff that were not included back in 1989, like the longest ear hairs!. But we have the Internet now, which can provide all sorts of facts that even the people of Guinness could not have imagined."},{"Title":"1989 Guinness Book of World Records","review":"I love to flip through this book.

It takes a really long time to fully work through this book from start to finish, but it is worth every minute. Especially if, like me, you haven't been to college. I can only speculate that in school you'd have a few good writing classes that teach these concepts. This book will open your mind and you'll really begin to understand the importance of word order and general organization in writing. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Writing Prose: Techniques and Purposes","review":"This book is fantastic! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their writing.

Superb, courageous, inspired writing!"},{"Title":"The St. Veronica Gig Stories","review":"This book is great. The discriptions are so vivid I feel and smell New York when I read it. The characters are more than believable. I read this book more than once to get everything out of the intense writting style."},{"Title":"The St. Veronica Gig Stories","review":"Pulaski's portrayal of family life in Brooklyn is masterful. By seamlessly incorporating Yiddish-English dialect into his prose and describing both cityscapes and internal psychological landscapes in painstaking detail, Pulaski draws me into most of his stories.I thought that the stories depicting his wife's side of the family fell flat, took confusing turns, and were generally less believable. The early sexual experiences of a young girl and the inner workings of this other family seemed to me beyond his knowledge, and thus beyond his considerable ability.All in all, it's worth reading and I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"The Prophet's Army: Trotskyists in America, 1928-1941 (Contributions in American History)","review":"Myers presents an excellent example of how NOT to do politics.

It is amazing how many parent's I have spoken to who have a pediatrician who misdiagnoses their babies reflux. This book can prevent that since it provides so much information on signs and symptoms of so many GI disorders, diseases and aliments.The book is very easy to follow and the information is very easy to understand. This book should be given to new mother's when they leave the hospital and should be on every pediatrician's desk.

While the book is written for pediatric patients it provides information for kids and adults alike. Who knew there is a new food pyramid???We highly recommend this book to all parents who have questions about what do to when your baby is just not feeding right or feeling well. Also it provides clear and concise information on overall general health and well being.

He will still be talking about it when ninety, perhaps even 100. The author is Peter Newell and his middle name must be \\"Methusaleh\\"?The concept of the hole shooting through each page of rhyming text has proved popular through the decades, mostly with boys, I suspect. They are probably attracted by the emphasis on ACTION, and IMPLAUSIBLE, OUTRAGEOUS EXCAPADES, even though there is a moral to the story: that guns are not to be handled carelessly.Here is a sample, and you can visualize the bullet traveling to liberate the mouse:\\"A cat espied a tiny mouse,And crouched to make a spring;The mousey couldn't find a placeIn which to hide -- poor thing!Just then the bullet made a hole --A fair-seized hole at that --And in it dashed the frightened mouse,And thus escaped the cat.\\"On the very last page the bullet lodges in the bride's not-very-light cake.

I believe it is an original copy from 1908. It has a grey cover and believe me, the hole is right where it should be. I loaned it to my daughters 1st Grade teacher and she really appreciated its mastery and originality."},{"Title":"THE HOLE BOOK","review":"My parents were given this book when they were children, read it to me when I was a child and now I read it to my children. Children thoroughly enjoy this book but it wasn't until I picked this book up and started to read this as an adult did I fully appreciate why Tom Pott's bullet suddenly stopped when it hit the new brides freshly baked cake. Read this book to your children and yourself, for all of you will enjoy this book tremendously."},{"Title":"THE HOLE BOOK","review":"Of all of the books that I read when I was a child, this is the only one that I truly never forget. I have captivated the attention of my friends and their children by reciting some of the best verses. The rhyme and meter is exquisite, providing an almost musical theme through each episode. The vocabulary is perfect for young people and fun for adults. It utilizes advanced words, while not burying their meaning from beginning readers. The characters lend themselves to creative new voices for each reader to explore. All of theses remarkable qualities, and it maintains a serious lesson for young people, that guns are not for fooling around."},{"Title":"THE HOLE BOOK","review":"I remember this 1908 book from my childhood. My copy originally belonged to my father (born in 1900), and would probably be a priceless collector's item now (along with those baseball cards from the 1940's), but it got lost some time in the last 60 years! So I enjoyed this book as a nostalgia trip, and the text and pictures were even cleverer than I remembered them. A couple of caveats... as other reviewers have pointed out, the registration of the hole isn't very good, which detracts from some of the pages. And the book isn't complete: without notice, at least one pair of pages that I remember (possibly more) has been censored, as a rather mild racial stereotype (which is why the book has the rather odd number of 56 pages)."},{"Title":"THE HOLE BOOK","review":"Frankly ALL the Newell books, like The Slant Book, should be published in near-original format by some hyper-sharp publishing house. The original publisher took great care to be sure the book functioned perfectly as an object, the registration is flawless, which isn't the case here. This is brilliant stuff and yet more evidence that our ancient ancestors of about 100 years ago may have been a little sharper than us in a lot of ways.For now this sloppy so-so edition will have to do, but in so many quality ways it really isn't even close to what was regular kid book standards back then (honestly, few kids books nowadays match what I'm finding from back then--illustration is getting just awful for starters). Five stars for Newell who was only a recent discovery and a happy one."},{"Title":"THE HOLE BOOK","review":"This is a crummy reprint of a wonderful classic children's book. First of all, there is no hole in the book, which spoils the novelty. Second, the original colors are missing, as the pictures are all printed in black-and-white.

It makes fun of black people and a wild animal gets killed."},{"Title":"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy","review":"Speculative fiction, at least that popular in the West, usually projects Western and White attitudes into the future or supernatural situations. This important book, which gets its title from a quote by Harriet Tubman, collects stories on such matters from people of color who have been informed by the colonial experience in their homelands. These submissions often utilize non-Western storytelling techniques featuring unexpected moral constructions and non-linear plotlines. Thus, several of these stories seem to have abrupt and inconclusive endings, but that's if you perceive them in a standard linear fashion. Meanwhile, a common motif in this collection is science fiction treatments of White/European colonialism through the eyes of aliens who are being colonized by humans. That's a great twist on a trusty sci-fi device, but many of these writers apparently came up with the concept before constructing their plots, leading to some stories that are very contrived and preachy (the most heavy-handed example is by Carole McDonnell).But on the other hand, the stories here are almost uniformly haunting and incredibly thought-provoking for informed readers of any culture. Karin Lowachee and devorah major really make the aforementioned humans-colonizing-aliens motif work in exciting ways. Tobias S. Buckell offers an intriguing space war with a Mesoamerican twist, and Opal Palmer Adisa brings redemption in an alternative history of slavery. Wayde Compton creates a marvelously updated version of a piece of old African folklore, to illustrate post-human discrimination, while Larissa Lai finds the inherent humanity and prejudice of supposedly inhuman robots. The most moving tale here is by Celu Amberstone, in which humans who have been forcibly relocated by aliens to a new planet try to connect with this strange new Earth in a Native American fashion. As with any collection of stories by different authors, some submissions here work better than others, with preachiness being a common drawback. But overall, this is an especially stirring collection of tales that tackle shopworn sci-fi and fantasy concepts from fresh non-Western viewpoints, offering the reader new ways of looking at the past, present, and future of the real world. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy","review":"Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan have joined forces to produce a powerful and insightful anthology of Science Fiction literature from a broad spectrum of experience and (counter) experience. Please note, Amazon doesn't credit Boston-based professor Mehan (who teaches at Emerson College) with having much to do with this book, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out he had just as much say in assembling the contents as did his co-editor, Nalo Hopkinson, the famous novelist of Canada whom many credit as being the \\"next Octavia Butler.\\" Together they make an imposing duo and they are wise indeed both in what they decided to do for and the people to whom they appealed for new work. The result is smashing and one of the very best books of 2004.Wayde Compton's \\"fairy tale\\" is almost too beautiful to describe. A \\"growing ball of light as bright as a sky full of half moons\\" appears to our hero and tells him that his name is Mr. Polaris. By the way, the hero is called Lacuna and thus describes the position of writers of color, often, marginalized within the already marginalized community of science fiction. That is, it's a world filled with its own rules and domains, yet those in charge of the dominant culture regard it with skepticism and even violence, based on the fear of losing their own Antaean strength--the exploring strength of the colonizer.The blind Victorian writer Celu Amberstone contributes a diaristic and chilling account of a mother-daughter relationship gone tragically wrong. In this brief and pointillistic tale, the daughter is called \\"Sleek\\" and she is almost like the spirit of the mother before society's pressures (and the pressures of colonization) took the free will out of her. The months and the days are each given beautiful and poetic names. The penultimate entry will bring tears to your eyes--even if you are a rock.I wish I had time to list all the stories and what makes them good. Before I sign off I could add that, although Compton and Amberstone are both Canadian, the anthology has many writers from other parts of North America too, including the USA, as well as from other parts of the world. This world--our world. The editors have skillfully suggested to their readers the ways in which all science fiction embodies aspects both of colonizing and post colonialist teleology. It's an eye opener. Hooray for Arsenal Pulp for bringing us the news in this handsome and durabe volume."},{"Title":"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy","review":"The stories are short but packed with depth and information. Fantastic writing from authors who should be paid attention to. A must buy for anyone interested in postcolonial writing, science fiction, race, and gender among others."},{"Title":"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy","review":"As the author of,The Second Virgin Birth, I have to say that Hopkinson book is very believable, with well developed-characters with amazing dialogue that surrounds several action-packed stories that will keep you guessing the entire time. It's an easy read, and extremely well written."},{"Title":"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy","review":"This book entails a lot of highly politically charged post-colonial science fiction. It felt a lot like reading a poetry from an annual collection for people interested in post-colonial literature. The works in this book are more serious, mature, and anchored in the real world than most traditional science fiction. If your a fan of most western science fiction, brace yourself for a very different style. It wasn't my cup of tea - again too political for me."},{"Title":"Help! I'm Trapped in My Sister's Body","review":"14 year-old Jake Sherman is in major trouble this time! He has his online pen-pal coming with her father to see him all the way from Japan. Through some E-Mail conversation, he has led her to believe that he is a star athlete, when in real life he's awful. He needs to find a way out of his predicament fast, so he switches bodies with his star athlete sister, Jessica. While being &quot;trapped&quot; in 16 year-old Jessica's body, Jake runs into some odd problems and predicaments, including having to go on a date as Jessica. This book is a great read for all ages. Before you read it though, ask yourself this question. (Actually this question applies to all of the books in Strasser's Body Swapping series.) How would YOU like to be someone else for a day?"},{"Title":"Help! I'm Trapped in My Sister's Body","review":"This was a great book. Jake switches bodies with his sister because he wants his pen pal from Japan to notice him. But something goes wrong and they are not able to switch back to their normal bodies.

So as jake tries to find a way to get out of this means, he can only come to one conclusion, he must switch bodies who is great at sports. Through his searching jake can only come up with one person in mind, his sister Jessica. They had only planned to switch for a half day, but they had to stay the whole day.

I'm Trapped in My Sister's Body","review":"This is basically the only book in which Jake Sherman switches bodies with a girl, if you don't count the supermodel book. The main characters are Jake, Jessica, Josh, Andy, Sumi, Stacy and a couple others. The plot is this: Jake has led Sumi into believing that he is a star athlete. Too bad he stinks at football! So, he switches bodies with his sister, Jessica. They have to put up with an almost-permanent makeover and a carnival with Jessica's boyfriend, Dan. In the end, they get caught by their principal while trying to switch back! Very good book! I guess this is why Todd Strasser made this series-to make sure that you never switch bodies with anyone; it could cause too many close calls! If you liked this book, I also reccomend: \\"...In a supermodel's body, In my lunch lady's body, and In my Principal's Body\\"."},{"Title":"Help!

I'm Trapped in My Sister's Body","review":"i love this book, but it doesnt compare to the other Help!s. ok, so the insults exchanged at the beggining of the book were lame. 'your brother's so stupid he sat on the tv and watched the couch.' 'you're so uncoordinated you slept on the floor and still fell out of bed' uh huh. i also thought the whole 'let's be nice to each other' was kind of corny too. BUT i love the whole thing where Jake is trapped in Scarcely Hers, a major girly store, and he's obsessing about Girl Rays that he thinks are gonna stunt his growth, take away his manhood[no i dont mean it like that, sicko!], and scar him for life. that was again, lame, but very cute. and GEEZ, why'd he have to CRY at the end? being a girl isn't that bad! but the funniest parts were when Jake was bad-mouthing Jessica's boyfriend, Dan Winters, a flirt with bad acne."},{"Title":"Help!

It saw reprints for nearly thirty years as fiction seemed to evolve into broader forms and more convoluted theories came to prevalence, but even today Foster-Harris' principles can be observed.The book uses simple language and illustrations that are also very effective in conveying a larger idea of plot, assuredly the result of the author's experience as an instructor. As such, this would be suitable for the youngest student while offering an effective analysis of plot structure that may have eluded even experienced writers."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"This book is not worthy of the \\"Unleashed\\" series, which typically has stellar books. Mostly just marketing level advice with very little in-depth information. You can get more information out of a Google search."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I purchased the second edition of this SharePoint book and received it a few days ago. No joke folks, this book has been masterfully rewritten. I felt it was important to mention this as I think many of the negative comments on this board were in regards to the first edition. A colleague of mine owns the first edition and there is a definate improvement to the book. The \\"fluff\\" that plagued the first edition is gone, and is replaced by some serious content on site design, database maintenance, and step by step guides to all aspects of using SharePoint. For those who are looking for a developer's guide, this still isn't it, but it is by far one of the most solidly written guides to SharePoint available today."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I picked up a copy of SharePoint 2003 Unleashed at TechEd and was happy that I did. It answered many of the questions that I had about the product, and included some good best practice info that I have started to use with our WSS implementation here. Only downside to the book was that it didn't go into much detail on custom programming with SharePoint, but 95% of what I needed was covered. I would definately recommend it if you were looking for a good, solid reference and design guide for a SharePoint project."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"Well done!Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I grabbed this from the company bookshelf to learn more about SharePoint and how I might use it to for simple document collaboration. I forced my self to read on even though things are not really explained and the reading is quite dry. I got to Chapter 6 and I had to quit....I still don't see any light.I've read enough books to know that it may take another chapter or 2 before you start to 'get it', I never got any of it. The book basically goes right into site design from architecture and site design/layout. Problem is they skipped telling you just what all these things are....Portal(s), Area(s), primary site, sub site, sub area, Topics and many other SharePoint terms.It's like they assume you know what all of these things are, maybe it's covered later. Problem I have is that I got to know what a 'widget' does before I can think about how to use it. Up through chapter 6 I have only vague ideas of what all these SharePoint things are and how I might use them.Maybe a simple reordering of chapters could help. SharePoint in itself is confusing as well it consists of 2 things 'SharePoint Services' and SharePointPortal Server'.I'm a developer going on 20 years of coding experience and quite a few books under the belt. While this book is not a 'coding' book I should be able to learn from it but I didn't. I have given up on very few books in my career and none recently."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"When I first started working my current job, I was given this book. I have to say that this is an extremely boring book. It didn't engage me in any shape, form, or fashion. Learning SharePoint is already difficult and this book does not make it any easier. I am glad I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"This is a good book and as a reference guide, it's great. I do feel that the editing could be better, it is easy to spot that different authors worked on this book. If the diting had been better and the very trivial first few chapters had been shortened somehwat I would have given this book a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"This book is a long winded explanation of the features of SharePoint 2003. It provides redundent how tos with little explanation of how to do anything that is not vanilla out of the box. I suggest simply becoming familar with the Administrative Guide that Microsoft produced. You'll be you degree closer to the source and 33 dollars richer in the pocket."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"It would be easy to mistake this book as a developer reference, having the book come from SAMS. This is not the case however. As a developer, i was extremley disappointed in the content this book contained. There are no code samples whatsoever, and no discussion of building custom web parts. Moreover, very important information has been completley omissed from the text. Things like customizing the look and feel of the portal by integration with frontpage 2003, and utilizing the complex nature of the single sign on service are not discussed for more than a paragraph, and these are very important points for anyone designing any sharepoint solution. This book can be described as a power user manual and implementation guide at best. If you're looking for a book with a lot of fluff, no examples on how to do things you are going to need to know how to do, some examples on things that are already self-explanatory, then this is a perfect book for you. Basically the information in this book is a poor rewrite of the SPS administrator manual that is on the cd. There is some helpful information in this book on certain topics, but it is not nearly as comprehensive as you would think it should be for its size."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint. The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system. My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I've purchased both this book and the Resource Kit and tried to use them like lifelines because my company is going ga-ga over SharePoint (and I mostly agree). While this book has a lot going for it--it's well written and has a good teaching point of view, I've found a ton of errors in it that have caused me to lose my confidence in it. I still refer to it as a tutorial, but it's an awful lot of money to pay for a book that I can't trust. My advice is to rely on the Resource Kit as a reference and only buy this book as a teaching guide."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"As someone that reads alot of books, both technical and non-technical, this is definetly the worst written book I've ever seen. It seems it has not been read by any editors.You can find typos, spelling mistakes, grammar errors and such all over the place. The authors just copy-pasted some of them over and over again. The text is boring to death, and for some reason, the least needed parts are repeated several times. For example, the meaning of \\"Description\\" of a field in a list is explained more than a dozen times in less that 5 pages.All of this, even before touching the content and subject of the book itself. The order of the content was not well thought of, the style of writing is boring, and the content itself is not very informative.As a developer, I did not expect to find much on the development side of SharePoint, but I doubt that even technicians and solution architects will find much help in this one."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"(actual review is 2.5 stars). Even though this book has a lot of pages, the content is pretty shallow and it suffers from an apparent desire to address to many different types of reader, from the developer to the administrator, to the technology decision maker. The result is that the book is weak in two key areas: development and administration. For readers who want reasonable depth in those areas, I suggest finding another source. For readers who want a broad brush, the book is a fine work."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I do SharePoint administration and development and own the other five SharePoint 2003 books currently on the market. This book is useless from any perspective except perhaps as a doorstop. It just repeats the same content chapter after chapter about the features of SharePoint while offering no insight as to installing, configuring or developing. You would get more insight about SharePoint reading a product brochure or just cruising Microsoft's web site. Avoid this book!"},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I was a bit skittish about buying this book based on some of the negative reviews. Having played around with the software but still having alot of questions, I wanted to judge for myself so I picked it up at the bookstore. If you can make it through the first section, which is basically fluff, there is some excellent content in the later parts of the book, particularily in the sections on Office use with SharePoint and SQL maintenance of the databases, which is not covered much at all in the other SharePoint books out today. My guess is that many of the other reviewers may have stopped reading after the first few chapters, and I can't really blame them. I would agree that it is better to skip them and going straight to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Microsoft SharePoint 2003 Unleashed (2nd Edition) (Unleashed)","review":"I have had this book for almost a year now and read almost the whole thing. One aspect of this book which makes it a very worthwhile read is the clear differentiation which the authors maintain between Windows Sharepoint Services (free to implement) and Sharepoint Portal Server (can be VERY expensive.) Most Sharepoint books I have read fail to make this distinction and suffer greatly for it. I very much appreciated the clear differences between the products.This book is a great primer for someone looking to get a Sharepoint implementation up and running (which I have been.) Understanding scalability, using farms, managing the databases are all covered in sufficient detail to be able to implement it yourself and have it survive use.I was disappointed that the scope of the book wasn't wider. I would loved to have seen some developer information, or at least a list of resources. I would also liked to have seen more guidance on creating sites, organization of sites and other setup information. Perhaps a better title would have been Sharepoint 2003 Infrastructure Unleashed.With those comments, I can also say that I'd buy another volume of this and appreciate the authors attention to detail, especially in clearly differentiating between the free and the expensive Sharepoint products."},{"Title":"500 Best Vacation Home Plans","review":"I was dissapointed with this book, from a title standpoint. &quot;Vacation homes&quot; are not how I would categorize the plans in this book - although there are some nice plans. I would consider almost all 500 of them to be regular home plans - there certainly wasn't much available here that was less than 1200 sq ft. Not quite the cozy lakeside cottage I was looking for!"},{"Title":"Red Land Yellow River: A Story from the Cultural Revolution","review":"Experience the Chinese Cultural Revolution through a teen's eyes in Ange Zhang's straightforward and poignant autobiography. After his father, an intellectual seen as a counter-revolutionary, is publicly humiliated and later arrested, Zhang's shame grew, as an adolescent's could, towards his own family. In 1966, at the age of 13, he wants desperately to fit in, and not be labeled the \\"bad guy's son\\". In time, Zhang creates his own faction of the Red Guard, alienating himself further from his family until an experience unravels his fervent idealism. Gradually, he is re-awakened when he discovers his father's hidden books. Locked in bookcases sealed with paper strips bearing the Red Guard's seals, Zhang takes the hinges off the book case doors to keep the locks and seals intact. Day after day he stays inside his house reading banned books by Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens, and Jack London. He realizes through reading that each of us is unique and needs to pursue our own destiny. By the end, his family is re-united and Zhang is able to pursue the life of an artist.Zhang's moving account is illustrated with lush digitally rendered pictures of everyday life during Mao's Cultural Revolution, and accompanied by reproductions of period posters, black and white photos and artifacts. His striking artwork is reminiscent of silk-screened posters, and you will be astonished by his lovely work. A fine appendix expands the historical context.Earning a *Starred Review* from Booklist, Zhang's stirring experience gently unpacks a hopeful message to resonate with all pre-teens: oppression cannot squelch individuality and the power of dreams. For ages 8 and older."},{"Title":"The works of John Wesley","review":"Great Value! These seven volumes are actually fourteen volumes, re-issued as seven, with two \\"volumes\\" in each book. These are nicely boundIf you contrast the content in these volumes with Christian books which are enjoying popularity today, you might wonder why you wasted your time on the popular stuff. Wesley changed the English-speaking world, especially the working class. His sermons are awesome. When you read his sermon \\"Against Evil Speaking,\\" you may find yourself carefully guarding your tongue, and thoughts. Wesley's sermon against bigotry may help you become more tolerant of others -- this from the most prominent teacher and preacher of holiness in modern times.You'll have to work at some of the reading, but it is well worth the effort. This set of books lends itself well to browsing. You don't have to read huge chunks at a sitting. There is a wide variety of writings in these volumes. You'll get more than your money's worth in pleasure and intellectual/spiritual profitIf you enjoy these books, you would probably enjoy William Wilberforce's \\"A Practical View of Christianity.\\" Wesley's fans credit him and the Methodist movement (not today's United Methodist Church) with averting the kind of bloody revolution experienced by France. Wilberforce is rightly credited with bringing down slavery in Great Britain. Together, these English giants revived Christianity in the English-speaking world: relying upon the Bible, they showed Christians what God expects of us.

You can export the entire text to either WordPerfect or RTF (no PDF or MS Word option) but even then all 7 (or 14) volumes are contained in one giant file. You can search for particular words, but I haven't found any topical search (ie - I want a sermon on sanctification). And the worst for any $50 product, there are misspellings in the text!!

Actually, in practice, the greatest usage is of the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is provided by the US government and its Department of Defense. The dominance of GPS in satellite navigation is probably comparable to Microsoft on the computer desktop. To the layman, GPS is synonymous with satellite navigation. Thus, much of the book is devoted to explaining GPS.But not exclusively. The authors also explain how the European Union is rolling out Galileo. In part to build out its own technological capability in this field, and to not be solely dependent on the US. The text goes into the technical differences between Galileo and GPS. The most important of which is that Galileo is meant to be a strictly civilian system.Who are the readers of this book? Mostly communications engineers, judging by much of the technical content. Though not exclusively. The later sections of the book have an interesting synopsis of the ways that GPS is used in many industries. Including at the level of a single consumer, for personal navigation. Where the GPS device is quite possibly built into the functionality of a cellphone. Numerous location based services are possible, like emergency caller location. Indeed, increasingly in many countries, new cellphones are mandated to have such abilities.More GPS uses are continually emerging, and the book gives a good feel for these. If you are contemplating novel uses of GPS, in contexts where knowing locations of objects or people can be important, then the book might furnish ideas. Nor do you need to be an engineer.Another merit of the text is the lengthy reference sections appending each chapter. Potentially very timesaving if you get seriously interested in using GPS."},{"Title":"The Three Brontes","review":"I was searching for a biography of the Bronte siblings. What I found was this incomprehensible mash of random feelings and impressions the author seems to have had about previous biographies of the Brontes.

I love the candid honesty displayed by the author throughout the entire journey. Every step of the way I was amazed by the maturity and common sense she displayed at such a young age, her awareness, poise and compassion in instances where other women would have \\"lost it\\".I'm a great admirer of Lady Diana Mukpo. While I'm older than her by almost a decade, I can identify with how difficult it was \\"back then\\" to chose her own path and stick to it through thick and thin and she did it magnificently.Great book, by a remarkable woman whose marriage made enormous demands from her, which she handled with honesty and integrity.Regarding Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, well, he was a genius to say the least, so lived and died according to his believes...Buddhism is not about condemning, is about acceptance."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"\\"Dragon Thunder\\" is the fascinating memoir of Diana Mukpo, the widow of Shambhala Buddhism founder Chogyam Trungpa. The pair enjoyed a whirlwind courtship before he married her at the young age of 16. It was controversial at the time-a famous Buddhist monk tying the knot with his young student. Trungpa was also controversial for his drinking and his womanizing. Mukpo brings up a lesser known anecdote- Trungpa had impregnated a young Buddhist nun in Tibet, and if the Dalai Lama had found out, Trungpa wouldn't have gotten a visa to the UK.\\"Dragon Thunder\\" blends Buddhism with autobiography. Diana Mukpo uses Buddhism to come to terms with her life- from her late husband's alcoholism to her mentally challenged son (she says that since he wasn't \\"enthroned\\" at a young age, he now struggles with his mental disability) and her open marriage (her current husband was her lover when she was still married to Trungpa) Mukpo discusses the controversy of Trungpa's successor, the Vajra Regent, Osel TendzinBuddha in the Palm of Your HandTendzin was married to a woman&had; children with her--but he also had transmitted HIV/AIDS to his boyfriends. He claimed that purification rites had protected him. It's clear that Mukpo is dealing with a lot of denial, betrayal, and pain. Her Buddhist beliefs enable her to live through and purify the pain, to use it as a means of cleansing the world.While one might not agree with Mukpo's beliefs and/or lifestyle, she does provide helpful and compassionate insights.May all beings be happy.May all beings reach enlightenment."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"this is a good read because mukpo doesn't try to convince anyone, including herself, of anything. she tells her story as it happened and is happening, willingly opening herself to possible criticism and raised eyebrows. this is a real life, a real marriage, not, as her husband said, \\"one of those suburban couples\\" who pretend everything is real when it isn't. trungpa may have had some issues, but he profoundly impacted many lives. whether his impact was positive or negative is irrelevant--buddhism does not judge."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"I am in constant awe of all who have an intimate, daily connection to a mahasiddha. The karma to bring one to this place is strong. Diana married Rinpoche when she was 16. This is her amazing story. I loved it. It was a view of Chogyam Trungpa that we could not have had without her willingness to write with such honesty and openness of her relationship with him. I recommend this book to anyone, especially those for whom true spiritual growth is paramount. No matter your path, Chogyam Trungpa's teachings of sanity and compassion are relevant."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":".I am grateful for this factual and detailed accounting of Diana's life with her remarkable husband and rinpoche. And I very much appreciate her trust in what he was as a highly conscious, powerful spiritual being, which allowed her to accept his unconventional and sometimes outrageous behavior, as part of the gift that he was.However, as the story went on I became disappointed in her... that the devotion and dedication which drew her to him initially apparently did not take her into her own practice of meditation - the self-discovery and development which is the core of his life's message. She says nothing of learning to take her personal difficulties to the inner resource of her true nature..For those who would like further understanding of Tibetan spiritual culture and its complex of traditional reincarnated roles, which was part of Chogyam Trungpa's supporting structure for his students, I suggest reading Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's personal stories in the book \\"Blazing Splendor\\"."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"This is an amazing and compelling story. One of the few spiritual bios that is a total pageturner!"},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I am a practicing Tibetan Buddhist of the Drikung Kagyu lineage, and I really wanted to come away from this book with a better understanding of Chogyam Trungpa. I wanted to be able to stop thinking of him as a womanizing drunk.Unfortunately, this book didn't help me. The author spends a great deal of time explaining away Trungpa's behavior by stating that he just wasn't like other people and that the normal rules didn't apply to him. It felt like someone who is abused making excuses for her abuser. I didn't gain any clearer dharmic understanding of Trungpa's outrageous actions or his reasons for having affair after affair after affair, drinking to excess, or taking drugs.Brilliant teacher he may have been, but from what I read in this book, he doesn't strike me as any sort of a dharmic role model or a spiritual friend on whom I could rely.In addition to not feeling like I gained any sort of higher understanding of the main character, I feel that the book dragged on and on and on. It read at times like a list of dates and places, overly specific and uninteresting. The author seemed to be trying to account for every event in her and Trungpa's lives and explain how and why it showed Trungpa's brilliance. It got boring long before the book concluded.I give this book three stars because some of it is very interesting, and it gives a decent account of how Shambhala Buddhism came to be, but it doesn't offer any sort of scintillating window into who Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche was."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"I found this book to be heartbreaking. I was initially interested since I have so admired and loved the work of Ani Pema Chodron who has impacted my life with such illumination over the years. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche was her core teacher. I was not shocked by the drinking and \\"affectional\\" involvement with the students (there have never been reports of any students having felt used or coerced), rather by the excesses in hierarchy so common to cults of that era: how to separate the medium from the message? At least, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche offered great wisdom and enlightenment, and created a base of wisdom teachings from which many have prospered. But Diana Mukpo seems in the book almost wholly without insight, accepting that which comes her way without compunction or hesitation. Houses in Europe! Horses to own and ride! Being crowned queen with a tiara of diamonds. Receiving a title, and the subordination of footmen, butlers, chefs, chauffeurs and servants. Mink stoles and upset over her new shoes from Saks Fifth Avenue being ruined during a Buddhist Ceremony. She accepts all of this as though her due, when both finances and labour are provided by devotees of her husband (who did seem like a tireless worker in this tome) gratis. I do not see any difference between this group and the other cultish excesses of the time: the Rajneeshpurams, the followers of other charismatic leaders. I was grateful to the book for having brought out all of my \\"shenpa\\" with which to practise (I was \\"hooked\\" on nearly every page!), but it had me questioning everything? Am I right to follow Pema Chodron and Sakyong Mipham? Are these excesses sanctioned in Tibetan Buddhism? My disillusionment was extreme: I had thought of Tibetan Buddhism as enlightened and kind. Her passages about dressage were the most interesting to me, otherwise I found nearly no evolution in her person or character. Needing her husband to be right and godlike, I suppose, to justify the luxury in which they lived, the royalty they conferred upon themselves, and relating with little understanding towards those around her (her mother, for example) while incensed at any perceived mistreatment she received. I am trying to work with the energy of disillusionment as a path to wisdom with this book, but I found it heartbreaking, self-aggrandising, and painful in the extreme. If the blindness is mine, I would appreciate illumination or clarification from anyone who differs.....I can only think that perhaps Trungpa Rinpoche created a hierarchical royal setting to demonstrate the examples of the inherent royalty within us all. But even if this is so....how to justify its reification on the backs of the labour of others. I am really perplexed and confused...."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"\\"Enlightened Master\\"\\"Egomaniac\\"\\"Genius\\"\\"Fraud\\"\\"Compassionate\\"\\"Cruel\\"It is difficult to imagine one person attracting so many different sobriquets.Yet Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa gathered all of these and many more.A recognized reincarnation of the Tenth Trungpa, he came to India after the Chinese invasion of Tibet and faced enormous hardships. He eventually came to Britain and met and married the sixteen-year-old Diana Probus, who took the name Diana Mukpo, and finally wrote this extraordinary memoir, almost twenty years after his death. They were married for a tumultuous period of seventeen years during which he established meditation centers throughout Europe and North America, attracted a large number of students and founded Naropa in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired University in the United States.Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa was a key figure in the dissemination of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, and apart from the testimony of his personal students, he has left a substantial body of written works, many of which are widely recognized to be spiritual masterpieces. He was always controversial and heavy alcohol abuse contributed to his early demise.I never met Ch&ouml;gyam, but I well remember many of my Buddhist friends being scandalized by his behavior. Most of them had acquired an extraordinarily ascetic view of Buddhism that many still hold today. The idea that an Enlightened Master may smoke, drink and have sex is anathema. They have an idea of the way that a spiritual being should behave, and if he or she does not, well that simply proves that they are not enlightened! I have known so many people who never realized that this view of spirituality is a projection based on just one spiritual current. There are many others, and it is a sad reality that rather than practicing tolerance, many of the different spiritual schools and traditions really dislike each other.This book paints an intimate portrait of a master of \\"crazy wisdom.\\" It is particularly fascinating to see the juxtaposition of the early life of someone born into a life of privilege in England, with a man born in poverty half a world away. And what an unusual and complex man he was, with a colorful and powerful personality. Not only was he someone who transmitted teachings, he was also believed to be someone who found and uncovered lost poetic and philosophical treasures.This is a very personal book, but it is not a rose-colored one. Diana was not only Rinpoche's wife she was also his student, and he did many things that must have been very hard on her. There was evidently a clash of cultures and even though she was very young when they got married, she was concerned about some of the questionable decisions that were being made. Though at the end of it all, she says that she has \\"no regrets.\\" The book gives some extraordinary insights into the inner workings of Tibetan Buddhism during its early encounter with the West. Though not designed to be a book of teachings, it contains a great many acute observations about the Buddhist path.This is a book that will be of interest not only to Buddhists, but also to anyone who would like to learn more about the development of meditation and spirituality in the West.Richard G. Petty, MD, author ofHealing, Meaning and Purpose: The Magical Power of the Emerging Laws of Life"},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"I was a close student of Trungpa Rinpoche for 16 years. I never closed a door in Diana's face; I did spend a bit of time caring for Taggie, yet even though I was \\"close in\\" to Rinpoche's family, I did not appreciate or have much empathy for Diana's challenges or for the fact that she was facing them at such a young age. Now at 60, having raised 4 children and being grandfather to 4, I humbly beg her forgiveness and bow to her strong Dharma Heart.This book is a generous and bold revelation of life with a rare Great Being. It will help any spiritual seeker break out of their limited notions of spiritual life and practice.The way in which Diana perservered in preserving and strenghtening her own spirit under extraordinary circumstances will be an inspiring example for any reader. It with help you develop a mature relationship to meet your own challenges on the path."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"This is a captivating, deeply intimate account of Diana Mukpo's seventeen year marriage to Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche written, thanks to the editor, in a restrained, objective reporting style that prevents this inscrutable story from becoming out-of-control fiction, (which it verged on anyway).This book may be of greatest interest to students/former students of Chogyam Trungpa who experienced him and his broader organization, Vajradhatu, during his lifetime. His wife knew him most deeply, but neither she nor his closest students could ever pin him down, and that same principle applies to the reader: the accuracy and value of this book is relational to the perspectives of Ms. Mukpo and those of the reader, who (somewhat delightfully) is forced to construct his own conclusions.Personally, for example, as a peripheral student still carrying twenty years of doubts and grudges, to my surprise I found this book clarifying and helpful for further practice. Then again, some cynics might find this account marred by the author's normal adolescent narcissism, never outgrown, and still coloring her memories and explanations of Rinpoche's behavior. Fortunately, readers free from this type of historical baggage will find plenty to ponder, such as the author's gut-checking attempt to raise her family, one of whom proves to be autistic, whilst playing a cacaphony of roles created by her husband. The reader quickly learns that nothing is easy, predictable or certain when married to the guru, except perhaps death.An authoritative and objective third-person book about Chogyam Trungpa can never be written because he was aware of, but non-attached to habitual patterns unlike most prominent public figures. Well-intentioned attempts to \\"capture\\" him have proved to be critical literary failures. Prior to Diana Mukpo's book, the only first-person description of life with Rinpoche was John Perks' fine book \\"The Mahasiddha and his Idiot Servant\\". Now we have his wife's first-person account, independently written, different events, yet same flavor. This is a superb narrative about a near-impossible subject, firm and opiniated when necessary, and revealing just enough defensiveness to confirm the author's humanity. A good book by any measure."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"This is an extraordinary, from the heart account of life with a Mahasiddha, written in the most intimate terms of a love affair that continues to this day.

Just put yourself in the author's place to see how that feels. Dragon Thunder is a must read for anyone."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"Dragon Thunder is an remarkable book on many counts. The book not only gives us a new understanding of the extraordinary life and work of Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa, one of the great spiritual teachers of the 20th century, but it also shows, without equivocation, some of the many both serious and humorous complexities and paradoxes and challenges involved in the transmission of Buddhism to the West. Diana Mukpo's intimate revelations as wife, friend, and student of this remarkable teacher and human being are not only lovingly expressed, but, perhaps just as important, they are also balanced and sane. You don't have to be a Buddhist to appreciate this amazing book (I'm not); you just have to be willing to be taken beyond the framework of your habitual self-image and to open to the miracle and mystery of your own being. And even if you don't think you're really willing, get the book anyway. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chgyam Trungpa","review":"I very much agree with the previous two reviews. This is a wonderfuuly intimate and candid report of life with Trungpa. One hears about his outrageous teaching \\"methods\\" and starts to see in this book that while some of the \\"crazy\\" methods were based on the desire to awaken his students, it is very possible that others were just based on too much alcohol. So even though he was not perfect, one also sees how very difficult his life was and how much he had to change from Tibetan culture to American hippie culture to get his teaching about Buddhism across. One also admires her struggle to provide some stability to both their lives.

None of these are named, nor provide testimonials, apart from one ultra-runner on the back cover blurb.

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful.

What I knew about Buddhism I'd learned while studying the transcendental writers, Emerson, Thoreau etc. while in college.This book is written by Stephan Bodian, an American Buddhist monk, and Jonathan Landaw, who has led meditation courses at Buddhist centers for over twenty-five years.Despite its cheesy title, this book answered most of the questions I had about Buddhism:Why the heck does the Buddha have so many names? He was born Prince Siddhartha, but once he became enlightened, he was called Shakyamuni Buddha. Bodhi, the tree under which he meditated, means enlightenment. Shakyamuni means enlightened sage of the Shakyas, the clan to which he belonged.Was Buddha God? No, he was a real human thought to have lived between 563 and 483 BCE. When you see Buddhist monks prostate before a statue of Buddha, they are praying to their inner Buddha. They believe each of us has the ability to achieve enlightenment (nirvana).What is karma? Sort of credits you build up, both bad and good. Buddhists believe in reincarnation; karma credits transfer from life to life. So if you're dealt a bad hand; it's because you were naughty in a previous life.What's the difference between Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism? The way I understand it, Theravada emphasizes individual enlightenment; whereas, the Mahayana's proponents are more worried about helping everyone achieve spiritual awakening. A Buddha becomes a Bodhisattva, sort of a savior like Shakyamuni. Theravadas also emphasize compassion and kindness which is pretty much the same thing. Zen Buddhism and Vajrayana (Tibetan) are offshoots of Mahayana Buddhism.What about heaven and hell? This is where they lost me. Shakyamuni taught that suffering resulted from something called the &quot;Wheel of Life.&quot; A diagram shows a pig (ignorance) giving birth to a rooster (desire or attachment) and a snake (aversion or hatred). There are also six realms of existence: God, anti-God, Human, Animal, hungry ghost, and hell being. Primarily through meditation and compassion, an entity can build up enough karma to work its way up to God. But the gods can be demoted if they run out of karma and they are always fighting the jealous anti-gods, so apparently they are not Buddhas. This wheel of life has existed in infinity; one of the authors says to remember that an enemy was probably at one time your mother, so it should be easy to forgive.At times Landaw and Bodian take their transcendental philosophy a bit too far. The last section deals with &quot;uninvited house guests.&quot; By this they mean insects. According to Buddha killing mosquitoes and other pests is bad karma. If a mosquito makes its way into your house, you're supposed to catch it and take it outside. Obviously these guys haven't experienced a humid, Minnesota evening in July down by the lake."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"All the title really means is that this book is written for people who know very little -- or nothing at all -- of the subject matter. When it comes to Buddhism, that's the majority of North Americans. I perhaps knew a little bit more than most as I live in San Francisco where Buddhists may be found readily, but I appreciated this book for filling me in on the ins and outs. (I knew enough to know I didn't know enough.)This is a practical book designed to educate the Western reader on what Buddhism is and what it is not. A lot of attention is paid to dispelling myths Westerners frequently believe about Buddhism. What this book does not do is presume to get the reader started on some kind of practice of Buddhism, but it may well get a reader well enough informed to choose to pursue the Buddhist way further -- or not, for that matter.As a liberal Christian, I appreciated this book a lot. I'm interested in knowing more because I already look from a viewpoint that includes Buddhist ideas as experienced truth. One of the interesting things about Buddhism is that it neither teaches nor denies a supreme being and has nothign negative to say about other religions. Rather, in a nutshell, Buddhism is more of a system of spiritual self-discovery than it is a religion, per se.It's interesting to note that there are many different systems of Buddhist discipline, much as there are different denominations in Christianity, for example. The beliefs and teachings all have the same foundation, but are not necessarily identical from one form of Buddhism to another, nor are the practices the various adherents follow. It's interesting to find out what the differences are and when, how and where each &quot;denomination&quot; came into being.One thing annoyed me as I read this book, however, which is why I've given it four and a half stars and not five. Throughout this book, the historical human being we most often think of as the Buddha is referred to as Shakyamani Buddha, a term I hadn't heard before. Nearly everyone refers to Prince Siddartha who became enlightened while sitting under the Bodhi tree in northern India in his role as enlightened being as Gautama Buddha (or sometimes Gotama Buddha, a variant spelling). Not once in this book is the name &quot;Gautama&quot; even mentioned that I could find. At least a paragraph addressing the disparity between the appellations &quot;Shakyamani Buddha&quot; and &quot;Gautama Buddha&quot; would have been apprecited -- after all, the author is using the less familiar of the two terms.(I could be wrong here, but I think &quot;Gautama&quot; was Prince Siddartha's clan name, more like a family name, and his family belonged to the much larger Shakyamani tribe, of which he became prince.)Other than that, I very much liked this book and found it satisfyingly informative about a very interesting topic. I wish all Westerners were clearer about what Buddhism is and what it isn't and this book is effective toward that end."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"I'm not going to write what's in this book; instead, I'm going to tell you about how reading this book changed my life for the better.I was born and raised in a Catholic family, and for over 30 years I considered myself one, but I wasn't very good at it and I didn't like it; whenever I sinned, I was filled with despair and self-loathing. But then sometime in early 2008, I picked up this book and my life was changed forever. Within a few months my mind, my perceptions and my attitude toward myself had irrevocably changed.What I took from this book was the lesson that the physcial world is impermanent, it is always changing, and from this I took so much more from it. I have come to believe that looking outside yourself for lasting happiness--whether it is food, money, power, possessions, even love from others--is impossible; these things can only bring temporary happiness. True happiness come from within.Accepting this idea means you become much more accepting of the inevitable curve balls that life throws at you. You realize that the situation, while not to your liking, is only temporary, so just accept it and ride it out.This acceptance of events also applies to people as well. I used to be very hung up on what others thought of me. I did everything I could to make them happy, but in the end only drove myself crazy when they didn't give me that approval I so desperately needed. But now I accept that no matter what I do, some people just won't like me and I don't try to win them over.What also appeals to me about Buddhism is that you are allowed, even encouraged, to question the teachings of masters past. Even Buddha himself said not to follow what he said or did simply because he did it. Think for yourself on these practices, and if they work for you, then embrace them, but if not, then don't and don't lose any sleep over it.If any of these points I have raised appeal to you, then I encourage you to buy this book and I hope you find what you are looking for within these pages. But if my words go in one ear and out the other, that's okay too; Buddhism isn't for everybody."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Like most of the books for &quot;Dummies&quot; this one is neither simplistic nor easy. It's a fairly comprehensive guide to Buddhism, including a lot of its various myths, schools and competing dogmas. The title of the series has always been a bit off-putting for me.In fact, its attempt to be comprehensive is a bit of a drawback. It might be easier for the newcomer had the authors chosen to promote a specific line or school, rather than offer a meandering potpourri of all aspects of Buddhist thought, hisotry and practice.This book requires the reader pay attention and sift through this material more carefully than many of the practical guides - Awakening the Buddha Within, the Art of Happiness, etc. It's quetionable whether the novice reader needs to work through various myths surrounding the Buddha's life or the details of monastic practices in order to understand the basic concepts of Buddhism.This is a somewhat encyclopedic approach, and less of a hand-on roadmap for core belief and practice. It's a good book, but the depth may easily overwhelm the person seeking some basic information or answers to simple questions. It would work best when read in parallel with other works."},{"Title":"Buddhism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"This is no doubt a well written book.

One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that, from the beginning, we are all whole and complete just as we are, lacking nothing. There are in truth no dummies. Our practice is to realize, to actualize this in our daily lives.

It is easy for a beginner (like me) to become lost.For those interested in learning about Buddhism, I found this book very helpful. It covers the main schools of Buddhism and their historic and geographic context with sufficient detail to inform the reader without distraction. It covers the main tenants of Buddhism, such as The Eightfold Path, The Five Precepts, and The Four Heavenly Abodes.

It quite adeptly describes the basics of Buddhism and lays them out in a friendly manner. You will learn about the different sects and find out just how much Buddhism is NOT a cult. That is an important one to me because I have been accused by a neighbor of spreading my cult juice all around. Considering I never talk to anyone about this unless they ask its a bit challenging.Back to the book, inside you get information about the Buddha, where he came from, what his message was and most of all how he was NOT a deity. He never was and never expected to be treated as one. It was not until the Greeks invaded India that the first statues of Buddha came around, (notice the knotty hair you will see on most statues of Buddha, its very Greek in origin).This is a great primer for students too.

I am one of LaVyrle's greatest fans, but this is not my favorite romance.

He was there for her, even when she felt the need to keep her family secrets, that's the part I just don't get...

In &quot;A Promise to Cherish&quot; she tells the story of a young women yearning for love, who, when she finds it, is afraid to hold on to it."},{"Title":"A Promise to Cherish","review":"I have read almost all of Lavyrle Spencer's books and, in comparison to her other writings, this one leaves something to be desired. Keep in mind that I am only comparing this to Ms. Spencer's other books, not to all other romance novels in general.I just felt that the character's relationship was not as well developed as those of some of her other storylines. By the time they have declared their love for each other, Sam and Lee have barely spent any time together. It is hard to conveive that they could have fallen in love over nothing more that a short weekend. On top of that, Sam seems so nonchalant and unaffected by Lee that it is a surprise that he has any real feelings for her at all, much less that they apparently run so deep. As the male lead, he is so different from any of the other's in the books that I have read by Lavyrle. He comes across as almost unpassionate about anything that might be developing with Lee. Part of the problem might be the length of the book -- most of her others are fairly long and this one was about half the normal length. By far, not the worst romance novel I have read but, this book cannot even begin to compare to the powerhouses that are \\"The Gamble\\", \\"Vows\\", and \\"Seperate Beds\\"."},{"Title":"A Promise to Cherish","review":"The pace of this book is quite fast - the entire book is focused on the romance of Lee & Sam (the couple). Unlike most romance novels - there is no real background plot. The story deals with how Lee Walker, a divorced mother of two boys (they don't live with her) struggles with working in a male-dominated industry (she is a construction estimator) with a pig of a male boss. She meets Sam Walker, a man who co-owns his own construction firm when the two accidentally swap suitcases at the airport on a business trip unbeknowst to either of them. She meets him later on when they end up bidding for the same construction job. Recognising each other's names - they each collect back their respective suitcases after having opened them with surpise earlier (and investigated the contents!). With a massive chip on her shoulder about her Indian heritage and lost confidence in what she believes as her failure as a wife and mother, Lee is antagonistic towards Sam Walker from the moment they meet. Suspicious of his motives, dubious of his character after discovering a porno mag in his suitcase Lee has no intention of giving Sam the time of the day. Sam sets out to charm her and slowly but surely wins her over. After being forced to quit her job, she is offered a position from Sam at his firm. Wary, but aware the deal is a generous one, Lee accepts with reservations. After all, he is by all indications, interested in pursuing a relationship with her. Can she take the risk of an office romance? Will she risk her wary heart again? Can she trust his motives? Lee struggles with her personal issues as Sam ardently pursues her headlong into a relationship.The story is a good one but is left with an unanswered question which I'm sure many a reader would like to know the answer. After the fast pace of the book, while there is a happy ending, the reader is feeling incomplete because of it. The ending should have been better constructed. It is rather light-hearted and while that is okay, it would have been nice to have a deeper scene where the two exchange tender words as well, and reaffirm their love."},{"Title":"A Promise to Cherish","review":"LaVyrle Spencer is perfect in her craft. She brings you into a story from moment one and leads you through the next 6 months or so of a person's life with no detail left unturned.Lee and Sam meet on a business trip in a very funny way and their relationship takes off. Spencer fills you in on the details of their life, their homes, their jobs and their relationship unlike any other writer I've ever read. I adore reading her books. This one is set in the early 80's and is so precise in it's decor and style of that genre. The intmacy is hot yet done in the classy style of Spencer and appears at all the right times. Not too much, not too little.Again, she takes all the right elements and blends them together the way we want to read it.Buy this book.

I've been crocheting for years and it's by far one of my favorite finished items. I'd have to say that even the pictures don't fully show it's extreme cuteness. Having made it before, I will work the legs of the sheep differently this time. I really wanted the blanket to be truly reversible with sheep on one side and solid green on the other, but that's just my (crazy perfectionist!)preference. Using the green yarn, you can work into the back of the sheep and attach them very securely so even tiny fingers can't get in. If you work carefully enough, those stitches will barely show because of the textured stitches of the blanket. The legs, however, are embroidered on and there's no way to hide the stitching on the back of the blanket or the black yarn ends that need to be woven in. No big deal if you don't mind that showing, but I think I'll try a few other ways of adding the legs so that they are secure and don't leave somewhat messy looking black lines on the back of the blanket, which are odd looking and in seemingly random spots if you don't realize there's a design on the other side."},{"Title":"Candy Blankies","review":"This book has it all...beautifully designed blankets that go well beyond pink, blue and white granny square or chevron afghan, with easy-to-follow instructions and quality photography.Candy Blankies contains 29 patterns that are sophisticated yet simple to make, deriving their beauty from whimsical color choices and great design. Many of the patterns, for example, call for weaving in contrasting or complementary colors into finished pieces, a simple way to add dimension and complexity without much time and effort.The front of the book showcases the patterns, each with its own 2-page spread; the second half includes instructions, again with each pattern across two pages, which include a photograph of the finished piece lying flat.Though this book contains only afghan patterns, it has served as inspiration for me on many other projects, including scarves, purses and pillows."},{"Title":"Candy Blankies","review":"This book is what initially attracted me to crochet.

First off, the photography is gorgeous, a real treat to page through. The patterns are so beautiful, and are presented clearly and neatly. I have yet to find any mistakes in them. Some of the patterns are more complex than others, but I've found you can tell pretty quickly what the level of expertise required is, simply by looking at the complexity of the pattern presented. The last few pages of the book also include helfpul refresher tips (or how-to pictures for beginners) related to the stitches and techniques required in the patterns.If you love to crochet, and want to have a source for really creative, lovely, and customizable blankets, then this is the best book out there that I've found.

If that had been the only issue I might have let it go as a small error. However, in the 2nd book with adorable baby clothes 2 of those patterns had some direction issues. One of the patterns called for the use of a stitch that was NOT the one used in the picture and if I followed the directions exactly (yes I checked my guage), the end product was so large the 12 month old was swimming in it!Small details also seem to be omitted, like how she sewed in a zipper or added some of the details.The pictures of the final products ARE beautiful and inspiring.

The abridged editions are not much better. It was highly influential in its time, so it's standard reading for history-of-philosophy courses.

The reader of this his most influential and important work will be constantly struck not only by his sane and sober approach to philosophical questions but indeed, as another reviewer has noted, by how commonplace his own proposed solutions have become.It will be found that Locke, generally regarded as an &quot;empiricist,&quot; is extremely hard to pigeonhole. Though rejecting (an earlier version of) the doctrine of &quot;innate ideas&quot; and insisting that all of our ideas come from or through sense-experience, he was clearly a &quot;rationalist&quot; as regards the nature of knowledge itself. Both modern empiricists and modern rationalists could benefit from a healthy infusion of his reasonable, even-handed tenor and uncommon common sense.Also highly recommended is E.J. Lowe's _Locke On Human Understanding_, an excellent introduction and overview to this great work as well as a delightful and highly insightful attempt to show that many of Locke's positions are still defensible today (though perhaps in need of some modification). It is a handy companion to the present volume both for the beginner and for the longtime reader of Locke; even those who know Locke well (or think they do!) will find Lowe's work engaging and enlightening."},{"Title":"An essay concerning human understanding","review":"John Locke's 1698 &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. It is a phenomenal enquiry into how and why people become functional individuals. Bringing into philosophy a developmental model of personal becoming, Locke drilled pre-Berkeleyan common sense into a growing capitalist nation, one which was already moving away from the absolutist model of government and viewing self in the world espoused by Thomas Hobbes in &quot;Leviathan.&quot; While clearly building on and stepping on his predecessors, most notably Hobbes and Rene Descartes, Locke deals broadly with ideas, language, and how people come into knowledge, and sets the stage for a new phase of philosophy entering the 18th century.Locke begins the &quot;Essay&quot; by rejecting and dispensing with the notion of &quot;innate ideas,&quot; which basically says that we are born in possession of certain principles, elements of knowledge, or maxims that help us orient ourselves in the world. Through long and drawn out (one downside of Locke is his insistency on detail and repetition) examples and arguments, he attempts to prove that when we are born, we have absolutely nothing intelligence-wise, to recommend us. This is what is popularly referred to as the 'tabula rasa' theory, that when first born, our minds are like &quot;empty cabinets&quot; or &quot;white sheets&quot; of paper - which experience and experience only furnishes with our ideas about the world. His goal here is to get people to question their assumptions about the world, to ask questions and decide for themselves based on reason and experience, how best to interact with the world.Locke says that the only two sources of all human knowledge are sensation (that information which is passively thrust upon our senses) and reflection (when we consider and think about that sense data, and about our own thoughts). From these &quot;simple ideas,&quot; we are able to combine and recombine thoughts to form &quot;complex ideas&quot; and use clear and distinct language to express them to other people. This social aspect of this philosophy is something that really fascinated me about Locke. While focusing on the individual's growing base of knowledge, he is all the while trying to orient people to functioning in society. Saying that the end of all knowledge serves two purposes, viz., honouring God, and being morally responsible, Locke goes on to show how human life often works counter to these goals, with a view to correcting them.Another of his famous formulations, one all too familiar to Americans, as part of our national idealism, is that the basic state of nature of humanity consists in the &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot; Compared to Hobbes, for whom the state of nature consisted in the attempt to attain greater and greater power over others, Locke's state of nature seems relatively benign - however, he goes to great lengths to show how the pursuit of happiness often leads to reckless and wanton behaviours, ultimately destructive both to self and society. The idea that we must examine our desires and discipline them to the greater good is something that many of us lose sight of, and is an element central to his system.Briefly then, a couple of other items that might be of interest to someone thinking about picking up Locke's &quot;Essay&quot;: His philosophy of language is one that still has currency and influence on linguistic theory all the way to Saussure and the post-structuralists; Locke's manner of addressing cultural and gender diversity is progressive, but vexed, which makes for fascinating work in trying to determine his stances toward non-white European males. Locke's constant invocation of gold in his examples can be maddening, which can only mean that there is some significance therein; and finally, his other hobby-horse, so-called &quot;monstrous births&quot; and their status in the human race bears heavily and still importantly on the debate over a woman's right to choose. All this and so much more awaits you - over 600 pages of Lockean goodness. Beware though, Locke is extremely repetitive and can get bogged down in what, for us to-day, may seem common sense notions. But this is quintessential reading, nonetheless, for everyone interested in the formation of the modern self."},{"Title":"An essay concerning human understanding","review":"Any search for this text will result in a plethora of commentaries upon it, whilst it itself seems almost doomed to take second place. The importance of this work to philosophy cannot be underestimated; Descartes is held in common perception to be the figure who changed the course of philosophy. Whilst it is true he may have dipped his toes in uncharted waters, Locke was the first to plunge in. Here we find human understanding stripped to its first principles and from there rebuilt in such a fashion as to purge the presumptions of our age. Locke recommends modesty to the philosopher and thinker throughout and in our current times this message might need restated. In a world, which owes so much to the United States Constitution, it would be appropriate for us all to see what it owed its own origins to and be recalled to values of liberty, modesty and reason in a way which does not rush headlong into a catastrophe of pride."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],E={key:0},H={key:1};function M(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,L)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-9250266a"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/15.md","filePath":"library/15.md"}'),D={name:"library/15.md"},W=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,W as default};
