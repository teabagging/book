Anyone with even an elementary knowledge of Wicca and the New Age can easily tell that My Schnoebelen has no idea what he is talking about. If you want to learn about Wicca read a book written by a wiccan. Its only common sense. One wouldnt expect to read a book about Christianity written by a Wiccan author. The same is true for this."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"After I read Mr. Shnoebelen's book &quot;Lucifer Dethroned&quot; I have to change my review of this book. Shnoebelen claimes to have been an Alexandrian Wiccan, Thelemite, Druid, a member of TWO OTOs a Scottish, York, and Egyptian Rite mason (The Egyptian rite doesn't exist anymore) a Palladium mason (never existed)and illuminati member (never existed). In this book he failed to mention he was a spiritist church minister, a BISHOP in both the Old Catholic Church AND The Roman Catholic Church while being a high grade witch and satanist!For some reason he recalls it later in Lucifer Dethroned. I found most of the material in &quot;Lucifer Dethroned&quot; impossible to swallow, needless to say. The only practical reason for buying &quot;Wicca Satan's Little White Lie&quot; is the material he lifts from &quot;Crafting the Art of Wicca&quot;, which has been out of print for years. So, take the book with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Schnoebelen's experience of Witchcraft is obviously very different from my own. I have been a Witch nearly three years, and my family is Fundamentalist. This book has just enough accurate information on Wicca/Witchcraft to confuse the new seeker or the relatives of a Witch. However, much of it is inaccurate. For instance, his rendering of the Threefold Law and explanation of the bolline's (white-handled knife) use. The rebuttal of Laurie Cabot and his depiction of Pagan Milwaukee as a Witchcraft Dodge City would have been hilarious if he wasn't trying to pass them off as true. As one who is drug free, extremely fond of children, and (mostly) pro-life, I really resented the pages where he called us drug addicts and worse. I cannot speak for him, but he speaks wrongly of our Pagan religions. I am glad he got out of his destructive patterns--if in fact he was actually *in* them--but I resent his implications that all Witches are either bloodthirsty Satanists or ignorant hippies. I am glad I was able to rebut it to my relatives. In summation, if you are Christian and want to learn what Wiccans/Witches believe--ask one. The face you save may be your own!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Soooooo many people are dismissing this book because they say it misinforms people about the Wicca. It doesn't help that this book was published by Chick Publications, seeing how Chick is loathed for his &#34;hate&#34; material. But this book is NOT what you think it is.The author covers several subjects related to Wicca, like its history, beliefs, rituals, etc. Reading this book from cover to cover, the author is not making wild claims out of his head. Looking at the footnotes, he used very reliable sources, most of which are entirely Wiccan. In Chapter 1, he uses Elliot Rose' &#34;A Razor For a Goat&#34;, Francis King's &#34;Ritual Magic in England&#34;, &#34;The Rites of Modern Occult Magic&#34;, Dorren Valiente's &#34;Witchcraft for Tomorrow&#34;, Janet and Stewart Farrar &#34;The Witches' Goddess&#34;, &#34;What Witches Do&#34;, Miriam Starhawk's &#34;Dreaming the Dark: The Spiral Journey: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess&#34;, and many more titles totaling to 16 books influential to the Craft.I own an illustrated guide to Wicca called &#34;The Wicca Handbook&#34; by Sheena Morgan. Comparing what Mr. Schnoebelen wrote in his book, with Ms. Morgan's instructions to the Craft, Mr. Schnoebelen speaks the truth. Ms. Morgan doesn't teach you to kill babies and sacrifice humans, of course not. But in William's personal testimony, along with the subtle influence of Aleister Crowley to Gerald B. Gardner, it was evident that in order to advance to higher levels of witchcraft, bloodletting and sex were essential to enrich your craft and gain more power.I understand that not ALL Wiccans go this far. I understand, But whether your a white witch, a black witch, or a high priest/priestess, the spirit behind Wicca is Lucifer, and Lucifer is Satan, the deceiver, the devil. Satan manifests himself in many forms, with many names, but it is all the same.Why not give this book a chance? I was hesitant to buy this book at first, because I thought it was gonna bash Wicca, and treat it ignorantly like many other authors. Yet, that is not the case with this book. Please give this chance. read the whole thing. And don't resist the Holy Spirit of God when you read.God bless!"},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Once again, another hatemongering book is published from an ignorant person just willing to make money off of people who are as ignorant as they are. Not only does this book make Wiccans look bad (the information regarding Wicca in this book is complete tripe), but it makes genuinely good Christians look bad as well.To Schnoebelen and those that are as truly ignorant as him: how can Wiccans worship \\"satan\\" if they don't even believe in him? Oh wait, that's right...anyone who isn't Christian is worshipping the devil, right? (This is EXACTLY what Schnoebelen says). Satan was _never_ a part of witchcraft; this was (and is) Christian theology! People NEED to understand this!I'd bet money that most people who spread lies about witchcraft aren't even aware that early Christians borrowed the dates (and meanings, along with deities) from the Pagans and used them for their \\"new\\" holidays - yes, including Christmas.Back to the book though, this is truly and utterly ignorant, and I'm truly wondering where Schnoebelen's \\"good Christian morals\\" went when he wrote this book."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Perhaps a more appropriate title for this book should be, \\"From the Mixed Up Files of Mr. William Schnoebelen?\\" I have read several of Mr. Schnoebelens' books & articles (the books were a gift from someone) and I can honestly say that everything that this person writes is nothing but half-truths and out right fabrications. As a practicing Wiccan for several years, I can tell you this man has a very shrewd imagination! According to Schnoebelen, even Catholics are Satanist, as well as anyone else who doesn't follow whatever faith he \\"claims\\" to be into at the time. As for Wicca, unfortunately, he has twisted the facts just enough to make his lies sound credible to anyone who isn't educated enough on the subject as it fits his agenda. Schnoebelen is definate proof that ANYONE can write a book, even someone as delusional as he obviously seems to be."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"To say that this book is based on ignorance is like saying the Crusades were based on ignorance...anyone with any inkling of intellect and common sense should be able to see through the half-truths and out-right fallacious arguments that the author used to support this book to his ultimate goal: hate. The book is poorly written, based on information that has long been rendered irrelevant (since, say the 1800s), and is mostly just propaganda and hate mongering. Much like the Young Earth Creationists, this author and the individuals he represents should be viewed as the Christian equivalent of Al Qaeda...dangerous extremists who sole purpose in life is to hurt others. If you buy this book, make sure you get a couple extra matches, the cover is particularly resistant to flames."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"It's no small wonder how Mr. Schnoebelen can be this misinformed on such a topic when he claims to have held such high status within \\"wiccan\\" organizations....maybe he has some sort of learning/cognitive disorder? Amnesia? As aggravating as his agenda is, it would not surprise me to learn that he had received one or two blows about the head. I want to know where these ideas are actually coming from, because I don't think they're based on a reality as normal, rational people experience it.If you enjoyed this for its kitsch value, I highly recommend checking out a few of the wiccan/occult \\"documentaries\\" he's had his righteous hands in. As painfully inaccurate and foolish he comes across on paper, it's even better (worse?) on screen.So, yes -- I graciously award this gem with three stars, as this is was entertaining (albeit somewhat masochistically) from the perspective of a person interested in the Satanic Panic of the 80s and 90s.Also, as a card-carrying member of the Illuminati, I had to post this to get my darned check."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"And this is not it.

It is a scurrilous, uninformed attack against a gentle, legitimate, recognized religion. Wiccans follow the Wiccan Rede, which says \\"An it harm none, do what ye will.\\" In other words, harm no one. It is all right to defend yourself or someone else, but even then harm should be kept to a necessary minimum. Anyone familiar with Wicca knows this to be the case, both in books and in practice. The purpose of this book is to keep people from investigating the religion on their own. Wiccans do not write tracts warning people to stay away from hate-filled fundamentalist cults. We let people make their own decisions and do not lie to them or put out filthy propaganda. Amazon should remove this book from their online shelves, as they would remove anti-semitic books."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"I wouldn't buy this, so I didn't waste my money, but we Wiccans-and other Pagans and Witches-are NOT SATANISTS! We don't even believe in Satan. Satan is a Christian concoction. Since we don't believe in Satan, it would be impossible to worship such an entity. We revere the cycles and forces of Nature, even, as some might say---as your Christian god \\"made them\\" to be... (Although \\"ours\\" was/were here first, as most are pre-Christian dieties, we still respect your right to prefer yours and believe what you wish:)Ironically, we seem to worship that which the Christian god \\"made\\" (Christian belief, not ours), more than most Christians do. These things deserve our respect and protection-things such as the sun, air, trees, animals, rivers, streams and oceans, all things in their natural state, and the spirit---including the FREEDOM that each spirit has to express him or her self (without harming others, and without telling others how to live their lives; we trust people can listen to their own inner guide and find their own path... and when they truly want or need direction, they will seek it on their own... what a novel idea!!!) We try to live our lives in alignment with the rest of the natual world.So, um, this guy either got taken in by fakers big-time, or he made it all up-probably whilst possessed by his Satan.... I personally wouldn't go around creating such negative energies...they would make my home feel icky!

The least he might do is study Wicca and Paganism to understand what they are before he attacks. As it stands, he shadowboxes an imaginary enemy that he inaccurately labels Wicca and Paganism. His book fails to describe any particular pagan belief system with even minimum accuracy. That being said, to what pagan belief does he object, and for what reasons? I mean, really? And since his book does not address actual issues, to whom does he write except other Christians who probably don't know any more about Wicca than him?Anybody who understands the Old Religion surely will find this book irrelevant. Those who suffer to find relevance will come away with same the nagging feeling:To wit, that, gosh, although we've heard it before, many times, it really is true -- some Christians really are arrogant and stupid."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie is the problem with religion today. No need to look too far for the devil, it's right in this book!Overview: Schnoebelen claims to have been initiated into nearly every major sect of Wicca. Oh, and many other religions too. How he found out that every belief, other than what he currently believes, is wrong. He provides reasons as to why these beliefs are wrong and why he is right. Who needs a ghost story or an urban legend when we have a first hand account of what REALLY happens within Wicca?I find it incredibly upsetting that trash like this can actually be published and, even more upsetting, that some are willing to believe it! Why does no one do research anymore? Just gobble up everything that follows your belief pattern and then spend the rest of your life citing such nonsense. I challenge everyone to research this man and Wicca. If you are unwilling to do such things then you are part of the problem. Stop relying on someone, who has been proven to be a fraud, to think for you. Ignorance is not bliss."},{"Title":"Wicca: Satan's Little White Lie","review":"After reading the sample it became quite apparent that Schnoebelen only knows how to use a search engine. He claims to have been a member of the craft since the 1970s, reaching very high in rank as an Alexandrian in just under a year. (Which just so you know, usually never happens.) Now there are honest people who do dabble in Wicca for a while, realize it's not for them and end up going back to what's comfortable. Schnoebelen however, is not an honest person. He mixes up terms, misuses others, very simple, basic things that is very telling of someone who claims to be very experienced in the craft.The only thing this author is experienced at is using google. Really, it is very easy to tell that all this author did was a few quick google searches to grab enough \\"information\\" on the craft to make it sound like he knew what he was talking about to try and gain confidence in his readers so that he could write what he really wanted to say. Which is nothing but lies and a lot of hate on a religion he really knows nothing about.Also this book was published by Chick Publications, INC., which should give a huge warning sign to the legitimacy of his claims. Anyone who has ever read any of the infamous Chick-track comics knows that they're wild, over dramatized propaganda created to spread hate to Wicca, new age healers, Catholics, Dungeons and Dragons, and anything that isn't or questions their exact kind of Fundamentalist Christianity.These kinds of authors, Chick and Schnoeblen both, have lost the meaning of the teachings of their God and their religion that they preach so heavily about.

I used to play the Virginian on TV, for those of you who might not know me. I just saw that last review on Mike Blakely's book, Too Long At The Dance, and I couldn't let it stand without an argument. I have read several of Mike's books, and a lot of other western novels, including narrating Kirby Jonas' books onto Audio Tape for Books in Motion. I hope that qualifies me as one who can judge a good or a bad Western novel.This novel by Mike is superb. It is packed with high quality research and excitement and very believable characters, and it brings a very satisfying ending to the story begun with Shortgrass Song. I hope you folks who read these reviews will take my review to heart. I have no idea what the last reviewer was doing when he was supposed to be reading this book, but he obviously knows nothing about the West and perhaps has never read a Western book before in his life. This was a very good novel and well worth anyone's time, if you like authenticity in your reading."},{"Title":"Too Long at the Dance","review":"As a member of a sixth-generation Texas family, I cut my teeth on traditonal western novels. In my fifty-eight years of life on this planet, I have managed to get a master's degree, work in numerous foreign countries, as well as many states of the US. During that time I drifted away from the written works of my youth, but Mike Blakely's novels have brought me back into the fold. Although, I would not consider Blakely a traditional western writer, in the style of Louis L'Amour,et al., I would deem his works as fresh and envigorating as the breeze that sweeps across my hilltop just above the Guadalupe River. Upon returning to Texas to live, I taught history, among other subjects, in an adult education program. &quot;Too Long at the Dance&quot; and other Blakely novels (&quot;Comanche Dawn&quot; being my favorite) have been an inspiration to continue learning more about the West. This novel and other Blakely works have been not only a source of enjoyment, but a wonderful learning experience as well. Keep up the good work, Mike."},{"Title":"Too Long at the Dance","review":"Okay, right off the bat I'm gonna say something that may lead you to believe I'm biased, but I swear I don't make recommendations unless I like a book. If a friend writes up a yarn and I hate it, I just won't say anything. Folks, I'm Kirby Jonas, the guy James Drury was talking about in the review he did down below. Being a Western novelist myself, I am very critical of the writing of others. I want the history to be correct down to the proper dialogue (to a certain extent), the right guns and clothing and horses. I also want a fast moving book and good characters, and I want a book that's going to make me laugh and cry and give me goosebumps (I stole that from a review James Drury did on one of my books! :) ) Too Long at the Dance was all of these things, folks. It wasn't a fast read for one afternoon like Shane or a Louis L'Amour book. It was deep and insightful and lyrical and plain good. You need to read Shortgrass Song first to do it justice, but I'm telling you, if you want to learn history without thinking you're having a history lesson, PLEASE pick up this book. You will not for one moment regret it. Mike Blakely did a knock-down superb job here, and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. AND--for me this is a bonus--you don't have a bunch of sex and graphic violence and swearing to wade through, so you can even let your younkers and granny latch onto this'n. Give Mike a try. You'll get hooked."},{"Title":"Too Long at the Dance","review":"I love reading books that are witty, funny, romantic, and realistic.

He is also very good in detailing the various people that came West.

In all , the West Blakely depicts is an interesting tapestry of peoples."},{"Title":"Too Long at the Dance","review":"In my order of more books to read are the rest of Mr. Blakely's books.

Her extraordinary talent leaves the reader hoping for a sequel."},{"Title":"Free Falling","review":"Denise is having recurring nightmares that are terrifying her, because of this she seeks the help of Dr. Leopold, who gently convinces her that perhaps she is remembering a former life. This at first horrifies Denise but something inside of her draws her back to the doctor to find out the truth.Under hypnosis, Denise goes back to her past life as a young woman named Olivia who is married to an abusive husband. This is where the story truly blossoms.Olivia falls in love with her coach driver Wilson, who is a black man.They are drawn to each other by their deep desire to be free, one from the abuse of racism and one from the abuse of a cruel husband. Unfortunately their love causes both of their deaths. I found myself not able to put this book down until I completed the read.Although I am not a believer in reincarnation, to me this was a story of deep love that spanned the fringes of time. The author does an excellent job in drawing you into the very life's of her characters as their world unfolds before your eyes.I recommend this read, a real page turner with a very happy ending!"},{"Title":"Free Falling","review":"Since starting to date Aaron, Denise has been suffering from terrible nightmares. Aaron's tendency to abuse and threaten her certainly doesn't help, but her psychologist suspects that more may be involved. Could Denise's dreams be caused by past life regression? Under hypnosis, Denise finds herself in the person of Olivia Walters in ante bellum South Carolina. There, Olivia is brutalized by her husband, Byron Walters and finds love in the arms of Wilson, one of Byron's slaves. Olivia's efforts to escape Byron's brutality parallel those of Denise. But solving dreams is one issue--finding true happiness in modern America is an even greater challenge for Denise.FREE FALLING will appeal to readers interested in past life regression and in a view of the old south that is not obscured by the romantic wash that covers much romantic fiction. In author Sheri Neilson's world, the old south is a world of whippings, of spousal abuse, and of a concern for appearances at the price of simple decency. The strong message is reinforced by Neilson's decision to introduce an interracial relationship--that between white Olivia and black Wilson.Neilson's heroic efforts are partly offset by simplistic writing and a failure to examine what drives the attraction between Wilson and Olivia. Even though Olivia was raised on a relatively liberal plantation, deciding on an interracial love affair would have needed more motivation that was presented in FALLING FREE.FALLING FREE is a noble effort--attempting to combine a realistic view of the horrors of the institutions of the south with past life regression and abusive spouses. It falls somewhat short of its goals, but that doesn't detract from the power of the effort."},{"Title":"Maryland Real Estate Practice & Law","review":"The book condition was awful.

This currently-99-cents Kindle book is NOT NIV. Both the Bible quotes and Spurgeon's writings are the \\"thee's and thou's\\" version.Another thing, since I downloaded this book on 12 March, I decided to start with the 12 March devotional. Well, it has Matthew 5:43 as its verse reference, quoting, \\"Thou shalt love they neighbor,\\" and that's what the devotional is about. But, reading around Matthew 5:43, I see that the point of this very verse is NOT \\"love they neighbor.\\" The Bible says here, quoting from the NIV, \\"43\\"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?...\\" and so on. Kind of a different idea than what Spurgeon's devotional is about. Seems like he could have found a better place to quote, \\"Love thy neighbor,\\" such as, perhaps, Matthew 22:39.Anyway, just my very first thoughts about this devotional. I couldn't go any lower than 3 stars on this because I'm pretty sure Spurgeon is going to inspire me the more I read him...time will tell..."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Jesus Christ is the same today, yesterday and forever. God never changes and while some of us try to compromise our faith in this ever-changing world, we need to realize that the God of Abraham is the same God we serve today. I'm appalled at how Christians try to compromise our faith in order to fit in. Yes, i've been guilty several times of this so i'm not pointing any fingers.Needless to say, it's awesome to have a devotional that relies on the word of God, that has truth in it and reminds you of who God is. This devotional is very relevant in today's culture. God is still the same so let's not twist stuff in the bible in the name of present day culture. As a young adult who is trying to strengthen my walk with Christ, i find it refreshing to find a devotional that isn't 'sweetened' up to suit the part of me that wants to be godly and yet partake in the world. I want something that hits me with the plain truth and make me realize that i need to make Christ Jesus my primary focus. That's exactly what i get from this book. There are times i cry when i start reading the devotional cuz the tears just flow down my eyes. There are times when i read and learn something about God's love for me and that encourages me to keep on, to walk on by faith.This is a great devotional but i think it's best to read the complete and unabridged version. I got a new copy of the unabridged here on amazon for lot, lot cheaper i think it makes a lot more sense than these modern day translations. However, the modern day ones are good. Whichever one you get, i hope you approach God each morning and evening and like i read the other day, we don't need to approach God in the morning and evening and live the rest of the day in utter ignorance of him.If you're looking for something that paints a gray picture of living for Christ, this isn't it. If you're looking for something that tells you Jesus Christ isn't the only way to the Father, this ISN'T your book either. This isn't gonna tell you all lifestyles, religion and worldviews are equally valid. If you want to know God, know him as He is, not as you want Him to be. Remember, you can't serve both God and Mormon. For those who get this book, i hope it draws you closer to the Almighty God."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Recommended for serious christian readers.

It is all there and likely accurately taken from the original, I just do not find it to be a relaxing read, I have to think too hard to switch words around in my mind to make it make sense.

The product was wrapped in plastic when I got it, and in brand new condition. The company shipped fast. Not a bad deal but not super cheap, definitively worth the price ($15.)

Thank you, Mr. Spurgeon for your insight all those years ago. It proves that God's Word is timeless.

Also makes a beautiful gift for seminary student, pastor or someone in need of spiritual comfort."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"I have this book in both print and digital formats and have enjoyed it immensely. It's a great resource for anyone looking for a good start to their morning and evening devotionals. And I'm inspired by his story and ministry, especially how he didn't give up in the face of criticism for his plain speech.I, personally, do not dislike the digital version. There are minor errors in formatting, but they didn't distract me from the intent of the text. And, honestly, for $0.89, I don't think there's much room for complaints on these minor points. I also love being able to click on the \\"Morning and Evening\\" title and go directly to where I left off. It's even easier than the print version, and since I read so much anyway, there's no chance that I accidentally left my copy in my car or at the office. If nothing else, I could access it on my phone or computer if all else fails.This is an amazing buy for under a dollar."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"This is an excellent book, nicely layed out in a morning page and an evening page, side by side, for comfortable reading.

These should be used as an adjunct to reading the scriptures on a daily basis - the spiritual reflection is most helpful."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"For some reason I was worried about what the cover of the book would look like.

I think this version is probably the best quality and design in this price range."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"I have an older copy of Morning and Evening and love Spurgeon's writing.

Must have in your devotional library."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"It is the end of the year and I have just about finished this book.

I'll read it again in a year or so."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"I am very satisfied with my Daily Reading by Spurgeon, I read it every morning for devotions and I have learned much.

Exact and inspiring commentary on the Bible written in the 1800's, but is still applicable today. Rich use of the English language."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"This is a wonderful devotional. There are more than a few typos in this Kindle edition however. I will never understand how this happens. Doesn't anyone proof read the material? I can see one or two slipping by but honestly there are quiet a few. I am hoping for an update at some point. The corrected version would have 5 stars!"},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Reading Spurgeon's words deepen my love for and understanding of God's amazing word. The depth of meaning of each devotional helps me in my walk of sanctification. I use the NIV study Bible but enjoy the beauty of the older english used by Spurgeon. I especially enjoy the thoughtful systematic presentation of reformed theology incorporated throughout. These devotionals give me stength for the daily challenges we all face. On a practical note, the length of each devotional is just right for me on a daily basis and leaves me looking forward to the next days reading. I greatly encourage anyone to dive into these devotions whether in old english, NIV or ESV formats; they are each inspirational."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Who doesn't love Charles Spurgeon? But where to start? Start here: Morning and Evening. Much has been written about Spurgeon but I think you can gain an insight in to the heart of the man here and his deep love and devotion for Jesus. I find many devotionals to be full of fluff and devoid of substance. This is neither. You will find much to keep you eye on the Lord all day with this devotional. I love this leather edition as a devotional should be something of a treasure, something you reach for again and again. Let's face it, books just ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Charles Spurgeon is one of those brilliant Christian writers who I've just discovered as a new convert, but others have treasured for years. After my pastor quoted him for the third time in a homily, I decided I needed to learn more. And then I received this wonderful devotional for Christmas--perfect timing!This is an version of Spurgeon's classic daily devotional, which has been updated using the New Internation Version of the Bible as a source for the scripture verses. Spurgeon's writing has also been revised somewhat to tranlate some of the archaic expressions into phrasing that will make sense to modern readers.The text still retains a turn-of-the-century feel, but the words are no longer a barrier to understanding.There are meditations for each morning and evening. They are full of wisdom and comfort, and I am amazed at how much richness Spurgeon is able to draw from even the shortest bits of text, &quot;mighty to save&quot;, &quot;He humbled Himself&quot;, etc. This gives readers a renewed appreciation for the value of each and every word in Scripture.Helpful indexes make the book useful as a reference when readers need help or inspiration on a particular topic. This is a book that will be used long after the original devotions have been enjoyed on a daily basis."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"At last, a delightful modern treatise on Spurgy's wonderful devotions. No excuses anymore, the King's English has been modernized so that us contemporary, modern Christians can understand and apply the deep truths of the faith. This devotional, if used prayerfully, will change your life and deepen your well of faith."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"This is a penetrating compilation of meditations written by \\"The Prince of Preachers,\\" Charles Haddon Spurgeon. The man many knew as the most widely popular of English preachers in the nineteenth century, was born in Essex, England in 1834. Spurgeon, who became a Baptist preacher at the age of 20, was such an impressive preacher that his chapel was unable to accommodate all those who wanted to hear him.Spurgeon is a man of both keen intellect and profound conviction of a sort that was most rare for his time, and I believe is all but non-existent today.Spurgeon's life heeded the Berean call to search the Scriptures daily and to evaluate everything we read and hear by that standard! He loved others enough to tell them the truth without compromise!But the most important ingredient to Spurgeon's success was his deep, yet very simple trust in and understanding of his Lord and Saviour and of His great grace and love. Out of this came a great longing to have others come to know, to love and to worship the Lord Jesus as he did. This will become readily apparent as one drinks in Spurgeon's commentary and meditates on his Biblical message.This book is broken into facing pages for the same date such as: This Morning's Meditation, and This Evening's Meditation.This book will absolutely bless your Biblical socks off!"},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"This work is broken it to two parts, the author's reflection on scriptural text to be read in the morning, and a reflection on another verse for the evening. The morning and evening reflections are vivid, powerful, and inspiring. The masterful old English prose flows well; the snippets of scripture insightfully expounded upon. The bits of scripture addressed are small, perhaps a single verse or two, and yet are weighty enough to linger in your mind throughout the day. I had never really adhered to a daily devotional type of Bible study until I found this work. Now I am committed to completing both portions by the end of the day. Definitely worth the time and will make your day much richer.Now, with regard to the kindle formatting, I had but one issue. That is that the TOC does not link to individual months, but only to the individual (AM/PM) readings within the months. So, let's say you want to jump to a November reading, you'd have to page through all the linked readings of prior months before you could get to the one desired. I have seen another kindle version that links the months, and then also links the individual readings for every month as well. Had I not purchased this version first, I would have bought that one instead. It is not a big enough issue for me to return this version, but I thought I would give a warning to those would be buyers. In either case, this work is well worth the money."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Charles Spurgeon's Morning and Evening has been our daily companion for 4 years and this sleek, easy to carry along version is an extra blessing. The leather feels good in the hands and the contents are life changing. We thank God for Spurgeon."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Lovely little book... one of my two favorite devotional books. I bought it as a gift. Spurgeon understood people and he loved God. He is one of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"In the way of Spirit-ministered Truth, Spurgeon pulls the heart apart and applies the healing salve of gracious, living truth in its uplifting fulness. I don't know how many times I have found myself broken into, robbed of my personal treasures, and then filled with treasures that are inexpressible. He has the God-given ability to let humility be the foundation of what he presents on every page. Rewards? His continue to multiply in a way that must surely extract the address form the Lord Jesus, \\"Well done thou good and faithful servant\\"!Alive in Him is Spurgeon indeed! Alive through Him is the Word as it was preached! Death did not kill the testimony to the Truth that he so dearly, dearly loved."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"I just downloaded this book to my Kindle; my husband downloaded this book to his Nook. The formatting on the Kindle is sub-par, there are no chapters; cannot navigate except page to page. The Nook edition is the same price but is formatted so much better with chapters for each day and with no extra spaces in the middle of words. Although I should not rate the book without reading it, I'm sure the content will be good; however, a heads-up for those who are particular with formatting (and I'm not!)."},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Charles Spurgeon's \\"Morning and Evening (a devotional classic based on the King James Version)\\" is classic devotion and now is in paperback and very affordable which makes his potent words even more accessible. A pastor's heart is expressed as he directs the reader to the joy found in Jesus. Readings are for each morning and each evening.In this contemporary edition one finds:- the same splendid prose (from the traditional text) of the prince of preachers- a daily spiritual tool to get fired-up in the AM for the Lord- powerful life changing truth that yields peace and comfort at night- the KJV English flows throughout.One example from a morning:\\"Prayers are instantly noticed in heaven. The moment Saul began to pray the Lord heard him. Here is comfort for the distressed but praying soul. Oftentimes a poor broken-hearted one bends his knee, but can only utter his wailing in the language of sighs and tears; yet that groan has made all the harps of heaven thrill with music; that tear has been caught by God and treasured in the lachrymatory of heaven. \\"Thou puttest my tears into thy bottle,\\" implies that they are caught as they flow. The suppliant, whose fears prevent his words, will be well understood by the Most High. He may only look up with misty eye; but \\"prayer is the falling of a tear.\\" Tears are the diamonds of heaven; sighs are a part of the music of Jehovah's court, and are numbered with \\"the sublimest strains that reach the majesty on high.\\" Think not that your prayer, however weak or trembling, will be unregarded. Jacob's ladder is lofty, but our prayers shall lean upon the Angel of the covenant and so climb its starry rounds.\\"\\"Our God not only hears prayer but also loves to hear it. \\"He forgetteth not the cry of the humble.\\" True, He regards not high looks and lofty words; He cares not for the pomp and pageantry of kings; He listens not to the swell of martial music; He regards not the triumph and pride of man; but wherever there is a heart big with sorrow, or a lip quivering with agony, or a deep groan, or a penitential sigh, the heart of Jehovah is open; He marks it down in the registry of His memory; He puts our prayers, like rose leaves, between the pages of His book of remembrance, and when the volume is opened at last, there shall be a precious fragrance springing up therefrom.\\"\\"Behold, he prayeth\\" Acts 9:11.In C.H. Spurgeon's \\"Morning and Evening\\" one find 732 readings that will touch you, move you, draw you closer to God through mighty words that will teach you the essentials of the faith.If you are interested in the Ten Commandments or apologetics see:There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies\\"God Does Exist!: Defending the Faith using Presuppositional Apologetics, Evidence, and the Impossibility of the Contrary\\" ASIN:1420827626"},{"Title":"MORNING AND EVENING BASED ON THE NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION","review":"Can't complain much since it's just .99, but having no chapters or table of contents makes this book hard to navigate."},{"Title":"The brigand; (Pan books)","review":"Admittedly I'm a fan of the Edgar Wallace & E Phillips Oppenheim type of fiction. \\"The Brigand\\" contains 12 chapters, each of which is a short story in itself, but which form a continuing narrative. The hero, Tony Newton, is a down-on-his-luck WWI veteran who takes takes up a career as a brigand - basically a modern Robin Hood who fleeces rich capitalist crooks for his own benefit. Some of the scams are pretty clever; some just average."},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"As an instructor I cut my teeth on Machen and for several years taught using Mounce but this combination of CD and printable texts has really unleashed my students. I like how the verb is introduced first so within 4 lessons students can already start with sentences having verbs and nouns enough to begin with. My students don't feel pressure that they have to copy everything said in class down or try to figure out a phonetic way of writing what was pronounced in clas as they know that the program will pronounce it for them with the click of a mouse.They really liked saving money buying one CD which has all the textbooks, workbooks, lexicon and a vocabulary builder all in one. The interactive part is an overlap with a program called Greek Tutor but this CD goes far beyond that.As an instructor I contacted Baker Book House and they made available to me all the PowerPoint slides to teach MNTG to my class. That has saved so much time rather than writing everything on the overhead or board now its just projected in an instant and I didn't have to develop any of them.The workbook works well having a place for student names with each excercise. I have my students do about 1.5 chapters a week and they like the foldunders which give them the answer on 10-15 examples before they have to try it on their own. There is also an instructor's key provided but the student answer key has all the evens...unfortunately too many of my students used that.One thing I liked as we draw near to finishing second semester is the Vocab Builder which takes them beyond the first year and introduces a vocabulary building list that will last them the rest of their lives. It comes both in interactive format pronouncing the words and also in a text format similar to Trenchard/Warren's word list. The complete lexicon also takes them beyond second year although I encourage them to think about getting into BibleWorks or BibleWindows.Not sure whether the program would work for a totally independent situation but it sure works great in the classroom. My students loved it and it gave me the resources that made it easy to teach. Those pre-made PowerPoints saved me tons of class prep time!Perhaps what I like best is its $32 price tag for basically everything my students needed for first year Greek. Actually I only got through 1 John 1-5 so I directed them over the summer to work through Hildebrandt's easy reader for John 1-5 and also to hit the vocab builder down to about 700 words. If they do that they'll be ready when they come back for second year.The students are more tech savy than I am and they liked all having all the resources available whenever they wanted them. The scores have gone up in my class as I've used quizzes from previous years and the students are getting and enjoying the materials better than before. I've also been able to move a little more quickly as they have the resources if they don't get it in class.Greek's still hard for many and I wish there was a purple pill to make it easy but this is the next best thing."},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"Dr. Hildebrandt made this program so students would not have to pay $100 or more on textbooks. It is a common misconception that this program is meant to make you a scholar of New Testament Greek. In actuality, it is not. It is meant to give you a foundation to work off of - there is so much more to learn! Therefore, you should not expect the world of this program. You get the basics you need for further study, but, for what it is, this program is tremendous. And, as a professor, I could not ask for anyone better than Dr. Hildebrandt."},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"This CD makes learning Greek a joy. I have taught Greek for several years using standard texts (Mounce, Machen...) with my students paying nearly $100 for books, workbooks, supplements etc. This CD built off the old Greek Tutor program adds a complete textbook (350 pages) and a workbook (250 pages) with about 10 pages of tons of drills going way beyond the original Tutor program including short/long translations (usually 25 per chapter) and parsings, vocabulary drills and a mixing it up section as well as fold-unders which are solved parsings/translations which the students can use to get their feet wet in new material (usually about 20 parsings/translations per chapter already solved). The students can print and reprint the exercises as desired. Rather than purchasing 4-5 books its all on the CD. What a savings! There is also a vocabulary builder which goes down to all the words used 9x and more in the NT. The brief lexicon has every word in the Gk. New Testament with a brief definition saving an initial investment in DBAG until the second year. The textbook has an English-Greek lexicon and a one page summary of each chapter giving the students quick resources to review with.Best of all is the interactive part where the computer speaks Greek so students can drill themselves with interactive exercises and go over and over it until they get it in an interactive environment. Many I have known have gotten the CD and taught themselves Greek even passing Seminary entrance exams after using these materials. Everything one needs for first year Greek is on this CD and more. The whole text of 1 John and John 1-5 is formatted in an interactive way so that when a word is click it is pronounced, translated, parsed and even the page in DBAG is given. This easy reading format helps students into reading without being overwhelmed reinforcing the grammar learned earlier. Hildebrandt's web site even has downloadable mp3's that students can get to listen to their vocabulary when jogging or for commuters on the road. All in all I've been very pleased and it is the best thing currently on the market and saved each students $30-40 and more.For faculty Hildebrandt also offers free of charge Powerpoint presentations that go over all the content of the etextbook and eworkbook.This CD made the difference for many of my students!"},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"This program has been a life saver for me. I'm preparing to take a Greek exam. I got the program and it helped me to review the basic syntax. Having the pronunciations available just a click away helped cement the words into my hearing as well as my sight.The 350 page textbook was very useful and I was able to use it while commuting by train to work each day. I followed up doing the written exercises from the 250 page workbook. These excercises were different and much more extensive than the interactive program itself. The \\"Foldunder\\" section gives you fifteen well worked out examples with answers so you have some good models to work through before attempting the excercises themselves (there is an answer key for all the even ones which is also very helpful when puzzling over a translation or parsing).I can see where the combination of the textbook and the workbook together would work very well in a course and were a good combination for my review. The textbook I should say has a quick review summary of each chapter in 2 pages which made it very quick to refresh. The interactive excercises pushed me with having to spell words out in Greek either with or mercifully without the accents.What was also very helpful was the easy-reader which allowed me to read 1 John and John 1-5 simply clicking on any word to have it parsed, translated and pronounced. With these eleven chapter under my belt I was ready for the exam.Don't overlook the vocab builder (both interactive and text formats, I really like having both). The program also helped me resurrect my vocabulary. It allows you to go all the way down to the words used 9x and more. There is also a lexicon in about 80 pages that covers every word in the NT with a short definition.I guess what I find really handy is having all of these resources packaged together. Before I had to buy a textbook, then a workbook, Metzger's Word List and then drop the big one for BAGD. Still need BAGD or BibleWorks or something but this has all the basics for first year.I also found Hildebrandt's website at Gordon College where I discovered *.mp3's for downloading audio Greek for 1 John and the vocabulary builder which I can load on my ipod. It's free and very helpful to learn to listen instead of always being in \\"read\\" mode. I also discovered a host of articles on the Imperative, conditional structures, participles and Burton's complete grammar there. It's for free! What a find!In short this program helped me successfully prepare for a comp. over first year Greek. Great for quick review and to be honest I wish I had had all these helpful ways of learning when I learned Greek the first time."},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"This CD makes learning Greek a joy.

New Testament with a brief definition saving an initial investment in DBAG until the second year. The textbook has an English-Greek lexicon and a one page summary of each chapter giving the students quick resources to review with.Best of all is the interactive part where the computer speaks Greek so students can drill themselves with interactive exercises and go over and over it until they get it in an interactive environment. Many I have known have gotten the CD and taught themselves Greek even passing Seminary entrance exams after using these materials. Everything one needs for first year Greek is on this CD and more. The whole text of 1 John and John 1-5 is formatted in an interactive way so that when a word is click it is pronounced, translated, parsed and even the page in DBAG is given. This easy reading format helps students into reading without being overwhelmed reinforcing the grammar learned earlier. Hildebrandt's web site even has downloadable mp3's that students can get to listen to their vocabulary when jogging or for commuters on the road. All in all I've been very pleased and it is the best thing currently on the market and saved each students $30-40 and more.For faculty Hildebrandt also offers free of charge Powerpoint presentations that go over all the content of the etextbook and eworkbook. Check out his online site for a ton of free books and mp3's you can use--1 John to Mozart. Really helpful.This CD made the difference for many of my students!"},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"Seems to be a great way to learn Greek.

I had to go to other resources to understand this area."},{"Title":"Mastering New Testament Greek on CD-ROM: An Interactive Guide for Beginners (Greek Edition)","review":"I am a homeschool mom.

It doesn't substitute for a good book (like Mounce's, which for its shortcomings is still my favorite).Verbal pronunciations are very helpful for not only learning to pronounce the words, but to memorize the vocabulary. Since the biggest obstacle to learning Greek is knowing how English \\"works\\", there are helps in this regard. Material covers an entire first year Greek course.However lessons are disappointingly very, very short, as are the \\"drills\\" (in other words, a lot of ground is covered in a very short lesson). This is excusable for a textbook that assumes you have a teacher to ask questions to, but is much less excusable for an interactive program that attempts to replace the teacher. I suppose Hildebrandt does this on purpose, but I don't like the end results. On the positive side, the lessons are generally short enough to complete in a single sitting, which for those of us who have short attention spans or not a lot of time, is a good thing.The interface reminds me of Windows 3.1, very simple to use, and anyone who was very new to computers would be able to use the program successfully. It also means that the interface is dated - cheesy window with cheesy icons and very basic navigation.Another disappointment is that \\"exceptions\\" to the rules are given too much attention and end up being confusing (I'd rather he stuck with what's \\"normal\\" and pick up the exceptions in later lessons once you've had a chance to master the earlier material).I also have \\"Greek Tutor\\", which I thought was going to be a different product, but is actually the exact same thing without the \\"extra\\" ebooks. The books that come with Mastering NT Greek are:Mastering NT Greek Textbook (MNTG) by T. Hildebrandt (basically this is the same thing as the program in PDF format)MNTG Workbook (basically the drills in PDF format)MNTG Vocabulary builder (sets of vocabulary words and basic definitions in PDF format)MNTG Lexicon (basically a brief dictionary written by Hildebrandt in PDF format)MNTG Workbook Answers (answers to the drills in PDF format)You're not really getting anything that isn't already incorporated into the electronic lessons.My recommendation is to get it if you don't have a teacher and like the interactive experience to keep you going, but supplement it with a textbook (preferably Basics of Biblical Greek by William Mounce). If the drills are too short for you, pick up Mounce's workbook or the \\"Student's Guide: Essentials of New Testament Greek\\" workbook by Steven Cox to supplement it."},{"Title":"The labours of Hercules: An astrological interpretation","review":"One of the easier to read of Bailey's very heady works, but non the less, contains a vast amount of wisdom and wonderful keys to self unfoldment. Each sign of the Zodiac is explained and its true purpose in this lifetime revealed. A great inspirational book to carry in the briefcase or suitcase, to read before a walk on the beach or in the woods."},{"Title":"The labours of Hercules: An astrological interpretation","review":"This book provides a mythical story about each of the 12 Labors of Hercules. Each labor corresponds to one of the astrological signs. There is a discussion about the symbolism of the myth after each one. Hercules represents each of us - a soul incarnate in matter, and the labors represent the difficulties and tests we encounter in the material world. It's fascinating to read the labor for the current month each month as we go through the astrological year.Alice Bailey's books are somewhat difficult to read, but well worth it for the spiritual seeker. Her work has resonated with me as truth more deeply than anything I've ever read. It is highly mental material, and I can only read a few pages at a time. Any more than that gives me a headache."},{"Title":"The labours of Hercules: An astrological interpretation","review":"This order should be cancelled.

In this comparison, the Haynes manual falls a little short in terms of the quality of the photographs and diagrams (especially the wiring diagrams), but is still very useful.The book is well organized and easy to read, and contains good detail on just about every rebuild, including transmissions, engine, rear end, brakes, etc. As the cover says: &quot;...Based on a complete teardown and rebuild.&quot;I'm about to embark on a complete teardown and rebuild of a '71 2002, and bought this book to make sure I would have all the information necessary to complete this project. All of the stock BMW carburetion systems are covered, but my car has dual Weber 40 DCOEs (a common aftermarket addition). The excellent &quot;Weber Carburettors Owners Workshop Manual&quot; from Haynes covers them.After reviewing it, I'm satisified that everything I will need is there, equivalent in content to the BMW and Bentley manuals.

It's worth tracking down. Loren D. Estleman is one of the best prose stylists in the business. STAMPING GROUND features his U.S. Marshal Page Murdock, a middle-aged Civil War vet with a limp. Page is sent to the Dakotas to capture and bring to justice the young firebrand chieftain Ghost Shirt. Accompanying Page are stolid Marshal Hudspeth and the half-breed scout Pere Jac. Their adventures, including the apprehension of Ghost Shirt, unravel at a bullet-fast pace. The realistic descriptions of landscape and the gritty characters make this Western a superior read than most I've tried. Page is a sympathetic figure who doesn't take himself seriously, only his assigned mission."},{"Title":"Stamping Ground (Page Murdock, US Deputy Marshall, Book 2)","review":"Stamping Ground by Loren Estleman is another Page Murdock western and it's a good one. In this novel Murdock goes after a renegade called Ghost Shirt. All the usual Estleman flavor is here: tight writing, violence, believable characters. If I have any gripe it's how Estleman starts and finishes the book. He has his character Murdock start off by telling us that stories often start in the past before the people we know become involved. And then he goes into some heavy backstory. The ending is similar in that Murdock presents a laundry list of what happened to whom after the events he relates come to a close.I know what Estleman is trying to do, I just don't think he's successful. I'm old school. A story should have a specific beginning, middle and end. This novel drifts into the main story from the beginning and then drifts back out. I think it's a poor stylistic choice. To be fair, I'm not saying Estleman doesn't pull it off. Because he does. It's just irksome to me.Still, Stamping Ground is a good read. If you like Estleman (and I do) then you will certainly like this book."},{"Title":"Stamping Ground (Page Murdock, US Deputy Marshall, Book 2)","review":"I got this old Page Murdock from Amazon.

Itten was as much interested in the spirituality of color as in developing a theory of color.Another great aspect of the book is the numerous master paintings beautifully reproduced and intertwined with his own theories and color diagrams. You get paintings by Rembrandt, Renoir, Monet, El Greco, Seurat, and so many others. Itten is always contrasting the objective and the subjective aspects of art and color, and it makes for a fascinating reading experience.Itten has a mature perspective on these painters and their relation to color. Its only flaw is that Itten's is only one perspective. I wish there were more authors who could write and analyze art at this level, and who weren't afraid to be spiritual in their assessments.With so many dramatic advancements in technology, we tend to forget very quickly where we were. Just a decade or so ago, this book was literally too difficult and too expensive to produce. We are lucky to live in an age in which a book of such profound beauty is even available. Overall, it's a must for any fine library."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"This book of Johannes Itten is a good example of the use of colour in the antroposofic way. He connects the different colours with moods and feelings, religious symbols and even gives it a spiritual dimension. For me it was an eye-opener on the aspect of harmony. Itten emphasizes that the eye and mind are always looking for balance, harmony in the sense of a grey-tone. If a work of art does not reflect this kind of harmony, for instance because of a distonality in the use of colours, the eye and mind get restless and agitated. But if used on purpose this aspect of colour gives a work of art a very strong impact and makes it a masterpiece.[...]."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"Anyone interested in the color theory and its applicance on art should seriously consider this book. Everything explained is illustrated by high quality examples and samples from different artists' work; definitely made me happy."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"I'd studied physiology and neuroscience, later switching careers from a medical path to that of a designer. I've dived into many sources for my self-education/training. Itten is the grand-master of color; no other book I've read compares to those of Itten. His teachings have enlightened me in ways that I'm amazed by, touching on scientific, psychological, behavioral, and the most personal aspects of color as a study and an experience. It's changed the way I look at my environment, and it's changing the way I use color in my work as a designer.I'm so impressed with the value this book has had to me, that I bought Itten's book on Form and Design, even though I didn't necessarily feel lacking on those aspects of design. It's rather because of the likelihood in the quality and richenss of knowledge I'll gain, as I did from this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"As an artist who uses color in my work, this book has been invaluable. The color wheel has always been my primary reference for color combinations; however, since reading Johannes Itten book, an entirely new world of understanding and enlightenment has evolved. I love this book for how it has enriched my knowledge and passion for color."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"The Art of Color describes seven innate contrasts in color, giving special significance to Simultaneous Contrast. Further, Itten describes the psychological effects of color, the analogous shapes to each color, drops the names of several color theorists which can be used for a jumping off point for further study, provides several exercises for the reader, and gives eye-opening analyses of a wide variety of paintings, from Rembrandt to Seurat to van Gogh to Mondrian.The text is not perfect, and suffers from deficiencies stemming from the fact that color was not as well understood when Itten was developing these theories. The primary colors are described as red, yellow, blue, instead of the red, green, blue (and complements cyan, magenta, yellow) that we know today.Another deficiency is a striking lack of several color effects described in other contemporary texts on color theory, such as the Bezold effect, vibrating colors, and the Weber-Fechner law.Still, this text is not to be missed. It is probably the most comprehensive text on color that is not written from a purely technical standpoint."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"We have both the original printing (1961) and the later printing (1973). The later printing fails to do justice to Itten's principles.

Our rating of 5 stars applies to the 1961 printing."},{"Title":"The Art of Color The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color.","review":"A little expensive, but well laid out and designed.

I asked for advice about color theory books on computer graphics forums and was recommended this book many times...what a waste. The entire book is nothing but comments by the author on the use of color in classic paintings. Stupid comments about things that anyone with common sense could observe like: \\"look at the white robe makes the woman in the foreground stand out against the black curtain. Whats really hilarious about this is that most of the paintings are about historical events in nature where the painter had no other choice but to paint what he saw. Mr Itten seems to think that the painter had control over what people wore in history in order to make their paintings look more dramatic."},{"Title":"Fraternity village","review":"A beautiful collection of wonderful short stories set in a village in rural Maine.

She relies on an obvious and powerful training in literary analysis to consider the history and multiple uses of salsa as a form of expression, communication, and community formation. However, the most important contribution of this work is its concentration on gender and on the ways in which desire, identity and language are negotiatied upon music. It is clear that years of research went into the production of this monograph, especially since it manages to balance historical exploration with critical analysis. The benefit to this multidisciplinary approach is that the book can serve a variety of purposes, from providing basic information, to offering complex textual analyses. This makes the book useful for non-academic readers, as well as the academics for whom it was intended. However, since the book doesn't come with a CD, those not well-versed in the songs discussed might need to do extra research. With the increasing popularity of Latin music, it is imperative that everyone who listens to salsa be involved in analyzing why we like it, and what we do with the music we consume. This book can help lovers of salsa start to frame these questions. Hopefully, it will also encourage other listeners to write their own perceptions on salsa and how it connects with other aspects of daily life and with self-identity. It is time to value popular culture in terms other than dollars and cents, which is what this project begins to do. Now, if only someone wrote a book on West Coast salsa my library would be complete."},{"Title":"Listening to Salsa: Gender, Latin Popular Music, and Puerto Rican Cultures (Music Culture)","review":"&quot;Listening to Salsa&quot; is a scholarly wake up call to anyone who is interested in this genre. After reading it, you will probably never listen to Salsa the same way and it is probably just as well! What I discovered by reading this book is that I was hearing the music but not really listening. &quot;Listening to Salsa&quot; will give you a deeper appreciation of the nuances, intricacies and gender issues that comprise Salsa.As an aspiring writer on the subject, I know that I will be referring back to this book time and time again. Congratulations to the author and I look forward to reading and enjoying more of her work in the future!"},{"Title":"Listening to Salsa: Gender, Latin Popular Music, and Puerto Rican Cultures (Music Culture)","review":"I strongly disagree with the other reviewers. Some research was done in writing this book, but the writer lacks in depth knowledge of salsa culture. Also too much analysis is drawn from other genres such as the bolero, danza and plena and the conclusions applied to salsa too liberally.The author is happy to mention that black innovators Ismael Rivera and Cortijo they pushed black Puerto Rican culture into every household in the island. But rather than rejoice in this success, she destroys it by commenting that the contributions of light skinned latinos have \\"whitewashed\\" and diluted the music. Tito Puente, Ismael Miranda, Hector Lavoe and even the non-hispanic Larry Harlow were all light skinned innovators in the hard salsa scene of the 60s and 70s.Her second point of contention is the relationship in which salsa music deals with and portrays women. As the vast majority of musicians, singers and songwriters are men, it should be no surprise that salsa offers a mostly male point of view. But it is problematic that she chose to use a study of a Tex-Mex nightclub to make inferences about salsa when those genres never come together, and Mexican culture differs significantly from the Puerto Rican she focuses.Finally these two lines join together into a conclusion about Puerto Rican males and their view of women in relationships, white as wives, black as prostitute lovers. And hence she goes on to explain that in salsa lyrics when they sing about \\"mi negrita\\" or \\"mi mulata\\", all they are talking about is their prostitute lovers. The problem is that all salseros, including her black heroes, use those terms.But the biggest problem is that a lot of her sources for explaining her viewpoints do not come from those same musicians, singers and songwriters who she is analyzing, so she makes basic mistakes. Regarding Cortijo's and Rafael Ithier's bands she claims that the \\"Combo\\", was a greater musical outlet than an \\"Orchestra\\". A problem arises when one considers that Puerto Ricans use the word \\"Orquesta\\" when referring to all salsa bands, regardless of whether it is a sonora (trumpets band), trombanga (trombones and flute band) or combo (trumpets and saxes band)."},{"Title":"Music Contracts 101 - Updated Edition - Preprinted Binder / CD-ROM set containing over 100 contracts and agreements for recording artist, musicians, ... industry.

The Hopewell of the WWII years and the post-war period in no way resembles the one depicted in this book. As someone who grew up in the Petersburg-Hopewell-Fort Lee (then Camp Lee) environs, I am fully aware that Hopewell, far from being a sleepy little rural town, was a thriving manufacturing center with a fully staffedpolice department, a good educational system, and law enforcement was not in the hands of a one-man sheriff's department. I picked this up to read because of the local setting and the further I read, the further my jaw dropped.I can only guess that Mr. Miller picked up on the town name and its proximity to a large military base and wrote his book without doing any actual research.If one chooses to use an actual locale as the setting for a work of fiction, one is then obligated to maintain the integrity of the setting even though the people and plot are fictional."},{"Title":"Tropical Heat","review":"I found this book accidentally, what a nice surprise! It's got a little bit of everything, one of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Tropical Heat","review":"Hopewell, Virginia is a sleepy little town where nothing ugly ever happens and race relations seem to be fine. Sheriff A.G. Farrell had planned to stay in the big city but when war broke out, he was asked to serve a term for Sheriff. Twelve years later, he is still the sheriff although he doesn't wear a uniform or carry a badge. He has gotten into a routine and lives up to the town's expectations of him.A.G.'s complacency is about to be shattered by the scandalous murder of Captain Fitzgerald, a soldier stationed at Ft. Lee. With just a little digging, the sheriff learns that Private Carbone's wife was having an affair with the captain and that the enlisted man possessed the murder weapon. Carbone is arrested for the homicide. A.G. thinks the case is wrapped up a little too neatly but before he can dig any deeper, he meets the captain's wife, a beautiful and seductive woman and begins an affair with her. The unprofessional behavior clouds his judgment so that all his future actions involving the captain's death are skewed by his desire for the lovely widow.John A. Miller has written a complex and introspective work that reflects the social morals and values of the fifties. The key characters in TROPICAL HEAT are people that are unforgettable. Though one sub-plot add nothing to the main story line, overall the mystery is designed for the reader to see the truth right away, but cleverly executed to keep the audience's attention till the end.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy!

The prose is turgid and tension builds up to a certain point and then peters away in the weakest prose I have read in print in many years. The poverty of the story line is striking. There is only one memorable character and she is so, I suspect, only because I remember her from volume one, where she was reasonably well presented.Even when something vaguely dramatic happens, it occurs off stage and is reported by a letter or by somebody who heard of it from somebody else. This absence of on-scene action is the fatal flaw of amateur fiction the world over. I keep wondering how this book and the series it comes from could have obtained such a great reputation, unless the story sounds infinitely better in the original Indonesian. But the loudest praise comes from reviewers in overseas publications who would not have read it in the original. Did they read it at all? Or was it the politically correct thing to praise?"},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"&quot;Child of All Nations&quot; is excellent reading for those interested in history, more specifically, the history of the Dutch East Indies. The reason I gave this novel four stars, however, and not five is because with all the historical references in the novel, it masks the underlying plot and also does not allow the reader to connect personally with the characters. The writing style in this novel, like it's predisessor,&quot;This Earth of Mankind,&quot; is impressional, and moving.The message in the story is also very moving. The novel makes you think and helps the reader come to understand humanity more effeciently than they did before reading the novel. This set of novels (The Buru Quartet) are a comprised collection of intellectually stimulating and touching peice of literature."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"Sorry, being so late, but you've done the job. The writer of this book, twice nominator for Nobel Prize, the victim of Buru exilement--without trial, the so called communist by Soeharto regime--but widely known as humanist is an Indonesian. So, read geography. Read history. I am--uhmmm--insulted, (a little bit) by such LITTLE ignorance."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"This follow-on tale from This Earth of Mankind has some interesting stories woven throughout -- for instance the tale of the young maiden who willingly contracts smallpox to avoid a life of shame as a concubine. However, the book lacks the momentum (and uniqueness) of his first novel. It also lacks subtlty and tends to be somewhat preachy. In this book the reader gets beaten over the head mercilessly in contrast to the gentle pats from This Earth. It just wasn't as fun. That said, it still has some interesting angles on a life and culture so very foreign to a turn-of-the-21st century American. And it has some poignant fragments, particularly those insights on the life of Minke's strong-willed concubine mother-in-law. It's still worth reading even though it's not of This Earth. I'm looking forward to Footsteps."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"I want to correct a serious error in the last sentence of the first review posted on this page. It says that Toer's books &quot;are banned in his native MALAYSIA.&quot; This is not the correct country. Toer is a native of INDONESIA, and the Buru quartet chronicles the emotional, political and social emergence of that nation. I met the author when I had the opportunity to translate for him during his trip to the US in 1999 -- I strongly feel that he would want people to know that his country is Indonesia!"},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"Pramoedya's ability to illustrate the conflicts among the pure Javanese natives, half-breed Indos, and the Dutch colonialist masters is nothing short of phenomenal. The rights of the natives proved to be meaningless when it came face to face against the greeds of the colonial masters."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"I read \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" about a year ago and since then, I was wondering what happened with the characters. I don't like to stick with the same story for a long time, so I needed a few months to pad. In the meantime, I dedicated my time with other books and after I finished \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", somehow I decided that it was time to go back to Minke & co.I was very disappointed with \\"Child of All Nations\\". First of all, you will need to read \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" before touching this book. These books are not independent. If you don't read \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" first, you won't have any idea of what is going on. Or maybe let me correct myself... You may get an idea of what is going on because basically there is no much going on.Proer spends pages, pages and more pages preaching on Indonesian cast society and all the craziness that was the Dutch colonization. I got the point!!! He was obviously more interested in that than in the story. All the action on this book could fit 5-10 pages.I like historical novels, not history books. This is 95% history and 5% novel.Two stars because at least I read until the end (although I totally forgot if there was a conclusion). This book was mostly waste of my time and I lost my interest on the \\"Buru Quartet\\"."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"Even more compelling than his first in the series, this book continues the story of Menke, Nyai, Darsam et al. and the Dutch sugar baron occupation of Eastern and Central Java. More detail on the odious treatment of the natives in the name of European corporate greed. As a Dutch descendent married to a Javanese woman I now understand much better than she could tell me about that oppression, and marvel that they don't seem to stll hate us. Human love and concern for one another are seen to shine through though and it is hard to end this book without a tear. In addtion to a good story and interesting history, springled through it are jewels of universal wisdom worth quoting. These books should be required reading and a part of any world citizen's education. On to book number 3 - then I may re-read the 4th, which I read first."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"This book is a great novel about Dutch occupation of Indonesia. Very interesting and good history presented in novel form."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"This is the second book in the wonderfully written Buru quartet. Originally composed and recited orally while the author was in prison for political reasons, the story was published in 4 volumes. The main themes are colonialism, class structure, and injustice in 1900 Indonesia. The main characters are a young native (Javanese) student, and native Nyai (concubine of a Dutch colonialist), her children, and various other characters as they confront their roles, the expectations of that society, and the injustices that entails. So far, this has been one of the best series I have ever read. One just gets totally into this world and deeply enmeshed with the characters. This particular volume continues where the last one left off. The native/Dutch daughter of Nyai has been sent to the Netherlands, where she suffers from deep depression. The family in Indonesia are frantic to help her. What will happen? I don't dare say here because it will give too much away. Another continuation from Book 1 is the reappearance of \\"Fatso,\\" as we discover who he is and why he is following members of the family. Finally, we discover what has happened to Anneliese's brother, Robert, and what dreadful fate awaited him. I recommend this book highly and hope that everyone will read this wonderful author."},{"Title":"Child of All Nations (Buru Quartet)","review":"This book is part of a four book set that Pramoedya composed while a political prisoner.

Pramoedya Ananta Toer is not a Malaysian and his books are not banned in Malaysia. I am from Malaysia and I read his book \\"Keluarga Gerilya\\" (Guerrila Family)for Malay Lieterature during my school days sometime in 1985. Pramoedya is an Indonesian and his books are banned in his native Indonesia.

The language, struggles and emotional conflicts allow the reader to visualize the time and be move by the story page by page. Pramoedya Ananta Toer is a great writer and I would recommend him to everyone."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"Robin Cook again shows us that his novels contain an element that may affect you. In Fatal Cure, he questions HMOs and the morality about it all. Like most Cook novels, a few of the &quot;mysteries&quot; are easy to figure out from the beginning, but the book will still keep you in suspense. A great read!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"\\"Fatal Cure\\" is a quick read. There's no depth of character to slow the reader; but the plot weaves as pages turn. Dr. Angela Wilson is a pathologist who does not like her boss touching her on the derriere or pulling her onto his lap for a peek at the microscope, a scientific lap dance. When she complains about sexual harassment, her boss suddenly gets upset with her. Then when a dead body of the former hospital administrator is found in her basement requiring continual absences from work, she gets fired! Where is CSI Vermont!?! ... This book was fun because something was always happening. It was also frustrating because the characters lacked perception. This is a fast read that's fiction's nutritional equivalent to cotton candy. A definite maybe!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This is the kind of books that I like of Dr. Cook, of course I am not a doctor so I don't understand many things about medicine, but this book is definitely a medical thrillers, and as all of his books you will think twice before you go to a doctor or a hospital.The story of the hospital that want to save money instead of save patients is not out of reality, in other words I can believe that these things could happened in a small town or a place that have not too many hospitals.It has one or two mistakes with their daughter, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't be real."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I thought the plot was great and he developped the characters very well.I'm reading Vector now - it's quite good so far!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I cannot get enough of this author. I am a registered nurse, and I see the effects of managed care regulary - this book takes it to the ultimate fictional extreme, but the thought of it possibly becoming reality is chilling!!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This book is an awesome book. A story about two doctors, who move to Bartlett, Vermont to practice health care. Things go wrong from day one. I don't want to spoil things for you, but if you love mystery and suspense, with a tinge of medical tecno jumbo, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This book was unintentionally laughable. The dialogue was absurd - I guarantee that no one in the world has ever uttered the words these characters do. Of course, the bad dialogue is only half of the problem - the ridiculous plot is the rest. The synopsis should read \\"Two doctors, thought to be brilliant, behave like idiots in a quest to solve a mystery.\\" The plot was so transparent that I kept reading, hoping that there would be a twist or something worthwhile to take from the book. Sadly, that was not the case."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I've read more than a dozen Cook novels and this one is the best yet. At times, he tends to have unrealistic plots and characters that make dumb decisions, but in this one most everything tracked. People acted in ways that were reasonable, and yet the plot stayed fresh and the characters likable. I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"Complete waste of time! I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!! Give me a break!! Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.) The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I recall loving \\"Coma\\" which was Robin Cook's first novel. My advice to him now is to give up writing. Fatal Cure has these starry-eyed former Boston med students being offered good positions with a hospital in Vermont. It is all so trite and obvious when they are offered a great home from the bank and everyone on staff is smiling ear to ear. Others have told you the basic plot, but it opens with an orthopedist being depressed about the deaths of two of his patients who had been doing very well until hospitalized. These new kids on the block are not interested in this said orthopedist's supposed suicide, nor checking his patient records. The new doctor begins having the same problem, yet he accepts his patient deaths as his fault. Duh. His pathologist wife is being sexually harassed and although she is an independent and outspoken woman, she says nothing about it for way too long. This book is about an HMO dictating what patients will be treated and where (ER or inpatient). The author says the health crisis in this country is our government's fault, when in fact I firmly believe HMOs are the problem and Cook even proves that in this silly book!! It all ends after many ridiculous moves by our two fledgling doctors and then who do they go to work for in NY? An HMO!!!!!!!!!!! So bad. Shame on you Robin Cook.

Being a native Vermonter I kept being distracted by the fact that the book talked about a Vermont town that simply doesn't exist. It isn't just that it's a fictional town, it's that the setting is totally unreal. It appears to have been written by someone who's seen some Vermont postcards, but never spent any time in the state. There simply aren't places in Vermont where nearby hospitals have been put out of business by HMO's and other hospitals, other than Burlington where the facilities have essentially consolidated. There is no way that Burlington could be mistaken for Cook's setting.The Vermonters in the story don't act like real Vermonters, the yuppie professionals in the story are unrealistic as well.Having said that there are some factual pieces about hospitals forcing doctors out of private practices into hospital controlled practices.The unreality in this story really detracted from the story line as a whole. Also I was perplexed as to why the couple would allow their daughter to be hospitalized in a hospital where patients were dying mysteriously. It isn't like there are no other hospitals in the state. People routinely travel for an hour plus in Vermont to get better medical care than is available locally.All in all the book's polemics were interesting, but the lack of knowledge of the setting and poor character development made it not one of Cook's best. Before he writes about Vermont again he ought to come and live here for 6 months or so."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"Robin Cook has a political message, but is not content to let the message come across with anything less than the force of a sledgehammer. He has rammed the same message about managed care down the readers throat one time too often. I found this book was extremely annoying to read, despite the fact that I agree with the message! Dr. Cook does not seem to even try to develop his characters, and the writing is what one would expect from an eighth grader, not a mature author. Don't waste your time reading this one!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This was the first book by Robin Cook I ever read.

This was a extremely interesting book, with intricate details and an exciting plot. The only drawback to the book was the length. Although the book remained exciting throughout the book, the end could have been tightened to remove unneccesary and sometimes boring information.

A married couple start a hospital business where they can treat several patients in a day, including their daughter who suffers from crystic fibrosis.

It was a great tapebook, which had a manageable number of characters to keep up with, and a nice weave of stories linking them to the storyline. The conclusion as to the &quot;fatal cure&quot; was something I had long figured out before the somewhat dim-witted physician family around which the story swirled. I agree that the child proved to be the bright light in a gloomy town.

I could not put it down"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"As a healthcare professional, Robin Cook's books arechillingly realistic.

This time Cook has truely constructed a horrifying piece of fiction which seems easily possible in reality,considering the technological progress made by this world.Gawd !! I would be real scared to be hospitalized after reading this book."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"In this twist of Cook's signature \\"doctors-gone-wild\\" plotline, unsuspecting patients of a rural hospital are plagued by sudden unexplainable deaths as a duo of doctors digs up the dirt. Literally. Although many of Cook's plots are quite similar, his style is fast-paced suspense that will have the readers guessing at the bad-guy until the last turn. I'm generally not a fan of redundant plotlines or recycled characters, but I've recently noticed Cook's works embody a gigantic medical ethics course. Each book explores a new ethical dilemma. Fatal Cure suggests to the reader that although America's medical system needs to be renovated, we may be driving it down an even more dangerous superhighway--one with very few exits. This is not one of Cook's best works. His introduction to the hospital backdrop limps through a few &lt;gag!> administrative meetings. I'm already having nightmares about administrative meetings, thank-you, I don't need to read about them at bedtime. Once the readers zone out (or check their blackberries) through this sludgy beginning, the plot quickly picks up pace. I recommend this book to any avid Robin Cook fan."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I just finished Robin Cook's Fatal Cure first published in 1993. Health care reform was a huge topic then, and surprise it is, or will be a big topic in the upcoming presdential election in 2008. The plot and characters are not developed well but the read is easy and engaging. As a physician myself, I can relate to the excitement and uncertainty of finally finishing your training to start your career, but with the economic burden of debt. Now as a practicing physician, I am acutely aware of how the economics of medicine do not necessarily mix with good patient care. Dr. Cook's thoughts on the subject are well presented in the last few pages of the novel. An old novel with a timely message."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"This book was basically well written, and was very pratical.

As is standard, Cook takes a development in health care that is disturbing and expands it into fantastic proportions. In this case, the disturbing element is the increased emphasis on cost at the expense of patients' health--all courtesy of HMO's.&quot;Fatal Cure&quot; tells the story of two young doctors (Angela and David Wilson) who move to an idyllic Vermont town when they are able to land jobs, one at a hospital and another working for the only HMO in the area. David's patients begin dying at an alarming rate, and the deaths defy diagnosis. At the same time, they turn up the body of a doctor in their basement. The dead man had disappeared relatively recently, and the Wilsons (Angela, especially, as she becomes obsessed with the matter) seek to unravel the mystery surrounding his death. Their efforts, however, do not please the town, which responds with threats, vandalism, and hostility. And as if these two problems are not enough, there's the rapist who has been claiming victims in the hospital's parking lots.The story is thoroughly transparent, and while the precise identity of the culprit might not be obvious, the reasons behind and causes of the patients' mysterious deaths should not be any surprise (and shouldn't have been a surprise to the Wilsons). The lack of surprise is due largely to the transparency of Cook's political message. The characters' motivations do not seem to be entirely consistent with reality, especially as the two young doctors repeatedly endanger their daughter's life by taking her into high-risk situations. Angela, for example, takes the girl with her when she goes in search of her missing husband rather than leaving the child with her grandparents. That factor, more than the political intrusion, is especially disturbing. Cook does know how to string together dramatic events, but the characters are too dull to figure out what is obvious, and the writing is rather poor. For Cook's fans, though, none of these problems will come as a surprise or present any difficulties. For people in search of realism or intelligent and multi-dimensional characters, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I enjoyed reading the book because it did have a good idea behind it. What bothered me, though, was how unrealistic the main characters' responses were to what happened to them. What got me the most was when the two characters that the family and the little girl were supposedly so close to died, they didn't even contact their families or attend their funerals! PLEASE! At least mention it in the book for 5 seconds so that we know that you have at least a slight grasp of what would really happen! No wonder everyone in Barlet hated them!!"},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"Robin Cook is just one of those authors that you just love to read when you want to be slightly amused. This book gets you going and revives that fear of hospitals and doctors. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The child comes off as being the smartest and most intelligent of the family. No more Robin Cook for me."},{"Title":"Fatal Cure","review":"I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review. This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel. This guy went to Harvard? It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker. The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid. It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on? Maybe they went to Harvard, too). Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than &quot;making love.&quot; We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words. Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters. Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, perhaps). This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel."},{"Title":"Great rulers of the African past (Zenith books)","review":"We African Americans often say, \\"We came from kings and queens.\\" Here's a book that attempts to attest to that. Because these kings lived centuries ago, a summary of their lives and reigns is not dated. However, this book clearly comes from the time when interest in Africa was big among African Americans in the 1960s. This book has pictures in two colors; it's not as dull as black-and-white, but not as vibrant as colorful books. This is not for little children; it is more for youngsters from ages 9 to 12. This is a great book for book reports or class speeches during Black History Month. I appreciate the diversity of the kings, but I thought African queens, or women passing as kings, and rulers from Southern Africa (like Shaka Zulu) could have been covered."},{"Title":"After He's Gone - A Guide for Widowed & Divorced Women","review":"This is an amazing book which addresses issues you are either facing or may be facing in the future.

The play is both a tour de force and profoundly searching. It is perhaps the first major feminist play in England, with the Duchess presented as an outstandingly noble even if fallible character, the victim of her two evil \\"partriarchal\\" brothers. Of these, her twin brother Ferdinand is among the most intelligently conceived characters to appear on the Jacobean stage. Unknowingly (i.e. in his \\"unconscious\\") he is incestuously in love with his sister. Unable to cope with this \\"taboo\\" feeling, he tries to \\"repress\\" it unsuccessfully, and finally his ... \\"libido\\" comes to express itself in a violent wish to destroy her if he cannot ... own her, and he ends up believing himself to be a wolf, attempting to dig up her grave after he has had her killed. Obviously, then, this is a very Freudian work - anticipating Freud's insights brilliantly by some four centuries, and without lapsing into Freud's extravagantly improbable claims about such matters as the Oedipus complex. It is the working of the unconcious, as a reservoir of what we do not understand and cannot control, which is quite central in this play, and Ferdinand's ... confusion is potently contrasted with his sister's openminded, acknowledged and generous ... health. An outstanding play, recommended as among the best of its time (comparable in quality and interest to e.g. *Othello* or *The Changeling*). - Joost Daalder, Professor of English, Flinders University, South Australia"},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"John Webster's play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; is a violent play that presents a dark, disturbing portrait of the human condition. According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first presented in 1613 or 1614.The title character is a widow with two brothers: Ferdinand and the Cardinal. In the play's opening act, the brothers try to persuade their sister not to seek a new husband. Her resistance to their wishes sets in motion a chain of secrecy, plotting, and violence.The relationship between Ferdinand and the Duchess is probably one of the most unsettling brother-sister relationships in literature. The play is full of both onstage killings and great lines. The title character is one of stage history's intriguing female characters; she is a woman whose desires lead her to defy familial pressure. Another fascinating and complex character is Bosola, who early in the play is enlisted to act as a spy. Overall, a compelling and well-written tragedy."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"I do not feel Webster's &quot;Duchess of Malfi&quot; quite matches his &quot;The White Devil.&quot; Nevertheless, it is still an excellent play. Only Webster could combine this much violence and beauty so well! Webster starts the play well when Antonio and Delio make comments on questionable characters. (Bosola and the Cardinal) Bosola is drawn well as the hired hand reluctant to join the demonic Ferdinand. 2.5 is captivating when Ferdinand explodes with fury upon discovering that the Duchess has married. The cardinal shows an interesting foil to Ferdinand when he tries to encourage caution. The fury exchanged between Ferdinand and the Duchess in 3.2 is memorable. Bosola offers a striking passage on politicians in 3.2. The tragic ceremony in 3.4 is sorrowful and yet beautiful. The parting of Antonio and the Duchess in 3.5 is very lamentable. 4.1 allows us to see that Ferdinand is not only evil, but demented as well. This paves the way for his final insanity. Bosola's hesitation to carry out the murder is well constructed. Ferdinand's final torture of the Duchess reminds us that he is not simply cruel, but psychotic as well. The Duchess is memorable when she faces her death with dignity. Webster DOES NOT stop here! Ferdinand actually taunts the hired killer and this paves the way for the final act. 5.3 is a scene that not even Marlowe or Shakespeare ever used. Fragments of Antonio's own echo foreshadow his death. Bosola's accidental murder of Antonio and his remorse pave the way for the final massacre! Even here, Webster keeps his efforts up. The cardinal's passage on fear of damnation keeps us in chills. Bosola's death and passage of remorse is a fitting end for this excellent work. My only complaint about this play is that the Cardinal could have been more complex."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"It quite simply isn't allowed! John Webster has written a play that takes all of the conventions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean tragedy, and then promptly dispenses with them. For this reason alone, it is worth reading The Duchess of Malfi - simply to see a warped formula that works exceptionally well.The play is slightly marred by Webster's wooden stage craft, but thankfully the originality of the story compensates for some stilted dialogue and awkward devices. For its time, Malfi was a sensational play - truly gruesome and bloody, with its special effects making it a Jacobean Hollywood Blockbuster.The characters are perhaps the greatest success of this play. Webster's Ferdinand is vile, his Duchess is fiesty, yet at times she commits acts that condemn her to not being dubbed a &quot;heroine&quot;, such as her fake pilgrimage. Antonio, the principle male &quot;good guy&quot; is so outrageously stupid that one has to hate him for being wetter than a Thomas Hardy novel. In fact, the microcosm of the play is almost without virtue, save for Pescara (an interesting play on 'piscari' - the Latin for fish, the Christian symbol). Finally, the play pivots on the role of Bosola, who is neither anti-hero, villain, hero or anything else for that matter. He is a fabulous and intelligent malcontent: the Macciavel personified.Ultimately, if you are bored of reading the same formula within a tragedy, pick up the Duchess of Malfi and blow off the dust from the front cover. It is an often overlooked play, though its author has written a piece of theatre that is so strange and so difficult to perform that it is still largely snubbed by theatre companies today. By destroying the conventions of the tragedy to the extent that the end result arguably isn't a tragic play at all, Webster has written a play that is as important to the development of the modern tragedy as those which rigidly stick to the formulae."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"In using this edition to teach a college course, I found that the editorial notes were vastly inadequate, and I ended up having to make a supplementary glossary for students. For that reason, I don't recommend the New Mermaids edition."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"John Webster will probably never be as popular as William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, or even Cliff Marlowe. Nevertheless, his writing is quite impressive. His plays came out about the time Shakespeare was putting out his final plays. As the play begins, we meet Bosola. While he is a murderer, he offers several intersting passages, and he is not quite a 2d villain. Bosola expresses his dislike for Duke Ferdinand and his brother the Cardinal. This opinion is shared by the Duchess's eventual husband Antonio. This allows Webster to prepare the villains of this story. The wicked Ferdinand expresses his wish for his sister (the Duchess) not to marry. Eventually, we will learn that he wants control over her estates. (How unheard of! Especially today!) He asks Bosola to spy on the Duchess. Bosola is a bit hesitant, but he proceeds. Well, the Duchess against her wicked brother's request marries Antonio secretly. Some time passes, and Bosola suspects that the Duchess is pregnant. While Antonio suspects the foul play of Bosola, he is basically a loving, but not so able man. Ferdinand of course finds out that his request has been disregarded. Interestingly, the cardinal comes off a little better when his cautious side contrasts with Ferdinand's rages. Onto Act 3. The Duchess and Antonio now have children. While Ferdinand knows the Duchess has married, he does NOT know Antonio is the husband. The poor Duchess makes the mistake of appealing to Bosola for help, and of course all is found out. Antonio is banished to Ancona. The parting between Antonio and the Duchess is quite sad. But all is not lost. Antonio flees to Milan and they may still be together. Sadly, hope disappears as the Duchess is arrested. Ferdinand orders Bosola to murder her, and while Bosola does hesitate, he performs the cruel murder of the Duchess. It is interesting that Bosola's evil deeds are often accompanied by hesitation and regret, as well as some interesting passages on the harsh truths of the human condition. But Webster does not stop here. Ferdinand's cruelty gives way to insanity and he taunts Bosola for carrying out his orders. Onto the final act. Poor Antonio (not knowing his wife is dead) has heard of Ferdinand's insanity. He thinks perhaps he can reconcile with the Cardinal. Soon we see that the cardinal is not quite an accomplished psychopath. With Ferdinand gone, he sinks further and further into panic trying to cover the bloody mess. In a well done scene, fragments of Antonio's echo foreshadow his downfall. Bosola accidentally kills Antonio and is filled with regret. The final scene begins with the cardinal giving a passage on fear of damnation. In a brutal massacre, Bosola, Ferdinand, and the Cardinal all die. The play ends with a restoration to order by the son of Antonio and the Duchess, but like Shakespeare's \\"King Lear,\\" it doesn't take away the sadness of the play. Overall, it's a good play that combines an interesting variety of villains, romance, tragedy, suspense, horror, and dark comedy."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Malfi","review":"I'm doing this Elizabethan play for my Literature course now, and I found it difficult to grasp at first, but it got easier as I delved further into the plot. Having prior experience with Shakespearan texts would surely make reading this play an easier ride though. The central concerns are timeless: forbidden love, societal and patriachal forces versus the courageous individual, twisted fate - The Duchess of Malfi falls in love and marries her stewart, Antonio, and is thus persecuted by her two brothers, the Cardinal and Ferdinand, with the help of the ambiguous Bosola, the prototype malcontent. What stands out in this play is its twisted violence and surprising plot manuveres, but these only serve to bring out in a unique manner the ultimate message of the play - the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"The conquerors;: A narrative, (His The winning of America)","review":"Like Eckerts other books this is an accurate portrail of American History.

As a previous reviewer stated, the exercises really work. Therefore, I must warn any casual dabblers out there - this is not a game!

I like his approach to simplifying everyday kabbalistic practice so that anyone can touch upon the Sephiroth without getting bogged down in confusing jargon and concepts.There were two gripes I have though with this book: First, he becomes very repetitive with explaining why it is important to access other levels of consciousness - it would be more effective to state your case once (maybe with a restatement later on) and devote the rest of the manual to more practical exercises so the student can discover for themself how important it is (Mr. Andrews seems to be adamantly trying to convince the reader); and secondly, I disagree with the use of Jehovah in place of the traditional and more accurate YHVH with each letter pronounced separately. I understand that each individual must find what works for them (as he presents in his book) but giving out just that one option I thought was too limiting.I had occasion to ask Mr. Andrews about this at an Animal-Speak workshop I attended many years ago as he was signing my books. He replied that it was \\"personal preference\\". That's all well and good, but I strongly believe that the original and linguistically accurate version should have been presented as well given that many who use this book will be beginners and may not know of the alternative.All in all, a nice little introduction to a watered-down Kabala - this is the first of a two volume-series he has written on the topic."},{"Title":"Simplified Magic: A Beginner's Guide to the New Age Quabala (Llewellyn's new age series)","review":"I still have this nook for my own.

Overall it is a well-balanced and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Boxing Day: The Fight That Changed the World","review":"While Jeff Wells does an excellent job capturing the tenor of the times he does Tommy Burns a grave disservice in treating him as the bad guy of his story, and Johnson the great hero. Burns could have done what previous holders of the heavyweight championship had done, and flatly refused to give Johnson a shot at the title. But, unlike the others, he allowed Johnson, a black man, his big chance. It was Johnson who turned his back on his race and denied similar opportunities to Sam Langford, Joe Jeannette, and Sam McVea. Jack Johnson was a talented fighter, but not much of a human being."},{"Title":"Boxing Day: The Fight That Changed the World","review":"A couple of weeks ago I was invited over to Lyle's house for dinner for some weird Canadian holiday called \\"Boxing-Day\\". When Lyle first called me and asked if I wanted to come over I was a little hesitant to make myself public again because I might have to talk about the Jack-Russell-Terrier. After listening to that Dog-Rat bark over and over, I decided it was in my best interest to go over to Lyle's and regain some of my sanity that the Jack-Russell-Terrier has been stripping away from me since it's un-holy insulting arrival to MY house. I called Lyle back and told him I'd be there ONLY if no-one would mention the Jack-Russell-Terrier or Morris (unless of course they had found him).After I hung up the phone with Lyle, I realized that I did-not know anything about this Canadian-custom of Boxing-Day. Since both mom and Dad were home I was unable to go on Dad's \\"golden\\" computer and research it, so I had to research it in my head and on Home-Box-Office's-boxing-show. As I watched two guys in a ring punch each-other merciless for a while, Dad walked in and started talking at me about something or another, so I just went up to my room and closed the door. Doesn't he know I don't want to speak with him due to his treachery against Morris?As I sat in my room I wrote down the things I noticed about watching the boxing show:Boxing GlovesRobeShortsAngry-FacesDue to my time limit I was forced to prepare my outfit for the Boxing-Day celebration quickly. I snuck into Mom's room and grabbed a robe that closely resembled what the gladiators wore to the ring. There was a problem though. I noticed some loop in it that said some-thing about some-one named Victoria, I ripped at it until it came off, tearing a hole in the robe in the proccess. I was upset with the robe at first, but I figured that the hole probably made it look like I've used it before in other Boxing-Day celebrations. I wanted to fit in.Now with that taken care of I ran to the basement to get my boxing-gloves that I use on my Sock'em-Bop-Buddy inflatable punching-man. I wanted to make sure I still had some of my old moves, so I punched at it for a while (mental note: tape picture of the Jack-Russell-Terrier to it when I'm done with this review). I snuck past Mom and Dad to return to my room to grab a pair of addias-soccer-shorts. I'm pretty sure Lyle and his family won't mind, due to me being American and all, and not having a real pair of boxer-shorts. I put the outfit on. I looked pretty good for a First-Time-Boxing-Day-Rocky. I looked over my list again, and noticed I still needed the angry-face to complete the out-fit. I stared at my mirror until it was time to go, practicing my angry-face. MAN did I make some angry-faces! You should have seen them! Watch this, I'm gonna make one now! GRRRRRRRRRRR! AAArrrrrrrrRRR! Oh man, you guys should see this! ARARARARRRRR! Now THAT was a good one! Okay, here I go watch---Oh yeah, the review. Anyways, I threw my coat over the out-fit so Mom and Dad wouldn't want to take my picture, or some other weird parent thing.When I arrived at Lyle's, (oh yeah, for my fans knowledge, it's really hard to drive with Boxing-Gloves on), any-who, back on track. When I arrived at Lyle's I walked in and threw off my coat to show them my Boxing-Day out-fit. I thought they would be really impressed with my respect for their culture. They sat there wide-eyed for a moment, so I thought I would further impress them and I threw out some jabs and a hay-maker style air-punch. Lyle's father and brother started to laugh, Lyle's mom told Lyle to get me some \\"proper-attire\\". I followed Lyle to his room confused, I spent all that time on this out-fit to impress them and I got laughed at. Maybe I was too pre-mature, and we would switch after dinner.Lyle gave me some clothes to put on, and informed me that it wasn't that type of Boxing... He did note he was pleased with my enthusiasm though. We walked down to the dinner-table and Lyle's Dad called me Sugar-Ray for some reason. What the HECK!? Is that how Canadians do Boxing? With verbal-punches? I thought I'd join in and made a comment on his HUGE bald spot. Lyle and Lyle's Mom and Brother laughed. I said \\"how'd you like that verbal upper-cut?\\". Then I layed into him with some verbal jabs about his chronic-alcoholism. Lyle's Mom quickly interjected by lecturing me about how Boxing-Day did not have aaaannnyyy-thing to do with Boxing, physical or verbal. She then went on with some snore about church donations and this-and-that. What I thought was a great idea for a holiday, just pulled a one-eighty. For some reason though, Lyle's dad continued to call me Sugar-Ray for the rest of the evening. What the HECK kind of thing is that to call a GUEST in your house!? What's next, Honey-Bottom? Candy-Striper? Cinderella-Man!? He was probably just drunk.In Conclusion, I blame the turn-out of this evening on my own Dad. Since he doesn't allow me on the computer all that much, it didn't allow me the time to do the proper research. I might have to invest in a book on Canadian customs so this won't happen again. They have this Thanks-Giving prequel type thing that I don't want to get embarrassed about either. Pfffft. Those Canadians LOL! Whatever, leave me alone. My dog ran away and you should stop reading this and go help me find him you lazy Americans.

Tozer but lambaste the Christian mystics he so highly regarded? Have you ever tried to practice what Mr. Tozer preached and found yourself at odds with fellow evangelicals? If so, this book is for you.It is a collection of essays. In one, entitled \\"Revelation is Not Enough,\\" Mr. Tozer describes a battle over truth between evangelical rationalists and evangelical mystics. The rationalists believe that divine truth is reducible to mere words and creeds. If you hold the right opinion on the stated propositions, then you have the truth. If you can recite the creed, you have the truth. The rationalists search the scriptures, thinking that in them they have eternal life, but they will not eat the flesh or drink the blood of Him whom the scriptures bear witness. Mr. Tozer likens them to the pharisees, and notes the pharisees were the Lord's worst enemies. Hard words, but there is much at stake. This rationalism will kill off the truth, Mr. Tozer says, as surely but more subtly as a liberalism that denies the divine source of scripture.Who is on the other side of this battle? Who are the evangelical mystics? They are the ones who believe, as Mr. Tozer did, that saints of old, such as Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross, can instruct today's evangelicals on how to worship God in spirit and in truth. Whose hearts resonate with the words of Bernard of Clairvaux:\\"We taste Thee, O Thou Living Breadand long to feast upon Thee stillWe drink of Thee the Fountain Headand thirst our souls from Thee to fill\\""},{"Title":"Faith Beyond Reason","review":"In typical Tozer fashion, he cuts to the heart of every issue with Spirit-guided precision! Tozer tells the truth boldly, plainly, and unerringly on target. This little book is a treasury of spiritual insights like:&quot;Faith never goes contrary to reason; faith simply ignores reason and rises above it.&quot;or&quot;I have been memorizing the Scriptures ever since I was converted, but my faith does not rest on God's promises. My faith rests upon God's character.&quot;or, talking about the importance of emptying oneself:&quot;The less there is in the kettle, the quicker it begins to boil.&quot;I love Tozer's straight-forwardness and his plain talk about complex matters. He takes the abstract and makes it concrete.Tozer writes, &quot;It is not enough that I hold an inspired book in my hands. I must have an inspired heart.&quot;Thanks, Lord, for sending Tozer to us and for giving him such an inspired heart."},{"Title":"Faith Beyond Reason","review":"Tozer never belabors or sugarcoats what needs to be said to the body of Christ and his perception and clarity reveal scriptures and inspire the heart.

Like the author, I have a passion for sports broadcast history and have extensive data on the subject myself; to my pleasant suprise, I did not find a single factual inaccuracy in the entire book! The broadcast histories are the most comprehensive I've ever seen; moreover, the author brings to life the voices of ny sports with highly readable biographies and critiques; in terms of detail, this book goes far beyond anything ever published; anyone whose husband, father or grandfather grew up listening to the Stanley Cup champion Rangers (either the 1940 or 1994 version), Warm Up Time and Sports Extra, the Yankees, Dodgers and Giants, the Knicks (or even the New Jersey Americans, Brooklyn Tigers, the Golden Blades or the weekly fights at St Nick's Arena) should order this book and gift wrap it immediately; had I not already given this gift to myself, it would be the most appreciated gift I could imagine!"},{"Title":"Sports on New York Radio","review":"David Halberstam has compiled an exceptionally well written history of sports broadcasting in the Big Apple.

Anyone would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Sports on New York Radio","review":"If ever one of my book reviews deserved five stars this is it in spades. David Halberstam, a great author on numerous subjects, has provided us with a comprehensive history of the great names that have graced the radio sports scene in New York. The book is filled with anecdotes that reveal the personalities of such greats as Graham McNamee, Ted Husing, Red Barber, Mel Allen, Don Dunphy, Phil Rizzuto, Marv Albert, Marty Glickman, Clem McCarthy, Russ Hodges, Jim Woods, Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy, and numerous others. Anyone who ever reported sports on radio in New York is in here. Separate chapters are devoted to boxing, hockey, college and pro football, basketball, the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants, the New York Yankees, the New York Mets, talk radio, and his personal experience of a mistake he, himself, made while doing a game for the Miami Heat basketball team. The book concludes with a final section on references that cover most anything you may want to know on this subject. Halberstan says that baseball voices are not paid for how they describe a play, but how they handle airtime between plays. We are treated to a number of Vin Scully phrases such as when the Brewers and Cardinals, both sponsored by beer companies, played in the 1982 World Series. Scully said, &quot;There will be no bad hops in this Series.&quot; An interesting tidbit is that Connie Desmond and Al Helfer are the only individuals that have covered the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants. An interesting, but puzzling, story is told when Halberstam asked the general manager of a radio station in Talahassee, Florida, to arrange for him to spend a half hour with Red Barber. Barber was cordial, but could be cold with visitors. The author said he had so much to ask him. Just as he was warming up, Barber politely got up off his chair, shook the author's hand, and thanked him for coming. Thirty minutes were up, and it was time to go. If you enjoy the giants of the sports airwaves this book is a must for your reading, and deserves a prominent place in anyone's sports library."},{"Title":"Sports on New York Radio","review":"David J. Halberstam (not to be confused with the more well-known David Halberstam) has written one of the best reference books ever on sports broadcasting, focusing on the history of radio play by play in New York City from its inception in the 20s to the present. Baseball, Football, Basketball, Hockey etc. are all given equal treatment in their own chapters, and while this can lead to occasionally repetitive information, that in no way detracts from the opportunity to enjoy this work. Only Curt Smith's &quot;Voices Of The Game&quot; has ever done anything similar to what Halberstam has done in this instance. I was glad to see Halberstam correct the injustice Smith's book did to the late Frank Messer by giving him due credit for his 18 years of outstanding work on the Yankees broadcast team (but I have to dissent from Halberstam's negative view of current Yankees voice John Sterling and think its not fair to cite one disgruntled anonymous letter to the Post as a bellwether of how Yankee fans feel about his work), and other voices of New York sports like Mel Allen, Red Barber, Marty Glickman, Marv Albert, Jim Gordon etc. also receive attention for their fine work over the years with various teams. Along the way you'll learn all kinds of fascinating trivia you never would have expected. Did you know Monty Hall of &quot;Let's Make A Deal&quot; spent a season as a Rangers color analyst in 1960? Or that the Mets were on one of the weakest stations in NY during their amazing run in 69? That's just the tip of some of the fascinating material you'll learn in this book.

As the sharp polarization in Customer Reviews attests, you will either love or hate this slender volume. Where you fall on this spectrum will very much depend on your own preconceived notions regarding the natures of God and Man, and the relationship between the two. The religiously orthodox - of whatever persuasion - will have a tough, tough time with this book. Wilmhurst himself makes it abundantly clear that his target audience is probably quite small and makes no attempt to persuade the incredulous.The main thrust of Wilmhurst's argument is that Freemasonry is, if not a direct linear descendant, at least a modern (i.e., post 16th century) revival of the ancient Orders of Initiation, also known as the Mystery Schools. Interpreted in this light, the Craft is neither a social club nor a philanthropic organization but, rather, a path to personal spiritual enlightenment. Though he doesn't specifically draw the parallel, Wilmhurst's understanding of Masonry is, in many respects, reminiscent of the ancient Chinese concept of Tao (the Way).In Wilmhurst's view, the modern Masonic rituals that new members are routinely ushered through in the course of a few months (or, worse still, during the infamous \\"One Day Class\\") are but a dim recollection of the arduous, but necessary, trials undertaken by those determined to achieve a richer, fuller understanding of life, the universe, and everything. Think \\"Mysteries-Lite\\".However, many in 20th (and now, 21st) century Europe and America are openly embarrassed by people and institutions that speak of the Infinite, the Eternal or the True (except in the most banal or hypothetical terms), and, for these folks, even the faint echoes of awe that remain in Masonic ritual are too much. Hence, the Craft's current inordinate emphasis upon philanthropy and good fellowship at the expense of spirituality. In nearly all jurisdictions, Mystic principles and practices are simply glossed over, if addressed at all.Today, many Masons advance through the three degrees in utter ignorance of the rituals' true significance as a transformative experience. As a consequence, many are admitted to the fraternity who are spiritually unprepared and those who are prepared are, more often than not, shortchanged. Wilmhurst's book is a call for Masons to reclaim their Mystic heritage.To those who have made the Royal Art their life's work, Wilmhurst's arguments are self-evident, and become all the more so with each reading. Although it is a short work (only 224 pages) it will provide you with enough material to contemplate for many years to come.The book is, however, not without its shortcomings.First, Wilmhurst is most definitely a man of his Time and Place. It is imperative to keep in mind that this book was first published in 1922 and that most of the material was penned well before that. Wilmhurst's text is written in the upper class dialect of \\"British\\" English spoken in the Edwardian Era. Modern American readers will find themselves frequently reaching for the dictionary to decipher unfamiliar spellings and arcane usages.Second, Wilmhurst assumes that the reader has more than a passing familiarity with the ancient Mystery Schools of both the Eastern and Western traditions. It is not necessary that you become an expert in these subjects, but a working knowledge of the major schools and players will aid you tremendously in understanding where Wilmhurst is coming from and what he is proposing.Third, there is little here for the non-Mason. With the few exceptional passages in which he discusses those bits of ritual work peculiar to \\"British\\" Masonry, any Mason who has paid even minimal attention during the degree rituals will instantly recognize what Wilmhurst alludes to. However, the non-Mason is largely out of luck. On the upside, if there is little in this book for the non-Mason, there is still less for the New World Order/Illuminati/Bilderbergers/Council on Foreign Relations/Anti-Christ/UFOs/Black Helicopters conspiracy theorist.Dogmatic Christians may be put off by Wilmhurst's interpretation of Christianity-as-Mystery-School. Non-Christians won't care much for his unquestioned acceptance of Christ as the Word Incarnate.This book is not an easy read and it is definitely not for everyone. But, for the Freemason of a questioning nature, \\"The Meaning of Masonry\\" is the Mother Lode - perhaps the most lucid exposition on the subject in print today."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"People are always saying that masons don't believe in God &amp; Christ ... that it is a Pagan Group. This Book shows &amp; tells how the masonic order &amp; Christianty feed off each other. The search for &quot;light&quot; in masonry is nothing but the search for light in Christianty. He shows how the two are simular as in when Hiram Abiff died between two thieves as they beat him and afterwards the Temple he started was finished ... Christ died between two thieves &amp; afterwards his Temple (or church) was finished. Also that the ritual of the 3rd degree is a reference to death &amp; rebirth, just as christ died &amp; was reborn. He makes many references like this. I always knew there had to be more to masonry than just a few stories/parables ... Mr. Wilmshurst being worried of what Masonry was turning into ( a social club), wrote this book for those of us who want to know the truth &amp; not just to read another flashy opinion/interpation someone has. Most Masons can't tell you what Masonry really is! This is a book you will keep &amp; read over and over and over. Did you know that the apron of an EA with it's 5 points represents the 5 wounds of Christ &amp; the 5 points of fellowship? ... PLUS some other really interesting stuff.

Here it is: everything you ever wanted to know about Masonry, but were afraid to ask.... Or, wanted to ask--but, couldn't get anyone to talk about it. This is the book you have been Searching for &amp; the book that will revitalize The Craft. Wilmshurst tells it like it is, after giving many Lectures amongst Masons of the world. He offers us some Gold, instead-of a Treasure Map. If all the other Masonic books left you feeling unsatiated and thirsty for more Knowledge, this book will quench your thirst and provide ample revitalization in the future. Wilmshurst believes a man should enter The Craft with no blinders or misgivings about his Work. He believes in offering the Truths he has discovered to all those seeking The Light. Anyone contemplating the idea of petitioning The Lodge should read this book...and, everyone within The Lodge should give Wilmshurst's message a respectful perusal during a quiet afternoon."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"Wilmshurst writes far more than a thought provoking book on the subject of Masonry. This is a road map for our, the Masons, journey home. This book however, is not for the average Mason and it is not for the non-Mason at all. (The non-Mason would find it incomprehensible.) But, for any Mason who experiences that inner call, this book will provide welcome insight, and will let you know that you're on the right path.

I read it before I became a Master Mason and just didn't \\"get it.\\" Now I understand what Wilmshurst is saying, and am deeply moved by it.If you are a Christian, a Master Mason, and have any theological background whatsoever, this title is a must-read.

For those masons who prefer not to see the Craft in such a way, this book can be startling, but for those who are truly &quot;speculative&quot; it provides a sane and informed perspective. If you view Masonry simply as an ethical dining club, this is not for you! Otherwise, an important classic of its type."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"One of the most coherent, spiritual discourses of Freemasonry available to the modern reader. This text is the emotional compliment to W. K. MacNulty's intellectual text &quot;Freemasonry A Journey...&quot;.This is a timeless text for Freemasons and non-Masons alike. It is the most influential book on my shelf, no trivial statement given that I am a long-time collector and dealer in antiquarian texts.Too many Masons, and non-Masons for that matter, step through the rituals of their life and accept the symbols of their world without consciously reflecting on their purpose. This is not wrong by itself - the intent of Freemasonry is self-discovery by fraternity with other motivated good men.But Wilmshurst reminds us that conscious reflection means we discover and improve our physical selves faster. When we learn from mistakes, we avoid making them again. When we learn to pace ourselves, we make the world better for those around us. As men what we most owe to our families is a better man. In short God has charged us to rise to Him and Freemasonry can help us serve Him. If we choose to see.I recommend taking this book down at least once a month to read a random chapter. Remember our charge: learn to subdue our passions, learn to be better men."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"Despite the drab editorial review, Wilmshurst's book is an excellent interpretation of Freemasonic philosophy. Unfortunately, it will have little to offer for those who are not Freemasons. Perhaps, sadly, it will also have little to offer to those who ARE Freemasons. With the rise of the so-called &quot;Realistic&quot; school of Freemasonry, the spiritual heritage and import of the Craft has been dilluted and, in some cases, despised. I have written in the past that Freemasonry exists and has exited for one reason, i.e., to provide the phenomenological proof of a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. The &quot;Realistic&quot; school would have us believe that Freemasonry is no more than an agrandized Optomists Club. Wilmshurst provides a clear insight into WHY the Craft has endured and why many thoughtful men have been drawn to its door."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"This book contains a deeper view of masonry than what we are given in lodge. Wilmshurst takes into his own hands, expanding the bare bones of lecture and lets it 'flower' in our conciousness. This is not the best book written, he is sometimes dry, BUT it is very informative and offers new ideas. Not only are the contents rich at times, but his delivery is very rich at times. His writing style is unique, and makes me feel like he is holding in front of me a grand but disguised treasure.... (one of those 'hmmm, hmm, AH-HA!' books)"},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"This is a classic book on mystical Freemasonry. Wilmshurst's writing was good in his day but is a hard read nowadays, be nests his clauses ten deep at times. Nevertheless it is well worth studying. It explains how Freemasonry is more than a dinning club and charitable organisation, this shows how it is a spiritual pathway to self improvment.If you are a Mason it is worth reading to understand the deeper secrets of the Craft. If you are a non-Mason and just iunterested this will explain what attracts so many people to FreemasonryThe only drawback is the old fashioned writing style.

The book suffers from repetitiveness (I surmise it to have been a collection of previously-delivered lectures and speeches) and 19th Century grandiloquence, but nonetheless proves to be a worthwhile addition to most Mason's libraries.Just make sure you donate your copy to a local library when you are finished with it, so that students and scholars may form their own opinions; it might be shelved with Freud and Jung instead of Nathan Bedford Forrest.Remember also, Bro Benjamin Franklin's acute summation of \\"The Mysteries\\": \\"the big secret is that there IS no secret\\"."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"Most enlightening I did not know just how deep this secret organisation feed into most parts of UK and USA politics' very worrying stuff!ThanksSteve"},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"I am an active Freemason and reguarly read as much on the subject as I can.

I have no problem with it. I would, just as quickly, take up a similar discussion of the Craft from a Judaic or Islamic (or even Buddhist or Hindu) point of view, because one cannot fully understand a concept until one looks at it from many different angles.&quot;The Meaning of Masonry&quot; is just but a small footstep into a larger world.

Wilmhurst assumes that the reader already has some background in Masonry, so I don't recommend this as a first-read to anyone just beginning to learn about either Masonry or the Mysteries. However, for any serious student of the occult, mysticism, magick, Witchcraft, Masonry or the Mystery traditions, this book is an excellent find. All of the bits and pieces of information I've picked up over the years concerning Masonry make a great deal more sense now.Concerning Wilmhurst's writing style: on a few occasions I had to go back and re-read a passage to catch the meaning, but didn't find the author's language problematic, as some reviewers have complained. However, this book is adapted from a series of lectures, so I will forewarn that it can be repetitive. Overall, I found that the content of the author's material far outweighed the somewhat unfamiliar writing style."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"One of the best books on Fremasonry anywhere! This is the book that removes the scales from the Freemason's eyes with surgical precision. The author is really concerned about the reader as a Freemason, not just as a member of the fraternity. So often it is that members of the fraternity are not Freemasons; they are just members. Make no mistake here, Wilmshurst is writing to the Freemasons.This book reveals the symbols behind the symbols; the screts behind the secrets; the Freemasons behind the Masons (You'll need to think about that one. And don't ask me because I won't tell).This is a book about Freemasonry not targeting everybody involved with Freemasonry. Written nearly a century ago, it appeals only to a select minority within Freemasonry's ranks (which is shameful). You would think others would have got the message long ago. But unfortunately for the world, that just ain't so. Members will read this book and walk away with nothing--they enjoy that. Members are afraid to look behind Freemasonry's myriad veils, anyway, most are comfortable with a surface knowledge and a shallow understanding. But Freemasons will read this book and never walk away from it. To be sure, this is what going down the rabbit hole is all about; this is the red pill. This is the stuff \\"they\\" don't tell you in the lodge.This book is not easy reading. But if you're accustomed to this reading genre, you won't find the Edwardian English in the book too archaic to keep up with. And even if you never read this genre, but you are a Freemason and not just a member of the fraternity, you will find your way around the archaic expressions with little difficulty. Language, notwithstanding, the message here is so potent and timeless, it makes no difference.The author eloquently emphasizes throughout the book that Freemasonry's ancient message, is its true message (which is spiritual), and therefore cannot be received from its concrete, surface symbolism, but rather from the timeless principles which emanate from within the allegories, rituals, and spiritual interpretation of the symbols.After reading The Meaning of Masonry, Freemasons are sure to see a light they never saw in the lodge."},{"Title":"Meaning of Masonry","review":"As stated on page 47, &quot;The very essence of the Masonic doctrine is that all men in this world are in search of something in their own nature which they have lost, but that with proper instruction and by their own patience and industry they may hope to find.&quot; Ironically, this was my intent behind buying this book.

He explains to us that \\"The most fundamental phenomenon in the universe is relationship.\\" This in itself can be perplexing to many a reader, especialy those who have learned to see the world existing as separate objects which appear to him to compete with eachother. Salk tells us that there are no independant objects, instead \\"We must consider al events in terms of process.\\" This process leads to integration and that in turn leads to wholeness. However the wholeness has properties that the constituent parts do not have. Salk goes further than, say, General Systems Theory, which has the same fundamental claims, in that he ascribes a fundamental importance to the binary process, revealing to us that all processes are a binary process integrated by relationships between the elements. This suggests that there is a fundamental process of existence, and if realized will constitute a principle or framework similar to the scientific theory of everything, but different in that Salks approach is not a particularized perspective."},{"Title":"Anatomy of Reality: Merging of Intuition and Reason (Convergence)","review":"The author doesn't really discuss the topic as &quot;advertised&quot; by his book's title &amp; its subtitle.

Instead he writes about evolution particularly that of the biosphere -- which is a nice discussion. He &quot;dances&quot; around merging intuition &amp; reason, I guess because he has very foggy notions on how to do it. So he just dangles the topic in front of his readers. I concur wholeheartedly with Salk that morals &amp; ethics is strictly &amp; purely a human creation, that they have no basis in supernatural &quot;things&quot; or mental creations. It's just us humans down here, trying to live from day to day hopefully with some measure of meaningfulness. At least the book is very short. If Salk's book were a long one, I'm sure it would have been unbearably tedious &amp; pedantic.

He mentioned that he reconstructed the last few months of FDR's actual life to see how an assassination attempt might have fit in fictionally. It sounded like the focus of the book was FDR's last days, with an assassination plot woven in. Just the kind of historical fiction I'd be interested in.However, I've read over 60 pages and am giving it up. FDR has barely been mentioned. The dialogue and description have a modern flavor, rather than putting you back in the 1940's. There are none of the details of everyday life one would expect in historical fiction. The guns described in an early chapter almost have more personality than the human characters.It is what it is, probably a good thriller if that's what you're into. But if you heard the same misleading interview I did, you ought to know that's what it is."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"\\"The Assassins Gallery,\\" by David L. Robbins, is a historical thriller set during the early months of 1945. Professor Mikhal Lammeck poses the question: \\"Can a single man change or direct the course of history?\\" during the first session of his class at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Although the professor is fascinated by the whole \\"bloody mess that is human history,\\" his particular field of expertise is the political killer or assassin. Lammeck has begun to write a treatise on assassinations, but, after five years of work, the book remains unfinished. Adding to his already heavy workload, Lammeck spends time in the Scottish highlands instructing clandestine teams of highly trained British operatives who work behind enemy lines. However, all of his activities are put on hold when Lammeck receives an unexpected visit from an old friend, Dag Nabbit.Nabbit is with the American Secret Service, and his job is to protect President Franklin Roosevelt. After two civil defense wardens are killed while patrolling a remote Massachusetts beach, Nabbit and his superiors suspect that a deadly intruder has infiltrated the country to kill FDR. They want Lammeck to lend his expertise in the hunt for this would-be assassin.The author provides some interesting facts about famous assassins in history, and he repeatedly raises questions similar to the one that the professor asked in Scotland: Do people mold history or are they history's unwitting pawns? By killing a head of state, can a single individual accomplish what years of war cannot? Trying to change the direction of world events is an exotic looking woman from Cairo who calls herself Judith. She has been hired to rid the world of FDR, and Robbins follows Judith as she settles into Washington, D. C. and formulates her strategy. Lammeck tries to outthink his wily opponent, but he gradually realizes that he is facing a formidable, dangerous, and tenacious foe.Robbins energizes \\"The Assassins Gallery\\" with lively characters and sharp dialogue. Lammeck, for all of his scholarly interest in political violence, is a thoughtful man with a conscience, for whom killing is theoretical. Judith, on the other hand, is a cold-blooded sociopath who has few qualms about eliminating anyone who stands in her way. The paths of these two very different people will inevitably cross, but who will emerge the victor? The secondary characters are nicely drawn, as well, from a neurotic political wife for whom Judith works as a housekeeper to an elderly neighbor who shrewdly sees through Judith's lies. The author includes thoroughly researched tidbits about FDR's affection for Lucy Rutherford, and the scenes featuring the president, devastated by illness and surrounded by his loved ones, add flavor and poignancy to the story.There are a few predictable elements in this novel, including the obligatory high-speed chase scenes and near-misses that we have come to expect. However, Robbins goes way beyond the obvious, and the suspense builds excruciatingly as Judith edges closer to her goal. \\"The Assassins Gallery\\" provides satisfying entertainment and a refreshingly original conclusion, with several loose ends that are purposely left dangling. Robbins, it seems, agrees with his fictional hero that world events can never be tied up in a neat package."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"As the countdown ends 1944, Judith comes ashore from the freezing water off Newburyport, Massachusetts into a Nor'easter. When a two-person civilian patrol stops her on the beach, Judith tries a bluff, but when that fails she kills them. Judith cannot find her murder weapon, a twelfth century knife belonging to enemies of the Templars during the Crusades. Still the enemy agent knows stealth remains her major weapon so no one must know who came ashore.The murders on the beach upset the Secret Service, who assume a plot against President Roosevelt by unknown assassins. Agent Nabbit obtains the help of his former history professor Mikhal Lammeck, who concludes by the murder weapon used that the killer is a professional who will slay anyone remotely in his or her way. He assumes like Dag that FDR is the target. So he waits patiently in DC for the assassin's arrival, not realizing a female is the cold blooded killer and that she is already on the staff of Roosevelt's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherford, but beyond stopping the assassin Lammeck wonders who hired her.David L. Robbins provides a fascinating historical thriller that uses an electrifying plot to enable the audience to look deeply at 1945 DC. The story line is action-packed so that the thriller crowd will sit on edge throughout, but also includes interesting tidbits. For instance many people by his fourth term thought Roosevelt was a benevolent dictator whose popularity was waning as the war seemed endless, but feared switching administrations (when will we begin hearing the noise to change the twenty-second amendment?). Lammeck is a well-rounded hero struggling to stop an assassination and uncover a conspiracy, but also relaxes by exploring his favorite subject, what is history, which ultimately is the underlying theme of this delightful thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"One might be tempted to dismiss David L. Robbins's latest historical thriller as a rewriting or perhaps a recasting of Frederick Forsyth's classic THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. This should only arise as the result of failing to read THE ASSASSINS GALLERY, an engrossing, riveting work that needs to be judged solely on its own formidable merits.THE ASSASSINS GALLERY is set in the closing months of World War II. Suspicions have arisen that an increasingly ailing Franklin Roosevelt may be the target of an assassination attempt. Mikhal Lammeck, an expert in the history of assassinations and a special ops instructor, is clandestinely recruited by the Secret Service to determine if such a threat exists and, if so, to thwart it. Lammeck, a United States expatriate residing in Scotland, is initially reluctant but soon becomes engrossed in the hunt for the assassin, who by appearances is as unlikely a murderer as Lammeck is a hunter.The killer, whom we come to know as \\"Sarah,\\" is a master of subtle disguise, recruited by an unknown principal to assassinate the most powerful man on earth. Utilizing her looks to pass freely between the black and white community, Sarah is able to slowly but inevitably work her way toward the White House, turning culturally imposed limitations and barriers into strengths while using her own formidable skills to turn Lammeck from the hunter into the hunted.Robbins's dialogue is absolutely first-rate, capturing the nuanced cadence of the early to mid 1940s. He also deftly weaves his way through the crazy quilt patchwork of race relations during the mid-twentieth century. Washington, D.C., where the majority of the novel is based, was officially not segregated, yet people of color were assigned to second-class status. Robbins takes this point of fact and utilizes it as a key element of his work, fashioning it as a camouflage from which his villain of the piece can operate. These and other elements move the book out of the \\"what if?\\" category of fiction into the \\"maybe so\\" area.THE ASSASSINS GALLERY will be of special interest to those who study American history, but any fan of thriller novels or of strong characterization will find much to enjoy here. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"What if FDR didn't die of a brain aneurism but was really assassinated? That is the premise of David L. Robbins' latest historical thriller. The Assassins Gallery is very fast-paced and suspenseful, while blending in some interesting historical information about assassins, FDR's private life and some thought-provoking issues. All in all, Robbins's writing style will keep you glued to your seat to find out what happens next ... but, with the exception of the ending, you'll probably be able to accurately predict a lot of what happens. This, however, will not detract from this exciting thriller. The one major criticism I did have with The Assassins Gallery, and which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating, is the relative ease with which the main \\"good\\" character is able to determine what the assassin is planning to do as well as of the relative ease with which the \\"bad\\" character, the assassin, is able to manipulate everyone she comes in contact with. Nonetheless, The Assassins Gallery should be Robbins' \\"break out\\" book and help get him the large audience he deserves."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"I work for a book store, so I was fortunate enough to read an advanced copy. This book is utterly enthralling. Initially I picked it up for some light bedtime reading, then before I realized the time it was 3 am and I had finished it.The premise of the book is that a female assasin has been hired to kill FDR. The secret service recruits the help of a Scottish professor, who happens to train OSE and is writing a book on assasins, to hunt down this assasin before she hunts down FDR. I won't write any more about the plot because I would hate to provide any spoilers.Robbins' writing style is reminscent of the best of Dan Brown and Vince Flynn's works. Not only is there fast paced action goading you to turn the next page, but the characterization is excellent as well.

I'd first heard about it thanks to a radio commercial plugging The Assassins Gallery a few months ago. Curiousity got the best of me and so I purchased it and read it in a few days.

At times Dag was quite annoying but it was obvious the man was serious about his job of protecting FDR. I also enjoyed Mikhal Lammeck's character, flaws and all. Even the sometimes cantankerous Mrs. Beach(assistant to the Secret Service supervisor Mr. Reilly) was starting to grow on me. It was quite interesting in that Robbins made his assassin a Persian woman who deliberately called herself Judith.

'Papillon', 'A Winters Tale', and 'Portnoy's Complaint' are some other novels that temporarily took my life over in this way. These are all different types of books but they had in common an ability to allow me a temporary escape from my day to day life. If you are familiar with these titles you will also understand that it has been a while since I have had this experience.If you have not had this experience you will when you read 'The Assassins Gallery'. You will find yourself following leads along with Professor Lammeck in his search to stop the assassin before it is too late. You will be both repulsed and attracted (in my case very attracted) to Judith (the Persian assassin). You will be genuinely sad when certain characters are murdered in various and exotic ways and not so sad when some other characters meet their fate. The best quality of this novel (among many) is the complexity of the characters. They are complete human beings, not just heroes or villains.To summarize The Assassins Gallery is a great book but do not open it up if you have an important sales meeting the next morning. Because you will appear at that meeting with bleary eyes and thinking about whether the donuts might be laced with arsenic rather than the monthly sales results."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"Robbins' seventh novel, a fast-paced thriller, takes place in Washington DC. It is 1945, the war is in its final days, and a lone assassin slips ashore, her target none other than the American president. Judith, beautiful blue-eyed almond-skinned Egyptian who can pass for white or black depending upon her wardrobe and demeanor, is one the most captivating --and cold-blooded --assassins you are likely to encounter in the pages of a book. Mikhal Lammeck, the history professor who has mastered the secrets of the deadliest assassins, searches in all the bright spots and dark corners of the nation's segregated capital for his elusive prey, culminating in a desperate race across the American South. Will he catch her in time?This thriller has a great plot, nuanced characters, and lean, but elegant, prose. What's not to like? Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"If the reader can look past the series of fortunate events that play into the plot line and get lost in this excellent story, they'll find a first rate thriller. I had to question the amazing luck of the female villan when she lucked into a maid's job at a house whose occupant works in the FDR administration. This coupled with a Secret Service Agent with an apparent crystal ball who recognizes two civil defense volunteers murders in Mass. as part of a plot to kill FDR.The strengths of this book lie in the crisp dialogue and historical setting which propel a reader back in time to 1945. It infuses fiction with nonfiction and even some minor characters who are mentioned in passing are accurately portrayed in their historical rolls.Recommended for the thriller devote."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"After reading a dozen or so reviews, it seems to me that nobody addressed the most vital questions 1.Who hired Judith? 2. What is the nationality of the sub that put her ashore in New England?

This novel spins an awfully believable tale surrounding the death of FDR! Totally fiction. Totally enjoyable! If you have never read David L Robbins, do yourself a big favor and dig in!"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"The author makes so many glaring errors early in the book, I didn't trust anything in it that I didn't already know is historically accurate.For example:In the first paragraph, the killer swims ashore to Newburyport, Mass. on January 1, 1945, wearing a wetsuit; the wetsuit was invented in 1949. In the fourth paragraph, she looks up at the quarter moon; the moon appeared nearly full at 2:00 am in Massachusetts on January 1, 1945.A tire iron, used as a weapon in the fight she gets into on the beach with two civilian defense volunteers, inexplicably becomes a crowbar when discussed throughout the rest of the book.And when the assassin gets to DC, a walk takes her close to the White House and its \\"classic dome.\\"Even the dust jacket blurb gets in the spirit of the errors, telling us that this novel that begins around 2 am on January 1, 1945 starts on \\"New Year's Eve, 1945.\\"I read historical fiction partly for the story and partly for the history. I was sorry that the author completely lost my trust on the history.The story is highly implausible but, once you grant its premise, mostly consistent. I don't buy that the assassin is acting in character when the author brings her into conversation with the professor hunting her, but otherwise it is generally character driven.I also give the story points for the fascinating species of suspense it offers. We know from the beginning that FDR will die in April 1945, but it's still suspenseful to find out whether it will be at the hands of the assassin (whose weapons include a variety of subtly acting poisons) or whether death by natural causes cheats the assassin."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"While some features of the ending make no sense to me, the story as a whole fascinated me enough to keep me reading.

I started it, then stopped and read another WWII mystery, &#34;Billy Boyle,&#34; then came back to it. I'm still not finished.

It starts out with a bang and never lets up. I recently read another World War II thriller that is like a book end to thisIt's \\"Stealing Trinity\\" by Ward Larsen and it's focus is on the end of the war. \\"Stealing Trinity\\" is this author's second thriller. The first, \\"The Perfect Assassin\\" is awesome, too. Keep these types of books coming, guys!!"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"A hired assassin, a terrifyingly brutal practitioner of killing arts drawn from a millennia of secrecy and deceit, enters the United States near the end of World War II prepared to put an end to one of the country's greatest presidents. Standing between her and her prize are a history professor specializing in the study of assassination and the Secret Service, whose agent, Dag Nabbit, is a former student. The resulting battle of intellect and cunning takes the reader on a fast ride from New England through Washington, D.C., to Warm Springs, Georgia, in a seductive alternate history from an author renowned for accuracy and imagination.It's been a pleasure for this reader to watch David Robbins practice his craft with growing maturity and style. Always crisp and forceful, Robbins' writing now displays sure talent for intricate characterization, credible dialog and inventive storylines. The thrilling conclusion of \\"The Assassins Gallery\\", with its unerring evocation of an impossible, but inevitable, tragedy, gives us good reason to look forward to Robbins' next outing, due this year."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"David Robbins' book is one of the best \\"cat and mouse\\" suspense novels I have ever read, and you are never sure which of the protagonists is the cat and which is the mouse -- each chases the other.There are no incredible leaps of faith required -- the book is very logical and well paced.If you like John Le Carre and Fredrick Forsyth, you should read this book. Robbbins is clearly in their class.His perspective on the historical times of 1945 is interesting and well done, but does not detract from the parallel plot lines. Every character introduced is both realistic and interesting.I plan to read all the rest of Robbins' books."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"Before reading The Assassins Gallery, by David L. Robbins, I was quite a bit down on reading anything new. It seems that finding a book with any level of depth or quality penmanship these days is a pursuit not too easily accomplished. Robbins has managed, in one book, to restore my faith and ressurrect my hunt for books (not written a century before) worth my time and effort. I've drilled through all of his previous books, loved them all, but still (due to the previously mentioned angst) approached The Assassins Gallery with a measure of trepidity. Robbins excels in crafting fiction around fact, morphing verifiable history (the actual kind, not the kind that authors make up and throw about like a child with a handful of wet noodles) into a personal stroll through aspects of the past you may not, beforehand, have given a second look. In his previous novels, Robbins took us through various moments of World War II, specifically detailing the matters involved in the Eastern Front of Europe and the quest to capture Berlin. This time, we're off the warfront, back in the States and on the chase for an assassin believed to be targeting none other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt.It's a chase against time and Mikhal Lammeck, an expert on assassins, has been given the task of hunting an assassin that has never been seen, never been confirmed, and to all in the government does not exist. From a small beach in New England to the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, Lammeck pursues the assassin the only way possible: He has to think, act, behave like and become an assassin himself. The action is swift, hitting you squarely in the first chapter and leaving you stuck to the pages throughout. When the action brings us to the story's climax, when you've finally taken that breath you've been holding since page one, Robbins lays out the biggest gamble of them all, found in the book's final pages.To simply say that Robbins is a skilled artisan is leaving much yet on the table. What makes The Assassins Gallery worth the read is his investment in character and research. History is a living, breathing, functioning character and is given as much respect and leeway as any character in the book. You invest yourself in them all, feel what they feel, but are left with more, historically speaking, than absorbing one of the best books of the year. You learn and grow with a history you never knew existed and that--if there were no other reason--is why you will run to tell everybody about The Assassin's Gallery.Was there truly a plot to kill FDR? Did he really die of an aneurism at Warm Springs as history tells us? Or did the assassin succeed and alter the course of a nation's war?"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"AG starts out well. Very well. Vividly, excitingly, pulse-poundingly well. The writing is entertaining, the story fast-paced. That's just the beginning, though. The great bulk of AG is given over to cliche characters and a highly contrived story. These would be excusable in a novel of the genre if they weren't so bloody predictable. I listened to AG on the daily commute. The first tape was a shot of caffeine straight to the veins. The next 10 or so tapes were a cup of hot milk on a humid day as the doldrums set in. In a word, boring."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"Authentic, exciting, and provocative thriller. The action jumps off the page. The writing is crisp and spare. Assassin's Gallery brilliantly evokes America in 1945, especially Washington DC. Robbins has an eye for the details of class and color and an ear for dialogue. The female lead, in particular, is made of flesh and blood. And somehow, while telling a great yarn about the last year of the Second World War, Robbins makes us think about the issues that trouble us today -- and he does so quietly and without advertising it."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"This is one of the best and most well-researched works of historical fiction that I have ever read. The pace of the book is so fast that I was able to devour this book in a matter of hours, without skipping a beat.Robbins has a funny track record when it comes to writing his stuff. There are a lot of avid followers in his wake. But before this one, I'd read \\"War of the Rats\\", \\"The End of War\\", and \\"The Last Citadel\\" - Out of the three \\"War of the Rats\\" was the only one that I deemed as being completely 5 stars. I say this because a lot of the other stuff that I read were very \\"yawn\\" producing. They dragged with a lot of what I call frivolous detail. Yet, in reading \\"War of the Rats\\" and the \\"Assassin's Gallery\\" I found a fast/concrete attachment to the characters. The plot was well played - and the historical outcome was interwoven with what seemed so seamless.With the \\"Assassin's Gallery\\", Robbins has found his niche' in a very well laid out story. The story of the assassin, the target, and the most unlikely of trackers is so compelling that it begs to be read and re-read for just the sheer pleasure! In my reviews, I never try to give away so much of the story that the readers find themselves reading the book in my review - especially if the story is a 5 star!The only thing that I will give away is that the \\"Assassin's Gallery\\" is a book in the works - within the story of the book. The protagonist is a person that anyone on the street would have overlooked as being an \\"expert\\", the assassin is a very skilled professional with a very dark secret. The \\"mark\\" was so unsuspecting - that everything fits in a very \\"possible\\" way. That is why the story seemed so seamlessly woven in both past and present.I know that all of this seems so cryptic. But believe me when I say this - this book is worth whatever money you are going to pay. This book presents a very candid and very realistic look into the art of the \\"silent kill\\". Could anyone see it coming? If they didn't, is that the final measure of success? Or is it in the getting away and being able to simply observe one's work? That was the creed of the inhabitants of the \\"Valley of the Assassins\\" in northern Iran. The whole premise of the story's \\"Assassin's Gallery\\" is a documentation of History's judgment regarding the progression of time/politics, and her attempt at re-balancing the chess board if she feels that something was done out of place. But the interesting point is that the most skilled assassin is the one that you don't see come or go. Don't believe that it's possible....read the book! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"Mikhal Lammeck is a history professor, though an American, he is living and teaching students in Scotland. His speciality is assassination. Both from a historical perspective as well as teaching his military students how to operate as assassin killers. The time frame of the book is January 1945-May 1945. Judith, a persian master assassin, is put ashore on a Massachusetts beach after having come in on a raft subsequent to disembarking from a submarine. Her mission is to kill President Roosevelt. I love these assassin books going back to Day of the Jackal and Sean Flannery's Counter-Strike. I always have rooted for the assassin. Lammeck is contacted by a former student of his who now works for the secret service and returns to the U.S. to help protect Roosevelt. It seems as though Judith is always a step ahead of the authorities. This is a fine read. The only reason I give it four stars is that it didn't seem to have that can't put it down quality. Particularly some of the passages related to Lammeck's pursuit of Judith. The scenes specifically related to Juith are first rate. Nevertheless it's definitely worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"This book flows like a river on a rainy day, smooth yet exciting. It's fabulous. There are some things that seem far-fetched at times, but it's most intrigueing. The interaction between two men (Lammeck and Dag) is great. Funny story about Dag's name. It's great mix of fiction with history around FDR's end."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"This book starts out with a woman named Judith being dropped on the shores of Newburyport Massachusetts. There she encounters a Civil Defense Patrol(a man and a woman). She murders both of them and escapes. MikhalLammeck, an authority on assassinations is called in to investigate the murders in Massachusetts. He is shown a knife left behind after themurders. Lammeck identifies the knife as belonging to a sect known as theAssassins of Persia. Their tribal name Ismai-i-l Assasins of Alamut.Theirleader was known as Hasan-i-Sabah. Lammeck knows that Judith has been sent to America to kill Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Along with Secret Service agent Dag Nabbit Lammeck begins a search for Judith. She always seems to stay one step ahead. She finally gains employment with Roosevelt's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. Lammeck is still unable to catch up with her.Finally he recognizes her and dashes down to Warm Springs, Georgia to prevent her from assassinating Roosevelt. It has anunbelievable ending. The person that hired Judith is also shocking. Thisis an outstanding book. Be sure to read it."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"My first inclination was to label this as just another assassination-of-an-important-person novel, but this story carries some added uncertainty to this genre. In most of these books we know how it will all end. In Day of the Jackal, for instance, we know from the beginning that the plot against de Gaulle will fail. In another rather recent novel the target was John Kennedy on his trip to Berlin. No suspense there. We know he came home alive from Berlin. This time around we are dealing with an assassin's attempt to have a go at Franklin Roosevelt. The bad person here is a woman named Judith who sets out not to shoot or stab FDR, but to poison him. That would, in light of the history of FDR's death, be the most plausible approach.The Secret Service invites an American professor living in Scotland to come back to the US, and look into a group of strange deaths that might indicate a foreign agent has landed in Massachusetts. Prof Lammack arrives on the scene, and doggedly begins to pursue the villain - well, actually, not so doggedly as he frequently gets tired of it all, and just drives around aimlessly in his government issue car. Well, at least he is committed to finding Ms Judith, isn't he? Well, actually, he sometimes asks if he can just go home to Scotland. Be that as it may, he does keep on her trail. In one rather implausible scene Judith sets it up so that she meets with the Prof at an embassy party. She just wants to tell him her biography, and having done so she melts away into the night.Again, the fun part of this book is that you really don't know until the end if she succeeds or not. Did FDR die of a cerebral hemorrhage or did he die of cyanide poisoning? Then there is the strange feeling you have that the Prof might have developed a bit of fondness for Judith. Now that is a switch.Let me explain my four star rating of this book. My first inclination was to give the book two or three stars. The author is a very average writer, and often the story just sort of lumps along with a few frenetic sections followed by some dull spots. I gave it four stars simply because you really don't know if FDR will die naturally or by an assassin's hand."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"\\"... you had a gun on me twice, and both times you let me go. A girl gets to appreciate that sort of thing.\\" - from THE ASSASSINS GALLERYMy first chance at THE ASSASSINS GALLERY was the initial thirty-six pages I finished on AMTRAK's Southwest Chief on the overnight leg from Los Angeles to Albuquerque, where I disembarked from the train and mistakenly left the book behind to continue on to Chicago all by itself. This was no small loss as I'd been hooked by what I'd read so far and thus had to purchase a second copy once I returned home. (I just hate it when that happens, don't you?)In the opening chapter, a mysterious submarine surreptitiously drops off a passenger on an isolated stretch of the Massachusetts coast on January 1, 1945. The intruder, after skillfully but brutally killing two unlucky Civil Defense coast watchers, goes to the nearest town, obtains a car, and sets out for Washington, D.C. The mission: to kill the President of the United States.One member of the Secret Service detail assigned to protect the Chief Executive is Agent Dag Nabbit, once on loan to, trained by, and operational with the British Special Operations Executive. (Dag Nabbit? Author David Robbins must be kidding. How about Holy Moses, Jumpin' Jehosephat, Gosh Darn, or my personal favorite, Oh S--T?) Nabbit, having come across the police report from Massachusetts concerning the double murder on the sands, suspects something sinister is afoot. So, he gets from the SOE the loan of his former instructor and historical expert on assassination techniques, Professor Mikhal Lammeck, to help with the investigation.The author's previous works of fiction are centered on World War II. The first three skipped around the Eastern Front (Stalingrad, Berlin, Kursk), and the fourth takes place in Europe on the Western Front. THE ASSASSINS GALLERY also has the war as a backdrop, but at the distant vantage point of the U.S. capital. Here, the plot is ultimately keyed to an historical event, Franklin Roosevelt's death at Warm Springs, SC on April 12, 1945, ostensibly from a brain hemorrhage.The promise of the first 36 pages held up; the volume teetered on the edge of being in the couldn't-put-it-down category until the end. The confrontation between the assassin and Lammeck at a full-dress reception at the Peruvian embassy was especially clever and worth the price of admission - paid twice as you recall. And the identity of the government payrolling the assassin was a nice twist. There were, however, irritations that caused me to lop off a star.One of the biggest thorns in America's side in today's era of radical Islamic mischief is Iran (Persia). So, as if the author's publisher wanted David to make THE ASSASSINS GALLERY topical with current times, the unlikely villain of this piece is a Persian, Moslem assassin adept in the use of knife and poisons. What's more, her name is ... Judith. Okey-dokey. (Lucky we're not now in confrontation with Alaska; the Bad Gal would've been an Eskimo named Gladys with a harpoon.)I also wasn't engaged by the main protagonist, Lammeck. Rather than coming off as heroic, he presented himself more as a whiner. And his relationship with former student Dag, rather than being congenial, was a continuing source of annoyance to both and to me. Actually, the most interesting and engaging character was Judith; she deserves her own series, something which Robbins makes possible, especially if she continues to stalk American politicians."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"In a vivid tale that transports you back to the 40s, a question arises through the voice of Professor Mikhal Lammeck: Which determines the course of history- individuals or events?This is at the very heart of Assassins Gallery, an intelligent and captivating story that invites the reader not merely to be entertained, but to think, feel and question how our collective and individual existence shapes our circumstances, and vice versa.In this vein the author produces not only a well-written tome, but reveals to us that he has a beloved mistress and her name is History."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"What a great read! I loved the fast pace as much as I loved the historical tidbits. Probably my favorite of all his books because I just could't put it down. Wartime D.C. is drawn clearly and compellingly and the research is, as always with this author, thorough and reliable - as close to time travel as I'm likely to get."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"I wouldn't comment except I see so many 5 stars and wonder why. Yes, this is a fairly interesting book but I couldn't wait for it to end - and that's never a good sign. I thought it started to drag in the middle and for a while I thought it would never end. Then when it did end I couldn't believe the ending. I don't want to spoil the ending but it just doesn't fit the character of someone who trains assassins. Because the history was interesting I give it 3 stars but as far as the overall story I think that's generous."},{"Title":"The Assassins Gallery","review":"I came away from the novel understanding President Roosevelt's last year's like never before.

However, later, when I had a chance to actually read it, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a quite intelligent and creative summation of the past 1000 years. Although it hits all the usual highlights, this book rises above the Time-Life standard, sinking neither into sentimentality nor into thoughtless platitudes. I would recommend this book to people who are building image collections. Additionally (and I mean this in the best possible sense), this is the kind of book that should be in doctors' waiting rooms: it can be read in fits and spurts, and is a smart picture book. It might also reengage a middle-schooler who has gone off socail studies."},{"Title":"The Life Millennium: The 100 Most Important Events and People of the Past 1000 Years","review":"What an interesting topic! Unfortunately, however,the list of the top 100 people of the millenniumseems distorted by misunderstood patriotism.For example, the top spot got assigned to Edison,for some quite nonobvious reason. Sure, Edison was a fineinventor, but even during his lifetime there were non-USinventors whose inventions had greater impact than Edison's.And to let him preside over the entire millennium will reallyseem like the most amazing stretch of patriotism, at least to foreigners.The unsuspecting reader is left with the impression thatEdison was the most important contributor to the lightbulb, although he was just one of those who improved it.Goebel invented the first true light bulb in 1854,Woodward and Evans patented one in 1875, Swan built onewith carbon filament in 1878, and Edison purchased the1875 patent and had a team of co-workers trymany alternative materials untilthey were able to prolong the burning time in 1879.Likewise, most of Edison's numerous other patentswere just improvements of older inventions (exception:the grammophone). Moreover, even the 19th century (leaveallone the entire millennium) saw greaterinventions than the light bulb or the grammophone, e.g,gasoline engine and car (Benz; note that it is the carindustry that became the TwenCen's dominant industry,not the light bulb industry), or the dynamo for makingelectricity (Siemens), or the electric motor (Faraday).Other contemporaries whose impact exceeded Edison'sinclude Darwin (evolution theory) and Haber (artificialfertilizer, most influential TwenCen invention accordingto NATURE, July 1999, p.415: increasing the world'spopulation from 1.6 to 6 billion).Similarly, the Wright bros got the #20 spot, whilethe first human flights (France, 18th century) andthe first powered heavier-than-air flight (Ader, 1890)are not even mentioned. Even Lilienthal does not appearin the top 100, although he performed 2500 flightslong before the Wrights.I guess the main problem with the book is thatpatriotic inaccuracies and overstatementsinvalidate and actually ridicule the entire top 100 list.A positive note: at least the top 10 event list does not seemunreasonable, topped by bookprint (Gutenberg re-inventedthis Chinese technology and thus started the Westerninformation age), steam engine (start of the industrialrevolution; Watt improved the previous models),Protestantism (only major new religion of the past1000 years), and the discovery of the New World(Columbus, 1492).But given this more or less convincing eventlist it comes as an even greater surprise to seeone of several influential 19th century inventorsplaced ahead of truly influential giants such as Gutenbergand Watt and Luther and Newton and Einstein and Columbus.I think it is fair to say that no decent round of experts(say, an international group of history professors) wouldplace Edison anywhere near the top 30.Anyway, the book is an interesting documentation of aparticular world view, and does contain edifyinginformation. I give it two stars."},{"Title":"The Life Millennium: The 100 Most Important Events and People of the Past 1000 Years","review":"This is the fairest treatment of the events of the past millennium that I have seen.

It's a terrible feeling, isn't it? Countless research studies indicate that a substantial majority of those surveyed have a greater fear of speaking in public than of dying. (This may explain the origin of the comment \\"I really died up there.\\") Here in a single volume are the thoughts, feelings, values, skills, techniques, reminiscences, and recommendations of 22 of the world's greatest public speakers. This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone (literally anyone) who, from time to time, must prepare and then present a program of some kind to an audience.Obviously, no single chapter (much less all of them) can guarantee that the reader will then be able to overcome fear or discomfort. However, after having read the entire book, the reader will then be much better prepared for whatever public presentations may be required of her or him. Advance preparation is essential and that includes such seemingly unimportant items as having a spare bulb for the overhead or slide projector; checking out the room, the seating arrangements, the room's lighting and temperature, and the sound equipment in advance; completing adequate \\"homework\\" on the audience and its expectations; and as conducting as many rehearsals as necessary to become comfortable with both the material and the flow of presenting it. I learned something of great value from each of the \\"masters\\" who contributed to this volume. Each of them has a distinctive style but all are effective communicators. Each prepares for a presentation in different ways but all believe in Murphy's Law and proceed accordingly.Many of the \\"secrets\\" referred to in the book's title are just plain common sense but many others, until now, have been unknown to most people. All can be very helpful during the preparation and presentation process. Because almost everyone dreads speaking in public and so few people are any good at it, this book can provide you with a significant advantage during the progress of your career by setting you apart from (and a rung or two above) almost everyone else in your organization. It can also help you to have a much greater positive impact on those outside your organization, especially current and prospective customers. Those who are effective public speakers have much greater impact in one-to-one conversations and during group discussions. They respond more crisply and eloquently, hence more impressively, when asked direct questions. They are invariably better prepared. They speak with conviction. And they are highly persuasive. If this is the kind of impact you wish to have in all manner of situations, buy the book, read it, and then apply what you have learned in each and every situation in which you have the opportunity to communicate with someone else."},{"Title":"Guide to a Healthy Cat","review":"I have read many books on cats, and this one gives great information that is easy to read and understand.

There have been periods in history where his works were dismissed as irrelevant and of poor technical quality. But despite the varying critical evaluations, Turner's inimitable style of finding the transparency of that plane where water and air admix has always been viewed by those who are fortunate enough to approach his great works as that of an idiosyncratic romantic poet.No subject better provided a venue for his vision than the mysterious and magnificent 'La Serenissima' - Venice, Italy. It is in this city that floats like a transient tenant on the sea, laced with canals, bathed in fog and rain and mist that Turner found the essence of the spirit of Venice. This lavishly designed and illustrated volume originally served as a catalogue for the exhibition by the same title that was staged at the Tate Museum in London and traveled thereafter. Curator Ian Warrell is to be commended for this largest collection of Turner's paintings and drawings ever to be assembled, and to top his achievement he produced this monograph which not only illustrates in rich color separations the glories of the paintings and the detail of the sketches, it also is graced by excellent essays by travel writer Jan Morris, historian David Laven and Venice specialist Cecelia Powell.While there have been several fine books on Turner, this is the finest assemblage of works that inherently relate, a fact which induces a deeper appreciation for Turner's talent. Setting his paintings in context with the works of other painters, both his contemporaries and others, shows not only the 'how' of Turner's techniques, it informs us of the context of the views both historically and artistically.The quality of the reproductions is first class and the quality of the paper of this book is of the highest order. This is simply a magnificent book visually and educationally...and romantically! Highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 05"},{"Title":"Simply Delectable","review":"\\"Simply Delicious\\" is the original title of this book as it was sold here in South Africa. I intended to review Sharon's follow-up book, \\"Simply Too Delicious\\" because that's the one I own, but it's not in Amazon's catalogue. Nevertheless, the two books are very similar in terms of quality, style of cooking and presentation - although the second book has more recipes (and is more expensive).These are fantastic books for the novice cook, because the recipes are mostly simple to prepare (and many are suitable for everyday use), but still delicious enough to delight your friends. You're not expected to prepare your own stock or make your own pastry. That's not to say that experienced cooks won't learn anything from Sharon's imaginative ways with ingredients.Another thing I like about this book is that she includes menu suggestions; recipes for items such as sauces, dressings and mustards; explanations of which commercial products (stock cubes, etc) she uses and good substitutes (because some are only available in South Africa).An interesting point to note is that the author is Jewish, and so although the books are not marketed as \\"Kosher Cookbooks\\" and do not contain traditional Jewish foods, all of the recipes are in fact kosher (which means no pork or shellfish recipes, and no recipes that mix meat with dairy products). She also gives alternatives on some recipes to make them dairy-free so that they can be served at a meat-based meal. This is probably useful for the lactose-intolerant too."},{"Title":"Simply Delectable","review":"I recently purchased her book through Amazon and wish I could get a hold of her newer book, \\"Simply to Delicious.\\" I have thoroughly enjoyed using it to make some outstanding dishes that were simple and delicious.

We had guests from Scotland, friends of mine from my college days in that country and we thought of putting together a varied menu which was delicious as well as easy to prepare. When it comes to entertaining friends, we always want to serve them something either they have never tasted before or thought of preparing it for themselves; that is not easy to do in practice. However, after spending half an hour going through our cookbooks on our shelves, we came across SIMPLY DELECTABLE by Sharon Glass. Quite frankly, ever dish that we prepared turned out to be just delectable.The recipes in this book are very easy to follow. One must be really bad or hopeless cook for these recipes not to turn out well. The Mushroom and Ricotta Canneloni, The Soy Glazed Rack of Lamb and Macadamia and Chocolate Wafers were our guests' favorite during their week long stay. I have to point out that, being dark chocolate funs, we used extra dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips when preparing the wafers, and I think that really improved the flavor of the recipe.This book is divided into several chapters for easy reference and it even has a chapter on kitchen essentials. Buy this book and the home entertaining will be a breeze."},{"Title":"Simply Delectable","review":"I was lucky enough to attend a cooking demonstration given by the author in San Diego earlier this year.

Why else would she have agreed to organize the big day-when she clearly had a grudge against him? Still, there was unfinished business between them: a reckless one-night stand just two months ago...Regan did have a hidden reason for getting close to Joshua's family. Only she could never reveal her secret plans-not even when Joshua confessed his engagement was a sham and he wanted his ring on Regan's finger!The first 96 pages and the ending are worth four stars. The rest of the book is fine too. The only quibble I have is that Joshua spent way too much time engaged to the wrong woman. The plot description above is wrong in that she doesn't know whose wedding she is organizing until she gets to meet the groom to be. There is a sub-plot about the brother that goes on too long and I wonder if Ms. Napier ever wrote a book about Joshua's son?"},{"Title":"Revenge Affair (Sweet Revenge/Seduction) (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Susan Napier does it again!

But the mistakes and oversights by the author are less forgivable. Missing figures and diagrams and referencing the same fish twice in the species description section (Sarda Orientalis) prevent this book from being recommended by me. A total of four total color photographs (including the one found on the soft jacket cover) is pretty skimpy considering the book's supposedly comprehensive intent.

Yike! Where's My Trike? (Peek-a-Board Book)","review":"Sister Bear has parked her bike near a tree and now can't find it. On each page she thinks she spies a part of the bike (seat, basket,...) through a cutout on the next page. Finally, after spotting several things that are NOT her bike, she does indeed find her bike parked beside a tree. On each page, a cutsie animal peeks through from the previous page, helping to narrate the story.The whole cut out/peek-a-boo theme doesn't work well at all. The rhymes aren't at all natural and don't have a good flow to them. The book attempts to teach differences between Sister Bear's trike and the other objects she mistakes for her trike. It falls flat. The cutsie animals don't fit well in the story, and actually create a distraction.There are definitely better childrens' books out there."},{"Title":"The Handbook of Enology: Volume 2, The Chemistry of Wine Stabilisation and Treatments (Handbook of Enology: Microbiology of Wine)","review":"I am currently working as a enologist in a wine producing company. I am actively involved every day with winemaking as well as wine research. To know the latest research being done on wine is thus very important to me. This book presents the latest research and facts in a scientific way, which should be helpful for both the scientist, winemaker as well as the novice. The wealth of enological knowledge which the French acquired over many years is now also available to the non-French speaking wine community through this book. The different chapters in this book cover a wide field of enology and I can recommend it."},{"Title":"The Handbook of Enology: Volume 2, The Chemistry of Wine Stabilisation and Treatments (Handbook of Enology: Microbiology of Wine)","review":"This is a standard reference that everyone involved in winemaking should own. If more wine journalists bought and read these volumes we would not have to see so many myths and misunderstandings in print. My only objection is the high price, making it almost impossible to buy for the amateur wine enthusiast that is interested in wine chemistry."},{"Title":"Alzheimer's: Hard Questions","review":"The words \\"selfish\\" and \\"selfless\\" are used repeatedly in this book, and the authors state very clearly that \\"selfish\\" is bad and \\"selfless\\" is good. It is \\"selfish\\" not to take care of your Alzheimer's-afflicted relative in your own home, it is \\"selfless\\" to take care of your Alzheimer's-afflicted relative in your own home.I think that this is already the baseline model that each of us brings with us when we start deciding how to accomodate an Alzheimer's patient that we love. No new outlooks from the labs of academia here. Nor is there any educational material about how ethicists arrive at the conclusions they do.The format of the book is descriptions of seven composite family scenarios. The tone of the writing underlines the judgemental quality of the thinking by narrating in a sing-songy rhythm, and using character descriptions that remind me of the lesson book we used in my Catholic catechism class during grade-school.The selfhood discussion comes too late in the book. The concept of \\"selfhood\\" and the effects of Alzheimer's on selfhood would have made a much better focus for this discussion than the \\"family-care good\\" \\"institutional-care bad\\" framework that was so overpowering. They should have featured why a family would want to protect a patient's selfhood, and how other considerations like safety, inconvenience, and concommitant and equally important tasks (such as parenting young and teenage children) might come into conflict with (or dovetail with) protection of the patient's selfhood.Projecting the long-term consequences to each individual of the choices that they make during Alzheimer's disintegration in a family member would have been a less judgemental angle to approach issues of \\"selfishness\\" from. There was no recognition in any of the scenarios of the effect of long-standing mental illness in family members, including but not limited to the patient, or ethical ways of viewing \\"dysfunction\\" in families facing the care of an Alzheimer's patient."},{"Title":"Alzheimer's: Hard Questions","review":"This book is a wonderful resource for family members with loved ones suffering from dementia.

While some may find his declamatory style and tendency toward bombast wearying in the plays, it is perfectly suited to the frieze-like beauties of HERO AND LEANDER, and particularly to the rhetorical excesses of Lucan, whose first book Marlowe translated &quot;line for line.&quot; And few translations of Ovid AMORES capture his eroticism and wit as well as Marlowe's. A must-have selection of poems, convenient and affordable, although the apparatus and notes are not as helpful as those in the Penguin edition (now sadly out of print) edited by Stephen Orgel."},{"Title":"Christopher Marlowe;","review":"The Everyman's Poetry edition of Christopher Marlowe's poetry is a nice collection. With extensive notes and a lengthy introduction dealing with Marlowe's work and life, it is an excellent resource for students and admirers of Marlowe alike.As for Marlowe's poetry itself, it can be quite tedious. Steeped in rhetoric and mythology, the long poems drone on for page after pretentious page. Personally, I prefer Marlowe's plays to his poetry but both formats show him to be a cerebral and skilled author. In short, the book is not for the casual reader.Also of note, the vast majority of the book is made up of Marlowe's translations of other works."},{"Title":"Muhammad at Medina","review":"Muhammed at Medina is a remarkable volume that covers the second part of the life of the prophet of Islam and the early days of his young nation after 622 CE, the year of Hijra when Muhammed left Mecca to Medina which also marks the first year of the Muslim calander. With much skill and ability to retrodict events and put them in their historical context, Watt offers this book as one of the most authentic works on the subject.The volume is an academic work and might not appeal to all kinds of readers save for academics and those who are very interested in the subject. Watt employs the modern methodology in classifying, crediting and discrediting almost all of the primary sources of the time. Watt then objectively treats these sources and draws conclusions that a reader can rarely find in other places.His gifted style helped a great deal in making a lengthy volume full of details entertaining for the reader and rather catchy. Those who are interested in reading about the whole story of Muhammed and his mission should also buy Watt's first volume, Mohammed at Mecca, which covers his pre Hijra years between his birth in 570 and his immigration to Medina in 622.Too bad the book is out-of-print. Publishers should consider marketing a second edition since it would certainly deserve the attention and interest of many scholars and readers today."},{"Title":"I Still Love You Daddy!: What Children Say They Need from Their Dads After Divorce","review":"A very informative and enjoyable book for all fathers. The letters from the children were heart wrenching. The book gets down to the most important element of fatherhood-what children need from their father, from their point of view. It is an easy read with many vitally important but simple acts and thoughts for fathers to think about while being a child's father. It is not heavy text but thought provoking and could be life changing for a child if a father would incorporate some of the ideas children feel are important especially in a divorce situation. It is a must read for all dads. I loved it."},{"Title":"Cyrus the Great","review":"Cyrus the Great is Harold Lamb's narrative of the life of the King of Persia who conquered the Medes, Lydians and Babylonians and marched into those mysterious lands to the east forging the largest empire of the time. Some of the book is, of course, informed speculation about everything from Cyrus's childhood to his motivations as an adult. The book was originally written in 1960 and I have a 1976 printing from Pinnacle Books. Lamb wrote an entire series of history and historical fiction books, writing mostly between World War I and II, on historical figures from Genghis Khan to Alexander the Great. At the time I bought this one, I missed the opportunity to buy about a dozen others of his works at a used bookstore and have been kicking myself ever since. I check the shelves every time I'm there and keep an eye out on Amazon but these books are really hard to come by especially in good condition with paperbacks this old."},{"Title":"Cyrus the Great","review":"Harold Lamb explains that \\"this book ... is not history\\" (p. 297). It is a dramatic imagining, rather, of the life, death and legacy of Cyrus the Great, the obscure Persian who conquered the Medes, Anatolia, Transoxiana, and Babylonia; who ended the era of Semitic petty kingdoms forever; and who founded what was at the time the largest empire the world had ever seen. That makes Cyrus an intriguing figure, but because the actual evidence of his background and reign is so thin, Lamb has a lot of room to invent whatever he wants -- about psyche, motivations, mood, statements, anything at all -- and he does precisely that.So the book isn't history. It's still a lot of fun to read. My favorite parts are about Babylon and the Jewish captivity, casting the writings of Daniel, Isaiah and Ezekiel in a new and interesting light. The book isn't worth much as a history, because the author makes almost no effort to differentiate for the reader which parts are fabrication and which are fact. I recommend it to all readers, with or without a background in Persia or the wider Middle East (although readers with such a background will enjoy it more), with just the one caveat."},{"Title":"Cyrus the Great","review":"The best part is Cyrus's spy mission to Babylon and later when the Persians are besieging the great city. One of the problems I have with many of Lamb's historical treatments is that his great captain are often not great fighters. He did it with Charlemagne and here with Cyrus. What Lamb does so well, however, is to give you a feel for that era. In that, he's a master."},{"Title":"Through the Dark Continent: Or, The Sources of the Nile, around the Great Lakes of Equatorial Africa, and down the Livingstone River to the Atlantic Ocean. Volume 1","review":"The natives of Africa who worked with Stanley called him Bula Matari - \\"The Rock Breaker\\", and with good reason. It is really very hard to appreciate Stanley's accomplishments from today's perspective. In 1874, Stanley left Zanzibar. By 1877, he had crossed the continent and reached the Atlantic Ocean. There is nothing modern man can do that would equal this accomplishment. Today's daring adventurers climb rocks or mountains or go bungee jumping. Stanley was traveling into the unknown. Not even space exploration today holds the quality of the unknown, as did Africa in Stanley's time. The hardship he faced during this time was unbelievable by today's standards. His circumnavigation of Lake Victoria alone contained a constant stream of near death scrapes that not only required staggering amounts of physical courage, but a mental toughness as well. A lot of the reviews I have read on this work focus on Stanley's political incorrectness. I urge a closer reading of the work. Stanley was actually extremely open minded and, more than anything, fair in his views and certainly very progressive. When discussing the character of the African natives, Stanley was of the opinion that \\"they are, in short, equal to any other race or colour on the face of the globe, in all the attributes of manhood.\\" Stanley was an insightful enough observer to draw comparisons between African legends and Christian beliefs, giving each equal respect and recognizing their similarities. Stanley even at one point performs the ceremony of blood-brotherhood with the famous chief Mirambo, which involved the sharing of blood by mutual cuts on the leg. I would suggest that Stanley was not only a progressive during his own time, but for any time. He judged men simply by deeds, nothing more or less. If only Stanley recieved the same standard of judgement. In Stanley's time, so much was unknown, and the world seemed so large and rich. In our time, so much more is known, and yet our world has become so narrow, specialized and petty. There can never be another man like Stanley. We are all far more interested in watching a teenager eat a plate of worms on \\"Fear Factor.\\""},{"Title":"A dictionary of the otchipwe language, explained in english","review":"I am not happy with this publication.

Older kids will love reading it over & over. Used copies are reasonable, actually cheap for such a fun story by the most famous poet of Indiana, James Whitcomb Riley (b 1849). An Indianapolis Children's hospital is named after him. He used old Hoosier dialect in his poetry, making him quite read and praised in his lifetime--and since. He wrote of boyhood, the common man, and the local genre. Even Mark Twain enjoyed attending Riley's performances of his poetry.Joel Schick illustrated the written work of JWR with a magnificent flair. For kids, the black/white ink pictures will delight. The supposedly scary story is filled with characters drawn with smiles, so it's not too scary for wee lads and lasses. The story begins: \\"Little Orphant (Riley dialect spelling) Annie's come to our house to stay,\\" and most drawings, many full page, have Little Orphant Annie smiling broadly. Oh there are some \\"Gobble-uns 'at gits you\\" drawn that try to look scary, but are so exaggerated that they just become more of the fun of this great, classic, children's book.The book even has a good moral for the young 'uns ta 'ear.An old book, yes, but worth the recycling to new generations."},{"Title":"Edu-Manga: Anne Frank","review":"I am a big believer in children being introduced to the personal lives of key people in history, so that they are not only familiar with the contributions to world society that person made and be inspired, but also to put a human face they can relate to for the era in history that person inhabits. It makes history personal. The problem is not so much that the \\"important\\" people are not well known, but that accessible material about them geared to children is hard to find, and by accessible, I mean entertaining in a way that while the facts are presented, the child actually wants to use the material. Now, my kids are like most kids. They LOVE cartoons and comic books as much as the next kid, and it is probably not a huge surprise given my own reading tastes, that they have a love of Japanese graphic novels in particular.It was therefore with great interest that one day while browsing Digital Manga's website, I came across the Edu-manga series. I asked the sales office rep about these titles, and she helped me source all five of the titles they had published. They have not been reprinted, but stocks are readily available via Amazon, Play.com, and other manga specialists, so not that difficult to get your hands on. I admit I had some trepidation on this matter. Firstly, these are COMICS. Now, I have read plenty of manga, and I know they can be quite serious in tone, and indeed, in Japan, many manuals and such are even produced in this format. I was not concerned about the format itself, but the fact that being aimed at kids, maybe it was dumbed down in some way. My second concern was that these were written originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, then translated, so what , for example, would their \\"take\\" be on European events? I decided they must be fairly balanced views and not overly dumbed down, else an American publishing house would not have gone to all the expense of licensing and translating it, so having the books sourced for me, I happily awaited their arrival.As it happens, the first book we decided to look at was about Anne Frank. I was particularly interested in this one because Anne Frank's diary moved me deeply when I first read it as a child of 12. My daughter is not quite nine, so not old enough to really understand a lot of emotions and the finer dirty details of the life Anne lived. I did think though that Anne Frank was a person I wanted my children to know, preferably before being assigned her diary as an educational read a few years down the line, so that as we studied events from WW II, they had that personal \\"face\\" of a real person to put on that time frame. Here, the children were being placed on trains and sent way to homes far away to escape the bombs, but there, children were herded onto trains for a darker different purpose, and families fled to secret homes to attempt an escape a fate worse than the possibility of a random bomb drop. This is the reality of Anne, who nonetheless hoped, laughed and dreamed in the way every young girl has. This was the persona that my daughter and son could identify with, whose emotions they could feel, to completely understand what it was like in those dark days. Well, they could, if it was presented in a way they could understand.So how did this fare? Well, not only were we enchanted by the presentation, but even I learned something. Rated for all ages, it has a reading level suitable for the 8 and above range, but a talented 6 or 7 year old could read it with minor assistance, as the vocabulary is not overly complicated, and while the subject matter is about a terribly violent and cruel period of our recent history, it is not explicit in its depictions though I would recommend being to hand as it is a story that will well the eyes with tears. The chapters are short and sandwiched between them are brief Q and A sections that explain key facts that may puzzle young readers. Astro Boy (yes, THAT Astro Boy) and his sister Uran are visiting their friend who is a professor. Uran has heard that a young girl became famous because she wrote a diary, and that young girl's name is Anne Frank. The professor says he knows about Anne, and takes the young pair to the Japanese city of Kobe as it has an important place related to Anne Frank, and that there , they can learn more about her.What? Kobe, Japan? Just what does the city of Kobe have to do with a young Austrian girl who was killed by the Nazis in Europe? I didn't know either, and was fascinated by the answer. You see, Anne's diary touched so many, and her place in history has been that human face I spoke of earlier. The one that represents the nonsensical ruin of a life of so many innocents who suffered during that terrible time. A time that the Japanese see as one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century, and so, in Kobe, they have built a church in her honour, complete with a statue of Anne and a memorial rose garden: Nishinomiya Anne's Rose Church . Now, I know Anne was Jewish, but the Japanese built this after consulting with Anne's father and his approval. Today, schoolchildren from Japan and tourists from around the world stop here while visiting the prefecture, and pay their respects to the memory of Anne Frank, to learn her story, and to etch in their hearts the need to never forget the terrible true price of genocide and war. So, it is very fitting that our two young Japanese friends visit here with professor, and begin to learn about the life of an ordinary young woman who came to symbolise a lost generation.The biographical part starts out with Anne's birth,and her parents are snapping photos of the newborn with her sister. We are treated to vignettes of ordinary life, interspersed with the intrusion of the ugliness that was to spread. People wearing armbands suddenly shouting \\"Juden\\" and smashing shop windows. A panel with Anne's father explaining the bad things they see, followed by a panel showing Hitler poised in that infamous salute, with the explanation rolling over. Anne grows up, starts school, the family moves, and things move onwards, steadily advancing to the terrible reality that was the attic, and their subsequent discovery by the Nazis, and the camp that followed. We see all of this, and while it is a lot of information for a graphic novel of only 168 pages, it is more than enough to tell us the story of Anne's life. This is not meant to replace the famous Diary, but to talk about who Anne was, how she came to write it, how she died, and why the world holds her diary so close to its collective heart. In fact, it drums home (without browbeating) that the Diary of Anne Frank is a must read.With the strategically placed Q and A sections between chapters, children have many questions answered that would likely confuse them, as it did Astro Boy and Uran. Questions like, \\"Why did the Nazis decide to persecute the Jews?\\", \\"What kind of place was a concentration camp?\\" , and \\"Does the Secret Annex where Anne lived still exist?\\". In addition, thanks to this being a graphic novel following Anne and her sister as they too question what they see happening about them, readers are treated to the explanations given them by Anne's parents. This makes the time period more understandable in an unartificial way as well as acting to bind young readers' personal experience as an \\"eyewitness\\" as they stand virtually beside Anne and see and hear this themselves. I quite like how it managed to explain the Holocaust in ways that would not engender horrific nightmares in the young, and the way it depicted the happenings without demonising the people of an entire country.The end of the book is another wealth of information that parents and teachers can make great use of. It has a small section explaining how Anne's father came to publish the diary, followed by another section that contains four short biographies of people who \\"dedicated themselves to Anne's Dream and world peace\\". Admittedly, these people probably did not know Anne at the time, but nonetheless, they shared the same dream. The first person is Anne's father, which is quite fitting. The next name on the list did not surprise me, and I was really happy to see a mention of him in a children's book as the only other book (or film for that matter) that I know of is definitely not one to show children: Oskar Schindler. The next two names did surprise me, I had to admit I had NEVER heard of them (hangs head in shame). Chiune Sugihara, anyone?Yes, when the majority of us think of the second world war and the Japanese, we usually and rather unfairly only think of Pearl Harbour, Iwo Jima, and such, right? That is only half of the story though, as Sugihara-san proves. In 1940, this man was the Japanese consular from Japan to Lithuania. There, he used his position to issue upwards of 6000 entry visas for Japan to fleeing Jews before the Japanese government stopped him. Yes, that is more than Schindler, isn't it? But nobody made a movie or wrote a novel about him, though perhaps they should. I think it would be fascinating, as he worked sandwiched between the Emperor of Japan and his government as they fought the Allies, and the advancing Nazis on the other, with a tide of desperate humanity looking for someone to help them.The last one is someone else with ties to Japan, though he was an Austrian, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, the Austrian scientist who put forward the idea that became the modern EU. He was born in Tokyo to his Japanese mother, who was married to the Austrian minister to Japan. He first put this idea forth during the war years, but had to flee Austria once the Germans occupied it, surfacing in the USA, and returning to Europe after the war to push his idea of a Pan European state, one where each nation would have a voice and listen to others, in a hope that war once more would not ravage Europe. Regardless of what one thinks of the modern EU, having it put into perspective like that makes one take stock, and maybe to want to kick some people for straying from ideals. Ahem..The last little detail this gem has is a time line. Now, I really love how this was done. It has three columns, so that one can see events in tandem at a glance. The first column follows Anne's life, the second the political events in Europe, while the third shows what happened in Japan, the US and elsewhere around the world at the same time. It keeps to just key points as otherwise it would be unwieldy, but it makes for an excellent resource to cross reference with other study materials on down the line. With its larger print, bigger than average art panels, and simpler language, this is sure to engage to the attention of a child being introduced to it and they certainly will come away from it knowing more about WW II and Anne Frank than they did going in. This is not to say that this won't have some possible hiccups with western users though.The first issue is minor. This is \\"native manga\\", so you will have to introduce the uninitiated in the proper way to read it. That is, the \\"back cover\\" is actually the \\"front\\", and you read the panels right to left. It is not difficult however, and the last page of the book actually has a pictorial guide to aid the unwary. The second quibble is the paper quality, It's almost like newsprint and is off-white. So, what I am saying is, it feels a bit cheap, and ham handed kids very well may rip the pages. It is no worse quality than most kids' cheap paperback books though, so as long as you make sure they know how to properly treat a book, you'll be okay. It is a slight disappointment, however, as it being educational material, you would think they might go a bit more upmarket with the paper to encourage schools and libraries to stock it, as multiple children would be handling it. It is not enough though to take away a star, so I'll just be done with mentioning it and leave it at that. Having done such a great job overall, we are looking forward to reading the other titles, and meeting Mother Teresa, Beethoven, Helen Keller, and Albert Einstein.For the interested, sample pages of this title can be viewed at [...]"},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"It is a great book on a not-so-well-known subject. A really gripping depiction of the struggle and suffering in besieged Leningrad. Starting at a rather slow (read: too slow) pace, as the author presents the political situation before the German attack on the Soviet Union, and events leading to Leningrad's encirclement, the book proceeds to very graphic, horrifying description of the life under the siege. Road to Life accross Ladoga Lake, desperate attempts to feed the city's population, cases of cannibalism are just a few highlights of this great book. However, the book never looked at these events from the other site. Germans are just shadows looming over the city. We never got a chance to hear from them, to find out what it was like from their perspective. Another problem with the perspective: author makes it look like Leningrad was populated in 90% by artists. Writers, painters, composers, and their likes, crowd the pages of the book leaving little room for ordinary people. With all that said, it is a great book, very readable, and, at least to me, very enlightening."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"The Soviet official history records that \\"never in the history of the world has there been an example of tragedy equal to that of starving Leningrad.\\" This flawed classic is not a military history, or even a balanced account, of the siege. It is the dark story of Leningrad's starvation in the first year of the siege. The author's perspective is solidly fixed on the city; there is little about either Soviet German troop dispositions and the German armies hover malevolently just off-stage. The story of the siege is also incomplete. The first year is told with excruciating detail. Everything else is summed up in a single chapter. The titanic struggle for Sinyavino Heights is dispensed in a single allusion. The real story is the effect of the siege on the artistic community of Leningrad. It is as a picture of suffering that the book succeeds, almost to excess. The grim stories of death do not pursuade but rather bludgeon the reader. The lack of military details make \\"The 900 Days\\" less than useful as a military history, and the sheer number of grim civilian stories ensure that it is not a pleasant read. This is one of those books that I'm glad to have read, but did not enjoy reading."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"This book is both easy and difficult to read.On the one hand, Pulitzer Prize winning author Harrison Salisbury was for many years the lead correspondent for The New York Times in the Soviet Union and writes with the clarity and purpose of a top-notch journalist. The recent paperback release is nearly 600 hundred pages in length, but you'll be surprised how quickly the narrative moves. Salisbury's chapters switch quickly and often from scenes of grand strategy at the Kremlin with Stalin to the everyday hazards of walking down Nevsky Prospekt during a heavy artillery barrage, which offers interesting contrasts and keeps the drama pulsing.On the other hand, the plight of the Leningrad population during the winter of 1941-42 so graphically told by Salisbury is agonizing to read. I would often find myself grimacing and squirming in my chair as Salisbury told of half-starved children huddled around the frozen corpse of their mother in an unlit, unheated and bombed out Leningrad apartment building. The physical, psychological and emotional toughness of the Russians is awe-inspiring. Moreover, these were common citizens, mostly factory workers and intellectuals and a good many women and children, not highly trained, battle-hardened soldiers. In mid-June they were lounging under trees on the banks of the Neva reading poetry. Six-months later they were manning anti-aircraft guns and trying to live on 300 grams of bread a day in temperatures that regularly dipped to 40 degrees below zero.It should be noted that the title \\"The 900 Days\\" is a bit of a misnomer. The siege of Leningrad did last just under 900 days (from September 1941 to January 1944), but the focus of this book is really the start of Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941) through the first winter of the siege (March 1942). Although there is a good deal of discussion on the military operations in defense of the city and many touching anecdotes of everyday life in the \\"city of death,\\" this book is neither a military history nor a complete social history of the siege. The experience of the blockade is conveyed primarily from the perspective of the leading lights of the Leningrad intelligentsia: Vera Inber, Anna Ahkmatova, Olga Bergolts, and Vsevold Vishnesky. They were poets, playwrights, journalists and composers - precisely the kinds of people most apt to leave the most enduring reminiscences of a horrific experience.It is hard to read books like \\"The 900 Days\\" (or Antony Beevor's \\"Stalingrad\\") and not feel that the primary credit for defeating Hitler rests with the Soviets. I love my country and my fellow Americans, but I simply can't imagine one of our cities enduring an experience like Leningrad and holding out even for a couple of weeks, let alone years. And through it all they kept not only their dignity, but also their appreciation for art and literature - throughout the siege the Leningrad central library never closed and was never empty."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"&quot;900 Days&quot; is the compelling story of the most brutal &amp; savage siege in modern history, that of the siege of Leningrad (St. Petersburg) by the German Army in Wold War II. The author, by way of personal interviews with survivors of the siege, manages to convey the horrific conditions &amp; effects of the to the reader in a way few studies of history have been able to do. Eminently readable, &quot;900 Days&quot; is a terrible &amp; gripping depiction of the event that laid bare the soul &amp; heart of a nation"},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Although I read this book just out of high school over thirty years ago, its images are still fresh on my mind. This was both a terrifying and fascinating book -terrifying because of the stark brutality of war, the slaughter of innocents and the depravation that the people of Leningrad experienced; and fascinating in how a people managed to survive in such desolation.The story of the eastern front is largely forgotten in the West. Recently, our nation celebrated the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, but as terrible a fight as it was; it was a cakewalk when compared to the horrific fighting on the Eastern front. In the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad alone over two million people perished- they were cauldrons of death. Although Stalin urged Roosevelt to commence the D-Day invasion to take the pressure on the eastern front and to hasten the defeat of the Nazis, the plain fact of history is that even without the invasion Hitler would had been defeated by the Soviet juggernaut. From the western perspective, the D-Day invasion served not to defeat Hitler (Stalin would have done that himself) but to keep all of Western Europe from falling Soviet domination.Now, back to the book. Yes, Salisbury was a journalist, not an historian and this is both a strength and weakness of the book. Yes, the plight and the hardship of the German Army is largely ignored, and yes, he misses some of the political ramifications of the battle, but as for telling a story of the survival of the human spirit he is unsurpassed. Put this book on you're a-list. It is a powerful and amazing book."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"It's a dicey endeavor to try to state the \\"worst\\" thing humanity has ever lived through in history. After all, there are so many candidates for the prize (and many of them occurred during WWII). But the siege of Leningrad surely must be among the most harrowing experiences human beings have ever survived. The 900 days gives every details of what the citizens of Leningrad did to survive several years of Nazis at their gate. The book goes through it step by step: the war coming closer every day, the rail lines cut off, the food supply dwindling. And then we see the awful day-to-day: ration cards, crime, cannibalism. It gave me chills to read certain chapters. They seem like stories from some wild, Hollywood tale but they are completely true. And the spirit of the Russians is astounding. They are surely some of the toughest people on the planet. Reading about how they drove trucks across the frozen lake to bring food will make you marvel at the ingenuity of people in the darkest of times. On a technical note, the book was a little long for me. Some parts dragged, but not so much that I couldn't keep going. I finished the book feeling saddened that human beings have done such things to each other, yet also in awe of what we can sustain as a people."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"This gripping narrative looks at the horrific siege of Leningrad from 1941-1944. Author Harrison Salisbury opens by examining Soviet Russia on the eve of the June, 1941 invasion - when commanders that suspected a German attack dared not prepare and risk the wrath of Stalin. Then the author describes the invasion, the approach of Nazi tank columns, and the surrounding of Leningrad's 2.5 million residents (and 500,000 defenders) at the end of August, 1941. Readers learn of the city's leadership, its battered but defiant defenders, and Stalin's machinations. The author devotes many chapters to the horrific winter of 1941-1942, when the besieged city ran out of food and coal. Imagine trying to survive on daily food rations of a few ounces of bread, in a frozen city with no heat or electricity, and with German bombs and shells falling daily. Dogs, cats, and birds disappeared into frying pans, and brave truckers brought in some supplies over a frozen Lake Lagoda, but over 250,000 civilians died of starvation during that first winter. After describing that horrific first winter, the author bascially fast forwards to the massive Russian offensive in January of 1944 that ended the siege. Then he concludes with a brief post-war epilogue that mentions survivors, rebuilding, and Stalin's brutal purge of the city's leadership.Journalist Harrison Salisbury (1908-1993) wrote readable prose that almost makes us feel as if we're inside Leningrad during the siege. His book does need better maps - even with a handy atlas I couldn't locate every town and river mentioned. Still this is gripping history, considered by some as definitive, and well worth your time. Readers might also enjoy many of the author's other works on Russia, China, etc."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"I will not recount here the grim and heartrending story of the Nazi siege of Leningrad during World War II, in which a million Soviet citizens died--most from starvation. Rather I will make a few comments that may alert readers considering buying this book. And offer a few ruminations about the siege and Eastern Front.This is a long and heavy book, not just physically. Like the siege it goes on and on. In fact the siege does not even begin until almost the middle of the book. It is an historian's book, not a popular, breezy tour. I found it impossible to keep in mind all the myriad Russian officers, officials, and bureaucrats that played a role in the saga. Many place names meant nothing to me and the three maps in the book were little help. I Google-mapped and used my atlas, neither of which helped much. It is just a confetti storm of facts, people, names, places, battles. I would have preferred an abridged or edited version.Nevertheless, the story, and pain and heroism, the quotidian aspects, and glory and misery of the siege do come through to the reader. Many passages are eloquent and expressive especially regarding the starvation, cold, and dark of the ghastly winter of '41-\`42.The reader who is not an expert on Soviet military history must sift and skim. Still, this is worth doing. But not being such an expert, I think in retrospect, I might have done better with one of the more recent shorter books on the siege (see Amazon.com for these). I plan to turn to one or more of these later.Now for my ruminations: I was struck by the difference between Paris and Leningrad in facing the Nazis. Paris essentially opened its doors and went on more-or-less as normal during the Nazi Occupation. The French government declared Paris an Open City in 1940 and fled south. Not so Leningrad. Knowing that resistance to the Nazi Blitzkrieg would bring disaster the Russians resisted with all their might. The world would be very different today if the Soviets had capitulated to save their glorious cities and precious lives. Hitler would have been triumphant, or if the Nazis would not have been ultimately victorious, the British and Americans--us--would have had an even vaster and more horrendous situation that would not obviously have had a good outcome.Thus the sacrifices and heroism of the Leningrad people and Soviets were not just for themselves, they are relevant to us today who enjoy reading about them, well-fed, in our well-heated and comfortable easy chairs. The Soviet leadership was tyrannical and ugly, and this comes out in the book, but they did save Europe and perhaps the world from Nazism."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"An intense examination of the siege of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1941-42. Most of the book is concerned with the German invasion in June 1941 and takes us to the disastrous winter of 1941-42 when possibly over 600,000 Leningraders died of deliberate starvation from the German siege. The city understandably was in such disarray during this time that we will never know the exact number of deaths - and how many died of residual effects after, will also never be known. During and after the spring and summer of 1942 many more residents were evacuated and sadly rations could be increased because there were simply far fewer people to feed as so many had perished.Mr. Salisbury is at his best when describing the terrible events of the German siege - the constant bombardment, the total collapse of infrastructure (no water or heating, public transportation became non-existent) - people were just too weak from starvation to carry on normal activities - most were barely living. It makes for very despairing reading, but we must never forget the cruelty that Nazism brought to the people of the Soviet Union and the titanic struggle they waged to fight off the Nazi aggression.It would be nice to say that this book is eloquently written to capture this crucial period of history, but unfortunately the writing left much to be desired, as if an editor did not do the job properly. Most chapters have a surfeit of people introduced (at least 20 to 30) with little continuity from one to the other; some of whom disappear entirely or may spring up again 100 or 200 pages afterwards for another short paragraph. The military history can be rather dry - with the constant citing of division numbers. The chronology is confusing and goes back and forth in time; the taking of Mga by the Germans is mentioned on three different occasions. Statistics are over-used and add to the staleness. In a military or civilian operation the numbers are even broken down from the total by giving a sub-total of the number of Communist members taking part - what is the point of this?There is an overwhelming tendency when speaking of the civilian population of Leningrad to mention writers, musicians and the theatres they attended - as if everyone in Leningrad was a creative artist. The author remarks (on page 536 of my book) that in the springtime, after the long winter starvation, that in the \\"Writers House meals were once again served in the dining room by waitresses in neat uniforms\\". I am sure that the vast majority of survivors had no such treatment.The last half of the book is far better - and Mr. Salisbury acknowledges the sordidness of the Soviet system. Books were written on the siege, but never published or highly censored. A documentary film has never seen the light of day. Due to Soviet suppression many first-hand accounts of this painful period have disappeared forever.As the author states there has never, in the long history of human afflictions, been a siege as vicious and deliberate as this one; therein lies the importance of this book."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Not only have I read this novel (twice) I use it in a way to ensure that I no longer take life, in all its aspects good and bad for granted. The reviewer from NJ (top of this list) has missed the point entirely, this is not a book of military strategy, and &quot;the German perspective&quot; is well documented elsewhere. How often are we allowed entrance into the inner workings of the Russian experience. Salisbury respected the limitless sacrifice of the Russian people so much that he felt obligated to share it with the world, in a time when so many lived in feer for being sympathetic of the Soviets."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Harrison Salisbury's writing is similar to articles on Wikipedia. There were interesting and detailed descriptions; however, one shortly loses patience reading Army, Battalion, Regiment, Company, and Squad numbers, listing of equipment on hand, etc. The narrative is lacking any human emotion."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Outstanding.

Any one who has visted Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) or, who plans to visit, should read this book."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Yes, Salisbury is a journalist and not a historian - a good and valid point. However, I got more out of the book as a journalistic venture discussing the mistakes and horrors of &quot;the seige&quot; than I would have from reading a history on it per se.Salisbury does a remarkable job of humanizing a mythic and seminal event in the history of the USSR in all its grisly detail. Much has been made of the 900 days Leningraders suffered, earning it the accolade of &quot;Hero City&quot; by Stalin for its will to survive. Salisbury writes of the experience in a manner that allows the reader to empathize with the citizenry of Leningrad - something a historian would never do; however it is precisely this element that makes it such a remarkable book."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"The only thing that disappoints me about this work is that I took so long to find it. This author does a spectacular job of critical research while generating a work like a novel. The work is long but reads very quickly. The suffering of the Leningrad people is very much like the events of Greece after the Nazi occupation except there were no Italian troops to add some semblance of civility. Mr. Salisbury's insight into the '37-'39 purges adds a great deal of depth to the understanding of why Leningrad suffered as it did. I loved his captions of the lives of individuals during the seige. This, I believe make the effort as good as it is. Although first published in 1969, it is timely and well worth the money."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Like most casual history buffs, I had seen the relatively recent Hollywood movie about the siege of Leningrad/St. Petersburg and read briefer descriptions of the strategic importance of the Russian's hold-out there. But I had never read anything like this. To me the most interesting parts were the descriptions of the numerous blunders made in Moscow and on the ground in the city that created an even better opportunity for the Germans than they already had with their superior manpower and materiel. Plus the accounts of the Party politics that influenced the conduct of the battle were really interesting. I hope someone takes this work and the newly-available access to Soviet-era archives and updates these aspects of the story. If anyone knows of a book where this may have been done, I'd love to hear about it."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"I always hated history but this book is written like a novel. It is one of the very best I've ever read, especially when you consider it deals with a segment of WW II that few of us really knew about. It is extraordinarily well documented with facts to support every conclusion the author reaches.There are sections that are very tough to read, detailing what actually took place in Leningrad specially during that first winter of the war. These same sections are what prove that this tragedy can actually dwarf those at Hiroshima and the Warsaw ghetto.It has given me a much better respect for the Russian people who survived that horrible period - considering both the effort of the Germans to bomb and starve them as well as their own dictator and his cronies who were almost completely inept."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"The 900 Days, The Siege of Leningrad, Harrison Salisbury [1908-93]; Harper & Row (1969)The book title should be, \\"The 900 Pages.\\"The rampant redundancies in Weigley's \\"Eisenhower's Lieutenants\\" & Evans's \\"The Coming of the 3rd Reich\\" have kindred spirits in this disorganized fiasco.Salisbury is by far the better writer (no comparison). Yet all three authors achieved almost identical results - self-indulgent, interminable narratives that a reader will never want anything to do with again unless the indexes are useful to track down exact dates & isolated facts.What could have been a classic - it's a tremendous story - was, instead, ruined by Harper's refusal to pare the manuscript down to a manageable size. Throughout these 50 chapters, Salisbury methodically plods through the numerous successive catastrophes suffered by Soviet civilians, many of whom are profiled extensively during the account of the three-year ordeal. Also appearing are an extraordinary number of local & nationally-ranked Russian politicians. Their desperate efforts are also inexhaustibly chronicled.All of these people are introduced & their ordeals discussed. If they aren't killed by German shells or by starvation, they'll be back later. But for now, more & more new & newer people surface - commissars & poets, thieves & 2nd lieutenants, bread bakers & factory workers. Mr. Salisbury wants you to meet everyone.And woven into & around the above stories in almost all of the 50 chapters are the accounts of the dozens of battles between 1941-44, involving an almost infinite number of individual Soviet armies, corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, & battalions.There are an equally staggering number of German armies, corps, divisions, etc. Every time each military unit retreated ten miles, advanced fifteen, or just went to bed for the night, its full title - \\"1ST Battalion, 34th Regiment, 44th Division,\\" etc. is repeated in is entirety.The results aren't hard to anticipate.There is absolutely no way that 900D should have exceeded four hundred pages. Crammed with mind-numbing minutiae & incessant bottom-page footnotes (some of which actually continue on to the bottom third of the next page - jammed in front of another hefty footnote), it tops out (rather, topples over) at nearly six hundred pages.Maybe we'll luck out someday, with the publisher or an inheritor of the manuscript re-issuing a sensibly edited version of a story that deserved to be written succinctly, as well as passionately.Mr. Salisbury's obituary (NY Times, July 7, 1993) can be read via Wikipedia; drop down to the bottom of the page & hit the link.

It is today considered the definitive work on the siege of the Northern Palymyra \\"Leningrad (now know as St Petersburg)during World War II. Its author was Harrison E. Salisbury the late editor of The New York Times, Russian reporter and winner of the Pulitzer Prize.Leningrad had been founded as St. Petersburg by Peter the Great in 1703. It was Peter's western window located in the far northern region of his vast land. It was in 1917 that Lenin began the Bolshevist revolution in Leningrad (then called Petrograd). It was Russia's Paris known for its beautiful buildings and such artists as Dostoevski, Pushkin, Diagheliv and others. It was in Leningrad that Shoshtakovich would write his immortal Seventh Symphony during the long siege.The Nazis invaded Russia on June 22, 1941. Leningrad was surrounded by this invading army. The siege would not be lifted until January, 1943. In a city of over 3 million people in 1940 the city would see its numbers gradually reduced due to: aerial attacks by the Nazis, disease, starvation and battle. It is estimated that over 1 million persons died during the siege from September 1941 to January 1943. The citizens became starving wretches who had to eat wood pulp, seeds, family pets, wallpaper, leather and other unappetizing nourishment in order to continue to live.Leningrad was a city disliked by Stalin. After the war was over he shot many of the governmental leaders of Leningrad in what was called \\"The Purge of Leningrad.\\" The people of Leningrad are the heroes of this epic of human endurance and courage. They refused to surrender to the Nazis and kept their city alive even as they had to battle the cruel Stalin regime in Moscow. Stalin had once thought the best policy would be to destroy Leningrad by explosion and fire but this was not done. The Leningraders endured the longest siege of any major city in modern times. Their suffering was a crucifixion of body and soul. We affluent Americans can have no idea of the human misery endured by these hardy Russians of the greatest generation.Salisbury did extensive research in Russia talking to persons who had survived the siege. His book is a monument to the survival of a great city and a heroic people. Harrowing reading and a classic historical account."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"It's a long book, but worth reading. Most books about the Eastern Front are written from a German perspective, so it was refreshing to see the Russian side of the story (and what a side!). The last thing I would want to be would be a Soviet officer during that time! If the Nazis didn't shoot you, the Communists would!Overall a good book. It got dull at a few points, but the author keeps it interesting by blending stories and anecdotes told by people who were there.

That suffering is movingly chronicled by Salisbury.For individual stories he relies heavily on the accounts of writers and artists, for it was they who recorded events in the greatest detail and with a truth seldom found in the censored newspapers and military communiques.This skews the book towards human interest journalism. The description of military campaigns contains minute detail about numbers and dates, but no real picture of the on-the-ground strategy and operations of the armed forces.Well documented are the the Stalinist regime's myopic miscalculation of Hitler's intentions toward the Soviet Union, and the barbaric scapegoating of its own military leaders (usually shot for failure).Salisbury gives due credit to the people of Leningrad: the workers, soldiers, Party brigades, and volunteers who, threatened from without by the Nazis and from within by a paranoid and repressive state bureaucracy, kept alive the two-thirds of the population who survived the siege.The siege resulted in more fatalities than any other single event in human history.

This is one of many signals revealing his strange affection for a barbaric regime and his amateurish mishandling of the subject.

It is incredibly well written, both the background leading up to the atack as well as the hardships over the next 2+ years. The fortitude and heroism portrayed give a much better understanding of the Russian people and what they endured."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Few events in the annals of modern history compare to the saga of the terrifying siege of Leningrad for almost three years by the German Wehrmacht during World War Two. In this classic historical work, \\"The 900 Days\\" written by long-time New York Times correspondent and editor Harrison Salisbury, the incredible toll in terms of blood, sweat and tears of the millions of Russian protagonists trapped by the Nazis in the city is told. The story is told in such a graphic and moving fashion that the individuals involved are portrayed from a common sense, human perspective, in terms of describing breathing, struggling individuals locked into a living nightmare, each of them having to make a titanic effort day after day just to endure the hardships and survive.The scale of the siege itself boggles the mind; some three million residents and soldiers were encircled and entrapped at the beginning of the Nazi incursion into Russia in Operation Barbarossa, intensifying with a ruthless German offensive in early October of 1941 that literally strangled the lifeline for food and critical supplies from the embattled urban area. Of those trapped, almost half succumbed, and most of these fatalities were in a relatively brief period of time, commencing with the events of October 1941 and climaxing in early April of 1942. People starved, froze, drowned, were run over by tanks, walked into mine fields, succumbed to a wide range of diseases, were murdered by German soldiers, and sometimes were caught in artillery fire. In all, almost one and one half million people were lost during the siege.Yet in the midst of all this immense suffering and the degraded conditions that forced many to the brink of extinction, the people of Leningrad consistently fought back, fighting environmental conditions, temperatures that dipped below 30 degrees below zero, with no heat, no light, little or no food or water. Yet the fighting on the front went on, supported by the inhabitants, who did everything from digging ditches to helping to care for the wounded in the midst of their own daily struggles to survive. In this instance, they didn't merely endure; in fact they prevailed against incredible odds. In the final analysis, it was the German army that was destroyed.The scope of this achievement seems to be little appreciated today. And while Salisbury traces the causes in the tragedy of Leningrad in Stalin's sectarian governmental policies that ultimately played into Hitler's plans for capturing the city, he also describes the incredible contributions of a cross-section of the citizenry of the city, including artists, factory workers, soldiers, teachers, housewives, children, writers, and others engaged in the common daily struggle to survive without ever ceding the ground or the war to the foe. Even more impressive is his unflinching attention to detail, and his retelling of the final coup-de-grace delivered by Stalin, jealous and politically fearful of the genuine heroes made by the siege, who then arranged to charge, convict and execute all the principals of the city's campaign against the Germans based on trumped up charges of treason. This was one of the first books to deal with the levels of Soviet suffering and contribution to the war effort, and it has been praised quite consistently by readers and critics alike. I can recommend this book without reservation.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"This is still the definitive work about the human tragedy of the Blockade of Leningrad. The background and military strategy are interesting and important, but the chronicle of the civilian suffering is gut-wrenching and unforgetable. It's been more than a dozen years since I read this, but certain scenes still remain with me: The diary of a little girl whose entire family starved to death. The heroic Young Pioneers and Komsomols hauling water by hand from the frozen Neva to the bakeries. The meager rations of the &quot;bread&quot;, baked from sawdust and nearly undigestable. The poet who made a &quot;meat jelly&quot; from her neighbor's leather briefcase. The elderly man who was driven by starvation to eat his beloved pet cat, then afterward hanged himself in his home. The dead, frozen in their beds where they lay and in the streets where they fell, pulled on children's sleds by emaciated relatives, stacked like logs at the cemetery gate, where the ground was too frozen to dig. The silent, cold-eyed &quot;cannibals&quot; in the market selling the ubiquitous ground-meat patties which buyers hoped were dog, rat, or horsemeat. The desperate and dangerous Road of Life over the frozen Lake Ladoga, established and traveled under fire... Only the extraordinary endurance and efforts of the citizens saved Leningrad. Hitler's plan was to erradicate the city and its people. Stalin was perfectly willing to sacrifice them. St. Petersburg still bears the scars from the seige that lasted nearly three years. &quot;Let no one forget. Let nothing be forgotten.&quot; Ironically, the human tragedy appears to be repeating itself today in Grozny."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"I wasn't nearly so impressed by this work as I had expected and hoped to be. The theme is extraordinary, the two great Western totalitarian powers square off over the fate of a city of enormous historical significance (it was the seat of the Russian Revolution) and geographical significance (it was either the first or last Western city depending on which direction you're facing).The book might better have been titled &quot;Scenes from 900 Days&quot; and if it were titled that or, better, written with the intention of being that, it might have been a great book. But the book aspired to be history and, because of that, it ought to have been more coherent. The reader gets a lot of the deprivation and misery among the ever dwindling Leningrad residents. And, in describing that, Salisbury is at his best. His descriptions are passionate and human without being mawkish. However, the military element of the siege (an important part -- if the Germans hadn't brought guns and artillery and all the other accoutrements of war along, the situation would have been more than just a littledifferent) is badly handled. We know that, at times, the Germans and Russians fought in places like Mga, but Salisbury rarely makes it clear why or how. The geography of the region remains a complete mystery. The two included maps were of little help and Salisbury wasn't particularly interested in describing the area or the significance of particular geographical features. There is precious little description of combat and either none or almost none of battlefields, strategies, tactics, and the like. The manner in which the Germans laid the siege is all but absent, so it becomes virtually impossible to figure out how the Russians would have or could have lifted it.Moreover, he explains that Stalinist-era Soviet incompetence, mendacity, and villainy exacerbated or even caused much of the Leningraders' suffering, but he never demonstrates how. It might, for example, have been nice to know exactly how food and basic supplies were received and distributed among Leningraders, what the exact policies were, what the bureaucracy charged with that task was like and how it behaved, but all that is left vague. I got to know that Leningraders were given increasingly austere rations on which to survive, but that's about all. The political and social structure of the city is likewise left vague. We are apprised of the political tensions among the ambitious political elites of the USSR, but the treatment is too superficial.His characters (and he draws too much on the experience of a group of writers, presumably because they were the people to whom he had access) are often flat and uninteresting. True, the historian doesn't always have the luxury of being able to play psychologist, but Salisbury rarely even seemed to make the attempt. Some of the players (Stalin, Andrei Zhdanov, and Marshal Zhukov) are well-enough known people that he could have provided a decent amount of insight into them and their motivations (history without some psychology tends to be about as interesting and as morally useful as literature without character development), and occasionally he did. The treatment of Beria and Malenkov is decent in this respect.There are, to be sure, some well-written and engaging scenes. Salisbury has the journalist's flair of not being boring (but seldom rises above that level of high competence). The sections on the construction of the supply-railroad across Lake Lagoda is extremely good. As is his discussion of canibalism. The problem is that if his virtues are those of a journalist, so are his shortcomings. Too much of the book reads like news items or human interest stories. His eye is permanently fixed on the sorts of details that people would have wanted or needed to know immediately during the war (he has a fondness for describing with mathematical precision the amount of food each Leningrader got at certain points and the bureaucratic designations of military outfits -- the 291st infantry or whatever). And the historian needs details to be sure, he just needs better ones than these.To be fair, the Soviet Union was a closed society and information about the siege must have been limited, both by official bureaucratic means and because, owing to the inculcation of contrary values and natural selection, candor ceased to be an attribute of the Russian character, if it ever was. Salisbury might have done the best he could with the limited resources he had. But that doesn't mean the book ought to be judged differently.And it certainly wouldn't have been possible to provide every significant aspect of the siege in full detail (that seems to have become a virtual mantra among historians and history students). Still, he could have done a better job of picking the most important aspects and describing them in as much detail as he had time for. I honestly wish I could have liked the book better. It's about an important part of 20th centory history by a writer who strikes me (from this one encounter) as perfectly decent and likable. Sadly, that wasn't an option. He deserves credit for taking on such an ambitious project, and the book is worth reading if for no other reason than it describes such an important and awesome period in history (hence my giving it three stars -- it was certainly an above average book), but the final product was too uneven to be as great as one would hope it would be."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Straight up, the Siege of Leningrad lasted either 872 or 880 days, depending on whether you begin the count from the German capture of Mga or Shlissel'burg, not 900 days. I guess \\"The 880 Days\\" didn't sound so good as a book title, but in any case, deliberately mis-labeling a historical event is not a good way to write a history of that event. Harrison E. Salisbury's The 900 Days was a sensation when it first appeared in the West in 1969 since it was really the first major book in English that covered the epic siege of Leningrad in any detail. Furthermore, compared to the white-washed Soviet histories of the Great Patriotic War which attempted to conceal that over one million civilians died in Leningrad during the siege, Salisbury's book was brutally frank and honest. I remember reading this book in the early 1970s and considered it quite good. However, The 900 Days has not aged well and now nearly forty years after it first appeared, the value of this book has been reduced by over-reliance on too narrow a source base and the author's acceptance of Soviet-era falsehoods. When I re-read this book recently, I saw a journalistic account that is riddled in places with factual inaccuracies or mistakes, some of which it is clear that the author never bothered to check. Also, The 900 Days, like David Glantz's more recent books on Leningrad only focuses on the Soviet perspective, while failing to address the German or Finnish sides in any detail. Furthermore, the book really only covers the first year of the siege in any depth; the remaining two years are glossed over quickly in the final chapter. Nevertheless, The 900 Days is very well written in parts and it remains a \`classic' in conveying the suffering endured by the people of Leningrad. Yet given its limitations, the book should now be viewed as an introduction to the siege, rather than a definitive history.The 900 Days is divided into five parts. Part I, \\"The Night Without End,\\" should have been called \\"the introduction without end,\\" because the author spends an interminable 130 pages - nearly a quarter of the book - describing events before the German invasion. It is particularly annoying in the manner in which the author describes how a host of minor characters heard about rumors of war approaching and his depiction of Leningrad as a sun-filled \`paradise' with women wearing diamonds and children eating ice-cream. No Stalinist-repression or Gulags here, please. Everything was happy, happy before the war. Part II, \\"The Summer War,\\" comprises about 140 pages and is easily the best section in the book, detailing the German advance toward Leningrad and the desperate Soviet measures to erect hasty defenses. The role of Leningrad Party boss Andrei Zhdanov is particularly well covered (he had already been exorcised from post-war Soviet histories, so Salisbury's account may remain the definitive one on this character) and Salisbury is at pains to point out that Zhukov's brief role at Leningrad was less vital that the standard \\"the General-who-never-lost-a-battle\\" histories depict. Salisbury does mention German plans and actions from time to time, but mostly at high-level. Soviet units and some commanders are mentioned - the role of engineer Bychevsky is interesting - but there are very few front-line accounts. There are a significant number of factual errors - such as the frequent claim that the German paratroopers were frequently used in airborne drops in this sector (there were frequent rumors of this in July-August 1941 because of the German airborne attack on Crete in May 1941, but the author failed to \`weed out' wartime rumors), that entire German units were destroyed, etc. He claims that the German commander for Leningrad was going to be \\"SS General Knut\\" when there was no such officer in the Wehrmacht or SS. At least Salisbury admits - unlike Soviet sources - that it isn't clear why the Germans failed to continue the offensive in September 1941 when Leningrad's defenses were crumbling.Part III, \\"Leningrad in Blockade,\\" covers the German encirclement of the city and also is well written, although marred by a number of factual errors. Part IV, \\"The Longest Winter,\\" is really the heart of the book and this is the section that most readers will remember, with all its somber details about a civilian population starving to death en masse. The final section, \\"Breaking the Iron Ring,\\" is only 50 pages long and covers the period summer 1942 to January 1944 in a twinkling (and skips over several Soviet disastrous offensives on the Volkhov). By this point, the author appeared to be running out of steam (or sources) and events are described briskly. In conclusion, the author estimates that one million or more civilians died in Leningrad during the siege, marking it as one of the most horrific experiences ever inflicted on a city(comparing it to Hiroshima and the 1870 siege of Paris).First and foremost, The 900 Days is a journalistic account and the author has a predilection for \`human interest' type anecdotes over narrative history, although some is provided. The author's focus on a group of Soviet \`poets' (it seems like every other person is described as a poet) and \`intellectuals' continues ad naseum throughout the book, but the author neglects that most of these favored \`peacocks' were approved by the party (while other writers went to the Gulag). All in all, the 900 Days remains a classic of sorts and it remains the best depiction of the human tragedy in Leningrad, but as more historical material comes to light, its failings are becoming more evident with time."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Having adopted two children from St. Petersburg orphanages and having twice visited the city in the past three years, I read this book from the perspective of an adoptive parent trying to gain a better understanding of the society and city my children came from. I was not disappointed. This well researched book tells the nearly forgotten tragic story of the people of Leningrad during what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War (WWII). It begins in great detail explaining Stalin's blunders before the war, which nearly allowed the Nazis to win a swift and easy victory. The bulk of the book of course recounts the stories of how a people, almost abandoned by its own country, coped with one of the most savage sieges of history. Finally, the book tells of the sad fate of many of the heroic survivors. The book does not try to tell the German perspective nor should it. By telling the stories of the victims we are more easily reminded of the horror of war and are less inclined to glorify aggression. The theme rather is taken from Leningrad poet, Olga Berggolts , &quot;Let no one forget, let nothing be forgotten.&quot; For those of us not used to Russian names, places or war heroes, it can be difficult to keep track of how the war and the siege are progressing in the book. Poets, writers, composers and artists may seem a bit over represented in the book, but the reader should remember that since the book is non-fiction, the author had to rely on real accounts of what happened. These accounts are much more likely to have been written about the more famous. On the other hand, having been to St. Petersburg, it's hard to find someone there who is not at least a poet, writer, composer or artist at heart. So the author might have the right mix of artist/not artist accounts in the book after all."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Salisbury gave us a monumental work of history: not just in scope, but in depth. This is a book which entwines the epic story with the human story, basing both on the kind of scholarship too few writers are dedicated enough to accomplish. I wrote a well-received history on the early satellites (The First Space Race, Texas A&M;, 2004) which I was proud of, but I can't resist the feeling that Salisbury did as much research for every chapter as I did for an entire book.As always with a well-written history, there are lessons which are important for our own times. The most striking example comes at the beginning of the book, where the reader learns the German invasion of Russia was anything but the complete surprise Russan leaders claimed it was. The German preperations were too large to hide, and all kinds of intelligence, even exact dates, made it into the briefings given to the Russian leadership. But Stalin had his own view of the way things were, and anything to the contrary was ignored or disparaged. The Russians were also victimized by a system in which initiative was dangerous: military and civilian officials who read the tea leaves and tried to take some preparatory action on their own were slapped down. Salisbury shows us, in sometimes-agonizing detail, how these factors resulted in what may have been the most brutal, dehumanizing, and costly battle in history. I agree with some other reviewers that more maps and photographs would be useful, but that's a minor quibble.This book is a breathtaking achivement."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Read this book by all means, but don't buy this edition. The print quality is awful...the text, photos and maps are blurry."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Reading the great new WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory&quot; triggered in me an interest in World War II, especially the fighting on the Eastern Front. I asked around and was told Salisbury's &quot;900 Days&quot; was one of the best accounts of the Leningrad fighting, and after reading it agree, with the slight complaint that it concentrates almost wholly on the situation inside the besieged city. It is more a story of the citizenry of Leningrad and their ordeal than in the military aspects of the siege."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"If \\"war is hell,\\" as General Sherman said, then at the innermost circle of hell you'll find the 900-day siege of Leningrad (now renamed St. Petersburg). It was, by all accounts, the deadliest battle in human history. More than 300,000 Soviet soldiers perished, plus uncounted thousands of Germans. Inside the blockade zone, an estimated 1.2 million civilians slowly starved to death as Hitler and Stalin used the city like a giant chess piece on the Eastern Front.The late Harrison Salisbury captured this epic struggle better than anyone else in \\"The 900 Days,\\" a book every student of 20th century history should read at least once. He begins the story with Leningrad at peace during the balmy \\"white nights\\" of June 1941. Culture is flourishing throughout the city. Composers, writers, musicians and artists are busy at work. Families are vacationing on the Baltic coast. Meanwhile, Stalin and his minions are in a massive state of denial about the coming Nazi assault, despite dozens of warnings and signs.After the first few fascinating chapters, \\"The 900 Days\\" can be slow going as Salisbury details the military intrigue and paranoia that decimated the Soviet leadership in the years leading up to the siege, which yielded tragic consequences for Russian defenses in 1941 and 1942. If you're primarily interested in the human side of the story, skip to Part IV on page 393.The emotional core of this book is the immense civilian catastrophe that took place during the 2.5 year siege. Despite heroic attempts by local citizens and Young Communist brigades, the city became a slow-motion killing zone without nearly enough food, fuel or even fresh water to sustain the population. People resorted to the most desperate and barbaric measures to stay alive. (Warning: Not for children or the squeamish.) Compassion and brutality roamed the streets simultaneously.Ultimately, the siege was broken in January 1944, but not before Leningrad was largely destroyed. Stalin gets much of the blame for failing to evacuate more civilians earlier on. But the real lesson of \\"The 900 Days\\" is that human suffering has no limit in times of war. Let's not forget that before we start another one.Final note: This book is relatively short on maps, photos and diagrams. Some courageous publisher should republish the book with a complete set of photos from the period, many of which are available at the St. Petersburg library."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"The first part of the book is fantastic in its description of the time leading up to Barbarossa, the simple shock the Soviets had and the almost refusal to believe by Stalin.The first half of the book I would give 5 stars. The detail is almost overwhelming. If one is not familiar with cyrilic and has at least a rough grasp of the Russian language, it is very difficult to keep all the names of generals, party officials, and city administrators separated. A few more maps would have been better, to help the reader get a better grasp of the situation described. I constantly found myslef going back to the maps at the beginning, trying to figure out specifics, and giving up because many of the places mentioned in the text were not on the map. However, the portrayal of the Soviet military structure is vivid and gives one a good image of what happened. The description of the Tallinn disaster was exceptionally good. The first half resembles the 25 years he spent researching the events.The second half of the book is lacking. The description of the starvation is very gruesome and disturbing, which is accurate historically. The timeline, which is fairly orderly at the beginning, takes a nose dive about half way through. Here, it seems that Salisbary was finding new information as he wrote the book, and including it. Therefore, events are presented in random order. Then the book just stops, and says that the city was still in blockade and then the war was over.Some of the other reviewers have accurately described the over emphasis on the plight of writers, poets, and playwrights. The ordinary citizen is not represented, nor is the average soldier given adequate attention.The German side of the engagement is almost non-existant. Beevor's book on Stalingrad is much better at describing the events. But as for Leningrad, Salisbary's book is still the best I have read on the subject."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"Readers will find a detailed depiction of the Seige of Leningrad from a Russian point of view. Very few references are from a German standpoint.The book describes the view from a military, political and societal perspective and it relates to the 900 day siege.Russia was not the backward country that the west percieved it to be. It was far advanced in many ways in terms of the arts, science, and even militarily.The reason for Russia's defeats in the first years of the war lay in the lack of organization and leadership. Russia was a sleeping giant who did not even realise it's true potential until it was invaded in June 1941. The Nazi's soon realized the vast expanse of the land and hardiness of the Russian people.One German soldier commented that, \\"How can we defeat an enemy who can exist at a level no better than their livestock\\". This quote described perfectly a nation that would sacrifice 30 million of its people out of a population of 200 million to defeat Hitler and the Nazi's.The book allows you to place yourself in the position of a person living in Leningrad during the siege. You can almost feel the cold of the winters and the hunger brought on by starvation.It is a must read for anyone interested in World War II on the Eastern Front."},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"I like that it is a very factual account but at times I got lost in the detail.

First it is amazing how Stalin misread Hitler's intentions towards the Soviets during the Nazi-Soviet pact. Because of his fear of giving the Nazis an excuse for breaking the pact, Stalin did not allow any defensive measures to be taken and even had some officers shot for carrying out defensive preparations. The Soviets even had orders not to return fire from any Nazi forces be they air intrusions or attacks or ground shelling or shots, and as a result of taking any of these measures there was a firing squad waiting. When the war finally really did break out, Stalin sort of disappeared for about a month as, I imagine, he struggled with his sanity in face of his obvious deadly misconception. But rather than confronting Stalin, the men close to him covered for him and , ironically, when he finally came out of his retreat a mix of Russian chauvanism and Stalin's own \\"cult of the personality\\" probably brought the forces together that were necessary to put up a defense and later an offense. But during these terrible times there were cultural voices and gov't policy that spent much time and resources to protect everything of cultural value including the Heritage Museum collection. A wonderful demonstration of the dedication to preservation of culture on an equal basis as the dedication to the military destruction of Nazism,"},{"Title":"The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad","review":"I have not as yet read the book though am looking forward to it.

On a hot Mississippi day, a young African-American girl walks into town and stops at a drinking fountain to get a drink. She sees a \\"Whites Only\\" sign on the drinking fountain and misinterprets the meaning of the sign. She innocently thinks the sign must mean \\"White Socks Only\\", so she takes off her black, Sunday best shoes and steps up to the fountain wearing her clean white socks. Suddenly, an angry white man pushes her to the ground. Soon other African-Americans gather around the fountain. To show their support and understanding of the child's innocent mistake, one by one they also take off their shoes and step up to get a drink with red, yellow, or blue socks. She is rescued by the \\"Chicken Man,\\" who has very unusual powers.This book deals with the issue of racism in a way that young children can relate to and understand because it makes the idea of judging people by the color of their skin almost as foolish as judging people by the color of their socks. I read this book to my fifth grade class and it generated some wonderful discussions about racism, and treating others with respect and kindness regardless of who they are, where they live, the color of their skin, or what clothes they wear. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"White Socks Only","review":"I read this book to my children and they loved it. Even at their ages - 7 and 8 - they clearly understood the irony of the title. This story gives children a front-row view of how ugly prejudice is, but does so in a gentle enough manner that it is appropriate for young ones."},{"Title":"White Socks Only","review":"The book, in an attempt to teach children about the injustice of prejudice, actually trivializes it. A little girl wanders into the busy downtown area of a segrgated southern city apparently oblivious to the danger around her. She mistakes a \\"Whites Only\\" sign on a public fountain as a direction to wear only white socks while drinking. A white townsman is very angred by this and a confrontation ensues. What I found disturbing about the story was the amount of violence against a little African American girl at the hands of a caucasian adult male and the African American adults who come to her aid. The white man is shown to \\"whup\\" the child and all of the adults none of whom seen willing or able to defend themselves. Given that there is no mention of the role of non-violent resistance in the Civil Rights movement, the African American adults simply appear helpless or worse witless. The day is saved when a \\"magic\\" man comes along and points at the white man and begins to whisper incantations. The white man runs away for fear and the whites only sign comes down forever. At the end of the book there is an illustration of a Chicken wearing a bandana like the one the white man was wearing. What is the messege here? That African Americans were passive? That they failed to teach their children about the dangers of the segrgated south? That they fought injustice with magic? If you want to teach children about the foolishness of prejudice, I suggest \\"The Story of Ruby Bridges\\" which focuses on courage,faith and determination."},{"Title":"White Socks Only","review":"I use this book in the many classrooms I am in during Black History month.

Also, I think that anybody reading the book will find the story of a little girl confronting segregation with her white socks compelling. Yet, young children might not understand why her actions were a problem, the book does not gives an explanation of why many would have considered the little girl's actions an act of adulteration."},{"Title":"White Socks Only","review":"I have been wanting this book for a long time.

This book is for ages five to ten and, grades two to six. People who also like reading about segregation should read this book.

He is very clear on that. It's apparently not nice to intentionally manipulate people, as long as you can get them to do what you want without such nefarious methods and intent. There's apparently a subtle shade of difference there!There are several very funny, professionally drawn cartoons in the book, as well as aphorisms, quotes and witty sayings on about every other page, in large bold type which help to illustrate his thoughts. They are almost worth the price of the book all by themselves.The meat of the book is advice on how to motivate yourself and others, and to change opinions and attitudes from those with which you disagree (negative thoughts) to those more in line with your own opinions and desires (positive, reasonable, healthy thoughts).Mr. Arthur is a motivational speaker and consultant who works with people who &quot;want to master the mysteries of the mind and companies that want jungle medicine for the corporate soul.&quot;Through the book, it is apparent that he also hopes to merchandise his motivational videos and other books on the same subject matter.This is a small (145 page) hardcover book with large, easy to read type. If you are interested in this kind of subject matter it would probably be money well spent. At my age, simply awaking every morning is a major accomplishment. Changing the world is no longer one of my primary interests.It's a good little book.Joseph H.

Truman: His Life and Times","review":"Brian Burnes new book on Harry Truman is a pleasure, impeccably researched and extremely well written. Rather than piling detail upon detail, Burnes opts for well-chosen anecdotes that add up to Truman's full story: his Kansas City boyhood, World War I service, political rise, presidency , and later years back in Kansas City. Truman is remembered for his momentous decision to drop the atomic bomb, but this book also delves into less-known aspects of his presidency. For example, Burnes recounts a wonderful episode involving an old poker buddy named Eddie Jacobson who, in 1948, helped convice Truman that the U.S. should recognize the brand new state of Israel.Throughout, Burnes does a masterful job of interweaving the story of Truman, the politician, with humanizing details about Truman, the man. While attending the Potsdam conference in 1945, for example, Truman purchased a luncheon set of Belgian lace for Bess. The first lady, in turn, thought the gift a bit extravagant. This book also has wonderful photographs and illustrations, including a Thomas Hart Benton portrait of Truman so closely observed and revelatory that it's worth a thousand words, easily."},{"Title":"Pulpit and press","review":"I love having these Kindle editions available.

The immigrants we learned about were from Europe and most of them settled on the East Coast. I was fascinated by these people who were so brave or desperate (or both) that they would abandon their homes, most likely forever, and start all over again in a new country where many of them didn't know anyone, or know how they'd support themselves. It was a terrific gamble but they came in droves. They still do.While Las Vegas isn't known as a destination for immigrants, it has a population as diverse as Los Angeles or New York. How did this happen? The Peoples of Las Vegas, an anthology about some of the groups that populate Las Vegas, takes on this question. Essay by essay, it becomes clear.We start by learning about the Southern Paiutes, the tribe that lived in Las Vegas before it was Las Vegas. Although the lessons in school about the Native Americans didn't hold my interest like the stories about the immigrants did, I found it eye-opening to read about how the Paiutes were captured and sold as slaves to the first European settlers by the Utes, who also lived in the Southwest. Like so many other Native Americans, they ended up on reservations in undesirable conditions, and in recent years have found some success by building and running a casino on their land. It's easy to see how Indian casinos in states without legal gambling are be a goldmine, but I was surprised to discover that the Paiutes' casino was also quite profitable, even so near Las Vegas.Chapters on the Mexicans and the Chinese tell stories of hard work and assimilation. African Americans had to deal with segregation until 1960. We Westerners are often surprised to learn that there was segregation here as well, not just in the South. But while segregation was still the law until 1964, the casinos and hotels ignored the law when it no longer suited them. In other words, it was starting to affect their profits, and had to go whether the lawmakers were ready for desegregation or not. The lawmakers eventually followed the lead of the casinos, something that still holds true in Las Vegas.The chapters on the Italians and the Jews go over familiar ground, since these groups pretty much made Las Vegas the gambling town it is and the stories of gangsters and ruthless businessmen have been told many times. I skimmed these chapters quickly, because it's the underdog aspect of the immigrant stories that always appealed to me. Italian and Jewish immigrants were certainly underdogs in many parts of America, but not in Las Vegas.Las Vegas is not typical (when is it ever?) when it comes to immigrants. For instance, few immigrants make Las Vegas their first U.S. home. Most settle elsewhere and then move to Las Vegas when they learn about the many opportunities it has to offer people who have little education or job skills and who may not yet speak English, but who are willing to work hard. A significant, if small, percentage of newcomers to Las Vegas are refugees from places like Bosnia and Sudan who settle wherever the government and the aid agencies tell them to. Imagine the double dose of culture shock that any refugee would get from being plopped down in Las Vegas.Another atypical aspect of immigrant life in Las Vegas is that there are very few ethnic neighborhoods or geographic concentrations of nationalities, other than the African-American \\"West Side\\" (which, as a result of Las Vegas spreading out in all directions over the years, is more accurately the North Central Side.)Essays about immigrants from Greece, Croatia, Poland, the Indian Subcontinent, El Salvador, Chile, and the Philippines round out the collection. The editors are hoping this will be the first edition of a series that explores the stories of many more of the groups that are populating Las Vegas. Although The Peoples of Las Vegas is a university press publication, written mostly by professors and academics, it is quite readable. Many of the authors are members or descendants of the groups they write about, so there is a personal touch to the writing that is engaging. I can't wait for the second edition!"},{"Title":"What is Faith?","review":"I own a first edition of this book. I have read it and referred to it often. It is in my opinion a definitive treatment of the subject of what faith is in the context of THE faith once for all delivered to the saints. Machen writes with theological and practical acumen. His analysis of the Biblical passages referred to are handled with clarity and precision. Yet, this book is surprisingly easy to read. What Is Faith is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who doubts or who is challenged by the unbelief of the present hour. Only the Bible itself can gender faith. But, Machen's work on the subject of faith will assist the wavering, the searching or the believingly challenged individual to rest in the facts of Scripture as the foundation for Faith and thereby entering into peace."},{"Title":"What is Faith?","review":"In What Is Faith?, J. Gresham Machen seeks to define the role, nature, and object of the historic Christian faith, as set against that of the contemporary liberal theology of his day. Machen's view was that the liberal versions of faith were not really versions of Christianity at all; they were simply various forms of unbelief. Here is a description of this book by the author himself:&quot;In What Is Faith?, 1925, I tried to combat the anti-intellectualism of the Modernist church--the false separation which is set up between faith and knowledge--and to present the New Testament teaching as to what faith is. That endeavor involved necessarily some treatment of the object of faith, so that the little book contains a brief and summary treatment of considerable portions of Christian doctrine.&quot;"},{"Title":"What is Faith?","review":"In the introduction to this text, J. Gresham Machen discusses the need to know things, to know facts, to know view points, before someone can think. A person cannot make educated conclusions without being educated. One cannot form ideas or arguments unless one knows the details that help formulate the thought or the arguments of other individual. Upon what study, what exploration does someone come to a conclusion. One must be able to discern between one's own conclusion, another person's conclusion, and absolute truth. Ideas are formed through emotion, cliche arguments, and utility. It is easy to come to a conclusion devoid of any understanding of the facts or arguments made.One can use vague references to Christian understanding and come up with a theology of sorts that conflicts with the Bible. Do the facts and arguments stated in the Bible used in the formulation of the person's thinking. What the person believes. Yes what the person has Faith in.What is Faith? I have faith in the person of Jesus Christ. Your Faith is summed up in a creed. What is the object of your Faith. If you say Jesus Christ, is your Faith consistent with the facts stated in the Bible and arguments contained in scripture? Do you choose to ignore what is written in the Bible. How do you perceive God's immanence? Is God the whole, is God the whole of the created, or does God exist external to all created, but perceives all and knows all and controls all? Man needs revelation from God to know absolute truth. God's creation is made up of infinite parts, but God does not make up the whole. He exist independently.J. Gresham Machen makes a distinction between Faith in the Father and Faith in the Son. To know each person of the Godhead and how it relates to you. As a created being that has rebelled against the will of God. One who needs a to be reconciled to the Father through the action of the Son. To believe in the Son and repent for ones sins. To Believe what Jesus taught. To believe man is condemned to hell unless he repents. This is what Jesus taught and what is recorded in the Bible. In the book is a long discussion how modern theologians attempt to avoid this fact. Also is a size-able discussion about Justification, atonement, distinction between works that come forth because of Faith and the incorrect concept that works that aid in a persons salvation (the Books argument). Jesus came to die die so you would not have to pay the consequences of sin. J. Gresham Machen goes through extensive arguments with his postmodern critics."},{"Title":"What is Faith?","review":"An excellent presentation of the Orthodox Christian Faith, something that is becoming a rare comodity in this age of Apostacy, an age were many just want their ears tickled instead of hearing God's Word of truth."},{"Title":"What is Faith?","review":"Faith is confusing to many but Machen spells it out in detail and you come away seeing what Faith is really about.

Asimov demonstrates that if the rich would lose too much luxury and wealth in order to save a doomed planet, than too bad for the millions of inhabitants. It's a very similar theme to what we are currently undergoing on our own world."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"This early Isaac Asimov novel is set in the same \\"Universe\\" as Asimov's Foundation series, and is one of a group of early Asimov novels often referred to as the \\"Empire\\" series. It is set somewhat prior to the establishment of the Galactic Empire--Trantor's Republic consists of over one million star systems, and the Empire is now in sight, but there are still independent star systems and stellar groups that Trantor has not yet assimilated.This story is set on the planet Florina, which is harshly ruled by the nearby planet Sark. Florina, alone in the Galaxy, produces Kyrt, which is a fabric with fabulous qualities and which makes Florina the key to great wealth for its Sarkian overlords. No one knows why only Florina can produce Kyrt, and the reason for this contains the doom of Florina. More would be telling; no spoilers here.This is quite a serviceable story, which has aged well despite certain anachronisms. I first read it as a teenager, and after picking it up after a delay of nearly 35 years I still enjoyed the book. This is not always true when revisiting books one enjoyed as a youth.Asimov was a giant of science fiction, and with his passing it is good to see that his stories are being republished and that they will be available for future generations of readers. This one is very recommended, and I rate it 3 stars only because so many of Asimov's other works are even better than this one."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"When a man known only as Rik finds himself on the planet of Florina, he has no memory of his past and little hope for the future. He knows only that he is destined to work in the fields, growing the wondrous kyrt plant that is found only on Florina and is therefore a highly valued commodity across the galaxy. But with the help of a kind and loyal local woman, Rik manages to rediscover his own identity and help free the Florinians from the domination of the Squires of Sark, who have been exploiting Florina for its kyrt crop.The second book in the Galactic Empire trilogy, Currents of Space will not fail to satisfy fans of Isaac Asimov's famed brand of hard SF/space opera. The GE trilogy takes place in the era before Asimov's classic Foundation books, when the empire of Trantor does not yet control the entire Galaxy. Asimov's speculations about carbon currents, which are at the center of the plot, are no longer tenable after 50 years, but it doesn't matter. Currents is solid, exciting, old-fashioned SF that is hard to beat."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The Currents of Space is the second of Isaac Asimov's Empire novels, the first one being The Stars, Like Dust, and the final one being Pebble In The Sky. The Empire books fill the chronological gap between his Robot book and his Foundation books, all of which intertwine together to form a very long and convoluted fictional universe (this is ignoring the books set in this universe that were written by other authors.)Sound confusing? It is; but don't let that worry you. Although the books are best read in sequence, they all work fine on their own as well, outside of the larger universe in which they are set, and they will serve the reader just fine, if he or she elects to pick and choose, though they will be missing a lot. I have no doubt that, after reading any one of the books, any reader will want to read all of them, owing to their high level of quality.This particular novel is a fast-moving, suspenseful, science fiction/mystery/adventure romp. Improving upon the previous Empire novel, Asimov here wrote a very tight, smooth book that is very entertaining to read and can be enjoyed by almost anyone, whether they are a fan of science fiction or not. Like most of Asimov's novels, the book, though ostensibly science fiction, has the basic structure and feel of a mystery novel. Not surprisingly, then, his novels, though always scientifically literate and full of interesting scientific ideas, not to mention eminently worthy political and philosophical concepts, have a generally wide appeal. This is one of the reasons that Asimov is one of the most well-known and perennially popular of all science fiction writers: many of his novels feature a mainstream appeal that is atypical for the genre. His books are also invariably well-written and deserving of their large readership. The Currents of Space is no exception. Here Asimov displays his immense plotting talents, which would come to full fruition in his later works, weaving an interesting and complex web of mystery, intrigue, and suspense. He writes a solid, tight story that will keep the reader interested and entertained -- not to mention on his or her toes -- all the way through. It also makes very clear one of the most admirable traits of Dr. Asimov's: his love of peace. This book, like the later Foundation stories, features practical, sensible political solutions as an alternative to war. One cannot help but admire the good doctor for not using his premise of a futuristic world and technology as an excuse to fill his pages with senseless interstellar wars, as many science fiction writers, even the great ones, often do.This is a book that any fan of Asimov will definitely want to read. That said, although it is a definite improvement on its prequel, this is not on the same level as some of the author's later and better-known work: though it is a solid story, well-told, it lacks, for the most part, the extra layer of deeper meaning that much of his later work would contain. It is for this reason that I give the work four stars. It is a bloody shame that the entire Empire series is no longer in print: they are a worthy series of books and fill in an important chronological niche in the Asimovian universe. Pick it up if you can find it."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's great Science Fiction works remain out of print.

I enjoy Asimov stories and General Sci Fi books. I'll be back for more."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"It's actually nice to finally be able to read this novel. I bought the darn thing probably around fifteen years ago when I was a teenager and on an Asimov kick. What I didn't realize at the time was that it was the only novel in the Empire series in print. Being slightly picky about such things (and probably not totally realizing that the novels aren't all that related) I tried to order the other two, failed, and then put this volume aside for quite some time. Eventually due to the magic of the Internet, I was able to find used copies of the other two and I was able to satisfy my strange urge to read them all in a row.Was it worth it? Actually, it was. I'm glad that I read it after the first two volumes because there's such an uptick in . . . I won't say \\"quality\\" because all three are decent but however you want to quantify the elusive factor known as \\"knowing what you're doing.\\" Inspiration, maybe? That could be it. This one feels more inspired.After a beginning where a scientist predicts that a planet will be destroyed to someone who not only openly scoffs but then proceeds to drug and mindwipe the poor guy, we're shifted to the world of Florina, ruled by Sark. Upon arriving we discover worker Rik, who was mysteriously found in a field a year ago knowing little more than a baby did and slowly putting himself back together and learning basic skills. Until more than basic science skills come back to him, kicking off a search that threatens to drag every conceivable faction into the mess.Of all the Empire novels, this one shows off Asimov's sometimes underrated skill at building intensity, something that we only really saw in the early Robot novels. Far from being bound to acting like a SF novel, at times it seems more like a political thriller with SF trappings as everyone seeks to gain the upper hand by finding out who knows what and when, and more importantly, what they don't know. Meanwhile Rik is caught in events without having much idea how he even got involved in this stuff in the first place. A vast stretch of the novel doesn't even involve him, as the faction on Sark and the agents from Trantor all vie to intimidate each other and figure out who the mole might be, almost like Asimov had gotten bored with good ol' Rik (who isn't much of a character beyond the amnesiac scientist type). In fact, when the novel isn't ignoring Rik, it's looking at the Townsman as he goes on a minor killing spree as he tries to evade the authorities, coming as close as Asimov ever did to that slippery beast he called \\"action.\\" His quirk of staking anything that might quicken your pulse in the periphery is already in full force, with killings being described after the fact, or in such clinical brushed off detail that a friend of a friend of a friend might as well be telling you about it. It becomes maddening after a while, especially when you're waiting for a fight scene to break up all the people talking at each other and the book decides to give you more people talking about the fight scene you just missed. Gah.But his footing is surer here than the other Empire novels and you finally get a sense that he's figuring this stuff out. The relationship between Sark and Florina is fairly well thought out in its totalitarian complexity and the tangled politics between Sark and Trantor ground the settings with a new urgency, so that it feels like the events that are happening here matter. All the political maneuvering between the Squires and Trantor doesn't quite reach the sophisticated heights of CJ Cherryh but comes close to stuff that Poul Anderson would be doing in his own series of novels. You can see a lot of instances here where other SF writers would take and refine these concepts further (the whole Spatio-analytics concept seems like something Van Vogt would have had fun with). I don't know who did it first, or if this book was influential at all but it's always neat to see the roots.Still, it's got flaws. As I mentioned, its talky in that Asimov way, where pages and pages go by of people debating things. This would be less of a problem when the central conceptual hook was good enough to justify all that chatter (the Robot novels, mostly, as most of the Foundation stories are shorter) but here it's not quite enough. Rik isn't a very strong character, we're supposed to feel bad that he's being buffeted by events out of his control and thus feel sorry for him but it's hard to get too worked up when his initial warnings are ignored by even the novel. It also seems like Asimov treated romance much the same way as action, handled off screen, which means that anyone who is a woman gets a bit of the shaft in terms of their narrative potential, mostly being around to add some local color. But what's worse is that the idea that is supposed to get us into the novel, the imminent destruction of the world, almost becomes a MacGuffin of sorts, in the background until the plot requires it to be and handled with any sort of sense of urgency or worry.Which means you stick around for the scenery and the political action. In this case it's strong enough to save the novel. Not enough to make it one of his all time classics but such a cut above the other two that you can definitely see the well from which the actual classics would eventually spring."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The book is in nearly new condition. I'm very happy to have found a copy of this out of print book for a low price, and look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The Currents of Space is one of the novels in Isaac Asimov's so-called \\"Empire Trilogy\\", but it stands alone - YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ ANYTHING ELSE TO UNDERSTAND AND ENJOY THIS BOOK. Asimov had already written the Foundation trilogy, but those were originally written as a serial in a magazine. Thus the Empire books are Asimov's earlist full-length novels that were written as such. All of the elements which make Asimov's writing great is there: realistic science fiction, compelling mystery, and well-developed characters. However I feel that there is something in this presentation that is lacking. As good as this book is, it just doesn't stand out when compared with later books like the Robot novels and the later Foundation novels. I don't have any complaints about this book. By any other author it would be 5 stars, but by someone as accomplished as Asimov it is slightly forgettable compared to his other works.The setting: The rise of the Galactic Empire of Trantor long before its downfall in the Foundation novels and long after mankind's origins on earth had been obscured in the Robot novels. The planet Sark (independent of the Empire) has taken over the planet Florina to exploit their resources, and Trantor wants control of both planets. A scientist from Trantor has discovered a danger that could destroy the entire planet of Florina, but when he tells someone about the danger his memory is erased and he is dumped in the middle of nowhere. He is as a helpless infant and is cared for by an illeterate Florinian laborer until he starts being able to take care of himself and gradually recovers some of his memory. He is also watched closely by a low-level politician who may or may not have his best interests in mind. Rik, our memory impaired protagonist, remembers that there is a danger to Florina, but he does not know what that danger is. He must save the planet while evading capture on all sides, getting caught in political intrigue, wondering who he can trust, and trying to figure out who erased his memory in the first place.This is a short book, but it is full of action and suspense. Asimov keeps you turning the pages, and you are done reading it in no time. In the end Asimov ties everything up nicely. No, I did not predict the ending. Yes, the ending was satisfying.If you are a fan of Isaac Asimov you can't go wrong with this book. If you haven't read him before, read his Robot or Foundation novels first. This book can stand on its own, but it is appreciated much more when you are familiar with Asimov's universe."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"This book was a really fun book to read. The science parts(a star exploding because of carbon currents in space) weren't all that interesting or complicated, but the political frenzy is everywhere. Every man seems to be suspected of being the mysterious criminal \\"X\\", but the one that is not suspected turns out to be the criminal- and for different reasons than anyone would imagine. But all that hassle about the criminal sidetracks them from the matter of real importance- the universe's most valued world, Florina's imminent destruction by the explosion of a prenovae star. The only way to find out how this breathtaking mystery, political and suspence masterwork by Isaac Asimov ends is to read the book- or buy the Kindle version, like I did."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Again Asimov enthralls us with another exciting and suspenful story with good characters and fast action. Keeps you in suspense through most of the book with great writing and short descriptions. It's a pleasure to be able to read these ageless accounts in their original prints, it's like stepping into a time machine."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Legendary author Isaac Asimov has written a tale full of murder and political intrigue along with some great science fiction.The Trantorian empire is closing in on it's conquest of the galaxy. But, the planet Sark stands in the path of this conquest. Sark is an independent planet but, more important, is its sale of kyrt. Kyrt, a cotton-like substance, is the foundation of most of the materials in the galaxy and is only available from Sark.Sark doesn't produce kyrt by itself. Instead, kyrt is grown on the planet Florina. Sark uses the population of Florina as cheap slave labor to produce kyrt. Many have tried, but none have succeeded in growing kyrt anywhere but on Florina. These imitations are more like plain cotton and nowhere near the quality of kyrt. Due to this relationship, Sark has become extremely powerful and wealthy, while Florina has suffered under the rule of Sark.But, a man has entered the picture with information which could prove devastating to Sark, Florina, and Trantor. This man claims to have knowledge that Florina and it's valuable supply of kyrt is in danger of being destroyed. This leads to an exciting story of murder, political manuvering, and intrigue.I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this is only the 2nd Asimov novel that I've read, the other being the classic \\"Nightfall\\", which I also recommend. I thought this book was good, but I had some difficulty following the story. I thought Asimov introduced too many characters in such a short book, too. However, I did enjoy the story and I plan on reading \\"Pebble in the Sky\\" and \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\".Asimov is one of the masters of science fiction authors, and this book is a good choice for fans of science fiction."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"I'm with SA (Alabama)...

The paper has the quality of school tablet paper and is very flimsy and easy to tear. The cover has barely thicker paper than the contents, plus the printing is very light and is only readable in bright light. This book is a one or two time reading copy and won't last but a few years even on the shelf. Amazon has let the quality of their books at this price point go down."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Asimov draws many parallels with history hear on Earth. The planet Florinia is the old south with kyrt as its cotton and the natives as African slaves. Trantor is the mighty expanding Roman Empire. The planet Sarth (sp?)is Europe and America consuming the produce of the undeveloped third world (Florinia). Asimov also includes technical detail that enhances the story's realism. Its sharply drawn characters, beautiful imagery, social commentary and interesting plot make it Asimov's best book."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The Galactic Empire series was written after the Foundation series as a prequel.

The Author, who is a master, has been dead for 18 years. The book cost about $2.50 to make and they are selling it for $9.99. How come Macmillan/Tor don't get it? Even Spectra understands because they sell the Foundation books for $5.99. This is pure price gouging by the publishers in my opinion."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"I have always enjoyed Isaac Asimov's nonfiction books but this one is just too dry and too technical. While he usually excels at explaining difficult scientific concepts to the laymen, he lost this layman a lot. I did enjoy the historical parts of the book and the last chapter on longevity was worth reading the entire book to get to. It was its one shining moment."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"This book is an exploration of a number of scientific related information that Asimov knows so well. It is a bit dry and not like his novels.More of a textbook than anything else."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"After finishing \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\", Asimov started working on a third novel which would be called \\"The Currents of Space\\", which he was intending to publish in \\"Astounding\\". After discussing the idea with Walter Bradbury of Doubleday & Co., Bradbury expressed interest in publishing the third novel as he had the first two. The novel was published in October - December of 1952 in \\"Astounding\\", and by Doubleday in December.\\"The Currents of Space\\" is easily the best of the three precursor novels to the Foundation series which have become known as the Galactic Empire Series; however that is not all that difficult. This story takes place in Asimov's universe chronologically between the other two books, at a time when Trantor had become an empire, but not the Galactic Empire that it would become later.The story is centered on the planet Florina and on a man named Rik, who initially appears to be mentally challenged, but who is in fact a spatio-analyst from Earth who has had much of his mind erased by a Psychic Probe after he tried to warn of the impending destruction of the planet. When Rik's memory starts to return, people from Trantor and Sark (the world which rules Florina), and perhaps others as well become aware of his existence and try to find and control him.As with the first two Galactic Empire novels, Asimov wrote an afterword where he explains the scientific errors in the story. In this story the error is rather significant to the plot; however, the other elements of this story do not suffer as badly as they did in \\"Pebble in The Sky\\" or \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\". Regardless, this is only a fairly average novel, and not the best place to start if you are unfamiliar with Isaac Asimov."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"This is certainly the best of the three Empire novels, and one of Asimov's best science fiction novels of any type. I love his early fiction in general more than his later stuff, like FOundation and Earth and Robots and Empire and Nemesis. In comparison, Currents is much tighter, and more cleanly written, with a plot that GRIPS you like a good mystery(which, I think, is the type of writer Asimov was at heart). My one regret about this novel is that it is one of the last of his that I have to read, and I don't want to be left without any more. And if there was one thing I was left wanting in the book, it was for a certain kiss(not to give away anything) to develop into something more-- but I suppose that is the working of modern hack-fiction on me, and Asimov's abstinence from such cheap &quot;attention-catchers&quot; demonstrates his superior writing ability. He didn't NEED that to make the book more interesting."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Having read all of Asimov's early works, it's fair to say that this is the best of the crop of the Empire novels, and is better than all the Robot novels as well. It's not quite up to the Foundation stories, hence the rating of 4 stars.The plot is interesting, and has aged well. There is not very much that makes you snicker in the light of current scientific knowledge. He has a lot of characters for a 200 page book, but it is never confusing; they are individuals and it's easy to keep them separated in your mind. The story draws you in and keeps you interested from beginning to end.Asimov had the tendency to throw too many cliffhangers/revelations that didn't go anywhere in his early novels (as compared to, say, Nightfall), and it feels like he's cheaply manipulating the reader. This book, while containing some of these events, are far more logical and less contrived than in the other Empire and Robot novels. This makes it a far more enjoyable read.It is a shame that these books are out of print. I think the fact that 14 people have written reviews of this book points to the fact that there is still a following for Asimov out there, and maybe the publishers should print another edition of these early books, even in a single volume (as each Empire book is only 200 pages or so)."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"One day, on an agricultural colony planet run by a empire as harsh as the Roman Empire in biblical times, a local functionary finds a man whose mind has been destroyed in one of his town's fields. A peasant woman is tasked to re-raise this man from pretty much a second infancy. But now things are starting to come back, and the supervisor, although a native himself, sees the threat this poses to his masters' power. The principal crop on this world is a form of cotton that grows only this way on his planet--it's used in expensive clothing. But before his mind was &quot;wiped&quot;, the victim was a scientist who had discovered a menace which threatened that planet. Although the story has Ludlumesque head games by people in power, its strong point is in the human factor in the form of the victim, his female protector, as well as his former boss who's concerned about what became of him. That's why I say Wouk. But this is a sci fi book, right? Well, don't let that scare you off. It's a hell of a story in a middlin' size book--you don't get the two in a single package all that often."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Yes it's a tough read. Yes it requires patience and determination. But the fruits of the labor are an opening of the mind, a refreshed perspective of our world and the universe. Choose your chapter that meets your interest and be entertained and educated. This is not one to read straight through from front to back. This is one of my favorite books and truly not only a fascinating set of facts but an arrangement of concepts that expand the mind."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"While clearly science fiction by its setting, this novel also contains elements of detective novel, future history/social commentary, and espionage. The setting is an agricultural planet (Florinia) that yields a unique and highly valuable crop (a high-quality luxury cloth fiber), and the natives are exploited at a peasant/slave level by the rich and oppresive Squires from nearby planet Sark. Meanwhile, Sark is, due to its rich export, able to stave off conquest by the encroaching Trantorian empire. Within this setting, a scientist has discovered a danger to Florinia, but before he can alert officials, he is captured and his memory erased (with a sci-fi device) by an unknown party. The story begins with the scientist, renamed Rik, barely able to function and not knowing who he is, working amongst the Florinians and remembering things piecemeal. From here, the various sides are all trying to figure out what is going on, and struggling to get their hands on Rik, as he and his companions try to elude capture. Asimov keeps both the action and the ideas going to keep the reader interested, and creates a beleivable and sensible \\"world\\" and plot, without resorting to two-dimensional stereotypes or suspension-of-disbelief moments. Even the overlords come across as human beings, despite their reprehensible social system (one remembers even America's \\"founding fathers\\" included slave-owners). Everything makes perfect sense at the end, yet I didn't guess the truth before I read it. Although written over 50 years ago, the science-fiction aspects don't come across as dated (although the underlying science of Rik's belief of danger for the planet has been discredited, it was beyond my scientific knowledge until I looked it up).Asimov's genius lies in the ability to tell an engrossing adventure story intelligently. Although well crafted, lthis IS a quick read - I'm surprised to find it listed only as an expensive hardcover; this is prime mass-market material; and at 200 pages each, they really should bind Asimov's three similar novels (this, \\"Pebble In The Sky\\", and \\"The Stars Like Dust\\" - not closely related, but all set in the same \\"universe\\" between his \\"Robot\\" and \\"Foundation\\" series) into one 600-page paperback! So, I suggest reading it, but (unless you like to collect hardcovers) pick up a used copy at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The elite of the galaxy are usually dressed in Kryt. It is the most beautiful fabric known. Its iridescent threads are nearly indestructible, and above all, it is so, oh so expensive.It has made the sellers of Kryt fabulously wealthy. Its trade is controlled solely by one planet, planet Sark; a planet which lies outside of Trantor's expanding galactic empire. Other planets have tried and failed to grow it; it is not known why Kryt grows only on one planet. It doesn't even grow on planet Sark, but on a planet that Sark controls: planet Florina.That is where you are: planet Florina. At first, you don't know that. In fact, you know practically nothing; somebody has blocked your memories, so much so, that you can't even speak. But a native woman takes you in, teaches you, gets you a job at the Kryt mill, and gradually your memories begin to seep in. And then one day - between bites on your lunch break - you remember something about your profession: you were a Spatio-analyst, one who collects and correlates data about the space between the stars. You are elated to discover who you were, but then - like a soaring fly that has been slammed with a flyswatter - you are crushed when you remember that millions of people are going to die!I greatly enjoy almost everything that Isaac Asimov has written; 'The Currents of Space' is no exception.I can make no comment on the physical quality of the book listed on Amazon, since my copy is a very old Fawcett Crest paperback; it is yellowed with age and exudes a faint musty smell. I wrote this review as a result of Amazon's suggestion; besides, it gave me an excuse to reread it after all these years."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's great Science Fiction works remain out of print. The three \`Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some, the reason these novels are called \`Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire referenced in the Foundation series began, during its infancy and during its peak. Very much fun indeed."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"The world of Sark exists in the minority in having thus far eluded annexation by the Empire of Trantor. The sole reason for this evasion rests in Sark's dominion over a no-account world called Florina. No-account, that is, except for a wondrous crop that grows only upon Florina. This crop is so entwined in the culture of the galaxy that Sark has become unbelievably wealthy, so much so that Trantor fears the large army to be raised by such wealth.Upon the planet Florina, there is a man whose memory has been erased for the danger it poses to the delicate balance that exists over Florina's condition. In his profession he uncovered a secret now lost, one of paramount importance to the safety of all Florina.This novel chronicles the mystery surrounding this mind-wiped man and the adventures that ensue as his memory begins to return. Asimov again displayed his excellent plotting ability as he leads you in various directions, so that you come to conclusions that are completely wrong, lest you recall the earlier-placed clues that would prevent such erroneous conclusions. When the questions are all finally answered, too many viable suspects have been eliminated, and there is left only the guilty. Asimov was successful in twisting the events such that any reader would be kept guessing.This book is the second of the three Empire novels, which depict different time periods in the creation of the Galactic Empire. This takes place after the Empire is relatively well established. Preceding these novels, but not necessary for any understanding (as Asimov did not tie them together until well after the Empire novels were published) of the events.Following the Empire novels are the Foundation novels, which chronicle the fall of the Empire. In order to truly get the feel of this universe, this book clues the reader in as to how Trantor progressed in its Imperial goal. Also, he provides information that indicate the state of things in the third Empire novel, Pebble in the Sky."},{"Title":"Of time and space and other things","review":"Uncharacteristically of the other two Empire novels, you really get a feel for the characters in this one and begin to understand them as if they were real people. You feel the panic and helplessness of Rik, a man with a bad case of amnesia of everything prior to a few days ago when he woke up and didn't know where he was or who he was, and just happened to have the good fortune of being taken in by a kind woman. On the planet Florina, still untouched by the rising Galactic Empire, lower class workers toil for their masters on the aristocratic world of Sark, and Rik struggles to find who wiped his mind and why. I was somewhat disappointed by all three Empire novels by the fact that none of them actually deals directly with the Empire or its rise, they only take place during it. Other than that, this is a superb novel."},{"Title":"Charles Taylor (Philosophy Now Series)","review":"Finally, what I've been waiting for, a series that accessibly captures the thoughts of the masters in more than &quot;90 Minutes&quot;.

This is the second in a series of books. It is the story of sex slaves to the Charleston elite. Palmer is a thirty-nine year old tennis instructor, recently married to Missy. Ashley Tennis Club, in Charleston, South Carolina, employs him. Palmer is happy instructing both young and senior members. When his star pupil Mimi Collins is found dead, Palmer is the prime suspect. While Missy disappears when the media begins watching the couple closely, Palmer runs while trying to clear his name. The hunt is on for escaped fugitive Palmer Morel. Palmer is the fall guy, set up by someone - but who?Missy's diary entries are intertwined through out the novel. Palmer learns that she \\"...knew about the Mephisto before she was captured and put behind its doors.\\" Could she truly love him and yet have implicated him in the murder of Mimi?This book is not for the timid. It includes sexual violence and graphic language. The author takes the reader into the dark and slimy underground world of Charleston, South Carolina. Rochelle has a running theme in his books; depraved rich, conspiracy, and a thirst for sex, money and power.No need to use your brain on this one. This is strictly reading for entertainment. I found the plot interesting in places. It had some unexpected twists and turns. I recommend this book for mystery readers who need a break from a deep involved read. It's a good book and very entertaining.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The Mephisto Diary: A Palmer Morel Mystery","review":"Latest in the series finds thirty-nine year old Palmer Morel, tennis pro, now teaching at Ashley Tennis Club located in Charleston, South Carolina. Teaching seniors as well as younger players and happily married to Missy, things are going very well. He especially enjoys certain aspects of his work, like teaching one of his younger students, Miriam \\"Mimi\\" Collins.Thanks to his help, she has moved strongly up the tennis rankings and is now ranked number two locally and at Sate level. The eighteen-year-old star is the pride of the Club. Attractive and talented she should go far. But, unknown to him as he drinks his morning coffee while distant fire and police sirens wail on the morning air, Mimi is dead.Mimi has been found dead in a second floor room of the neighboring Ashley Plantation thanks to an anonymous phone tip according to a television news report. The news is shocking and soon made worse by the fact that Palmer becomes the number one suspect. Soon, as the media watch intensifies, his wife Missy vanishes. Forced to run to clear his name, Palmer receives help from unlikely sources in his search for the real killer and the dark secrets of, \\"The Mephisto Diary.\\"Returning to his usual themes of illicit sex, conspiracy and the depraved rich and famous, the author once again creates a seedy underground world in a major city. This time around it is Charleston where the depraved elite are known by some as \\"sob's.\\" They run everything, use others for whatever they want, and have set Palmer up to be the fall guy in an elaborate months long plan.While not as sexually graphic as earlier novels in this series, as well as being better written, there is a crushing familiarity to the work. Once again, the names have been changed for the locations as well as Palmer's women but the core idea is still the same. The conspirator's names have changed but once again, they are rich, depraved and want sex, and don't care how they get about it as part of their thirst for money and power. One gets the sense that if one has read one Palmer Morel novel, one has pretty much read them all.As such, as a piece of mindless entertainment, it works. The story is interesting and occasionally ventures off in an unexpected ways. With little substance to it, the book is a pleasant diversion and a nice break from other more involved and complicated works.Book Facts:The Mephisto DiaryBy Larry RochelleZumaya Publicationswww.zumayapublications.com2003ISBN # 1-894869-75-3Large Trade Paperback (Other formats available)$15.00 US (Print Price)"},{"Title":"Fortunes of Captain Blood","review":"This is another collection of Sabatini's short stories featuring Peter Blood presented in serial order so the book can be read cover to cover or one story at a time. The plots center around Captain Blood's clever outwitting of his many opponents and incidents brought about by his fame in the Caribbean, including an imposter besmirching his reputation and a clever adversary who sees through one of the Captain's many alternate personas. Highly readable and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Fortunes of Captain Blood","review":"Raphael Sabatini apparently knew a good thing when he wrote it. The original Captain Blood was a runaway best seller. So Sabatini began cranking out further adventures of Captain Blood that were essentially collections of unrelated stories. Each chapter of \\"Fortunes\\" relates a complete stand-alone vignette, not related to the other chapters of the book.You won't find a continuous narrative, and not much in the way of Blood's pining for the unreachable Arabella Bishop. But if you are interested in a rock-em, sock-em collection of great, salty short stories starring Sabatini's sympathetic hero Peter Blood, then \\"Fortunes\\" is for you.Be sure that you first read the original \\"Captain Blood, His Odyssey\\", also sometimes sold simply as \\"Captain Blood\\". Then, once you are hooked on the main story, get a copy of \\"Fortunes\\" and enjoy even more piratical high-seas hijinks from everyone's favorite soldier of fortune.As a delightful little \\"bonus\\", see if you are a careful enough reader to pick out the error in Sabatini's time-line. You'll have to remember the original Captain Blood story, and then in \\"Fortunes\\", read the story of The Eloping Hidalga. Something between the two doesn't add up. See if you can spot the mistake."},{"Title":"Fortunes of Captain Blood","review":"This is the good stuff! If you've ever sailed with Conan of Cimmmeria, been in a tavern brawl with the Musketeers or swung over to the deck of a hostile ship with Errol Flynn, Rafael Sabatini is the mother lode. Here are pirates of the brave, capable and eloquent variety, and women worth risking life and limb over.If you're new to Captain Peter Blood, here's a once-over: the core and original book is \\"Captain Blood His Odyssey\\" and read that first if you can. Sabatini subsequently wrote \\"The Chronicles of Captain Blood\\" which is also sometimes titled \\"Captain Blood Returns\\" and this one, \\"The Fortunes of Captain Blood\\" but both subsequent volumes take place between the chapters of the original novel, deepening it, but not changing Peter Blood's happy ending.\\"Fortunes\\" is effectively a short story collection set in the Caribbean c. 1687--the great era of doubloons and buccaneering. Sabatini knows the period, understands naval warfare at this level to his fingertips and is the best dialogue writer ever to also describe swordfights--and no, I do not exclude Dumas. Buy this book.

Although it's directed toward \\"those who may have given up on church, but not on God,\\" these pages offer a sound presentation of the reality and the relevancy of Christianity in today's world. Reading this book will refresh the heart of any believer, and it can also stir up the embers of faith and trust in those who are wary of attending church.The reader will set off on a 30-day spiritual adventure, as the authors start at the point of skepticism and move ever onward toward the purposes and blessings of a community of believers. Most interesting was the use of the Apostle's Creed as the basis for this teaching. Each section works through another point of the Creed, while highlighting its validity in the modern world. In a significant blending of the ancient and the contemporary, the Apostle's Creed touches today with its timeless truths.The writing is conversational and is completely void of theological jargon. Because of this, there is a note of genuineness throughout. Doubts and misunderstandings are examined with honesty and humility. The authors acknowledge the problems confronting the modern believer, and then they walk alongside the reader as they attempt to find the answers. Skeptics will be given a new perspective on some vital issues, while all believers will have their faith strengthened with this solid biblical foundation.A Place for Skeptics is an excellent resource for reaching those who are wary of religion but who are also weary of searching. -- Joyce Handzo, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"A Place for Skeptics: A Spiritual Journey for Those Who May Have Given Up on Church But Not on God","review":"After reading A Place for Skeptics...I could have entitled it \\"A Place for my Friends and I\\".

The format of the book, broken down into 30 days, is just enough to get you thinking about that topic for the day and not overwhelm you.

As they quote from Dostoyevsky: \\"Sometimes the greatest act of faith is in the doubting.\\"What a gift it is to go on this 30-day journey with people who readiily acknowledge how fragile faith can often feel. Larson and Mitchell are refreshingly honest about their own doubts and questions, which is probably why so much of it resonates with me. They actually encourage us to be skeptics, in the healthiest sense of the word, leaving room for the mystery that is God. If you're looking for answers, look elsewhere. If you're open to the value of living with questions, you will probably appreciate, as I did, what this book has to offer.

(IE - Christianity is about holding the right ideas.)

Black and white photos and maps of the region are included. Each session is divided into six, 3-page lessons consisting of a passage from scripture, history of the site, reflection questions, and a prayer.For example, Session 3 covers the Jordan River, Cana, Capernaum (the synagogue and Peter's house), the Church of the Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes, and the Mount of Beatitudes. The lesson on Peter's house in Capernaum begins with readings from Mark (1:29-34, in which Peter's mother-in-law is cured of a fever and 2:1-12 in which the paralyzed man is lowered through the roof).We are introduced to the site as it is today: \\"A short distance from the synagogue are the remains of Peter's house... it had one large room, measuring about 20 feet by 20 feet, and several smaller rooms\\" with walls of black basalt stones and a roof of clay and straw. In the next paragraph we \\"see\\" Jesus in this place he called home, and are given more scripture references to fill out the picture. Next we learn that Peter's house was a gathering place for early Christians and, in the second half of the first century, the walls and ceilings of the large room were plastered to create a church.The author briefly describes further changes to the building in the fifth century and closes by describing the scene today, in which a modern church is built on pillars over the ruins. In the center of the church, a glass floor allows visitors to look into the excavations below and stand directly above the place Jesus called home.The reflection/discussion questions deal with what is sacred about the place we call home and ways in which we can bring others to Jesus as townspeople brought the paralyzed man to Jesus at Peter's house."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Ink Bottle: The Artist's Way of Seeing","review":"Even a cursory reading of &quot;Leonardo's Ink Bottle&quot; provides a rare glimpse into the mind of a working artist. Is is unusual to find an artist who excels in a variety of media and can as easily express herself in language as in paint or clay. The author's encyclopaedic knowledge of the arts and her craft of writing make her a wonderfully adept interpreter for those of us with a modest understanding of what drives a fully realized artist. Her approach to a life in art is as a process of spiritual discovery requiring the engagement of all the faculties: the eye that sees, the mind that conceives, the heart that feels and the hand that wields the brush or the pen to create something of beauty and value. The suggestions in Weir's book are drawn from her own life in the practice of art and are designed to take us beyond the conditioned framework of thought. These sharings of the journey to the wellsprings of creativity are a useful guide for the open-minded individual. This type of broad renaissance worldview is in such short suppply in our era that Weir's voice sounds a refreshing counterpoint, one that is not mawkish, new-agey or sentimental."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Ink Bottle: The Artist's Way of Seeing","review":"Roberta Weir has given visual artists a wonderful, enchanting work. She offers us not only a way of seeing but a way of being: open, receptive and true. It is a subtle blend of insight, very practical sugggestions for nurturing and developing one's creative work and selections of her fine drawings. It's wise, multi-layered and moving. I love this book. For visual arts students I would also recommend The Blank Canvas by Anna Held Audette."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Ink Bottle: The Artist's Way of Seeing","review":"Wonderful first book by a great American artist of the 20th century.

That said, the book is nevertheless well written. The style is reminiscent of the creative flow experience itself. This book does a good job helping the newbie to understand what flow feels like and how to obtain that state. The exercises are very practical and tend to balance the \\"flow-like\\" text. I loved the illustrations. I keep going back to the book just to look at the art work."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Ink Bottle: The Artist's Way of Seeing","review":"The budding (junior high to high school) artist may find this a nice thought provoking gift, but the experienced artist will find little to nourish them here. I found some of the explanations somewhat simplistic and the language of the book itself is somewhat like the type of poetry you read and cannot remember a word of the next moment."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"LATTER DAYS at the first glance seems a little out of the ordinary and is almost unconvincing: a WeHo pretty boy with muscles like fully-baked puffy muffins living in a kitschy apartment falls in love with his Mormon missionary neighbor who is in the closet. Christian Markelli is the typical player of the loose-moral, carefree, long-term-relationship shunning bunch who enjoys quick pleasure. Working at a high-end restaurant which makes prey hunting handy, Christian literally has hooked up with every straight male customer and commemorates each steamy encounter with an entry in his PDA.So when four young Mormon missionaries set us housekeeping in the apartment across the way, Christian and his friends place bets on how long it will take him to capitulate Elder Aaron Davis, the apple-cheeked, broad-shouldered evangelist who jolts his heart with love at first sight. Christian is stunned; he cannot make out of what it is that is so attractive about this young missionary. For Aaron the encounter evokes his repressed, closeted sensuality rooted in him. Aaron has nursed himself in the safety of the past, and in absolute obeisance to the ways of life the church has so diligently inculcated in him. He does not dare to reciprocate his affection to Christian for fear of harsh persecution from his colleagues.Above the comic inserts and episodes surrounding the budding romance between the two hangs the significant ideas of self-discovery, revelation, love, for both Aaron and Christian. Aaron has negotiated with himself, and with God, the consequence of the sin of homosexuality but at the same time nudges closer to the tender thought of Christian, who has heartedly declared his love for him. Aaron's discomfit escalates at the thought of his encounters with Christian and throws him into a constant state of enhanced sensuality. Self-discovery of who he is, instead of what he has done, puts him on the mettle to come out to his family and act in defiance of the church's expectations. The strenuous journey to enlightenment affords pain, humiliation and guilt.For Christian, he has never experienced such an indefinable madness for Aaron has stoically challenged and rebuked his shallow lifestyle. It prompts him to think about true intimacy, about getting to know the person to whom he wakes up in the morning. Christian's revelation is a glum one: that he has been fearful and inept to commitment and true intimacy. At the same time he feels utterly remorseful for getting Aaron into serious trouble with the church.LATTER DAYS, though a sweeping romantic story it advertises to be, teaches us a lesson or two in relationship. It might have gone a little far with the miracle and the angel's singing but it's what fiction does after all. Neither Aaron nor Christian has ever felt the way he feels about anyone in his entire life - the snuggly feeling that \\"it's got to mean something.\\" Yet they are both somewhat fearful to conform to this heart's calling. What if he is really the one he's been waiting for his whole life and he lets him go? In a world where everyone dances with one eye on the door, like we are all waiting for that next something better to walk in, LATTER DAYS calls us to be genuine with ourselves and promises the reward will be right around the corner."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"I have read the book, but not seen the movie. Other reviews have indicated that it's mostly a print version of the movie, which I don't doubt(see below).It's a compelling story that's pretty well put together. There are some plot developments that are improbable, and in a couple of places the characters behave in ways that aren't readily believable, but are possible. There are some fairly heavy scenes, too; any book that can make me cry has definitely made an emotional impact.I'm not entirely sure that someone who's straight would react the same way, though... I'm gay, and from a church that basically everyone considers to be fundamentalist (though not the Mormons). So some of the things that I thought were most moving might roll right by someone who doesn't have the same cultural background. I plan to give it to some straight friends (including one or two from church) to test my hypothesis. And, FWIW, I thought that what was in the book about how the Mormons go about setting up their mission teams and evangelizing was very interesting. Given that C. Jay Cox grew up in the church, I assume they're accurate. I'll definitely be more sympathetic the next time I see them out and about somewhere.If the book itself has a failing, it's that it goes by very fast. There may be more character development than in the movie, but there's room for still more. To some degree, however, that can probably be said of any story. Oh, one other thing: if you haven't seen the movie, the trailer available on the film's Web site has a spoiler or two in it... that's relevant for either the movie or the book."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Christian Markelli is the stereotypical West Hollywood gay \\"party boy\\" hunk, with a reputation for seducing even young men who claim to be straight. So it is not so strange when his coworkers at Lillys (a restaurant owned by a former movie star) bet him $50 he can't seduce a young Mormon missionary who recently moved in (along with three other missionaries) into his apartment complex. Along the way, Christian falls in love with the shy, frustrated Aaron Davis, who also finds himself attracted to Christian, in contrary to his strong religious upbringing and beliefs. He also makes Christian realize something about himself, and the story becomes a compelling story of connection and self-discovery as well as romance. It also realistically depicts the plight of gay members of the LDS church, as Aaron is discovered by a roommate and sent home from his mission in disgrace.The novel is based on a screenplay for the film, which has recently been released in several major US cities, and broke all records for gay movies in its opening weekend. I have not seen the film, so my review is based solely on the book. Nor has the book spoiled me from wanting to see the film, since the story - while somewhat simplistic and predictable in its revelations - is told masterfully and sensitively. I'd rate the book 5 stars out of 5, and look forward to the DVD release of the film."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"\\"Latter Days\\" the book and the movieWould you risk being ex-communicated by your church, shunned by your peers, and turned away by your parents, for the one you love? How desperate would you be if you were denied the freedom to love, to be with the person of your dreams? The one person who makes you feel complete. This is portrayed in the all too familiar story of boy meets boy, boy falls in love with boy, and boy has to choose between boy and family. Latter Days the book, written from the screenplay, is a replica of the movie except for a few minor details. C. Jay Cox wrote the screenplay. The book, adapted by T. Fabris, won the Audience Award as the Outstanding First Narrative Feature, Los Angeles Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss), a 19 year-old Morman, has never been away from home. He is called to serve as a missionary for his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His assignment is in Hollywood, California where he will spend two years. He makes the pilgrimage from Pocatello, Idaho to California, full of hope and promise that he will make his church and family proud. He studies the Bible and its teachings diligently. He loves the church and the feeling of belonging, but there is one big problem--he is gay. He falls in love with another boy, Christian. His church insists Aaron repent for his sins and forever deny who he is. Living as a homosexual is not an option. The church forces Aaron to choose between Christian and his religion.Christian Markelli (Wes Ramsey) is a vivacious, gorgeous, party animal. His claim to fame is his ability to get straight boys to have sex with him. He works as a waiter and bus boy at Lila's Restaurant-so does his roommate and best friend, Julie. His other friends are co-workers, Andrew and Traci. When Aaron and three other young Mormons move into Christian and Julie's apartment complex, Andrew, Traci, Julie and Chris make a $50 bet to see if Chris can get one of the missionaries to sleep with him. Chris and Julie bet he could do it; Andrew and Traci bet he could not. Christian had no idea that he was going to fall in love with Aaron, or that Aaron would return his love.Julie (Rebekah Jordan) is an aspiring singer. Through a connection, she gets Clive Davis to listen to her demo album. Chris and Julie are more than roommates; they support and love one another like family.Andrew (Khary Payton), the bartender at Lila's, has wisdom beyond his years because he has been HIV positive from a very young age. He convinces Christian to volunteer to help deliver food to housebound AIDS victims. Chris takes him up on his offer after Aaron tells him he is shallow and compares him to a \\"marshmallow peep\\"-a perfect analogy. Chris wants to prove to Aaron that he is not just a pretty face who only cares about getting laid.Traci (Amber Benson) is an aspiring actress whose parents are not too crazy about her career choice.Lila (Jacqueline Bisset) owns Lila's Restaurant and is the epitome of culture, grace, and poise. She is a mother figure to Christian and Aaron when their own parents are not willing to fulfill their roles. One of her best lines to Aaron is, \\"Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals. I am definitely not joining.\\" Aaron was there for Lila in her time of need and Lila returns the favor to Aaron. They were each others' angel.Aaron is kicked out of the missionary program and sent home after getting caught kissing Christian. Christian does not want to let him go that easily and tries to get him back.The set design is amazing and meaningful, as we see when Aaron returns home. His father is disappointed and his mother is cold. By contrast, the house is colorful and bright; even the kitchen cabinets are cheery. The house was decorated before Aaron shamed his family by admitting he is gay-designed when Aaron showed promise and potential to follow his father's example and become a church leader. The cheerful design makes Aaron's mother seem that much harsher by comparison.I loved Latter Days, the movie and the book, for many reasons but most of all for the important story it tells and the lesson it teaches. The lesson being that love comes in all forms and no person or church should have the right to condemn love between two people of the same sex. Many tragedies and near disasters could be avoided."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"First of all, it is so commendable for the writer of Sweet Home Alabama to come out and write this gay film. It must have been a risky career choice, but I hope this movie (book) has proven that it was worth it.Since the book is an adaption from the movie (i.e. from movie to book), one cannot expect beautiful sentences a la Michael Cunningham's A Home At The End Of The World. Nevertheless, the story is very sweet. It is definitely worth the read for those interested in exploring books in this genre. (For me, I was personally relieved to find a book with gay characters that does not merely involve drugs, clubs, and a plethora of one-night-stands)My own interpretation of the story is that it is about finding love in the most unexpected situation. The best kind of romantic connection can be found between the most unlikely candidates, which is what made me cheering for Christian and Aaron all the way. If an erstwhile whorish party boy who is jaded about love and a mind-Freaked yet innocent Mormom missionary could find comfort and love in each other's arms, then it is possible for us all.Without being a plot ruiner, I will just say that as corny as the plot sometimes seems to be, the characters are well developed. Major characters branch out into their own subplots to build more credibilities into the construction of their personalities. I am so glad finally there is a gay love story that has some dramatic substances other than the usual cheating-forgiving that has been made so blase by basically every other gay romantic book I have read.I believe this book really is 3-star material. However, based on the fact that there rarely are gay books with &quot;actual&quot; characters and &quot;real-life&quot; plots, I am going to give this book a special &quot;affirmative action&quot; rating of a 4-star. (Not to mention the very commendable inclusion of African-American characters in the book, kudos to the writers! We don't live in Scandanavia, for crying out loud; this book shows the reality)Buy it; support the writers! That is how more quality gay literature and films can come about! Remember what Martina Navartilova says of our dollars being assets in our campaign for equality, freedom, and visibility. Well, supporting well composed gay arts (movies and books) is as good a way to spend our dollars as any. I also recommend A Home At The End Of The World (Cunningham), and Dream Boy (Grimsley) within the genre."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"...so says Anderson Cooper in his latest article in \\"Details\\" magazine. I think he's right.\\"Latter Days\\" was fun and moving. No, it wasn't \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", but who needs soggy literature? Our economy sucks, our soldiers are dying, and I, for one, enjoy some decent but lighter entertainment. \\"Latter Days\\" isn't fluff, but it's not going to send you off to cut your wrists, either. We need more books like this (and yes, this adaptation is WAY better than the film). We need hope and humanity in the face of the radical religious right. \\"Latter Days\\" gives us that.So, Janeh, get a life.

I've not seen the movie, but the book has stimulated a very strong desire to see it on my home surround system with my same-sex mate with whom I bonded in 1977 and have maintained an outstanding monogamous relationship since then. Bravo to Cox!!!"},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"This book will appeal mostly to those who have seen the film and are interested in finding more information out about the characters. Hopefully, however, people around the world who can't see this film or can't wait for the DVD release will take a chance and read this faithful novelization that provides more backstory to some of the characters. The novelization is solidly written with the same great depth that screenwriter C. Jay Cox gave his characters. Those of you who read this book will find it enjoyable and an outstanding companion to the film. If you haven't seen the movie yet, the book gives an overall better feel for the time that passes between beginning and end.You will fall for these characters. You'll laugh, cry and cheer. I recommend this book HIGHLY and hope it's message of love is heard around the world, just as I hope the film gets the rewards (and awards) it so rightly deserves."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"This book was extremely satisfying--like good sex that only comes along once in a blue moon. So few books actually \\"go\\" somewhere, but this one does. The writing style and brilliant execution are on the same level as McCrae's \\"Bark of the Dogwood\\" (though the two books have nothing in common plot-wise) and some of the steamy scenes in this novel will set you twitching (think, some plots in lesser gay novels that are unabashed in their desire to please), but the overall effect is worth it. It's obvious that the author is a writer of movie scripts (uh, this is actually a compliment here . . .) because he certainly knows how to weave a story that will keep you interested. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Several friends recommended the movie, but I could not find a copy. But I did find the book, and read it. It is a rather slender gay love story, endearing on its own terms, and pleasantly written. It definitely shows its roots as a movie script.I at first thought the love story implausible, especially the fate of Aaron in dealing with his feelings about his church, until I did some research on the internet, and discovered the Mormon Affirmation web site and Mormon PFLAG. Aaron is lucky to have escaped a worse fate, and to have lived the happy ending in the book.I have family who are Mormon, and as such am interested in the LDS Church and its teachings, not for myself, but to understand better. This book indeed filled in another piece of the puzzle. I would have hoped, however, that the Mormon background to the story might have been written about with more depth and research."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Let me start by saying that I really feel there is a good story here somewhere just dieing to be told. Unfortunately, I don't think this book quite hits the mark. I remember seeing the movie and being sorely disappointed in its execution. I was hoping this story would get a better treatment through the book and was only somewhat disappointed. Having grown up with a strong Mormon influence and having had several Mormon friends, I will say that the missionary characters seemed believable, Aaron in particular. Christian, the other lead character, was equally as well developed and credible. The details of the plot just seem to get a little lost as they are thrown together in the end. I found myself really wanting to feel more of the emotion in the end but just couldn't fully buy into it. The dialogue is quite humorous at times albeit short lived. The romance between the characters feels real and--well--I too love a happy ending."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"The story is touching. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. The book was well-written, and there were times when I really felt the emotions of the characters. I also found myself worked up with my own strong feelings in certain situations. Throughout the reading I also learned a great deal about the Morman culture, and their views on different issues. This was a great book and I strongly reccommend reading it."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"I see more in C. Jay Cox than just the surface humor, horror, and treatment of this book. This author is tempting us to laugh and love in spite of the hypocritical quirks or our birth cultures. My favorite character was the Bishop who excommunicated our hero. My impression of his brain size has something to do with a thimble. [...]"},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"In this case, the book was based on the movie that preceded the book. I loved the movie, and I couldn't wait to read the book - and I wasn't disappointed.An easy read that combines a great story, just enough religious information focused on Latter Day Saints activities involving religious missions, families, and homophobia. It involves a gay character, a coming of age story, and a coming out story.A nicely written book that is a fun read. I certainly would recommend it to both teens and adults."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"You need to watch the movie first. I love the movie. I've watched it at least 20 times. Then I read the book. The book helps a lot in understanding certain points of the movie. I was able to picture in my mind the extra scenes. It was so good that it took me only 24 hours to read it. These two young men go through such an emotional roller coaster. I watched the movie on the internet. Then I read there was a book. So I had to get it. If you like romance books. You will love this book. I liked it so much I read it twice in two weeks."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Others already have said much of what I would say (or not say, for that matter!) about this story. I wrote, in another Amazon user's review, what I in all humility think is a probing analysis of the film and of the reality of the religious and social milieu which it depicts, so I would direct those who consult Amazon to refer to it for more detail.I wish mostly to point out how I appreciate the added dimension to character portrayal the book brings to the film. As one who spent time while growing up (for some years) as a L.D.S. Mormon, one from a family (on my mother's side) for several generations steeped in Mormonism, I appreciate the realism of Latter Days in portraying what the L.D.S. Mormon sect really is like, down to so many details. The book gives more profile especially to the secondary characters in this tale. The personality, background, world view, and ideals of the runtiest of the Mormon missionaries, Ryder, with whom Aaron works and comes into conflict, especially benefits from Cox' added detail and depth of portrayal. Ryder has his own aspirations and his own yearnings for love (in Ryder's case, heterosexual) to be reciprocated that go far in the book to make Ryder to be more than the shallow little conformist and (backed by his and Aaron's fellow missionaries) bully, too, that he rather too solely is in the film.The film and the book really do seize the atmosphere and ethos of L.D.S. Mormonism realistically, for better as well as for worse. Get the book, see the film on DVD or when it comes back to a local theatre for another screening!"},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Some German exchange student in my high school class (oh yes, years ago) was obsessively reading the literary adaptation of the film \\"Fatal Attraction\\", as well as other adaptations. I was flirting, so I feigned interest in borrowing the books...all of them. And, much like the guy, I found them to be a real snoozefest.Writers generally let a script sloppily carry them through writing a literary adaptation. It's usually a pasteurized view of what happens in the movie. It usually sucks. But T. Fabris really pulled one off, here. Fabris gives layers to the characters. Fabris unveils things with subtlety and grace. And while the purpose of this literary adaptation may have been to garner attention for the film it was based on, I have much more interest in the future works of T. Fabris than I have in seeing the film version of \\"Latter Days\\". It might just ruin it for me."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"After watching the movie, I saw that there was a novel based off it. I had never read a novelization of a movie before but since I loved the story I felt this was a good one to try. Overall it was a very enjoyable read. While sometimes it felt like the author's intention was to summarize the movie -by focusing on the characters' clothing choices rather than actions and inner feelings- the back stories of the minor characters gave them more depth and more insight into their actions.It took me less than a day to finish the novel because I just couldn't put it down and as soon as I finished reading it I wanted to read it again."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"If you've seen the movie, skip this book purchase, unless you can find it in the library. I thought, mistakenly, that the novel would add even the tiniest bit of detail, information, or insight that the movie didn't as most movies are cut up versions of novels. This book was the script to a T. As a matter of fact I suspect the actors read from this book while in front of the camera. There is nothing new to be gained here. I'm giving my copy away to someone who hasn't seen the movie. That being said, I actually enjoyed the movie/script. It was funny, thoughtful, and the characters were likeable. I also like to read books that tackle religious beliefs and sexuality. Unlike a lot of gay films out there Latter Days ends on a high note."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Latter Days is basically the screenplay of the movie by the same title, directed by C. Jay Cox, who also wrote it. T. Fabris adapted the screenplay into a novels: usually the process is not simple, and not always the result is good. I loved the movie and so I tried to read the novel without playing too much the scenes in my mind as I saw them in the movie. I tried to understand if the book was good despite the movie, if the story could appeal someone that maybe hasn't seen the movie and pick up the book. I think it's good, the story is basically good and it's a nice romance. It's not an overtly erotic book, it's almost a sweet romance.Christian is a very handsome gay guy... he is young, probably barely 20 years old, and he is doing nothing much than enjoy his life. I have the feeling that Christian has not money trouble, he has not a supporting family from a loving point of view, but I believe that he knows where to find an help if he needs it. He supports himself working as a waiter in an upperclass restaurant, owned by a former movie star, and his life style is up to his work. in the end, Christian is living in a perennial night party, changing partner every night and enjoying every minute of it.Then in the apartment near him moves a Mormon congregation, 4 young guys. One of them is Aaron, All American good boy type of guy but with a secret... he enjoys life! He has a deep faith but he doesn't believe that loving God means judging other people, he actually likes his proselytism mission since he allows him to meet new people, but he would like to also listen to other people not only to tell them \\"their\\" story. Aaron also loves the old black and white movies and the cute boys... yes, Aaron is gay, even if he has never had the chance to \\"test\\" his preferences. And when he is thrown in the middle of a gay friendly neighborhood, he has many of them, the nearer of which represented by Christian.Scorned when he brought the first friendly neighborly gift, Christian bets with his friends that he will seduce one of the young mormon boys, and obviously Aaron is the most likely candidate, since not only he is probably willing, but also since he is the only who talks with Christian. And here he proves how different he is from all the other guys Christian met, Aaron actually talks with him, he sees something other in Christian than a pretty boy [...] (one of Christian's friend tells him, you don't need to be deep, you are pretty! to give you an example of how was Christian's life before Aaron). The bet is soon forgotten and Christian starts to wonder if his life has a meaning, when, on the other side, Aaron start to question his faith, or better, the interpretation of faith that was taught to him.Actually of the two men, Christian is the one that has more chance to come out from the page of the book. I have the strong feeling to have listened to Christian's mind, to his reason, and instead Aaron was a little more undertone. Maybe it's right like that, it's in their character, Christian is the butterfly and instead Aaron is the thinker; it's Christian's character that has to develop, Aaron is almost already at the end of his discovery path. And I found quite interesting that Christian did a sprint to reach Aaron in that journey and in the end, it was him that reach the finishing line as first, while Aaron practically withdraw from the \\"competition\\".When I said that this is almost a sweet romance, I was referring to the fact that the sex is not the main purpose of the story. Christian lets aside his bet to really try to conquer Aaron, and they are basically the main characters of the story, but there are also a good parade of supporting characters and also a fairy godmother in the guise of Lila, the restaurant owner."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"OK, so this is the book version of the drama film \\"Latter Days.\\" I like having the book; with it, I can revisit the story of Aaron and Christian without having to turn on the DVD player. But I'm not really into romance novels, especially the more explicit ones. I tend to role my eyes and snort with disbelief at the more -- how shall I put it? -- sexual scenes. And yes, this book has its share of romantic stupidity. \\"Steaming abs\\"? Yah, is that even possible? Can abs steam? And what's with all the trite adjectives: \\"fabulous\\" and \\"wonderful\\"? Nothing more original? And why does the author have to TELL us what's going on? Can't he SHOW us, the way really good authors do?With all that, this is a good book, and its especially appreciated by this fan of the movie. I advise you to watch the movie, if not buy the DVD, after or before reading the book. It's interesting to compare the two, especially since the book gives extra background on the characters.Biggest inconsistency: In the movie, Christian's friend Julie is small -- petite, I'd say. But in the book they describe her as, to be circumspect, big on top. It's annoying. I know it's romance novel syndrome -- all the characters have to be perfect in as many ways as possible, and for Julie, that means a big cup. But as I said, it's inconsistent, and also annoying."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"I haven't seen the film but I do get the idea it would be better than the book. The POV shifts are distracting and the side-characters' slight developement added nothing to the plot. I wanted to read about Christian and Aaron, not Traci, Ryder and Keith. The overall story was nice and sweet but the ending seemed rushed and didn't ring very real to me. It looks from the reviews that the movie would be the better choice in this case."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The tranformations of aaron and christian are amazing and beautifully depicted. Though the story is not a surprising one, the character development is great. I would recommend this book to others &amp; then send them to see this movie. There are some stellar performances!!!"},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"Predictability is not always a bad thing. The book followed the exact path that most romantic comedies do, yet the way that Fabris and Cox wrote it absolutely pulled at my heartstrings. I found myself caring for the characters, especially Lila, and ended up tearing about what happened to another. I laughed, I cried, I blushed, and still knew that the plot was the same as it ever was. Sometimes a story so beautifully written can take you to a place where knowing the ending leaves you satisfied. And I, a self-proclaimed jaded cynic, found myself satisfied."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"It's not bad, but it certainly doesn't merit the enthusiasm shown by some reviewers. It's basically a conventional romance plot, with characters whose motivations are completely unbelievable (it's never explained why either of these guys has the slightest interest in the other except that \\"they just fell in love\\" and are drippingly hottalicious). If this were a heterosexual romance it would be completely unremarkable and hardly anyone would pay attention to it. I fail to understand how changing one character's sex makes anything special out of what would otherwise be a tired potboiler. People should demand something more interesting, and more inventive, from fiction."},{"Title":"Latter Days: A Novel","review":"From all the recent hype, I checked out Latter Days as soon as I could, read it in one sitting, and absolutely hated it. The scenes, seperate from the book (as seen on in the movie trailer) is actually quite beautiful, but once it's put back into the novel and subjected to pages of plotless, mindless writing that has no moral and no endearing connection to the reader, the scenes lose their value. It's a cheap love story, the main problem being that the book is unable to convince the reader that between Christian and Aaron there is truly a love beyond physical attraction. It's shallow and uses the age-old, used and abused idea of the series of \\"miraculous incidents\\" in which, at the very end (and only by chance!) do the two lovebirds come together \\"as one\\". The author's stab is humor is pitiful, and the book is so horrific it may be hard to put it down. I highly recommend any book of Jim Grimsley's over Latter Days, which has as much value as a broken penny."},{"Title":"Loving Words Every Woman Wants to Hear (J Countryman Books)","review":"As a woman I think this is a great book.

Which restaurant do you prefer?&quot;, &quot;Sweetheart, I was wrong. Will you forgive me?&quot;. As well as 'loving words' the book also contains pictures of couples as backgrounds, Bible scripture, romantic vacation spots, romantic songs, important phone numbers (such as 1-800-flowers), and two pages of romance tips.

She's just lost a close friend, Hugo Baumgartner. When she gets back home, all that is left of Baumgartner's life are a few postcards sent by his mother during the Second World War. The German text on these postcards is always cryptic: &quot;Meine kleine Maus,&quot; &quot;Mein Haschen&quot; &quot;Liebchen...&quot; &quot;Do not worry, my rabbit, I am well. Are you well?&quot; &quot;Keep well, my mouse, and do not worry&quot; &quot;I am well...&quot; and they're signed &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Mutti&quot; or &quot;M&quot;.And so the reader begins to follow Hugo Baumgartner's life, starting with his childhood in Berlin. At the age of about eight, his father, a Jewish furniture retailer, soon loses his business, his store is ransacked by the Nazis and he is taken to a concentration camp. Baumgartner and his mother are forced to leave their beautifully furnished apartment and hide in the former office of the shop. At school, Baumgartner's situation becomes unbearable: his classmates chant to him: &quot;Baumgartner, Baum, hat eine Nase wie ein Daum&quot; (Baumgartner's dumb, has a nose like a thumb.) Eventually, his survival in Germany becoming a matter of days, his mother agrees to Herr Pfuehl's idea to send his son to India, since he has a few connections there in the furniture production business.There are many moving scenes as the reader discovers, along with Hugo, the sights, sounds and smells of Calcutta and Bombay. And moving too, the life of this pathetic and insignificant man Baumgartner who simply does not belong. Neither to Hitler's Germany nor to India's society, where he is a perpetual &quot;firanghi&quot;, foreigner, a wounded survivor.This novel is the achievement of a superior writer with a sharp perception about human nature, loss, solitude."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"This is the first book I have read by Anita Desai. It was memorable and thoroughly satisfying. One could not say that it was enjoyable as that would betray the emotions experienced on reading the book. I came away enthralled, though disenchanted with the world and its occupants, to say nothing of being more than a little depressed.The eponymous character is a kindly, benevolent old man, a foreigner in India, who is totally out of kilter with the world in which he lives. His fondness for cats betrays his need for relationships, given the evident absence of personal contact in his everyday experiences. In many ways, the only satisfying aspect of his life is the past, where he spends much of his time reflecting. His sole relationship with any meaning is with another extremely unhappy, demoralised expatiate who hates everyting about the circumstances in which she now finds herself.Together, they make a sorry pair. He is kind, mild-mannered, gentle, unassuming and much put upon. She is much more aggressive, though an anchronism, living very much in the better days of yesteryear. The world in which they now live is extremely unfogiving and unkind to them. The past they left behind, however, was equally unattractive.The ending was in many ways a blessing. The misery of the surroundings and the leading characters will live in my mind for a long time, as will the conduct of the self-absorbed young foreigner who brought this tale to a climax. In many ways, he is the epitome of all that is unacceptable today. The small kindnesses he experienced are disregarded and his selfish demands take precedence over anyone else's needs.If you are looking for a fast-paced thriller full of action, you have come to the wrong place. If, however, you want to enjoy a real story which challenges all of the emotions as well as having a beginning, a middle and an end then this book will deeply move you.All in all, a very sad story, made all the sadder by some of the most beautiful, compact writing you will ever encounter."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"I read this book on a long plane ride. Well, it was okay...not special, though intermittently interesting. I guess my main problem was that I could not quite empathize with the main character Hugo Baumgartner. As another review says - he is a passive character caught up in terrible events. Yeah, it sucks to be him - but he didn't seem to put in much effort into making his life more worth living! The parts involving his interaction with the cafeteria owner Farookh are amusing. The parts describing his childhood back in Germany are cute. The other parts (the camp, Calcutta etc.) are just okay.Another problem I had was that India has been potrayed by the author in excessively poor light. I know that over population, poverty, squalor etc. are major problems all Indian cities are faced with - but seriously, is that all Anita Desai knows about India? Being an Indian, it is a shame that she has nothing positive to say about a diverse and fascinating country with a rich culture.Well I guess 3/5 sounds about right for this book."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"Baumgartner's Bombay is a memorable and haunting tale of the holocaust and the resulting new wave of the dispossessed and grieving let loose on the world--in this case cast adrift in India.

The ending is a bit disappointing but the novel as a whole reverberates in the mind long after you put it down..."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"In the last one month I have read three books by Anita Desai, but this is only my first review out of the three. The reason behind it is that Anita Desai's writing always leaves me with a feeling of awe towards the author. Her language and her writing style is unparalleled in her genre and I feel extremely under qualified to review her works. So instead of making this a proper review, I am going to merely state my feelings from reading this book.Baumgartner's Bombay is the story of one Hugo Baumgartner and his life during the World War II. Hugo had the misfortune to be born into a Jewish family during the time of The Holocaust. When his father's furniture shop was ransacked and he was taken to a concentration camp, Hugo' mother sent him off to Calcutta with the hope of a better future for her son before going into hiding. But Hugo arrived at Calcutta only to be imprisoned for a long period. Once freed, he moves to Bombay where he rekindles his acquaintance with Lotte and makes a few new acquaintances too. But even then he remains a loner for most part as his true companions were not human, but cats for whom he used to bring scrap food.Starting with a murder at the beginning, Anita Desai continues to tell Baumgartner's story by tying up the present with the past. Hugo Baumgartner at a glance seems to be an extremely plain person with no strong personality. As the story progresses, we realize that there's more to depth to Hugo's character than we had initially thought. The loner's need for relationship/companionship is reflected in his apparent affection for the cats. His life from the time of The Holocaust and the following experiences were responsible for shaping up his life and his personality. I found Lotte's character to be a sharp contrast to Hugo. She had a certain belligerent persona that made her stand apart from Hugo.The ending was just perfect for how the story had been shaping up. The novel takes us on a ride to discover the importance of relationships, friendships and explore the feelings of loss and solitude. The best part of the story is the author's narrative style and her elegant writing style which has the quality to grasp the reader unawares and not let go. It simply compels you to delve further and further into the character's lives and feel their emotions in person.Awesome book and I recommend it to the people who are interested in reading quality fiction with some depth."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"This is a heart wrenching, wonderful book. It will be impossible to forget the character Baumgartner and what Bombay was like for him. Anita Desai's descriptions are wonderful, they are visual.

His mother agrees to send her only son to India, but when he arrives he is imprisoned in an internment camp as a 'hostile alien'. After six years, he is released and ends up in Bombay where he befriends Lotte, the unhappy dancer, Farrokh, the owner of a cafe, and Kurt, the young Aryan druggie, but mostly he spends time with his assortment of cat-friends who make visitors to his small apartment so uncomfortable they resort to holding handkerchiefs to their noses.The story opens with a murder and weaves present and past together in Desai's graceful style of prose, however it doesn't captivate the reader - or at least not this one. While I understood Baumgartner's life to be a miserable one, I didn't reach the point of empathizing with him. I understood the irony of his internment, and found humor in his exchanges with Farrokh and Kurt, but in everything I looked on as a passive observer"},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"Baumgartner, a German Jew, gets to India as a teenager, &quot;escaping&quot; the Holocaust. He makes a living there until his Indian patron dies, then retires at an early age into poverty. He never gets over the death of his mother, who refused to emigrate. He is a totally passive personality whose one joy is caring for stray cats in his small apartment. Not only is he a dull protagonist, but Desai withholds the few interesting parts of his life until toward the end. Is Desai investigating bigger themes, by looking at the world and Indian society through the eyes of such a character? Is she trying to prove that even such a person is worth exploring? More likely the former, since this is not really an in depth character study. The events pallidly reflected are interesting, Desai is a good writer, Baumgartner arouses some feelings of empathy, so book is readable."},{"Title":"Baumgartner's Bombay","review":"This is a stunning novel that cannot be summed up by the back of the book.

His mother could not be compelled to go with him.It had seemed like bedlam when he walked on what he assumed was British soil. He told Lotte years later that on his first day he ate curry. In Calcutta he stayed in a hotel on Middleton Row. He found he had to build a new language to suit the conditions.News from Europe became rapidly more alarming. During the war he was taken to an improvised camp at Fort William. Baumgartner was labeled a German and a hostile. He remained in captivity for six years. In the final camp he saw the Himalayas. He carried with him the habits of an only child and an isolated youth.In the present Baumgartner had a visitor, a blond-haired boy. After the war he had found a room off of Free Street in Calcutta.

But they lost me a tad when they started discussing aromatherapy and Chinese medicine, and then I started questioning most of the book.While I can appreciate this isn't a technical book, there is no attempt to show research studies backing up some of their claims, and some of the claims sounded like they were simply winging it in an attempt to paraphrase in an accessible way (\\"this causes heating in the brain\\"?? I'm hoping that was a typo). Other claims just sounded like pure BS, like they took the word of some schmoe in a pharmacy who claimed to know a lot about herbal supplements.While I don't doubt a more natural and nutritional approach to treating ADD works best for many people, I believe there must be far better books out there on the subject."},{"Title":"A.D.D.: The Natural Approach","review":"My husband and I have 3 children who are ADD, this little book has helped us so much that I would highly recommend reading anhd followimg the authors suggestions."},{"Title":"A.D.D.: The Natural Approach","review":"If you are just getting started with Natural Approach's to ADD this is a great guide book."},{"Title":"Library Displays on a Shoestring","review":"This book is mainly about what you can use to create a great (but cheap) display.It deals with 'disguising' every day items to make them something new and where you can buy cheap products to use (however this is only of use if you live in the USA).I found the book was very good and love the idea of hanging shelves in displays.It does contain some black and white photos of displays to illustrate what the author means which are very helpful (and provide you with lots of ideas anyway).Overall a really good 'construction' display book and a few good display ideas and themes thrown in."},{"Title":"Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names","review":"I am somewhat new at collecting succulents and joined the CSSA of Tulsa, OK just last month. I wanted this book to help me fit-in with discussions among veteran collectors and commercial growers. The book has indeed been enlightening in many ways, except in the area of pronounciation of Latin and/or Greek terms. For a book that is supposed to be a \\"Dictionary\\" with a price tag of $110+, I don't feel that such an expectation is out of line. The purpose of any dictionary is not only to clearify meanings of things, but to assist in virbally communicating those meanings to others. How is it pronounced? Which sylable is accented? What letters are silent? Is 'ch' pronounced ch as in child, or c as in cat? Also, though I wasn't expecting any, some illustrations would have been helpful at times. The book seems to want to target not only advanced botanists, but uninformed beginners as well.

Uffindell counts on a variety of primary and secondary sources. Nor does he depend heavily on British accounts; German, French and Dutch-Belgian sources are used as well, balancing the writing so that the reader can understand the why of the decisions made by the battlefield commmanders. There are maps, though not many of them, but clear and relevant to the accounts in the book. His after-battle analysis, leading to the impact the twin battles of Quatre-Bras and Ligny had 2 days later on their more famous cousins, Waterloo and Wavre, is excellent. Through it, you may (as I have) come away convinced that Ligny, though a French tactical victory, was a strategic defeat in that it was the best chance in the campaign for Napoleon to destroy one of the armies he faced during the campaign. If the Prussian army had been destroyed at Ligny, Waterloo would not have been fought. Strongly recommended for all readers."},{"Title":"The Eagle's Last Triumph: Napoleon's Victory at Ligny, June 1815","review":"This short, concise, and insightful book is not a tactical study of the battle, but rather an objective operational and strategic study. So maps, although plentiful, lack details. Among the author's conclusions are that Napoleon believed that defeating Britain, with the great financial support and subsidies that it gave, would end the coalition and war against him. As a result, he originally planned a quick advance on Brussels, but Blucher concentrated more quickly, forcing him to change his plans. Prussian Chief of Staff Gneisenau thought that his nation had no interests in Belgium and that the Brits alone should defend it. Wellington, expecting Napoleon to fight defensively behind fortresses like in 1814, was slow to respond but did not intentionally mislead Blucher about his difficulties in concentrating. Dutch-Belgian commanders at Quatre-Bras stayed in place, against orders, helping to save the situation. From their pre-battle conference, Blucher believed that Wellington would attack Napoleon's flank, but as he left, the Duke added, \\"if possible\\", which the Prussian may not have picked up on, as both the French and Prussian armies deployed with the hope of help from the west. Napoleon intended an encircling a flank attack by D'Erlon's corps and an attack on the enemy's center at Ligny, but his army encountered a great crisis and was on the verge of panic when D'Erlon's unidentified corps mistakenly approached Napoleon's rear. The crisis was ended, however, and Blucher rashly committed all of his reserves, making the battle ripe for Napoleon to commit the Imperial Guard. A decisive victory was stymied because of the blundering and miscommunication regarding D'Erlon's reserve corps. Although Napoleon had changed his plan and now intended to attack Blucher, the staff officer sent to get D'Erlon's support did not continue on to explain this to Ney. Ney recalled D'Erlon, who despite being in sight of the battle at Ligny, compromised and brought most of his troops back toward Quatre-Bras - but too late to effect that battle. Napoleon's orders were not precise, so D'Erlon had not advanced into the Prussian flank, but into Napoleon's rear, nearly causing a panic. All the parties involved are responsible in some way. The failure to achieve a decisive victory and the failure to pursue quickly the following day made Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo possible. There, the author argues, Wellington prepared, if necessary, to retire toward Ostend on coast, and not through the forest behind him. This implies a readiness to abandon Blucher, who, despite advice to the contrary, was prepared to stand by Wellington to the end."},{"Title":"The Eagle's Last Triumph: Napoleon's Victory at Ligny, June 1815","review":"Excellent campaign study of the battle of Ligny. Many good maps at both the campaign and tactical level (much improved from the 1st edition from 1994). Several good appendices on D'Erlon's meanderings, Ney's blunderings, communication breakdowns, and a tour of the battlefield today.Blucher emerges as the true hero, which is unusual in histories of the 1815 campaign. Good exposition of how the \\"other half\\" of this double battle (Quatre Bras) influenced Ligny. Very nicely written."},{"Title":"The Eagle's Last Triumph: Napoleon's Victory at Ligny, June 1815","review":"Uffindell clearly spent lots of time walking the battlefield and has an excellent knowledge of it. He is also enthusiatic about his subject and the book is a good read. However, it is bad history. Too often, the myths about the campaign are repeated as fact. Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors. This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer's work."},{"Title":"The Eagle's Last Triumph: Napoleon's Victory at Ligny, June 1815","review":"This book summarises the battle of Ligny neatly, putting it in tactical context with the twin battle of Quatre-Bras and 2 days later, in strategic context with Waterloo.Wellington comes across as an overly cautious general, Blucher as an over-enthusiastic general.And Napoleon? He continued to belittle the capabilities of his opponents, underestimated their fighting prowess, was careless, and was ultimately let down by his own generals and sloppy staffwork. Napoleon had himself to blame. Great opening moves, but failed to win the mid-game and was checkmated in the end-game."},{"Title":"Lit a Shuck For Texas (Louis L'Amour)","review":"This Kindle book entertained me on a short trip i took and of course Louis L'amour came through with these short stories like i knew he would."},{"Title":"Lit a Shuck For Texas (Louis L'Amour)","review":"A typical Louis L'Amour.

It is wonderful piece of writing, and many scholars call it Swift's best. However, even the introduction to the Bantam edition points out that we have to sometimes rely on scholarship to fill in many of the allusions in the text that have been lost to time.I enjoyed reading it, but found myself many times wondering what Swift's target or motivation was for writing certain passages.

If you're interested in educating yourself about Global Warming, this is an excellent place to start. My only complaint about this book is that Flannery's prose is maddeningly inconsistent. At times it's eloquent and bristling with urgency, at other times muddled and clumsy in its delivery. However, these are petty criticisms. The message of the book is the main thing and it's powerful - climate change is a serious threat to all of us and unless we do something about it right now it may be too late. Read it and decide for yourself what you can do. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I was enticed into purchasing this book by the positive blurbs on the cover by, among others, Jared Diamond. Also, I am basically in the \\"yes, we must do something\\" camp with respect to climate, and looked to find a deeper understanding behind this phenomenon.Overall, this book suffers from the same problem as Flannery's book on North America (The Eternal Frontier). Flannery seems to seize on a conclusion, and then flog his facts in line. In contrast, my impression is that Diamond (or Quammen, or any of a dozen other ecologically focused authors) are much subtler thinkers. That is, they find repeated, compelling narratives that all nudge you in a consistent direction. Flannery doesn't detour to give you the background, he sticks to the straight-and-narrow of his thesis. Myself, I want to have the story told, and the facts emerge: Flannery tells me the facts, and justifies it with stories. There is a difference.Besides this pedagogical problem, there's a UNITS problem. As an engineer, I appreciate this. But Flannery should have sorted degrees F from C, gigajoules from kilocalories, millions of gallons from cubic km, and while Sverdups are great fun, say what? The scale of problems, and their interrelations, is just a plain frank mess in this book.Yes, the book is largely right in its conclusions. Yes, it is laudable in its passion.Sorry: in my opinion it is flawed in its tone and execution. It ends up being, in my mind, ALMOST as flawed with ideology as the idiots he'd oppose -- and the high motives are obscured by a lack of care with consistent comparisons."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Like many people I always thought, maybe hoped, that the whole global warming thing was exaggerated. After all, when I was a kid we got told that we were heading for another Ice Age only to be warned some years later of a global warming problem?!?!.While at school a big fuss was also made about the depleting Ozone layer; something that somehow managed to drop out of the public debate since then. Not thinking about it too much, I suppose I felt that either the scientists initially exaggerated the problem or they easily found a way to fix it - something they could do again in future, should the need arise...Flannery puts all this (and much more) in context. He provides the complete picture as well as remedies needed and solutions available. All of this is done in a sober, reasonable and non-judgmental way.It is a gripping read that is as accessible as it is valuable. A must read for a generation that literally holds the key to the climatic future of Earth."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"A few weeks ago, while visiting South Australia's Yorke Peninsula (the place where European settlers have cut the native mulga forest to plant wheat and barley... and later discovered that it does not always rain enough to grow wheat and barley), I stopped by a local public library looking for an interesting Australia book. As my luck had it, I picked two, from the same shelf: Tim Flannery's \\"The Weather Makers\\", and Tim Low's \\"Feral Future: The Untold Story of Australia's Exotic Invaders\\". It turned out that these two books - both well written, well informed, and covering environmental subject of concerns to Australians as well as people worldwide - complement each other in some ways that neither author may have planned.The heart of Flannery's book is a martyrology of species that have already gone extinct due to the climate change now in progress, or those likely to do so as the climate change (warming, reduction in precipitation, fog, or cloud cover) continues. As a biologist closely working with many rare and endangered species, and, on occasion, having a chance to discover a tree kangaroo species just to see it become extinct within a few years, Dr. Flannery no doubt is in a very good position to appreciate the danger brought by climate change to many plant and animal species, as well as the tragedy of their loss to the mankind.As Tim Flannery's accessible and well-presented analysis of many extinction (or threatened extinction) cases shows, the extinct or doomed species are mostly those that are already on their last legs, due to the natural or human-induced causes. Some of them have lost most of their habitat during the last ice age, others during the warming that followed the ice age; some were extirpated from many areas when the Aborigines came to Australia with the spear and the firestick, others were helped to their grave by Anglo-Australians' bulldozers and ploughshares. As Flannery correctly emphasizes, it is the reduction and segmentation of suitable habitats that makes many plant and animal species especially vulnerable to climate change, as, with the wheat fields and housing estates in the way, they can't easily \\"move\\" from the northern to southern parts of their geographic province anymore.Although that's probably not Flannery's conclusion, it seems to me that in many cases the impending loss of these species, while tragic for the world's genetic diversity, and for those small areas where these species do find the refuge now, their extinction won't affect the ecosystems as they currently exist throughout most of the world: there, these threatened species have already disappeared.As the global temperature inexorably rises, what is coming to replace the doomed species and the ecosystems that they form? As Flannery suggest, many areas of the world are on the way to simplification or \\"uniformization\\" of sorts: the reindeer's and lemming's tundra may be replaced by the expansion of the moose's and squirrel's taiga forest; the polar bear's ice-covered Arctic ocean - with a seasonally ice free cold sea (similar to today's Bering Sea perhaps?); Amazonian rainforest, with a savanna of sorts. And to get a better idea of who *is* likely to survive in the new hotter world, Tim Low's \\"Feral Future\\" makes a good companion reader. It is all about creatures whose habitat, instead of shrinking (often, due to human activity), expands (often, not without human help). Widely adaptable, these species are likely to survive in the changing world, and likely even to benefit from the change sometimes, replacing the species that are losing ground. Forests of lantana and mimosa instead of the native species; rats and racoons instead of tree cangaroos; starlings and mynas instead of the native birds... this is what we are likely to see more and more, with or without climate change.Read the two books together and think of what the future may hold. It may not be all that unpleasant - if, after some millenia, the climate stabilizes again, the now-worldwide starlings or racoons may undergo a new wave of speciation, developing new narrow-ecologic-niche species, replacing those that are disappearing now. It's probably not the first time this happens, on the geological scale: there must have been other global extinction events, followed by the appearance of new narrow-niche species, descending from the adaptable wide-nice survivors.But in the present day, perhaps though the conservation biologists could pressure governments into funding captive breeding programs, to save some of the particularly threatened species for later reintroduction in the suitable environments - wherever those may be. Maybe we should be prepared to grow a new Great Barrier Reef around Tasmania, too :-)"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"If An Inconvenient Truth was not sufficient to convince you of global warming or as it's called now \\"climate change\\" or you need a lot more information on the subject this is for you. As far as indisputable truth lots of statistics and a solidarity stance of scientist across the globe this book is a 5 star book. Entertainment value is very dry and at times boring. Imagine if An Inconvenient Truth was a five-hour movie with specific statistics on several animals in several habitats the entertainment value is 3 stars. Unless your studying the subject for a school project or you're a person trying to gather information on climate change for what ever reason I would recommend this book for the rest of us the current common knowledge is good. This book can get very depressing and hopeless the author even admits that scientist have given up there research on climate change because the results where too depressing so do not look for this book to brighten up your day.

Doesn't the sun (solar cycles & CME's -- coronal mass ejections) impact global weather patterns (warming & cooling cycles) much more than manmade pollution?

I would then ask, no demand that they respond to the scenarios outlined and the science presented in this book. It does challenge the lifestyle that I lead and American society as a whole. Have we really understood what is at stake here? Perhaps the only real important diet that we must consider is the Carbon Diet that we must now undertake, immediately! This will not be a fad diet, but one that we must undertake to save our civilization. Tim Flannery, provides science that may be a bit daunting to the layperson, but for the seriously minded student it is critical science that cannot be refuted by those that seek to maintain the status quo and pretend that global warming could be a positive development. The day will come that future generations will curse our generation if they knew and did nothing. The Weather Makers illustrates that we, as the weather makers, will determine to what extent we will take our folly of doing nothing or if we will undertake the boldest, most courageous changes that a civilization has ever undertaken in the shortest time available.

It is an in-depth assessment, yet very approachable for all backgrounds- another fine example of a complex subject matter formatted for general audience appeal and understanding.The first 25 or so pages give one a complete over-view of all aspects of global warming and Flannery's easy, flowing writing style lures one deeper and deeper into the accounts of global warming and it deleterious effects on life all over the planet. From shifting and disappearing ecosystems to water scarcity to accelerating intensity of hurricanes, melting glaciers and rising oceans, there is much to consider for taking immediate action in reducing fossil-fuel use to drastically reduce heat trapping CO2 emissions.This book finishes with what the cost of doing nothing about global warming such as is the fossil-fuel industry notion of how taking corrective action will hurt the world economies, yet the insurance industry is warning of the dire consequences of increasing global weather related catastrophes and doing nothing is no longer an option. Flannery gives many examples of how citizens can reduce their energy use footprint and includes resources for taking action.Flannery makes several references to the work of James Lovelock (Gaia, etc.) and for further study and awareness of Earth weather and nutrient regulatory processes/dynamics, I highly recommend his book \\"Healing Gaia: Practical Medicine for the Planet\\". It is done in a beautiful coffee-table/textbook format and written for a general audience appeal."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Global warming is a very politicized scientific topic. Invariably authors treat the subject in extreme ways. The most common way is this is the end of the World as we know it (the alarmists). The other way is this problem does not even exist (the nihilists). Ideally, I'd like to see authors present the issue without reaching for polarized political opinions. This won't happen.In view of the above, this book gets nearly as good as it can get. Tim Flannery has an encyclopedic interdisciplinary knowledge of the subject. And, he does an excellent job of educating the reader about every aspect of global warming you could possibly think of. The breadth and depth of the material seems far superior to the one presented by many contemporary books. He clearly explains why hydrogen and ethanol are not the solution. This is because the production of these fuels will produce as much CO2 emission than the consumption of these fuels would save. His discussion on the factors that may exacerbate climate change is fascinating, including the slowing down of the Gulf Stream, and the demise of the Amazon's rain forest.Being Australian, the author maintains a reasonably healthy detachment from U.S. politics. This makes the book easy to read regardless of one's own political stripe. Thus, from an educational standpoint anyone can get a lot out of this book.So why don't I give this book a 5 rating? This is because he is definitely an alarmist. Global warming is far more debated within scientific circles than is suggested by the press. One simple reason for it is that data on global temperature is of terrible quality. We have reasonably good data for only the past 30 years. We have pretty bad data going back to 1860. Many of the qualitative weaknesses in that data set have contributed to understating global temperature by nearly half a degree Celsius a century ago. This underestimation of earlier global temperature accounts for nearly half of the supposed temperature increase over the past century. Prior to 1860, we rely on computer simulations that are all over the place. They perform mediocraly well for the past 400 years, but are worth little going back further in time. The weakness in this data undermines the alarming tone Flannery sometimes espouses. He states the Earth is now warmer than it has been in millions of years. That's simply false. The Earth has gone through several warming and cooling cycles since then. And, the south pole in such past time was occasionally nearly tropical. He further argues that a two degree Celsius increase in temperature would be catastrophic for a large segment of humanity. An increase in sea level rise of 2 inches could be cause for irreversible damages. He goes on: \\"If humans pursue a business-as-usual course for the first half of this century, I believe the collapse of civilization due to climate change becomes inevitable.\\" This series of statements are out of line with the unreliability and underlying trend of the data and the weakness in any statistically significant causation between CO2 levels and global temperature. (I conducted firsthand a Granger Causality analysis of the data). Given his polarized perspective, he recommends a nearly immediate reduction in CO2 emission by 70% below 1990 levels in an effort to stabilize climate change. That just realistically can't happen. We'd have to trade our cars for bicycles and our computers for pencils and paper.In the middle of the book, Flannery briefly hit the perfect note by stating: \\"Earth's climate system, however, is so riddled with positive feedback loops that our usual concepts of cause and effect no longer hold.\\" Unfortunately, Flannery strongly deviated from this one brilliant vantage point to quickly join the camp of unless we do the impossible (see bikes, pencils and papers above) we are toast (literally).As stated earlier, the book is so informative, well written, and easy to read that I still can give it a pretty strong recommendation. Let's face it, you will not educate yourself on global warming by reading objective books (there are none). You'll have to read quite a few with diverging points of opinions to develop a more independent, objective knowledge base."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This liberal climate ecology book is troubling to civilization ignoring all the signs he explains.

But its \\"science\\", and its plain general knowledge, are deplorable.E.g., Page 56 tells us that the width of tree rings tells us of past climates, \\"when the sun shone and the rain fell\\" (giving wide rings)versus \\"long hard winters or drought-blighted summers\\" (narrow rings). There's no mention of whether the tres were well-spaced or crowded, causing wide or narrow rings respectively.Page 124: \\"[I]ncrease in winter rain .. in 2003.. triggered a deadly avalanche season in Canada.\\" What actually happened was a whole class of 15- or 16-year ols school students were taken on a back-country ski trip in dangerous avalanche conditions and the majority were tragically killed in one avalanche. Nothing to do with global warming.Page 185: \\"Let's consider the Poles, where the icy water of the deep ocean comes to the surface.\\" Surely it's common knowledge that the South Pole is in the middle of a large continent.I could go on for several pages.

I can only assume that they read no more than the jacket blurb."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"If you want my opinion on the science presented in this book read some of the other 1 Star reviews. For me, I'll sum it up in one statement made by the author that I'll paraphrase, \\"If the IPCC says it's true on global warming you can take it to the bank.\\" As we now know it may not to the scientific bank, but could be to the political bank. Unlike some of the other 1 Star reviewers I did read the entire book and endured the endless hyperbole based on progressive think tank conjecture and less on fact. But I did learn a few things in the 33rd and 34th chapters. The title of Chapter 33 is, \\"2084: The Carbon Dictatorship\\". Progressive thinkers like Mr. Flannery could have produced the \\"Green Police\\" Super Bowl commercial and thought these were cup cake measures to make you conform to the dictates of a one world carbon controlling government body. It was even alluded to in the book that the blue hatted UN peacekeepers would replace their hats with green ones. Something even tells me that these green police would actually be given authority to enforce their rules, whereas the blue hatted guys typically aren't. Chapter 34 is titled, \\"Time's Up\\", and puts a face on something I've heard but never knew it had a name. It's the brain child of Aubrey Meyer and it's called Contraction and Convergence, or C&C. This book was written in 2004, and the push to Copenhagen in 2010 looks to have embraced this philosophy and actually tried to have agreements signed on it's behalf. Basically stated, poor countries could grow, while developed countries would \`contract', by shrinking their energy use by imposing very punitive energy taxes, i.e. Cap & Trade. By contract, the concept is to send billions of U.S. tax payer dollars to undeveloped nations that use 100 - 1,000 times less energy than does a U.S. citizen. So, the U.S. will not be whole heartily developing nuclear energy, fusion, or the next big carbon free sustainable energy producer to reduce CO2 in the U.S., instead we will send billions overseas to developing countries that do not emit that much CO2 to begin with, and many that do. How about we take a step forward through innovation and engineering versus backwards? Building one world carbon governments and windmills may feel good to some, but put the magnifying glass on it and things don't measure up."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I just heard Flannery on \\"Fresh Air\\", and he made an incredibly innumerate comment; he said the 2C rise in global temperature is a more than 10% rise in temperature, since the global average is only 13.5C.That is idiotic and suggests he is no scientist. In order to calculate % increase in temperature you need to use a scale that starts at absolute zero, such as Kelvin, not a scale with an arbitrary zero like Celsius or Fahrenheit.

However, consider this fact. The author makes no mention of the Sun burning warmer and it is currently out-of-sync with the Maurder minimum, the present established base line of solar activity. Bottom line up front: a hotter burning sun makes for a warmer Earth.Perhaps the Sun is an evil Republican working with secret instructions from Carl Rove?The author was part of the same group of people what was warning of us of a coming ice age in the 1970s. Now it's 2006 and we must have global warming.A group of Russian astronomers have forecasted the Sun will greatly reduce solar activity in the late 2010s. So, if the Sun burns cooler then you think it will be cooler? Nah. That's common sense. We can prove that with science rather than conjecture using computer programs. If there is a massive cool off in the post 2015 period will we get refunds from the gloom and doom crowd.This book does not mention increased solar activity. Instead it pushes that man made carbon dioxide is the cause of global warming. We don't know the facts. How can you trust a book that does not do an exhaustive study of solar activity? NASA has been observing Mars and the solar caps on that planet have shrunk since the early observations of the 1960s. This evidence is plain in any astronomy journal.

The book is likely one of the most comprehensive compilations of everything weather-related, which describes in layman's terms the history and current trends affecting the planet and its inhabitants.Pointing the finger primarily at CO2 emissions, the Australian scientist and researcher unveils wide-ranging analyses of different aspects of environmental degradation. Be it the hurricanes, the extinction of tropical frogs, the fate of deep-ocean fish or the heat-related deaths of thousands in Europe in one summer The Weather Makers has both the science and the scope to educate and stimulate discussion.The author argues forcefully in favour of the notion of 'gaia' postulating and demonstrating how the planet is an interconnected ecosystem and what every man, woman and business can and must do to avoid imminent extinction.The book is especially useful given its flair for personalizing events in far-flung areas of the planet. The island of Borneo lost an area the size of The Netherlands to fires caused by El Nino in 1997-1998. The book connects the dots between coal-fire electricity and the golden toad - which is now extinct. It shows why the hottest summer in Europe was 2003 and notes the arrival of the first south Atlantic hurricane in 2002. It notes scientists' projection that snow cover in the Scottish highlands will decrease by 60% within 40 years, drought may become a permanent fixture in NSW, Australia, how given a global warming of 0.8 to 1.7 degrees 18% of species will head for extinction and more.Several scenarios are discussed at relative length as well. These are the collapse of the Gulf Stream, the Amazon rainforest and the release of Methane from the sea floor.The author's own country Australia and its corporate prime minister Howard also come under scrutiny, while another reactionary, namely Tony Blair of UK, not only oddly receives some praise is also astonishingly quoted on the book's back cover.The last third of the book then shifts over to naming names, exposing culprits and proposing solutions and conduct an individual can use to turn things around.The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing The Climate And What It Means For Life On Earth is up to the challenge of the ambitious title. It will worry you, it will scare you, it will anger you and it will demonstrate why not taking action may make all of those the least of your worries."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I must like it...

I have walked away with a real sense of sadness that we as a species are probably to self centered to make the changes that we must if we want our economies to survive as the impact of our actions takes further hold on the planet's ability to support us. If I was in charge I'd make this book required reading for all politicians and all high school students. I will be looking for more books from this author.

These effects include mass species extinction, rise in temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, as well as its oceans, and sea level rise just to name a few.

He has written a thorough and well-argued brief for his position. He is clearly familiar with the range of scientific evidence that has been developed, and he does an excellent job of making it understandable and accessible to the average intelligent layperson.In brief, Flannery shows that our modern industries, based on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, are generating so much carbon dioxide that they are raising the concentration of that gas in our atmosphere at a significant rate. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps the heat energy of sunshine and warms the Earth. By raising the concentration from 280 ppm to 380 ppm over the last century, Flannery argues that we are having a significant impact on the atmosphere and climate. Business as usual will push this number over 750 by the end of the century, and lead to so much warming that we will face significant environmental catastrophe.Flannery is on his strongest ground when he describes the impact of warming on biodiversity. While the environment has weathered much climate change in the past (e.g. for much of Earth's history we had no polar icecaps, and even in the last million years we have had repeated ice ages come and go), the cold-adapted species would have nowhere to run in a warmer world. Tropical mountaintops and the polar regions have very vulnerable biodiversity that could not stand much warming.Flannery is weak in a few areas. He overstates the vulnerability of human society to climate change. There is a reason why malaria does not occur in Hawaii or Singapore, and that is wealth and resources. Human society will grow much wealthier over the next century and this will provide ample resources to adapt to climate change. The global economy is growing at about 4% per year, and even at 3% per year, we will transform our current global economy of 35 trillion dollars into one over 600 trillion dollars by 2100. That will certainly make it affordable for all of humanity to survive climate change.The biggest weakness of the book is that although Flannerty is intending to write the definitive argument in favor of immediate action, he does not address a number of serious objections to the scenario of doom that he posits. Although some global warming skeptics are shills for coal and oil producers, not all of them are. Richard Lindzen is a respected atmospheric scientist at MIT, and his arguments are not addressed, and another reputable scientist, Fred Singer, is dismissed, incorrectly, as a Moonie (not sure how that is relevant anyway). Lindzen has argued that the theoretical basis of global warming, the \\"global circulation models\\" that are used to model and predict the long-range climate outlook, are simply not good enough to answer the question at hand, and to rely on them to make this huge public policy decision is flawed.Another major critic of immediate action is Bjorn Lomborg, a statistician in Denmark and author of the book \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\". Lomborg accepts the basic theory of global warming, but argued that the IPCC scenarios for global warming are flawed and exagerrated by three critical factors. They overestimate human population growth in the coming century, they used market exchange rates rather than purchasing power rates to estimate the size and predict the growth of Third World economies (these make for huge errors in India and China's predicted emissions), and they assume both massive increases in fossil fuel use along with persistent low prices, something we can see is unrealistic. Lomborg argues that if one uses correct assumptions, and takes into account the dampening effect of rising prices and falling costs of solar and wind power, we will never reach the doomsday scenarios.Flannery should have addressed these major issues to strengthen his own case. While he argues strongly for the US to join the Kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of CO2, he should have also made the case for an international agreement on a maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration that all nations agree to target. Even still, his is a very important contribution to this issue, and should be read by those who are true believers and by skeptics with an open mind. The future may depend on it."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Read it. It's not too late to alter the direction of climate change. The Weather Makers is a terrific, fascinating, and informative sum-up of this hugely contentious and overly politicized subject. Read it and decide for yourself. If, like me, you decide that Flannery is right, it's not too later to start doing your part. And like Pascal's Wager, even if he isn't quite right, it does less harm than good to change anyway. Can we really afford to risk the very future of the human race?Flannery does a very good job of anticipating and proactively defusing most of the objections one usually hears for changing our attitudes and behavior regarding the climate. It's too expensive, it'll destroy too many jobs, whole economies will fall -- and so forth. On the contrary, Flannery shows how altering our current course and paying more attention to the climate can actually stimulate economies and spur growth.Speaking as a lay person, I can't say whether this is the best possible explanation of the science of climate change, but I certainly found it convincing. And Flannery's writing is never dull.

Easily 5 stars, the highest rating, for its reasoned, common-sense guide to a complex subject, which largely avoids partisan politics and alarmist reactions. Of more than 30 books I've read on the subject, this is in the top three, the other two being \\"With Speed and Violence - Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change\\" by Fred Pearce; and \\"Hell and High Water - Global Warming, the Solution and the Politics, and What We Should Do\\" by Joseph Romm."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I have read many books that relate to this topic in one way or another. The value of this one is that it manages to include ideas from many disciplines and anticipate all of the skeptics' arguments. The arguments against global warming tend to be ad hoc and depend on very specific, and sometimes small details. This book give a very broad picture of all the evidence and fields of study that play into the global warming situation. Of course, in a book of this length, everything must be summarized, so at times it may seem like the author is simply asserting things without a lot of reference to the evidence, but rest assured, the evidence does exist and if you want to know about it, there are other books on each individual topic. For someone who already knows something about global warming, this book puts all the arguments into perspective and is a big call to action. For a skeptic, the book might appear to be sensationalist. Sadly there are a few key phrases that are such hot button issues, that they could potentially overshadow all of the good the book does. One example would be where he mentions how a carbon trading scheme could serve to transfer wealth from rich to poor countries. This is exactly the criticism leveled on the UN by global warming skeptics. Michaels and Balling use almost that same line in one of their books to discredit the UN's efforts. Still, when it comes to the details, Flannery seems to be right on about almost everything from paleoclimate studies to the prospects of a hydrogen economy. If you have never read any books on global warming, this would be a good one to start with."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Was sick of hearing about climate change.

Makes a few assumptions I am uncomfortable with.... but then again I'm not very comfortable with the opposing views either. There are a lot of uncertainties in the changing climate and Flannery is happy to point those out. This is not a book selling an opinion, but stating facts as they are known and the uncertainties as they stand.Been a long time since I've read a book as interesting, thought provoking and life changing. On the strength of this book we are making changes to our farms and businesses, with an aim to sustainability."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is a well-documented, in-depth look at human caused damage to the environment. It heralds as a wakeup call to humanity that the planet cannot bear such a burden (this burden being primarily CO2, but also incorporates other man made chemicals and green-house gasses). The author leads the reader through the vast aspects of the environment being effected, the history of our impact, and current day ecological devastation. He also uses his best scientific estimates to project future destruction if humanity keeps on this current course. He does end the text on a positive note however, leaving room for solutions that can be implemented on the individual, corporate, as well as governmental level.What I really liked about this book was the historical background, the acknowledgement of past climatologist's mistakes and the counter arguments for the nay-sayers of today. The reason I was impacted by these three things, is that I feel it is truly important to be intellectually honest and deal with past mistakes, as well as engage the possible loopholes that are posed against global warming. I also appreciated the detail put into his projections of future devastation and how these were reached.Where I found the book a little lacking was in overall readership. He has laid out his table of contents with amazing order and accuracy, yet when you enter the body of the text, I found myself quite often confused as to how one paragraph led to the other. Although this did detract somewhat from my overall ability to fully engage each chapter, it did not detract from the substance that I took away and have benefited from.Overall I recommend this book, and I am happy to now know why the planet is getting colder in certain areas even though overall the planet is warming."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The topic of global warming is a hot button issue, and deservedly so. Numerous persons, most in the pay of fossil energy combines, have raised a plethora of objections and evasions, so confusing and politicizing the matter that the average person hardly knows where to turn for accurate information, a state of affairs not helped by outlandish claims from some \\"journalists\\" posing as scientists on the \\"green\\" side of matters. (See my earlier review of \\"Thermogeddon.)For those of you who would simply like an objective, essentially non-partisan view of the issue, with easily understood data, presented in a pleasurable, relaxed manner, THIS IS YOUR BOOK!!!!!!!Professor Flannery's credentials are unimpeachable. He is a leading zoologist who has intensively examined the effects of rising temperatures on wildlife and plants, particulary in the Southwest Pacific, New Guinea, and Australia. In order to more fully understand the causes of the changes he has been, and is continuing to observe, Dr. Flannery has become an expert on the matter of climate change, and its many causes. That expertise wells up repeatedly and effortlessly in the excellently-written, carefully-organized pages of this text.\\"The Weather Makers\\" repeatedly demonstrates, and refutes, the many fallacies being propogated by those who would sell the future for a short-term profit now. Such things as the \\"Medieval Warming\\", for example, are shown to be highly exaggerated at best. Dr. Flannery's narrative of coming extinctions are dire to a point of depression, but he continually shows the reasons for these predictions, and their factual support.The book contains an excellent history of how man and his agriculture and industry, as well the Milankovitch astronomical cycles, are combining to warm the Earth faster than at any time since the Eocene mass extinctions. It is readily apparent that the problem of climate change/global warming is not one created by one or two heedless political elections, but one that has been growing for several hundred years at a minimum. However, again with extenive factual support, Dr. Flannery shows how our climate is alsmost seismographically sensitive to the slightest perturbations, and that we are now at a point where one too many of these changes, e.g. a continuing increase in greenhouse gases, might plunge our climate, and our civilization into an abyss from which recovery would be almost impossible at best.I confess that I am almost unduly impressed with this book's unraveling of the most important problem of our time. The importance of this book cannot be overstated. Consider the events of JUST THE LAST YEAR: vast prairie wildfires in Texas, giant forest fires in Alaska and Indonesia, intense hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, dust storms and drought in Asia, Australia, and Africa, and the decay of thousands of square miles of the polar ice caps. All these are connected. This book shows you how and why.My recommendation is as high as I can make it.

If you have a climate change sceptic friend or relative then please buy them this book and ask them to argue the science.The 'what you can do' section at the end is pretty light on so if you are looking for answers to the issue this isn't going to fill the void. The main point is that until we get a common consensus that this IS a major problem and that we need to do something about it, the best thing we can do is to alert others to the problem and this book did that for me."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I realize some prefer this book toThe Winds of Change: Climate, Weather, and the Destruction of Civilizationswhich just edged this one out in my personal opinion--see my review of the other book for a sense of why.This book is, however, easily of the same caliber, and more readable to boot. The author points out that climate change is different from \\"limits to growth\\" focused on resources. He is less focused on and consequently provides less detail than others on the intimate relations between climate, water scarcity, disease, poverty, and failed states. He does emphasize that absent more respect for climate change, human health, water, and food security are all at risk.The author points out that the Earth's average temperature for the past 10,000 years has been 57 degrees Fahrenheit, and focuses his book on the need to transition to a carbon free economy.Among the points he makes that jumped out at me: only four nations have refused to sign the Kyoto Treaty: the US, Australia, Morocco, and Liechtenstein.His best chapter for me was focused on the cost BENEFITS of addressing climate change.He attacks the oil and coal companies for disinformation, which has unfortunately had great effect. He likens them to dinosaurs with dinosaur brains that have been wounded, but stagger on.As a former clandestine case officer, long fed up with the tens of billions of dollars we waste on satellites (most of whose data we cannot make sense of in a timely or coherent fashion) I was quite pleased to have the author recount a story about the conflict between satellites in space and lowly thermometers on the ground. The satellites were averaging the temperatures of the cooling stratosphere with the warming troposphere, and getting ground truth wrong. As I like to say over and over again, ground truth comes from the ground, not from satellites.In his conclusion, the author notes that both the energy grid and the transport grid are candidates for decarbonization, but between the two he recommends the energy grid as the first priority. Readers may be interested to know that the same month that Vice President Cheney was meeting secretly with Enron and Exxon and others to plan the invasion of Central Asia and Iraq, WIRED Magazine published a thoughtful cover story on how to get from the wasteful (50%) one way energy grid to the much more productive two way and localized energy grid. This is not about brains; it is about ideology in the White House against practicality and the common interest across the Nation.The author ends with a simple and credible 11 item list of ACTIONS that translate into IMPACTS."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"CO2 is responsible for about 80% of global warming; methane (another 15-17%), nitrous oxides, and CFC gases are also culprits. Power plants are the greatest source of man-made CO2 (41%), followed by oil (39%), and gas (20%). CO2 levels in the atmosphere were about 280 parts per million (ppm) prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution; now they are at 380. Doubling these levels has the potential to heat our planet by about 5 degrees F, maybe even 10 degrees - levels that are considered the boundary of safe change.\\"The Weather Makers\\" explains why this is far more serious than a matter of slightly warmer weather. It is no mere coincidence that over the past decade the world has incurred devastating hurricanes, the hottest European summer (killed 26,000 in two months), rapid melting and break-up of glaciers and ice caps, and long droughts over large areas.Flannery also points out that global warming started by these gases feeds on itself, and thus could suddenly overwhelm the earth. For example, ice/snow reflect up to 80-90% of sunlight, vs. 5-10% for water - thus, melting icecaps also add to global warming. Meanwhile, while oceans have absorbed nearly half of all carbon emitted by humans from 1800-1994 (there are 50 molecules of CO2 in the ocean for every one in the atmosphere), their ability to do so decreases as temperature rises - in fact it has decreased about 10% from the 1980's to the 1990's. Further, it takes the surface about 30 years to absorb heat from the atmosphere - thus, today's oceans still only bear the impact of the 1970's atmosphere. Finally, the atmosphere's ability to hold water doubles with every 14 degree increase, making storms and flooding more and more damaging.Flannery posits three possible \\"tipping points\\" caused by global warming. 1)The Gulf Stream stops functioning as a result of decreased salinity in the North caused by melting polar ice - this results in a 5-7 degree cooler Europe and Eastern U.S., and a dryer/hotter Africa. 2)The Amazon forest dies off, due to hotter temperatures and reduced rain - this, in turn releases massive additional amounts of CO2 from decomposing vegetation on the ground. 3)Frozen ice at the ocean bottom contains about 50 times as much methane as recoverable natural gas found throughout the world; massive amounts of CO2 and methane are also trapped in permafrost - both could be released by and add to global warming.Flannery points out that some coal companies claim increased CO2 will \\"fertilize\\" our crops and create increased yields. Experiments, however, have found doubling CO2 yields only a 6-8% improvement in rice and wheat; meanwhile, the accompanying decline in rain would reduce yields overall.Nations have successfully worked together to prevent environmental disaster before - the 1985 Vienna Protocol banning CFC's which break up the UV-blocking ozone in the upper atmosphere. (Luckily CFCs use chlorine instead of bromine - bromine would have multiplied the damage by a factor of ten.)The U.S. and Australia are the only major developed nations that have not signed Kyoto. (Kyoto, however, needs to be strengthened by a factor of twelve to hold CO2 to levels twice that of pre 1800 levels.) The holdouts argue their case on the basis of cost - however, storm damage alone is steadily rising, and will reach $500 billion/year by 2050; in addition there are increased crop losses, cooling costs, disease, etc.Solutions: Wind, nuclear, and photo-voltaic power, in addition to improved combustion processes and conservation."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"In an entirely readable treatment of all the aspects of global warming from scientific research and discovery through causes and effects and assessment of present danger to the future of planet Earth, Tim Flannery has left no stone unturned. One would have to be an ostrich to ignore the immediate urgency of this situation, but at the same time the author does not leave the reader with a feeling of hopelessness. Instead he spells out the means that individuals, corporations and national, state and local and government can employ to turn the processes around before it is too late!"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is the first (or the next) book you should read on climate change (global warming). Many books on climate change and global warming have come before, but none share the balance, breadth, and accessibility of Tim Flannery's The Weather Makers. This man is a trained scientist and a good writer, and one senses that he really cares about communicating to all of us what he knows, so that we may choose intelligently what to do about it.In Chapter 1, Flannery introduces the topic of Gaia, the notion that the whole of planet Earth is one large organism. Flannery briefly presents controversy surrounding this idea among scientists. He concludes that while the scientific evidence supporting Gaia is slim, it provides a way of thinking that reminds us that many aspects of our environment are very tightly intertwined with each other, and that what happens in one place does not happen in isolation. He likes the term Gaia, not so much on its scientific merit, but because it conveys the interconnectedness of all things environmental.This is just one example of Flannery's considered approach to controversy and opinions. While many authors choose to tell the reader the \\"correct opinion\\", Flannery almost always takes the time to take you patiently through the arguments before coming to his conclusions. You may agree or disagree with him, but no matter what, you'll be better equipped to come to your own conclusions. Some of the chapters are introductions to topics that deserve (and usually have) books of their own. Fortunately, Flannery, the scientist, includes good references to his sources for those who want to read more.The chapters are concise, and the plan of the book flows well. In reading it, you will learn fascinating facts about the natural history of the earth, earth sciences methodologies (how we know what we know, and what we don't know yet), energy science and engineering, the pitfalls and opportunities in global politics (who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys), and some things we can do as citizens of the world. Many of the things we are told are depressing, but the book as a whole replaces depression with a sense of urgency to act, and act now, like, right now. We have, perhaps, three years to get solving the carbon problem on a worldwide basis. For example, the people of Cape Cod who resist an off-shore wind power farm because it will interfere with their view should not be allowed to stop it because the alternative contributes to global warming. For example, we can't wait to replace the Bush administration with one that is more in tune with the urgency at hand; we must work with Bush's team over the next two years, as difficult as that may be. Time is of the essence.I once thought that those of us who are members of the baby boomers will escape the brunt of the effect of atmospheric CO2, and that our concern should be focused on the legacy we leave our children and grandchildren. However, Flannery touched on a subject that made me realize that the problem is not so far in the future and may impact all of us in the next few years: the interaction of the coming oil shortage upon our decisions about global warming. If, in the next few years, countries become acutely focused primarily on securing energy to keep our economies whirring along, such pressing problems as global warming, whose impact will be felt long after the next election cycle, will take the back seat and won't be confronted as aggressively as they should. That would be a terrible circumstance to find ourselves in. We need to act while we can, without the pressure of heightened energy shortages to cloud our decision-making.After reading this book, I feel much more informed on a wide range of topics surrounding the effect of humans on the Earth's climate. I am sending copies to my children, and recommending to everyone I see. We can, and must, make a difference, both in our personal lives and in our political lives. The future of mankind, of the planet as we know it, rides on what we do. You owe it to those you love to be informed about humanity's impact on global climate. Flannery's book will quickly get you going."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The last reviewer is very innacurate in his effort to portray this book as innaccurate. So I thought I would coutner his arguments.Pg56: You're missing the point, he's talking about variations from year to year, not from tree to tree.Pg124: 2003 WAS actually a very deadly avalanche year with many avalanches all over BC, not just the one accident you mentioned.pg185: You're simply interpreting that he means the exact pole, which he clearly isn't. His affirmation that icy water from the depths comes to the surface near the poles is accurate.So lighten up, and take the book for what it is, a very well written and informative document. It is a very important book that I wish everyone would read, especially the oil and coal industries who are pillaging the planet for short-term profits."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This book made me finally commit to a green likestyle. It scared the crap out of me. We may finally have reached the tipping point in use of carbon fuel for energy and destroyed the planet along the way. This is not fiction!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I had a lengthy review of this and Elizabeth Kolbert's \\"Field Notes from a Catastrophe\\" published in the Dallas Morning News, and I have put it online at my Science Shelf website.Flannery's book transformed the Australian government's discussion of this issue, though they still have not signed on to the Kyoto accords. I can only hope that it will have a similar effect on the U.S. government, which is currently fiddling while the Arctic ecosystem melts away and coral reefs and coastal communities worldwide are threatened.The book describes the threats but also discusses the technological fixes at our disposal. The following two paragraphs from my review describe what I see as its most significant new idea.Of particular note is his discussion of \\"Time's Gateways,\\" which mark abrupt, irreversible transitions in global or regional climate. He makes a plausible case that a \\"magic gate\\" opened in the western tropical Pacific Ocean in 1976. Before that year, the region's surface temperature frequently dropped below 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Since then, it has rarely been below 77. Another gateway came in 1998, which seems to mark a dramatic change in the El Ni&ntilde;o-La Ni&ntilde;a cycle. Both of these changes have resulted in dramatic shifts in rainfall patterns, including extended droughts in the African Sahel, Australia, and southeast Asia.Arguably, those events may be no more than transitory fluctuations. But they may instead be harbingers of more serious transitions to come as the world's climate passes through other gateways later in this century. If they are the latter, the contrarian strategy of waiting for more data before acting is risky business indeed."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Even though this book is already five years old, it still serves as an excellent primer on man's role in the climate change dialogue. It's hard to argue that the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is not anthropomorphic after you read Flannery's description.This is a good book to get a condensed and understandable primer on climate change and man's role.It's only weakness is that it lacks an analytical basis and will not satisfy those who need lots of numbers to justify results. However, the book is aimed at a general audience and makes no claims otherwise. It is also very well written and concise. A good first lesson on climate change. However, better read it soon, as the effects of climate change are already on top of us leaving fewer options every day, at least according to Flannery."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery takes the scary and curious words of global warming to a whole new level in his book, \\"The Weather Makers.\\" The book is divided into many sub divisions that make the terms and concepts much easier to understand than if you would read the information as a regular book. Published for non-scientists and scientists alike, Flannery successfully appeals to nearly all audiences. This book could almost be considered to be a global warming encyclopedia as it covers all aspects of the before, during, and after effects of life here on earth and how humans are contributing to this.Flannery takes the criticism that global warming receives, from those who believe that the changes are completely natural and that no severe precautions need to be taken, and channels them into the reality of the human effects of climate change. Currently, there is heavy physical evidence of the effects of the ocean temperatures increasing on marine life. Coral reef has been experiencing the most drastic effects seen yet with severe bleaching of many reef species. The coral is essential to marine life in countless ways and with the increase in bleaching and dying of the reef the ocean will be seeing even more dramatic effects very soon. The underwater effects will be quickly seen as above water consequences.Flannery provided quite a lot of research on the topic of transportation as well as it is known to emit the second largest amount of carbon emissions. Following energy, transportation is without a doubt needing to be changed around the world. The new creation of ethanol gas made from corn was thought to help on the amount of emissions although it has seen little improvement on the topic. In fact, the amount of fossil fuels is takes to grow and harvest the corn to produce the ethanol gas hardly even shows a reduction in the emissions. What needs to be tackled is the switch to hybrid vehicles completely. This will reduce every person's individual carbon footprint and begin to make immense reduction of emissions. Flannery argues strongly that with the fast paced changes that are occurring today, the effects that we will soon see will not be delightful. Individual, societal, and governmental matters need to be taken to create an overwhelming response to this serious and not so pleasant situation."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Global warming, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, is an incontrovertible, unassailable fact. Yes, a few flat-earth folks remain who argue that more proof is still needed. Thousands of objective technical reports, published in refereed scientific journals, clearly show the case is already made. In the scientific community, there is no debate: Climate change, caused by humans, is here. And, unless we quickly do something about it, the end results could be cataclysmic. We recommend Tim Flannery's impassioned book about climate change. This book will thoroughly educate you regarding the dangers of global warming and will tell you what you can do to address this shared problem. It is hard to imagine a more vital topic."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery's \\"The Weathermakers\\" is not only an eloquent plea for the industrialized world to deal with the problem of climate change, but provides the science needed to understand this huge and vital topic. The book is spooky great fun too, with frights and chills enough to get the attention of any thrill seeker. Except that the thrills here come from contemplating near-irreversible global cataclysms that would wipe out humanity or make life darned near intolerable for us.Flannery is terrific at making difficult science easy to understand, without dumbing it down or condescending to his audience. This was greatly aided by the narrator of the audio book, Drew De Carvalho, whose wide-eyed Aussie delivery was akin to the joy and wonder of that other fine Down-under naturalist, Steve Irwin. Flannery discussed the Earth's tumultuous climactic past, using data obtained from tree rings and ice cores, to paint a picture of a dynamic planet whose climate and biota have varied wildly over its existence. Glaciers advance and retreat. Gargantuan upwellings of methane overwhelm the biosphere. Oceans rise and fall hundreds of feet. Changes in atmospheric gases permit or debar shellfish from secreteing the carboniferous husks that pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. The message: what Earth has done, it can do again.Flannery does a wonderful job of explaining the large weather phenomena known to most laymen -- carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, changes to the Gulf Stream, warming trends, etc. But he is equally good at describing the lesser-known but important elements that factor into climatic equations. I was not aware that transpiration -- the release of moisture from Amazonian trees -- was a main cause of precipitation in the region. I had never heard of clathrates, huge fields of methane-infused ice that underlie the oceans. And I had never thought of climate change literally chasing certain heat-sensitive species up into alpine regions, until they run out of room and become extinct. Flannery is also wonderful at explaining the feedback loops that, once triggered, can accelerate certain climatic trends. Air conditioning powered by burning coal can increase levels sulfur dioxide in rain, acidifying the oceans, making it harder for shellfish to secrete shells, thus leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere, causing further warming and leading to the need for more AC, and so on.Climate change to Flannery is not a theoretical possibility, but a certainty whose effects are visible today. He tells of the now-extinct South America Golden Toad, whose habitat was fed by moisture in low-lying clouds, being wiped out when a Pacific ocean hot spot caused mist-giving clouds to form just slightly higher up the mountainside than usual. His tale of the bleaching of the reefs like Great Barrier Reef -- in which huge swaths of coral reefs ejected their symbiotic algae, then bleached and die in a single season -- was frightening and sad. His discussion of the measurable changes in salinity in the Gulf Stream -- changes that could imperil its flow with deleterious effect on climate -- was terrifyingly plausible. Most chilling of all, Flannery's telling of the planet's near-miss with significant ozone depletion (due to industry's fortuitous use of chlorine rather than hyper-reactive bromine in aerosol cans and refrigeration systems) underscored how easy it is for humanity to fatally foul our nest without even realizing we are doing it.The book is alarming, but not alarmist. It does not seek the cheap thrill of scaring us to sell copies, but to educate and forewarn. Flannery is not afraid to call out the human practices that are warming our planet. Transportation needs (which account for 30% of CO2 emissions), accelerating burning of carbon-rich fossil fuels, and shortsighted self-interest are high on the list of culprits. Flannery points the finger at the big coal-gorging countries in the world -- the US and Australia among them -- for significant criticism. Neither does he spare the industrial giants who use deceit, misinformation and political contributions to steer politicians (and the public) away from limiting profitable, planet-damaging enterprises.I came away from the book with a new appreciation for the complexity and the fragility of the Gaia -- the living organism that is the Earth. \\"The Weathermakers\\" increased my appreciation of the path on which we have put our world. If Flannery's descriptions and predictions are true, our fossil-fuel-burning habits have already committed us to significant extinctions of species and significant discomfort for ourselves. As Flannery states, future generations will curse ours if we see the looming problem and fail to take action to correct it. Flannery is hopeful (else, why write such a book?) about our ability to turn things around. He evaluates technological and political solutions to the problems he poses, which not all will like, for carbon-low solutions include wind, geothermal, solar and (gasp!) nuclear power generation. And Flannery dismisses certain hopeful technologies like hydrogen and biomass. Flannery is also hopeful that past global cooperation -- of the type that limited the production of ozone-killing CFCs -- will be repeated, as human beings band together to save their world.\\"The Weather Makers\\" is a wonderful book that can open your eyes to the complexity of our world, of the difficulties of addressing climate change without wrecking economies, and of our responsibility to pass our planet, reasonably intact, to our children. Its stacks of facts can sometimes numb the mind, but they are the data needed to combat ignorance and deceit one often encounters when trying to persuade our friends and neighbors about the possibility of anthropogenic climate change."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery, well-known for his writing on the unique ecology of Australia, turns his attention to the pressing issue of global warming with \\"The Weather Makers\\". As the disappearance of the southern winter rain belt hit home in 2006, Flannery deservedly won an Australian of the Year award for exposing the continent's shameful record on greenhouse gas emissions.\\"The Weather Makers\\" begins in a quite slow fashion with a look at past climate changes and how they have occurred. Flannery, in a very scientific manner, gives a very detailed account of how the Earth's climate evolved, and how scientists gradually found out the role of carbon dioxide in making the Earth habitable by increasing temperatures. He looks at these things in quite revealing detail and the goes on a journey through geological and human history to illustrate how humanity developed in an era dominated by long periods of very cold weather in which most of the unusually fertile land of Europe, North America and New Zealand was covered by glaciers. Flannery then looks, in very close detail, at how coal and oil were formed and shows, in remarkably simple and legible language, how fossil fuels form and explains why they are so rare in comparison with the present demand for them. He also shows, in quite simple language, how they burn and why they vary so much in their usefulness as fuels.It is the last half or so of \\"The Weather Makers\\" that is really revealing and something that must be read by global warming sceptics and especially by those who are in doubt or overtly nervous about action. Flannery shows, contrary to popular belief, that climate moves as carbon dioxide increases from one metastable state to another, and that the changes - like the 40 percent drop in Melbourne rainfall in October 1996 - are quite abrupt and, as we are seeing in Australia today - extremely liable to be disastrous. His illustration of the declines in rainfall over southwestern Australia are especially noteworthy. Flannery also does a marvellous job of showing how species, especially in tropical mountains that are effectively cool \\"islands\\", global warming has already driven extremely old species like the golden toad to extinction through changing the level of the cloud layer. The very fact that such species have become extinct should, of itself, be enough to quash notions - still popular amongst the most fertile sections of modern humanity - that global warming is not real.Flannery also writes an excellent section titled \\"The Great Stumpy Reef\\" about threats to the Great Barrier Reef from global warming and coral bleaching.The last part of the book, which looks at the Kyoto Protocol, is however clearly the weakest part of the book. Whilst I do not question Flannery's point that there are a large number of vested interests controlling politics in Australia and the US that prevent public ratification of the Kyoto Protocol regardless of its ineffectiveness, I am still critical of Flannery for his failure to recognise that - contrary to conventional wisdom - Australia and the Republican states of the US do not belong to the same culture as the rest of the West. Rather, they retain a value system that disappeared from Europe a hundred years ago and from Blue America, Canada and New Zealand in the 1960s and 1970s. I have no doubts myself that Australia would not refuse to take the most radical action on greenhouse emissions like eliminating car travel and coal power were it not for a rapidly growing and socially ultraconservative bloc of voters becoming the dominant force in its politics. Flannery, in contrast, never looks at public opinion in Australia beyond the stereotyped liberal view that the public is less conservative than government.The rise of One Nation and Family First in Australia, and the number of conservative, climate-sceptic sites on the web form the US, should be proof that public opinion is actually more conservative than Flannery would like to believe. He also does not consider the serious question of what an increasingly ultraconservative Australian public will think when rainfall declines in Melbourne and Perth become even worse than they have already.He also does not look at whether international bodies' failure the greater ecological vulnerability of Australia (which he ought more than anyone to have known about) idea of assuming equal reductions for all countries as the right way to reduce emissions radically wrong. I myself believe Australia should have been internationally targeted long before any efforts at dealing with any other nation's emissions were even considered.Nonetheless, for all Flannery's failures on the cultural front, \\"The Weather Makers\\" is still a most impressive read packed with information to arm yourself against the climate change sceptics and to harden your views if you are in doubt."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"A must read book for everyone.

And \\"Seekers\\" aren't convinced yet. Apparently Flannery and everyone else on the planet has become an \\"Alarmist\\" for reasons best know to themselves.

Please.

It's tragic that those with a narrow self-interest for publicity or the next quarter's results ever managed to keep the debate going past the point where the central fact became known: Mankind is warming the globe with greenhouse gasses and this is a problem.Fortunately most people now know that this debate is over.There is, however, plenty of debate about how best to act. The real debate is in an area we *really* don't understand: economics (if any economist fully understood their subject they'd be rich). The economic, political, entrepreneurial, civic, and national security areas are the ones that now deserve our attention. That is a better use of time than listening to the 1/10th of 1% of scientists that still dispute even the idea of global warming, or whether HIV causes AIDs, or whether sugar-free gum is better for your teeth.There are things to do, problems to solve (and money to be made). It's time to change lightbulbs for swirly ones, buy more efficient appliances and cars, adjust A/C or heating, invest, buy CO2 offsets, get green energy from your utility, and to pray, and vote our way to making a difference."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I first became aware of this book by an Article in Playboy Magazine that was assembled from excerpts. (Of course I buy the magazine only for the articles.) The hype in front of the article was a little overdone, but I was intrigued. Two things were apparent: this was a very accessible article, being well written in a colloquial style, and all of the bad things that our inadvertent modification can cause to our environment were collected in one place--a lot of bad news. And I have to admit that in my losing battle with time, I thought I got all I needed from the article and would not have to spend the time to read the whole book.Shortly thereafter I was fortunate enough to catch an interview with the author, Tim Flannery, on National Public Radio's program \\"Fresh Air\\" interview show. If Flannery is an accessible writer, he is even more accessible as a speaker, knowing his stuff, speaking smoothly along in a pleasant voice, made a little more charming with his Australian accent, keeping it in simple terms.Terry Gross, the show host, nailed him right away about what made him change his mind from dismissing global warming as a major problem, to working hard to collect and show the facts. He explained that he was working as a field biologist seeing changes in his little research area but not connecting them to the big picture. Then an invitation to chair an advisory committee on science and sustainability caused him to read a wide range of books and scientific papers and talk to colleagues, and he saw that climate change was showing up everywhere.I wondered: Where was he in the late 80s when the data was in and the uncertainty was only in politics? Where were all of us?Flannery spoke of the great research on past events that affect weather, like North Sea gas ignited by lava 55 million years ago. The effect was the release of vast amounts of greenhouse gases, giving rise to rapid changes such as massive extinctions, the rise of rain forests in Greenland, and acidified oceans. He talked of the end of the last ice age 15,000 years ago, how very well associated events have been studied. He talked about the shift in the way the world climate system operates that took place in 1976, a trigger point, and then again in 1998.Then Terry Gross led him to talk about noise in the system, the variables of weather, the chaotic nature of the beast. A single event can't be interpreted as evidence of cause and effect. But the longer-term view is the key to understanding. That is a clear-headed scientist speaking, the kind of person worth listening to.The interviewer drew him out on how the writing went, and he admitted to becoming deeply discouraged during the research phase, as it all seemed to be bad news. Then he began to find things that he personally could do to reduce his own C02 emissions, such as putting solar collectors on his home, even though they were expensive. I was taken in by the man and the moral of his book, so I bought a copy that day.The book was first published in Australia in 2005 and was said to have been influential there. It was published in the US in early 2006. Flannery's first stroke of communication brilliance is to admit to the uncertainty of the recent past, deal with the controversy in the latter part of the last century, the caution that he calls rightful in interpreting news about climate. Then he begins to slowly explain what we now know, what is measured and true. His first zinger is to explain that the earth has been in a rare balance of temperature for the last 10,000 years, and that stability has enabled us to advance agriculture and create our modern civilization.Early on in the book appears the Keeling Curve, claimed in the article in Playboy to have been one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen, but to my exasperation was not included with the article. I suppose in that forum the curve would be bland. It is a rather a nice illustration of something cycling yearly and gaining over time. It depicts measurements of CO2 in the air on the top of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa from 1958 to 2000. The seducing beauty is that it traces an annual breathing of CO2 in the atmosphere, drawn in by the northern plants in the growing season, exhaled back out in the decomposition in fall, winter and spring. The precision of plotting that slight annual variation convinces me of the accuracy of the methodology used to measure the CO2. The steadily increasing trend is the problem, indicating that something beyond the annual cycle of plant life is going on. I was hooked into the book to find out why.Flannery does not resort to technical explanations to explain the physics of light and heat transfer, rather he keeps it in simple terms to retain any reader. His explanation of the subtle role of CO2 is done in a disarming way, starting with the puzzle that CO2 is negligible in its ability to contain the radiant heat of the earth. But it is better at catching the heat radiated from polar regions, and the slight increase in atmospheric temperature overall is a boost for water vapor. Water vapor is complex in its behavior, he explains but in simple terms it blocks incoming light when condensed into clouds, blocks heat from leaving the earth when in vapor form or cloud form. A single degree rise in the atmosphere caused by CO2 adds water vapor to the atmosphere, escalating the rise, and bearing more energy for storms.This was new for me, having missed the books that came out in 1990 that explained all this. The data of 1990 was good and pointed to where we are now, I must add. It was all lost in the controversy and suppression I'm afraid. Flannery has done us all a favor by putting it out again, updated and in readable form. It would be even easier to understand if diagrams were included, such as those in the most lucid book to come out early in the game, \\"Hothouse Earth,\\" by John Gribbon, one of those published in 1990, now out of print and recently acquired for pennies through Amazon.com.The current book outlines the history of climate change events, and explains how we learn of temperature and gases that were in the atmosphere in the distant past. He lays out in detail the big release of greenhouse gases 55 million years ago that I heard him summarize on NPR. The temperature rise was 9 to 18 F, a staggering increase. The increase was fast in geologic terms, and it took 20,000 years to reabsorb the CO2. And here is where Flannery locks in the reader: That event, he says, is the best parallel we have for our current situation. We are not playing around with some hypothetical stuff, rather, we have evidence of what happens if we add CO2 to the atmosphere.The author gives a sense of adventure as he talks of the challenges faced by a team drawing a two-mile long ice core from Antarctica. Completed in 2004, the core gives data back farther than ever achieved, over 740,000 years. He describes the findings in other ice cores, and evidence showing how a past warming phase shut off the Gulf Stream, the heat transporter that keeps Europe relatively warm in spite of its far north latitude. Without the current, the place froze up. This is why the term \\"Climate Change\\" is gaining ground as a descriptor for what we are in for, replacing \\"Global Warming\\" as it won't seem like warming to the Europeans. I expect that with a general understanding of this and recent news that the Gulf Stream is slowing, Europeans will be the biggest proponents of solutions to human induced climate change.Positively astounding is the clear layout of research and analysis that shows that the stability and mildness of the last 8000 years, the escape from the gyrations of advancing and retreating ice, was brought about by human activity. (I know, he contradicted his earlier claim of 10,000 years of stability.) Specifically, wet agriculture that became widespread in Asia stopped one of the long downward cycles of methane in the atmosphere, gently raised it up, a greenhouse gas, and created a mild and stable climate. That was the first time humans made the weather.Of course the reader will have read the dust jacket and will know that the book is about changing the weather now, and it is sobering to realize that the industrial revolution set us on a rapid course of changing the world. Not just changing it from a world of nature to a vast harvesting ground to supply and feed huge cities and transportation systems, but tipping the balance to an inexorable climate shift. The book steps through the changes now underway: one chapter giving a beautiful description of sea level rise, another discussing how climate modelers strive to improve their models with up-to-date data and strict accounting for uncertainties. Thereby their range of results covers minimum rise, most likely rise, and that staggering upper end of the uncertainty band, maximum rise.To make his case in a winning way, Flannery chooses the plight of the golden toad, a very pretty former inhabitant of the cloud forests of Costa Rica. This was the first frog species lost to global warming, a charismatic one; many more are following. Changes in rainfall, with data supporting what he calls the Magic Gate of 1976, a trigger point for change. \\"Magic\\" doesn't seem to be the right modifier for a turning point toward the downfall of all the world: its more of a hell's gate, a gate ripped from its hinges, with blind governments and greedy corporations refusing to put the gate back up. He lists companies and organizations that contest the issue of climate change, makes evident the self serving interests, and how superficial their claims, offering examples such as \\"an elaborate conspiracy engineered by hundreds of climate scientists...to maintain their funding.\\"Research suggests that if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases now, the Earth would reach a new stable state in 2050. That is fast in comparison to other changes, and is conservative because feedback mechanisms accelerate processes faster than realized. Things will be so bad by then that there will be no more argument, but the great challenge is to do something now. He covers engineering solutions, experiments carried out to reabsorb CO2. Many ideas first thought promising have proven false leads. For example, fertilizing plankton is infeasible and would change the ecology of oceans. He speaks well of sustainable agriculture that puts carbon in the soil, but I see an uphill battle to carry that in the face of global demand.Growing trees is everybody's favorite candidate for a solution, and the potential for tropical countries to do this and sell the resulting carbon credits has promise. Any wood we can produce is an offset as long as it is stored in long-lived trees. I envision redwoods in every backyard, but they simply won't grow everywhere, and propagating non-native trees is not wise for other ecological reasons. I have seen beautiful laminates made from bamboo, which is very fast growing, and wonder how long we can keep the wood flooring in our houses.Flannery lucidly discusses fuel alternatives, showing which fuels release the most CO2 for the energy produced (coal) and leads to which produces none (hydrogen). Oil is better than coal, natural gas (methane) is better than oil as long as it doesn't leak -- methane that escapes into the atmosphere is a greenhouse gas 25 times worse than CO2. Hydrogen produces no CO2 when burned, but Flannery smashes that hope with the most complete description of the problems of handling hydrogen that I have ever seen, and the problem of where do you get the stuff. He doesn't mention solid-state storage of hydrogen, another technology that has yet to be developed for transportation systems but which comes with its own staggering obstacles. In this discouraging future, the hybrid vehicles that we already have (although in very small numbers) look pretty good.Flannery points to the value of getting the power grids off coal with increasing use of wind and solar, pointing to how much more power-conscious individuals become when they are generating their own -- but he does not address the masses in the cities. They become power-conscious only when their air conditioning shuts off. I think they must be encouraged to buy more efficient appliances by enlightened incentives.The author discusses the difficulties of achieving our power needs with nuclear power, but my examination of the alternatives finds we are doomed if we do not move fast to solve the problems and replace the coal powered plants with nuclear plants. (See \\"Nuclear Power is the Only Green Solution,\\" by James Lovelock, an essay that appeared in The Independent, May 24, 2004.) Flannery mentions the vastness of geothermal heat reservoirs, but is quick to point out that very little electrical energy has been produced with this kind of heat.Finally, he appeals to the individual. He is right to do so, but how many will read this book? How many of those will take action? Where is the leverage? We need great leadership, to popularize doing the right thing, to create incentives, to ensure the long-term vision. We are a far cry from that. The book provides a list of things to do, but such lists have been around since the 70s. Congress let the SUVs through the mileage standards loop-hole, and the American public and the oil companies loved it.\\"The Weather Makers\\" is a great book, very complete, innovative in its presentation, well worth reading. It should be read be all leaders, anyone who is concerned about the future of the human race, and especially those who have or care about children."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Everyone should read this book. The very future of the planet we human beings rely on for survival is in jeopardy. This book outlines the science underlying the damage the human race is wreaking on the world's fragile, inter-connected ecosytems and atmosphere in a compelling, inspirational way that the lay person can easily understand. While I never doubted that global warming was happening I now have a much clearer understanding of the urgency of the need for action and have committed myself to doing what I can to address the situation. I fear not so much for my own future but for that of my children and yet-to-be-born grandchildren. While Tim Flannery spells out very clearly the dangers we face if little or no action is taken, he is optimistic that the human race has the ingenuity and intelligence to address the problems if we act immediately and decisively. We all need to do what we can as indiviudals and lobby our governments to do what they need to in order to save the world."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Both my husband and I read this book with interest and admiration for the good research Tim Flannery has done.

Not that he's wrong to point it out, but in the end, this is a problem that can only be solved if the governments of the world decide to take action."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"+++++This book, by scientist, explorer, and conservationist Tim Flannery explains brilliantly in an easy-to-read style \\"how [humans are] changing the climate and what it means for life on Earth.\\" (Weather is what we experience each day while climate is the sum of all weathers over a long period of time, for a region or for the planet as a whole).In order to understand this book, all you really have to know is the term \\"Greenhouse Effect.\\"The Greenhouse Effect is the global warming of the atmosphere (thus causing climate change) due to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. (Greenhouse gases are a class of gasses that trap heat near the Earth's surface. The most abundant greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide derived from the burning of fossil fuels. (There are, in fact, about thirty greenhouse gases.) Fossil fuels--oil, coal, and gas--are hydrocarbon fuels, since they consist of hydrogen and carbon, formed from organic matter like plants.)So, what's all the fuss about? Answer: We burn fossil fuels (especially those containing carbon dioxide) for electricity, for transportation, etc. And we burn lots and lots of fossil fuels thus causing potentially lethal climate change.Flannery explains his book eloquently in the last paragraph of his introduction:\\"What follows [in the chapters of this book] is my best effort, based on the work of thousands of colleagues, to outline the history of climate change, how it will [probably] unfold over [this] century, and what we can do about it. With great scientific advances being made every month, this book is necessarily incomplete. That should not, however, be used as an excuse for inaction. We know enough to act wisely.\\"This book has been called \\"beautiful\\" but \\"truly terrifying.\\" It is beautiful because it lays out the problem simply and non-technically in bite-size chapters that average five to six pages.Why is this book also called \\"truly terrifying?\\" This is due to some of the chilling (or maybe I should say warming) facts and observations Flannery presents. Here are just five:(1) The world's leading science journals are full of reports that glaciers are melting ten times faster than previously thought, that atmospheric greenhouse gases have reached levels not seen for millions of years, and that species are vanishing as a result of climate change.(2) The twenty-first century (from 2001 to 2100) could see from projected trends a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has potential to heat our planet by 3 degree Celsius, and perhaps as much as 6 degrees Celsius.(3) Coal is the most potent carbon dioxide polluter. More coal is burned today than any time in the past.(4) Most of the increase in the burning of fossil fuels has occurred over the last few decades, and nine out of the ten warmest years ever recorded have occurred since 1990.(5) My favorite: In the final days of 2004, it was discovered that Antarctica was turning green!!This book had almost ten black and white illustrations (diagrams, graphs, pictures, etc.) between its covers. My favorite is the steadily rising graph showing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as measured atop Mt. Mauna Loa, Hawaii, between 1958 and 2000.What I found most astonishing were the seven color plates or photographs found in the middle of the book. The one that stood out for me had the following caption:\\"The Golden Toad is the first species demonstrated to have become extinct as a result of climate change. It vanished from its Costa Rican habitat in the late 1980s.\\"Don't get the idea that this is just a doom and gloom book. The book's last part gives a vision of hope, with solutions and clear paths to get us out of this quandary. Also, there are two appendices (not labeled as such) entitled \\"Climate Change Checklist\\" and \\"Green Power\\" respectively. The former lists an \\"action\\" the reader can do and the \\"impact' that action will have on global warming. For example, an action listed is to \\"install a solar hot-water system.\\" The resulting impact is \\"up to 30% reduction in household emissions.\\" The latter is \\"a list of Green Power suppliers and resources.\\"Finally, the only problem (and this is very minor) I had with this book is that a black and white world map is presented at the beginning of the book. I found that after I had read the entire book that this map had important cities and other references mentioned in the main narrative marked on it. This comes in handy if you want to find the exact location of a city or other landmark or watermark. The reason I missed it was that there is no explanatory note saying that this map is to be used for this purpose.In conclusion, people are aware of the \\"war on terrorism.\\" This book makes one acutely aware that there is a \\"WAR ON CLIMATE CHANGE\\" also occurring!!!(first published 2005; forward; map; introduction; 5 parts or 35 chapters; postscript; afterword; main narrative 315 pages; 2 appendices; acknowledgements; credits; notes; bibliography; index)+++++"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I read the book when it first came out and it really changed the way I think about the topic.

No kidding. That's what this book inpires, more intense study. The book fails to mention solar activity as a driving force in climate change because a great many experts in astrophysics have done the homework already and determined that solar activity is NOT the likely cause of recent climate change. Yes, there are still official/scientific bodies that take a conservative stand on possible anthropogenic global warming, but at least some of that is due to pressure from President Foot-drag and the current administration in Washington. Wouldn't a truly \\"conservative\\" approach be to minimize our impact on the environment BECAUSE we don't have all the data and that we MAY be altering global climate in unpredictable ways?I know global warming nay-sayers (read Republicans) are interested in a stable environment for international commerce. Is it not in the best interest of the business world to minimize unpredictability?You can talk til your blue in the face of course. The bottom line is that this is most assuredly NOT a horror story from the \\"doom-and-gloom\\" crowd.

Now imagine the snowline moving predictably up the mountain year after year. The reason there is so little research done on these ecosystems is, in Flannery's words, \\"Because the work is just too depressing \\". Thousands of unique species are threatened with, or becoming extinct as climate change modifies existing habitats. The example Flannery gives about the mountain habitats is not only horrifying in its specific implications, it also provides us with a convenient parallel to anticipate what may be in store for all of us. Raising world consciousness about the coming disastrous effects of unchecked carbon emissions has become an evolutionary imperative. Ephemeral notions about driving less, and in a much more efficient vehicle, must become urgent priorities if we wish for our children and grandchildren to have a quality of life equal to the one we now enjoy.After reading this book I am now clearly able to explain the danger of \\"Feedback Loops\\", destructive cycles that must be interrupted to mitigate exponentially increasing environmental damage as a direct result of carbon emissions. I should think that if after reading this book someone should choose not to make tangible lifestyle adjustments they have chosen a destructive self-serving path. I take pride in my library but this book I was compelled to give away, and insist the recipient do the same."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The Weather Makers is a very intense book. I've read three or four books on the subject of global warming and climate change, and this is the one that makes it all real. Author Tim Flannery covers the usual ground of research and findings and of the evolving field of geoclimate. It is amazing how many disciplines the field includes, practitioners of which are all concerned as their various finding begin to merge and an alarming picture of the future of the planet begins to emerge.The most affecting aspects of his work are the descriptions of endangered or recently extinct species or ecologies. His discussion of the physical causes of this process create for his readers a sense of impending disaster in a way that many other books, while equally detailed and informative, don't. It's not even just the sense of disaster, but the heart breaking sadness of the irretrievable losses that we and nature have sustained that makes the book as effective as it is in stirring the reader to action.Alarming too, is his description of changes in water availability in many areas of the west and southwest in the US and in Sydney and Perth in Australia. His concern over the escalating incidents of damaging weather and their financial impact on the insurance industry, society and the individual is also enlightening. As he notes, \\"In purely human terms the United States would seem to have more to lose from climate change than any other large nation. Indeed, its ever spiraling insurance bill resulting from severe weather events and its growing water shortages in the west mean that the United States is already paying dearly for its CO2 emissions (p140).\\" How true he speaks. With our policy makers concerned more for the bottom line cost, it seems that we are practicing penny wisdom and dollar foolishness by not joining the global community in fighting global warming. In fact as this author and others point out, we ought to be leading the initiates and providing a role model.Furthermore, the final pages of the book provide the reader with suggestions on how to help solve the problem at least on the personal level. His Climate Change Checklist offers a number of actions the individual may take.While not all of us can afford to put up solar panels, we can all use more energy efficient light bulbs, make certain our car is up to its peak efficiency or plan to purchase our next one from among those that are. And who among us couldn't use a good walk instead of a drive to some of the places we go. His notes on the Carbon Footprint give resources for calculating ones own contribution to carbon emissions and web sites on which to discover what ones local resources for change might be.I've already turned down my water heater, moved the thermostat up on my airconditioner, and am checking into a windpower initiative being started by the local power company.

These two questions are explored with large doses of science in this easy to read book on the history (geological) and science of global climate change. Over several chapters, the author shows how various aspects of human civilization have in the past (thru agriculture), currently are (deforestation and land conversion), and will most likely (fossil fuel usage) affect the climate and weather of regions of the world. Several chapters are dedicated to the methods and practices whereby scientists discovered past changes, and how they forecast changes in the future. Several chapters are dedicated to explaining how climate change affects different ecosystems, such as rain forests, coral reefs, and farmlands. Several chapters focus on the details of how different human behaviors affect the climate and weather. And the last chapters of the book offer alternatives that societies can follow that will reduce man's impact on the climate.The book is simple to read; is quite interdisciplinary in drawing from archaelogy, chemistry, oceanography, geology and other sciences in explaining its thesis. The book also cites many other works in the field; both those that support the theory of global warming, and those that refute it. Overall, a great book to read."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery is able to break down the science that goes way over my head and present it in a way that should be able to make anyone understand the clear and present danger that is going on around us...if you really want to understand why scientists are so alarmed without being buried in scientific formulas and data..this is the book to read...read this book then watch Al Gores documentary and I think you'll have a grasp on global warming..I know I do...Mr Flannery is still optimistic that we can change our ways and save ourselves and for that I am grateful thought the tipping point might already be upon us."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"For years I was concerned about this issue, then I became more concerned, now I've become frantic bordering on despair.

The issue of global warming has been a hot topic for many years now. In The Weather Makers Tim Flannery argues that the climate is changing at a rapid rate and the issues need to be addressed or our Earth will never be the same. Flannery is addressing not only scholarly researchers but the everyday citizen in his understandable account of one of the most essential but controversial issues facing every person in the world today.To understand the effects that global warming has on the world you may think you would have to be a scientist but in The Weather Makers Flannery puts it all into perspective. In the book he discusses the history of different climate changes that we have gone through during the history of the Earth. He goes and predicts the scenarios that global warming has on the earth and gives solutions that governments and the general public can do to decrease the force of global warming on the Earth. Scenarios such as the Gulf Stream current stopping like in the fictional movie The Day after Tomorrow, the disappearing of the coral reefs, and a modern day ice age just to name a few. He also discusses solutions such as wind, solar, and nuclear power that, if used correctly could all start to reverse the effects of Global Warming.Tim Flannery's understanding as a scientist and his ability to put it into words that the everyday person can understand makes The Weather Makers a must read for anyone with any interest in the future of the world. One thing that made the read a bit confusing was his transitions. I often got lost and had to go back and re-read. Over all the book was a great read, it's probably one of the best books about Global Warming on the market and I recommend it to anyone who is a skeptic or a firm believer in Global Warming."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The observed facts that are described in this book, as well as in many other similar books, make it abundantly clear to anyone that the earth is indeed on a warming trend. The melting glaciers and ice sheets, the rising sea levels, the extinction of various animal species, the migration patterns of animals, the increasing frequency of violent storms, etc., etc., are all abundantly discussed here as a function of rising global temperatures. If this trend continues, projections as to the horrors that may happen in the future are also presented, as are various possible solutions, at the corporate, national and individual levels, that may help slow down and possibly reverse the trend. The only material that I would have liked to have seen in much greater detail in this book, i.e., perhaps another hundred pages or so, is extensive quantitative information on the various types of offending greenhouse gases and their sources, quantitative details of mechanisms relating these various greenhouse gas concentrations to global warming and the relative contribution of human activity to the increasing concentrations of each of these gases, all in light of the Milankovich cycles. I believe that these details may be all that is needed to convince many skeptics that remedial action is needed now. Many global warmings and increases in greenhouse gas concentrations have occurred in the earth's long history; one in particular, the great 26,000-year-long warm spell of 430,000 years ago, as yet, has remained unexplained. Consequently, directly and indisputably identifying human activity, in a rigorously quantitative way, as the main cause of the current global warming would likely convince many - both skeptics and fence sitters - that it is indeed time to act. The book's writing style is clear, friendly and authoritative. The short bite-sized chapters are an added feature that contributes towards making this book so difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Fancy a sun-soaked timeshare in deepest Greenland? How about the Arctic? Well, get your orders in quickly and the wait time may be in your lifetime. When it gets too hot to soak up the rays at the Costa del Sol, you might be pleased to know that there will remain somewhere you can count on getting your tan up while not simultaneously getting carbonised (for a while, at least).That is the spectre that we are both beginning to live with and speeding towards. We cannot bear to think of it so we consign it to the future. But all of us sense, know, we are experiencing it right now. Talk of the prospective possibility of the melting of the Greenland icecap, or of an ice-free Arctic and Antarctic seems fantastic, but it is happening, at an awesome rate, right now, and we know it but we can hardly believe it. We are already living climate change and are clearly on a trajectory that is pointed in only one possible, and dire, direction unless the most radical action is taken. The only question that remains is how long, unless action that is possible but depressingly unlikely is undertaken. Yet, because we have left it so late, getting our heads above the rising tides and confronting that worse case scenario is now our only choice.While the prospect of annihilation by nuclear weapons wielded by rogue states, such as North Korea, or \`groups' such as Al Qaeda, or economic meltdown cannot be discounted, it is becoming increasingly clear that politicans', indeed everyone's focus, has been on the wrong ball; a classical situation of diversion and procrastination while the water rises. As Al Gore points out in his movie version of An Inconvenient Truth, the state of the economy and everything else is an irrelevancy in the face of a planet which can no longer sustain human life at the rate we are going, given our ever increasing demands on its limited resources. The stresses being what they are now, it stretches the imagination to think what things will be like when the population reaches 9 billion, the projected figure for 2020.A rash of recent publications, most notably Tim Flannery's The Weather Makers, as well as Elizabeth Kolbert's Field Notes From a Catastrophe and, most famously, Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, tries to sound the alarm bells for those who have not already woken up and smelled the carbon. Of all of the recent additions to the genre, The Weather Makers stands out.Flannery, a palaeontologist and author of deserved repute, is brilliantly placed to tell the story of how doomed is our civilisation unless we begin to truly understand our relationship with our planet and begin to live our lives in a sustainable way. While Kolbert, Gore et al do a nice job of giving a sense of what is going on, Flannery solidly sketches the scientific background and provides the big picture generally, situating the current stresses we are placing on our environment in scientific and geo-historic perspective. For those seeking a solid, well written and scientifically credible expos&eacute; of climate change, Flannery is an excellent introduction, especially for lay persons. He manages to explain the science in a way which is extremely instructive without dumbing it down.While this text has been criticised for being polemical, one can only retort that when the scientists start to become agitated, it is time to be worried. Activist scientists? God forbid!As proven by this book, and countless other authorities, there is no serious scientific dissent regarding climate change. The real question is how to persuade, or defeat, the vested and selfish interests that would destroy our planet without conscience or care."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The book provides some popular scientific concepts behind thedebate on global warming.

So,the first 1/3 of the book is a good read. The rest of the book is disappointing, though.His exhortation to go \\"off-grid\\" is heart-felt, and may work for some new homes built on the margin. However, he doesn't tackle the issue of how to make existing city buildings and infrastructure more sustainable. And this is key, given that 1/2 the world's population lives in urban areas. He didn't touch on existing efforts to stop of mitigate urban sprawl, such as \\"smart growth\\".Many other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings re: the sections of the book dealing with science and technology. The book would have been strengthened had he co-authored it with one or two technical experts.His \\"off-grid\\" call seems based on a desire to \\"stick it\\" to big coal and oil companies. Disappointingly little detail is provided on how the resources of these large companies could be brought to bear on the issue of climate change.Further, a good discussion of tax-shifting is missing (taxing CO2 and other emissions while reducing cost of valuable economic inputs such as payroll taxes). Such tax regime changes have the potential to do a lot more to meet the climate change challenge than a few of us putting solar panels on our roofs."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This would have to be the best explanation of the bigger picture of the effects of global warming.

However, it also made me mad as heck. I picked up this book hoping for a non-partisan look at the truth about what's going on with the climate in our world. Environmental change has become such a political issue, I was hoping that this book would be written without the kind of vitriolic color that has become part and parcel of the discussion in books like Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. I just wanted to read a book without a political agenda. Flannery made me a little nervous with his brief mention of Gaia in the opening chapter, but he mentioned it as a theory and didn't seem to espouse it himself, so I continued reading. He goes into detail about previous climate changes in our planet's history, as well as the extinction in recent years of certain animals in the Southern Hemisphere. I continued reading, fascinated by Flannery's detail and apparent love for the lost species. But about 240 pages into the book, Flannery dropped his faade and allowed his true agenda to show through. His Bush and America bashing continued throughout the remainder of the book and colored everything before and after it for me. He even managed to blame the genocidal murders in the Sudan on Bush! He belabors the Kyoto Protocols, but doesn't mention the reduction in methane gas bill that Bush got passed earlier this year. Of course Flannery can't say enough nice things about Europe and how they are handling conservation issues, but Australia (his home country) comes off poorly in his estimation. I was disappointed because while he writes about possible changes to the climate of the earth in general, he never addresses how it will affect the population, other than to propose a global nation which will bring to heel countries that refuse to change their polluting ways (i.e., The US and Australia) and an international court where citizens can sue those same countries for destroying their way of life. I did learn some valuable information in this book: hydrogen power is not the way of the future, and ultimately we need to change our actions as individuals, and that is something I will do. But I'm very disappointed that this issue can't seem to be addressed in a way that isn't political."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I rarely buy two books sight unseen (hardcover much less), but in a moment of weakness (or wisdom), I bought The Winds of Change by Eugene Linden as well as The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery.

Interestingly enough, I heard Tim Flannery on the radio and it was his book that steered me to the purchase of these two. I stopped reading The Weather Makers about halfway through. I got so tired after reading about the one thousanth, four hundreth and thirty second CO2 readings over the past that I just stopped reading it.

Some days ago, I tried to read online, this trash-book. This trash-book tells about \\"devastating events that will take place\\" if global warming continues. With the same racism and absurd of pseudo-scientific \\"past\\" eugenics, with green colour, this book is another proof that ecologists not only hate mixed-races persons, as also they hate trees. I can imagine how many trees were cut to print this trash-book, but I'll show some of the fakes printed in this trash book:1- The book argues that if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to increase at current rates, the resulting climate change will cause mass species extinctions.True: In geological past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were far bigger than today. The carbon dioxide levels are growing because of coal burning in the USA and China, not from rain forests being burned.2-The book also asserts that global temperatures have already risen enough to cause the annual monsoon rains in the Sahel region of Africa to diminish, causing droughts and desertification. This in turn, according to Flannery, has caused the conflict in the Darfur region through competition, for disappearing resources.True: In late 1970s and 1980 decade, there were terribles droughts and desertification in Sahel region of Africa. And the conflict in the Darfur region is an Islamic war.3- Further consequences, argued in the book, include increasing hurricane intensity.True: The hurricane intensity in the world in the last decade is smaller than any other time knowned since at least, two centuries ago.Such as eugenics, ecology isn't a science, but a disease."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"If anyone believes anything Flim Flam writes or says please contact me because I have a bridge I have been trying to sell and you may be just the person I need.In Australia there are only two men and a dog, plus the Labour Party, that pay any attention to the ravings of this charlatan.I gave him one star because he spelt his name correctly."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"One of my children needed this book for school.

Readers may feel surfeited by the rash of books on \\"global warming\\" appearing in the past few years. The feeling is understandable. The situation should be considered an indication of how serious the problem is for all humanity. In this case, the author introduces a little-considered aspect. Tim Flannery, whose keen eye and bountiful wit always offers something new presented in a easily readable way, will not leave you jaded nor have your head nodding in ennui. Although Flannery does address some questions dealt with elsewhere, he adds the most significant topic of all - the future of life.As a zoologist, Flannery has extensive field experience in the forests of New Guinea and elsewhere. He's written of human impact on large animals in North America and Australia. Here, he writes of human impact on all life. Instead of hunting animals to extinction, humans are modifying the entire biosphere through pollutants and gases. This indirect imposition has already killed off at least one species, he demonstrates. In explaining how the Golden Toad went extinct, Flannery sets the scene expansively. The Toad wasn't just a local phenomenon, but died out due to wide-ranging changes in ocean temperature, air mass movements and changes in rainfall. This combination of influences resulted in what appeared to us as a minimal change in habitat. To the Golden Toad, that \\"minimal change\\" proved catastrophic. The object lesson is clear. How much change will the species humans rely on for survival tolerate? Flannery, citing James Lovelock's \\"Gaia\\" hypothesis of the biosphere as a tightly woven \\"system\\", argues that the tolerance for change is meagre. And human-induced change is squeezing the tolerance downward. Up to 30% of all major species are under threat of extinction during this century.Flannery notes how much needs to be learnt about our impact on the biosphere. Only a generation ago we had identified half of the \\"greenhouse gases\\" and scientists still contested whether their influence would warm or cool the planet. Now, he stresses, the warming effect is clearly dominant. The result of that warming is unfolding before us right now. More significantly, the consequences of today's conditions will not be fully realised for a generation. When they become apparent they will be far too severe to reverse. The time to take preventive action is now, not in a decade or more. The reason for prompt action refutes the \\"climate sceptics\\" who argue that climate change is \\"natural\\" and requires adaptability, not severe crisis-preventing action. Flannery explains how this view is mistaken and misleading. The rate of change today far exceeds any past natural process, and its effects may last many millennia. All examples of past climate change show cascading processes, where one small change induces later, more complex or far-reaching results. With today's rate of change so rapid, Flannery argues, the cumulative effects are unpredictable. But they won't be pleasant.Flannery's presentation is that of the convinced scientist and caring individual. His abilities as a science writer provide us with clearly spelled out conditions and solutions. He is an ardent supporter of personal steps to be taken to reduce that rate of change underway around us. He also shows how industries and governments can contribute to slowing the threat to our biosphere and thus, our children's future. In fact, just about the only negative thing that can be said about this book is its chaotic \\"References\\" section. There is a logic in there somewhere, but in this reviewer's opinion, it's to make you go back to the text to cross-check and relearn the point.

Scientists, meteorologists, and others with a professional interest in climate and the weather will appreciate the broad range of expertise Flannery demonstrates throughout this work. A scientist and conservationist himself, Flannery obviously knows what he is talking about. Readers without such a scientific background will enjoy this work because Flannery, like Jared Diamond, is able to write about what could be mind-numbingly complex issues with a wit and clarity that holds one's interest. As an Australian, Flannery writes from the perspective of a citizen of one of the nations which is most heavily environmentally stressed. And it is vital for humanity in Australia and elsewhere to become more conversant with the issues Flannery covers so well.The Weather Makers describes the many effects human activities have had on our planetary climate, beginning with the development of agriculture and proceeding on to the most recent headlines. Flannery analyzes the probabilities of catastrophic climate changes, stressing that this is not really a question of \\"If\\" but \\"When.\\" He is alarming but not alarmist, not stooping to the level of \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" for example, but also making it clear that even though drastic weather changes will not happen tomorrow, they certainly will within our life times and those of our children unless action is taken.Flannery is clear about what action needs to be taken. Although not overly enthusiastic about the Kyoto Accord, for example, he does herald it as a good first step. He provides suggestions for individual actions in a \\"green checklist\\" at the end of the book, and describes exciting possibilities, including those already well known such as hybrid cars and nuclear or geothermal power sources and intriguing new ones like the mini-cats: compressed air vehicles being developed in Europe.Its encouraging to see Tony Blair's name, among others in the chorus of enthusiastic responses to The Weather Makers on its back cover blurb. Perhaps Blair and others intelligent enough to recognize that Flannery knows what he is talking about can make some headway against other \\"leaders\\" more obtuse than they!"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I picked this book up in the Sydney airport in November while on vacation. Upon return home, I learned that it was not yet published in the US, so ordered 10 copies from Australia. I have given copies to friends and family, colleagues and elected officials. Without wanting to seem excessively dramatic, this book has changed my life.I had always considered global climate change (GCC) to be one of several important environmental issues. What Flannery does more than anything is synthesize the dramatic developments that have occured in climate science, just in the past few years. He points out that most of us think about GCC in the same terms and from the same limited understanding that we had many years ago when the issue first entered public consciousness. In the meantime, the science has evolved significantly, and with that evolution of understanding, the news has become worse. Since reading the book, I have embarked on a crash reading program on GCC issues and now share Flannery's view that this is not only THE environmental issue, it is THE issue. Many issues are important, but how we deal with them will likely not matter much if we do not seriously address the threat of climate change.This book is well-written and reads easily. It is accessible and informative to scientists and non-scientists alike (I am a mere lawyer, in fact), and would make a terrific contribution to high school or college level syllabi.Buy a copy, but you may want to buy two, since you will undoubtedly want to pass it on when you are finished."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I had the opportunity to read a bound galley of this book.

It's an alarm to all of us sharing this fragile and endangered planet. You should buy two copies and send one to a friend. It should be required reading in Washington and perhaps someone could read this out loud to our president."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This book was recommended to me by one of Canada's leading advocates for saving the Polar Regions. He told me I should read this book if I wanted to read the best book that has been written on climate change. I was skeptical, but he was right. This is the best book I have found on the subject of climate change.The author, Tim Flannery, is a well recognized scientist himself. He begins the book by discussing his reservations about global warming, how scientists are supposed to be skeptical and how much data must be present before scientific consensus can occur. From there, he explains how he was convinced that climate change was real.In the book, the author starts discussing climate change from many different scientific aspects. Although some of the science is tough, even for science majors such as myself, the specifics of the science involved are used more as examples, allowing readers with less of a scientific background to understand exactly what is being said. The author does a great job of utilizing a number of sciences, including anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, climatology, meteorology, geology, oceanography and more to prove the argument that climate change exists from every angle.In addition, he does a great job showing how something happening in one place may affect a totally different region of the world. He covers climate change around the globe in a comprehensive manner, and shows how different peoples will be affected.Finally, the author discusses what is being done and by whom. He points out the lack of effort to change in the US, as well as in Australia and other countries. He presents good arguments for the slowing global warming and for the economic benefits that countries would enjoy.This book is the best and most comprehensive I have read on global warming. If you are looking for a book that covers all aspects, this is for you. If you would prefer ranting and raving, don't look here, as there is very little of that present. Finally, if you are in doubt about global warming this book may very well change your mind, or at the very least give you something to think about seriously."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The first half or so of Flannery's book offers one of the clearest and most comprehensive accounts of global warming I have read. He gathers measurements, he explains how the various gases behave in the atmosphere, he documents the effects of climate change. Flannery's strong suit is zoology; his explication of the effects of global warming on animal and plant species is excellent. It is clear that he is not a meteorologist, yet his explication of atmospheric effects is very readable.I should praise his attempts to offer solutions, rather than note that those latter pages of the book are significantly weaker than the earlier ones -- the mix of generalities and wishful thinking just doesn't seem enough. That is not to say I would have any idea of what is 'enough,' or of any solution that would be accepted by a sufficient portion of our human-crowded, energy-hungry planet.Again, a first rate overview of the issue, one that gives the reader a sense of understanding and perspective."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is a fascinating book because it's so specific and wide-ranging.

I was looking for an unbiased and objective overview of the daunting topic of climate change and almost found it within these pages....almost. Not wanting to base my beliefs on what TV, politicians, and celebrities spew, I sought more information from books written by actual scientists. Flannery is indeed a scientist, however, not a climate scientists. He is actually a zoologist (who have much to contribute to the study of climate change) but this slant is all to apparent in the book. There is just a little too much (for my taste) on the various species that are at risk presumably due to climate change. Another minor complaint is that he gets a little too mother-earthy, what with the Gaia references and the wondrous magical beauty of nature stuff, etc. His passion for earth and nature is clear but I just wanted facts. His discussion of the science is good but there are better books out there if that's what you're looking for. He also tends to be a bit of a doomsayer, throwing around phrases like \\"Orwellian-style world governments\\", \\"protracted dark ages far more mordant than any..before\\", and a lot of other apocolyptic imagery. In the last couple of sections, it seems as if he just decided to dispense with any semblance of objectivity and lay it all out there (many people will appreciate his candor). Despite these (minor) flaws, this book provides a good overview of the science and politics of climate change."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This was a wonderful read for me during a week I spend in the woods on retreat.

The author convincingly demonstrates that global warming is real, and that terrible consequences loom ahead if nothing is done about it.I was very surprised to read how the Australian government bullies its neighboring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Many of the Pacific Islands nations are doomed to sink under water as the ocean level rise, yet they are bullied by the Australian government into inaction. Like individuals, nations are selfish and have no regard for other nations if it does not suit their purposes. This notion angered me. Unless the citizens of the world take action to fight global warming and CO2 emissions, governments, motivated by self-interest, will be very slow to act, if at all.Many of the themes in the book were already familiar to me, especially after reading An Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore. One new concept was about hydrogen power. According to the author, hydrogen power is not the solution to global warming since to produce hydrogen power fossil fuels must be burnt. He proposes the use of electric, solar, nuclear and wind power which are all available and affordable.The author also laments all the animals that became extinct due to global warming. For example, a frog, newly discovered by science, carries its newborn in its stomach. When ready to give birth, it regurgitates its babies. This is the only known species to do so, yet soon after its discovery, it became extinct due to our environmental carelessness. Many other species of animals, insects, and plants are becoming extinct.Maybe when we learn to stop killing each other we can finally take care of our environment. Does that mean that our root is evil and that nothing can be done to save our planet?"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The Weather Makers is stunning in its breadth and depth.

I also intend to inform my grown children and all my friends about the phenomenon of global warming, and why and how to combat it."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is one of the best books about Global Warming that is available, I think. I have read quite a few now, both pro and con. Flannery was on Cspan at a Seattle Bookstore on 3/15/07 and talked about his book. He did recap a lot of what was in the book but he also added lots of interesting tidbits. So he is really worth hearing. One great thing about Flannery is that he is a true scientist and he knows science and facts, and does his research. So I feel he is much more reputable than many naysayers. He never exaggerates for effect, but rather lays out the facts and projections. Over and over he does what science should do: ask questions, gather facts, examine hypotheses, choose the best, and make reasonable projections.The thing that REALLY impressed me, though, was how often he wrote explicitly some thoughts that I thought I had come up with on my own that were kind of \\"out there.\\" Well, I did think them up on my own, but he did, too. Or at least somebody did and Flannery wrote about them. There are extremely few original thoughts out there. If I have thought XYZ then chances are almost 100% that somebody else has thought XYZ, too, and probably put it into print somewhere.An example: ok, suppose we learn how to manage Earth's climate and avoid catastrophic warming. But what happens when the next true ice age cycle rolls around, due to the Milankovitch cycle? Well, we will know how to release CO2 into the atmosphere to artifically induce warming to offset the ice age.One that I read about in the newspaper recently was a kind of \\"air scrubber\\" that will remove CO2 directly from the air, kind of an artificial tree. Over a year ago I came up with this idea but thought it was probably too difficult or impractical. So I mused, in my spare time, what is it about this idea that makes it impractical? Not being a chemist, I didn't really know. But one day, I open up the newspaper, and BANG, there's this idea, very similar to the one I had. I'm sure there are still lots of things about it that make it unworkable at the moment, or else it would be too easy to solve global warming. But it is just another example of how ideas spontaneously arise in thinking persons' minds.Hopefully there will be millions of people, especially scientists, who are thinking up great ideas like this. Bush is right in a way... we really need the very best technology we can have, the best ideas, the cleverest solutions. But Bush is wrong about so many other things, especially that science fiction writers should be consulted over true climate scientists. The voters of the USA need to stand up and say, \\"We believe in science, in true science, and we want change now.\\""},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is a good book and a book people should read to gain some real understanding of how humans affect the climate.

Flannery does a good job with the science, but never spends enough time on it, so there are always too many questions remaining. It seems he is so concerned with his objective of writing a call to action, that he has no time for providing more science than he considers necessary to be persuasive. I think he tries to be objective, and is for the most part, but I imagine that many readers, after his discussion on Australian droughts, would be surprised to learn that Australia is the second largest wheat exporting nation (year ending june 2005, US is number 1). The reader should keep in mind that there is still a great deal of uncertainty: for example, in the past few years the likelihood of the Gulf Stream \\"stopping\\" in the 21st century has been drastically reduced as scientists refined their simulation model. The discussion of chlorofluorocarbons was particularly good: how their importance was discovered, how lucky we are that they were originally used instead of the bromine alternative, and the potential impact of UV rays on the basis for the marine ecosystem."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The paleoclimate record shouts out to us that, far from being self-stabilizing, the Earth's climatic system is an ornery beast which overreacts even to small nudges.-- Wallace Broecker, Cooling the TropicsA lot of Old Guard liberty sorts, believing in the Infinite Sink and wide open spaces forever (or being susceptible to self-serving oil-cartel propaganda), don't even like the word environmentalism.

But through observations of changing ancient landscapes--e.g. warm-plant species moving up mountainsides--and scientific journals discussing severe alpine threats broke the ice (no pun intended) for him.By 2004 his inquiries had turned to fears. The world's leading science journals were full of reports that glaciers were melting 10 times faster than expected, greenhouse gases were reaching levels not seen for millions of years, and species were vanishing seemingly overnight. Increasing extreme weather events and the recent occurrence of several of the hottest years on record sealed his conviction.Flannery became an advocate.Not just any advocate, mind you, one of those exceptional scientific advocates such as Carl Sagan who can write. This book is at once a reference manual you can mark and return to again and again, and an exciting narrative of discovery. He is even clear on matters like alternative energy systems.Did you know Denmark obtains nearly 25% of its electric power through wind, and the power is owned on a cooperative, distributed basis by the citizens themselves?...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"For the past several years I have been interested in the science behind the global warming theory. I listened with amazement to experts and pseudo-experts of all kinds offer their expertise on the subject to the public. I absorbed, but rarely participated in, the frequent debates that came my way at work, social gatherings, and on talk radio and TV. During this time I tried to keep an open mind on the subject - realizing that humans possibly could have an effect on the global climate, but wanting to be convinced that that is actually the case.A few things that struck me during this time of observation and casual investigation were 1) Those who adamantly deny the possibility of man having any effect on global climate were either ignorant about it or completely ideologically driven, 2) The vast majority of the skeptics (those who insist that the data is inconclusive and that we need more time to analyze the data) are almost invariably funded or supported by industries who have much to lose in the short term if public opinion fails them, and 3) the nearly voiceless community of climate scientists overwhelmingly concurs on the major aspects of the theory.Realizing that there must be something to this theory, I finally decided to become more educated about it. I researched many books and authors, and eventually I decided that The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery would be a very good starting point. I must say that I was not disappointed. As pointed out by other reviewers, a large amount of the book deals with how climate change is affecting various species of plants and animals worldwide. Personally, I found this very informative and appropriate since we have long known that all organisms on this biosphere are inter-related. When significant problems occur to numerous species humans are eventually going to suffer some consequence.The author explains the science behind this subject very well; I believe most readers will comprehend it. Of course, more detail could have been provided, but, as it is, a good balance is achieved.Overall, the book left me in a mild state of gloom. Knowing the prevalence of ignorance in the world, and the forces at work to keep people that way by spreading lies, deceit, and uncertainty made me feel that our civilization as we know it is doomed - if not in my lifetime, then certainly in my kids' or grandkids' lifetime. But we all owe it to ourselves and to our planet and to the future generations of earthlings to educate ourselves about this subject and to do what we can to avert this potential catastrophe."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I was a bit skeptical picking this book up, as this looks like just another book on climate change, and written by an Australian to boot.

However, the book is not the all-encompassing manifesto that you might expect from the hype. The concept of climate change (also known popularly, and rather inaccurately, as global warming) includes many different scientific disciplines, and although Tim Flannery is a notable scientist and conservationist, he is not an authority on the overall topic. However, he has embarked on a popular science strategy, not unlike Carl Sagan, to summarize this incredibly complex and timely topic for the masses. About the first two-thirds of this book are exceptionally informative (and worrisome), as Flannery introduces all of the recent scientific efforts to detect climate change, from all relevant scientific disciplines, as well as the incontrovertible evidence that climate change is really upon us.You'd have to be a real ideologue, fantasist, or ostrich with your head in the sand to deny that the climate really is changing at an alarming rate, and it really has been caused by humans. Of course, this book wouldn't be too timely if Flannery didn't cover the political influences behind the ridiculous climate change denial that we hear from vested interests in government and industry, and increasingly, from misinformed general citizens. Without a doubt, climate change is an incredibly complex phenomenon, but it really is happening, which should go without saying for anyone who can see the sense the real world themselves.Unfortunately, this mostly successful treatise starts to unravel near the end. Flannery should have wrapped things up about two-thirds of the way through, but he starts unloading increasingly alarmist language as he approaches his planned pinnacle of climate change activism. The great level-headedness of the earlier portions of the book gives way to ecological horror stories and more than a bit of guilt-tripping about humanity's role in the growing disaster. Flannery also spends too much time dwelling on obscure political machinations in his native Australia, and his examination of anti-environmentalist politics and shifty industrial denials comes close to political reality, but remains rather simplistic and hyperbolic. Meanwhile, Flannery's short and rapid-fire chapters, which were useful for introducing varied scientific concepts earlier in the book, become a liability later, taking the form of inconclusive rants against selected environmental problems and political villains. But while the wrap-up to this book is problematic, anyone who reads it will be more concerned than ever about the reality of climate change, and how we better act fast before it's too late. We should hope that opponents and deniers can be swayed by this book as well, because the most crucial information is definitely in there.

In that year 2050, our world population will stand at 9 billion people. By comparison, the signatories of the Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to reductions of 5.2%. The United States was one of only four countries not to sign the Kyoto agreement (the others were Australia, Monaco, and Liechtenstein).For people like George W. Bush who say that they want \\"more certainty\\" about climate change, Flannery's thorough review of the history and science of global warming establishes the nature and dimensions of the problem beyond any reasonable doubt. Melting glaciers, species migration and extinction, and increased greenhouse gases are only a few of the barometers that measure the crisis. Of the thirty or so greenhouse gases in our atmosphere (many of which exist only in trace amounts), CO2 is by far the most abundant, and the cause of about 80% of all global warming. Burning the fossil fuels coal and oil, and to a lesser extent gas, releases the CO2 into our atmosphere, which then traps heat near the earth, warms the world, and alters the climate.Flannery is passionate about his subject, but he never pretends that we have easy alternatives. He shows how and why controversies rage on due to the multidisciplinary nature of the subject that makes it complex, competing special interest groups, industry lobbies, corporate profits, and lack of political will. At the end of his book he places the responsibility squarely upon private citizens who, he believes, can take the fate of the earth into their own hands by making wise choices: \\"It's easy to condemn the extravagance that led to the situation in which we now find ourselves, but we must remember that until recently nobody had the slightest idea that their tailpipe emissions or their Hoover vacuum cleaner would have an impact on their children and grandchildren. The same cannot be said for us today, for the true cost of our four-wheel-drives, air conditioners, electric hot water service, clothes dryers, and refrigerators is increasingly evident to all. Moreover, in many developed nations we are three times as affluent on average as our parents were at the same stage of life, and therefore we are able to bear the cost of changing our ways.\\"Jared Diamond's book Collapse argued a simple and sobering fact of history, that even advanced civilizations vanished because of environmental distress. Al Gore's film and book, An Inconvenient Truth, and the blue-ribbon study Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis. A Report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), are two other studies of the conclusive evidence.

He also explains how a super wealthy owner of coal mines and coal-fired generators, living - guess where! In Texas! - glommed on to the self-justifying theory that increased carbon and global warming would increase the agricultural areas of the planet and cause plants to grow more prolifically, thus improving things for humanity. This man produced the movie \\"The Greening of America\\" at large cost, and that movie influenced a generation of Texans, who have evidently avoided digging any deeper on the subject ever since. Unfortunately, global warming increases deserts and storm sizes, and higher concentrations of carbon have little effect on cereal crops, but greatly enhance the poisons in poison ivy and poison oak, among other things, none of them helpful and most harmful. It is common sense that conditions as they were when human kind evolved are the conditions to which we are acclimated, and any significant alteration will not be good for us - or, it turns out, any of the lifeforms on our planet upon which we are dependent. We are in the midst of the \\"Sixth Extinction\\" (Richard Leakey) and as we take ourselves down we are taking most of the planet with us. There is only a chance that we can manage things to surmount them - and that chance grows smaller every day.

Tim Flannery is an Australian scientist and climate authority and I intend to present what science thinks are the facts behind the changing climate of the earth and what we have to do. I will be giving a Marxist spin to some of these facts as I think it is the capitalist economic system fostering large scale industrial pollution and the emission of green house gasses that is the problem not \\"man\\" as the title suggests.Flannery tells us that the best scientific evidence indicates that by 2050 we must reduce CO2 emissions by 70%. So we must keep that in mind in any policy discussions and suggestions that people or governments put forth. We must only support programs that aim at this level of reduction.For purposes of explanation, NOT as a scientific fact, Flannery refers to the GAIA hypothesis which treats the Earth as a living interconnected entity. This is very poetic but Marxist dialectics accomplishes the same function of treating the earth as a unity in difference wherein each and every part influences each and every other part to a greater or lesser degree.Flannery mentions something called Earth's ALBEDO. This word comes from Latin for \\"whiteness. The Albedo is the ability to reflect the Sun's heat back into space and away from the Earth (clouds, snow, etc.). We should note that 1/3 of all the heat reaching the Earth from the Sun is redirected back out into space.We are also told that if we don't control global warming we could destroy our civilization and even our species. If we did that we would kill off so many other life forms along with us that \\"the repair job to Earth's biodiversity would take tens of millions of years.\\" Only ideologically driven Ayn Rand type capitalists would trade off tens of millions of years and our species itself to pump a few more barrels of oil or open more coal power plants. Remember we only have to 2050 to get rid of 70% of the CO2 emissions!Just as there a great ocean of H2O covering most of the Earth there is a great \\"aerial ocean\\" surrounding the planet: it this ocean in which we live.Generally called the atmosphere it is made up of four layers. We live in the bottom layer called the troposphere which has 80% the gases of the atmosphere. We live the first 1/3 of it which has 50% of all the gases. The 1/3 we live in is the only place where we can breathe. Flannery informs us that it is warmer at the bottom \\"its temperature gradient is upside down.\\" Another fact is that the air in it north of the equator rarely mixes with the air south of the equator. Hence polluted air in the more developed north doesn't go south.The second layer starts about seven miles up and is called the stratosphere.Going up to thirty miles we meet the mesosphere. Last, at fifty miles up comes the thermosphere which after another forty or so miles peters out into space.The atmosphere is basically made up of three elements that we breathe: argon (.9%), oxygen (20.9%), nitrogen (78%). There are also trace gases, less than .05%.Flannery says we have only recently recognized that the atmosphere engages in \\"telekinesis.\\" What he means is that atmospheric changes can \\"manifest themselves simultaneously in distant regions.\\"Now, the subject of this book are the greenhouse gases, part of the collection of trace gases, but they all \\"share the ability to block long wavelengths of energy\\"-- the HEAT ENERGY coming from the sun. By \\"block\\" Flannery means \\"trap\\"-- they trap it in the atmosphere. It is instructive he says, to make some comparisons. The temperature of Venus at the surface is 891 degrees F and its atmosphere is 98% CO2 (a major greenhouse gas). If CO2 became 1% of Our atmosphere, the surface temperature of Earth would rise to 212 degrees F. I think you all know what that means folks.Part 2CO2 is not itself the only cause of global warming. Rather, Flannery says, its ability to \\"trigger\\" the production of water vapor is far more important. It creates a \\"feed back loop\\": CO2 warms the air thus producing more H2O vapor which warms the air even more, then CO2 warms this new air, etc. H2O vapor also makes up the clouds which play a dual role. Thin high flying clouds reflect heat energy back into space, low flying thick ones trap it and warm the atmosphere. The CO2 generated by fossil fuels is responsible for 80% of global warming as a result of these processes. One of reasons it is so dangerous is its longevity in the atmosphere. Flannery points out that 56% of the CO2 generated in the last couple of hundred years is still in the atmosphere.Where does most of it come from? We are told it's from all the billions of motors we have made that run of fossil fuel. \\"Most dangerous of all are the power plants that use coal to generate electricity.\\" It looks like every new coal fueled power plant is another nail in the coffin of our planet. The next most dangerous greenhouse gas is methane: CH4. This mostly comes from natural gas.Nature has its own ways of removing carbon gases from the air-- unless we overload the system (which is what our profit driven capitalist system is doing ). The forests and the oceans have been thought to be the biggest carbon \\"sinks\\" but recent research has shown that only the oceans really count-- from 1800-1994 they stored 48% of the carbon put out by our system \\"while life on land has actually contributed carbon to the atmosphere.\\" Please recall Ronald Reagan's astute observation that trees are also polluters!Now we need a little history. Genetic analysis shows that about 100,000 years ago there were only about 2000 breeding members of out species on Earth. A very small population. Now there are six billion of us (not all of us breeding). About 10,000 years ago some of us took up agriculture and the industrial civilization of today is the result. There are still pockets of humans, in the Amazon for example, with cultures untouched by developments of industrial civilization (but not for long).All humans lived as hunter gathers until the agricultural revolution. There is no evidence that we are any smarter today than then, or that present day hunter gathers are any less smarter than their city dwelling cousins. So what were we doing for 90,000 years until agriculture came along. Why didn't we become agricultural much sooner?Scientists have been taking ice cores from the poles and from glaciers around the world. These reveal that violent climate changes and alternating ice ages and warm periods were taking place on off throughout the period of our early gestation. These periods show major CO2 fluctuations also occurring and being responsible for climate changes. But these CO2 fluxes were of natural origin. What is going on today is caused by our industrial system.The last great ice age, of many, lasted from 35,000 to 20,000 years ago. Around 20,000 years ago another natural flux towards global warning began which led, by 10,000 years ago to the climate we have today. Between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago the Earth warmed up by 9 degrees F. This was a little under an increase of 2 degrees F per 1000 years.But with our coal power plants and other fossil fuels we are slated to heat the Earth between 2 to 8 degrees F in this century alone. This will be an unmitigated disaster for life on Earth. It will lead to the greatest extinction event (it has already begun) since the end of the Age of the Dinosaurs 65 million years ago. [Since birds are dinosaurs they are not technically extinct.]The long warming period that began 20,000 years ago was marked by a zig zag back and forth between alterations of hot and cold climates which finally stabilized about 8000 years ago in what scientists call \\"the long summer\\" [i.e., the climate since the agricultural revolution]. So what were humans doing up until then? Well, with the coming of the long summer we slowly left our caves and huts, populations increased, agriculture led to the founding of early civilizations.... and here we are.Part 3For the last 8000 years the Earth's climate has been stable and Flannery says this period of time has been the most crucial in the long history of our species. It allowed us to develop agriculture and create the industrial civilization we now have. Agriculture is older than the \\"long summer\\" but it was \\"during this period that we acquired most of our major crops and domestic animals....\\"A few hundred years ago, after the inventions of Newcomen and Watt (Newcommen engine and improved steam engine) coal was in great demand as a cheap fuel. Flannery points out that Edison, in 1882, opened the first electric light power station in New York City and it was powered by coal. Steam engines are no loner in vogue and today coal is more or less confined to the production of electric power (there is some use of it in home heating but oil is more likely here).Oil is a major source of energy production these days, but by 1995 it began to look like we might run out of it. Cheap oil [under $40 a barrel] was becoming a thing of the past and while we were finding new oil at about the rate of 9.6 billion barrels a year we were using about 24 billion barrels.Flannery reports that scientists estimate it takes 100 tons of ancient plant life to yield one gallon of gas. You can imagine the vast sizes of the prehistoric forests of the Carboniferous period [286-380 million years ago] which now rest under our feet in great pools of oil. Oil is ultimately nothing more than fossil sunlight, Flannery says. How much sunlight did it take to grow 100 tons plant life in the Carboniferous period. It can be calculated. Flannery gives the figures for 1997. All the oil we consumed that year took 422 years of plant life to supply. In one year we consumed what it took 422 years \\"of blazing light from a Carboniferous sun\\" to produce.Some of our resources are renewable and some are not. The oil in the ground is not renewable. As far as renewable resources are concerned, we are already using them up at a rate of 20% more \\"than the planet can sustainably provide.\\" Flannery reminds us that in 1961 there where 3 billion of us on the planet and now we number 6 billion and growing. By 1986 we were using each year 100% of what the earth could reproduce for us in a sustainable manner. In that year we \\"reached Earth's carrying capacity.\\" Every year since \\"we have been running the environmental equivalent of a budget deficit, which is sustained only by plundering our capital base.\\"Look at it this way. Our economy is tanking. Well so is the Earth. President Obama might get us out of the financial crisis-- but the crisis we are putting the Earth through, by maintaining capitalism, may finish us off. The oceans are more and more polluted, the coral reefs are dying, the fisheries are on the verge of collapse, the rain forests are being cut down, the Arctic is melting, and the Japanese still want to hunt whales.If we don't get rid of capitalism, capitalism will get rid of us. The capitalist countries, despite all the talk about doing something, have no intention of taking meaningful action. This is all due to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Hey hey, ho, ho, oil and coal have got to go! [And natural gas too.]There have been two important years in the last thirty that stand out as having heralded major changes due to greenhouse gases. One is 1976. Before that date the tropical Pacific often had a surface temperature that often dipped below 66.5 degrees F. Since then the temperature rarely gets below 77 degrees F. This changes wind currents in the atmosphere and the distribution of rain. One of the biggest such disturbances happened in 1998 which dried out much of Southeast Asia which lost around 25 million acres to fire (50% was of old rain forest). Flannery says 2 million additional acres were lost on Borneo alone. The climate of the world has never been the same since.However, climate change is slower in tropical and temperate zones. It takes longer to reveal itself. At the poles, however, Flannery reveals, \\"climate change is occurring now at TWICE the rate seen anywhere else.\\" This is why, by the way, we all have been reading about the plight of polar bears and penguins and have seen on TV the glaciers falling apart and crashing into the ocean. All this drama is on its way here too. Its just a matter of time. Its already hinted at by the increase in the amount and intensity of the fires onPart 4The most dramatic first results of global warming are to be seen at the poles. More specifically at the edges of the Arctic and Antarctic regions were most life is found. In southern Alaska, Flannery reports that since the 1970s the winters have become 4 to 5 degrees F warmer. This can result in more than the dramatic pictures of retreating glaciers that we see.There is small insect named \\"the spruce bark beetle.\\" The temperature increase has allowed more of its eggs to hatch and its grubs to mature and they are spreading and have now \\"killed some 40 million trees in southern Alaska, more than any other insect in North America's recorded history.\\"The Arctic proper is already treeless as it is a vast tundra. On this vast tundra lives DICROSTONYX HUDSONIUS. A tough little rodent better known as the lemming. It makes a meager living, but the tundra is its home. The tundra is also the nesting place of hundreds of millions of migrating birds.Flannery says the ARCTIC CLIMATE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (2004, published jointly by the countries bordering the region) reports the higher temperatures are likely to result in a loss of 50% of bird nesting areas due to the destruction of the tundra by the invasion of forests that can now spread to the region. As for the lemming: \\"the species will be extinct before the end of this century.\\"The lives of the Inuit (Alaska, Canada, Greenland) and of the Saami people of Finland [Laplanders] will also be affected. They depend on caribou (reindeer) as part of their domestic economy. As the temperature rises it appears that \\"the Arctic will no longer be a suitable habitat for caribou.\\"We already know the polar bear is facing extinction. But so are the many other species that depend on the bear. The bear kills a seal for food but leaves a mess behind. That mess feeds the arctic fox, several species of gull and the raven, among others. Bears are not getting enough food to build up their fat supplies for hibernation. This is because less sea ice means less opportunity to find and catch a seal. Nevertheless they hibernate and simply die instead of waking up. The loss of the polar bear \\"may mark the beginning of the collapse of the entire Arctic ecosystem.\\" And what is true for the polar bear is also true for the walrus and the narwhal.After the poles, other areas of the world that show damage from greenhouse gases are ocean reefs. The reefs are actually getting a double whammy-- climate change and ocean pollution. Flannery quotes Alfred Russel Wallace (1857) on the coral reef he saw while sailing into Ambon Habour, Indonesia. He saw one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen-- a great coral reef covered with life: a forest of animals: \\"It was a sight to gaze at for hours, and no description can do justice to its surpassing beauty and interest.\\"Flannery went there in the 1990s but saw no beautiful forest of animals or beautiful corals. \\"Instead , the opaque water stank and was thick with effluent and garbage. As I neared the town , it got worse, until I was greeted with rafts of feces, plastic bags, and the intestines of butchered goats.\\" So much for the wonders of nature.Climate change is raising the temperature of the oceans. Coral is sensitive to warmer H2O and after a few months, if the temperature does not go down, the coral dies and we have a \\"bleached\\" reef-- a big dead spot. Prior to the 1930s bleaching was little known, and was so up to the 1970s when it began to be more noticeable. After 1998 a global coral dying was \\"triggered.\\"Lets just look at the Great Barrier Reef as example. In 1998 42% of it bleached. It recovered a bit but 18% was dead for good. In 2002 60% of the reef was affected by bleaching. A study the next year showed on 50% of the reef living coral had been reduced to 10%. A big loss!. The reef is being killed by \\"spiraling CO2 emissions.\\"Flannery points out that per capita Australia emits more CO2 than any other country. The government says it wants to save the reef-- one of the greatest natural wonders of the world. However, in 2004 its new energy policy \\"enshrined coal at the center of the nation's energy generation system.\\" [Coal powered plants are the global enemy of life on Earth].Note this was in 2004. Meanwhile back in 2002 global scientists had warned in the magazine Science that \\"projected increases in CO2 and temperatures over the next fifty years exceed the conditions under which coral reefs have flourished over the past half-million years.\\" So we are posed to wipe out in 50 years what it took nature 500,000 years to produce. Hello! Meanwhile we will see zillions of ads on TV from American coal companies about \\"clean coal\\" and how we can become energy independent with coal fired power plants. The coal industry is just like the cigarette industry. They know they are killing us but will testify that their product is harmless, etc. All capitalists act this way.Part 5The golden toad was a beautiful small toad that lived in Costa Rica until the end of 1980s. It is now extinct, and Flannery calls it the \\"first documented victim of global warming.\\" It was our gas guzzling cars and coal fired power plants that wiped out the delicate climate of its environment \\"as surely as if we had flattened its forest with bulldozers.\\"The golden toad was the first, but not the last. Enter RHEOBATRACHUS SILUS, the gastric brooding frog, formerly a native of Australia. This frog was first found in 1973. It was very unusual. The scientist who found opened its mouth to see a little tiny frog sitting inside. What was R. silus up to?It had evolved to swallow its eggs which hatched into tadpoles in a special chamber of its stomach (where digestion would not take place) and when a tadpole turned into a little frog up it came into momma's mouth to be released into the world. Six years later there was no more R. silus. Although it too was killed by global warming the cause was not documented until after the cause of the golden toad had been.There is a world wide die off of frogs, toads and other amphibians going on at this time. Many, if not most, are killed by a fungus SAPROLGENIA FERAX. But the reason this fungus is killing them is that climate change has weakened the amphibian embryo by allowing more ultra violet light to reach the Earth, and the rise in Earth's temperature is spreading the fungus and allowing it to attack more and more victims. Also the ponds that many tadpoles live in are drying up before they can turn into frogs and toads.Some extra info. SCIENCE DAILY (online) for 1-21-2009 reports another major threat to frogs. The headline reads \\"Frogs Are Being Eaten To Extinction, Experts Say.\\" Despite the fact that amphibians are \\"the most threatened animal group\\" hundreds of millions of frogs are being hunted to extinction for their legs. Frog legs are on menus throughout the world-- including school lunch menus in Europe. The crash in frog populations is similar to that of the marine fisheries. Bon appetit!Some of the most serious consequences of global warming can be seen in the redistribution of rain fall patterns. As the Earth warms there is more rain at higher latitudes in winter, Flannery reports. This will, and has, produced more serious avalanches and flooding. Just watch the evening news!But just as serious, in fact more serious, is that rainfall will also diminish in other areas where it has been plentiful. A new drier climate has been created in the Sahel region of Africa-- \\"an enormous swathe \\" of land from the Atlantic coast to Sudan. For the last 40 years the monsoon rains have failed to appear in this region, due to climate change caused by the European and American (and now Indian and Chinese) use of hydrocarbons for energy.We have destroyed the rain and the consequence has been a rash of famines that have killed hundreds of thousands. All those starving Ethiopians we have seen on TV ever since the 1980s are starving because of our capitalist economic activity driven by coal and oil. Besides warming, \\"global dimming\\" is going on. The dust particles we pump into the air blocks sunlight from reaching the oceans and their cooling affects the rain fall and monsoons that are needed in the Sahel. The \\"moral implications\\" of this, Flannery says, \\"seems to have gone all but unnoticed in the world's news media.\\" There is a direct causal link between our use of coal and other hydocarbons and the mass famines in Africa.The tragic events in Dafur can also be explained by the West's causing of so much climate change. The camel herding nomads have been driven into the agricultural areas of Dafur seeking food and water for their animals and themselves due to climate change. Conflict broke out between them and the farmers in the agricultural areas. The two groups are classified as Arabs and Africans but, except for herding or farming, the groups are \\"culturally and physically indistinguishable\\" according to Flannery.There are all sorts of political complications but \\"we see the west focusing on religion and politics as the problem, rather than the well-documented and evident environmental catastrophe that is its ultimate cause.\\" We had better focus on the real causes because, \\"So big is the Sahelian climate shift that it could influence the climate of the entire planet.\\"If you remember, we live at the bottom of the troposphere which extends upwards about seven miles to meet the stratosphere-- the boundary region is called the tropopause. Flannery reports that in 2003 scientists discovered that the tropopause has risen by several hundred meters. This is important because this \\"is where much of our weather is generated.\\" Greenhouse gasses trapped there heat up the whole planet causing more and more powerful hurricanes and other extreme weather phenomena.These are some of the effects of this warming worth mentioning:1. More flooding: 7 million people were flooded out yearly in the 1960s, but now the yearly figure is about 150 million.2. More extreme heat waves. 26,000 people died from the heat in Europe in 2003 from July to September.3. In 2004 the temperature in Egypt hit 126.8 degrees F. One of highest \\"ever recorded.\\"4. All the continents are right now in the process of shrinking. \\"This is because, courtesy of heat and melting ice, the oceans are expanding.\\"Part 6Lets look at just some of the problems we create by burning coal, according to the scientific evidence in Flannery's book.There are wee bits of dust and particulate matter that drifts in the atmosphere. They are called aerosols. Coal burning plants in the U.S. now pump so many aerosols into the atmosphere that they kill about 60,000 people per year in this country alone (increased mortality thru lung diseases). Lung cancer rates are higher around areas with coal burning plants.Aerosols also influence \\"global dimming.\\" This is a phenomenon wherebyless sunlight can reach the earth. Soot aerosols, along with jet trails, reflect sunlight back into space cooling the earth. But we are putting so much CO2 into the air that the heat being trapped is greater than the heat being reflected into space. Therefore the earth is warming up. The only thing that can prevent an ecological disaster is to start removing CO2 from the air (which we have not figured out how to do in any meaningful way).If we stopped putting CO2 into the air today the CO2 already there will continue to heat the earth for decades. So, we are facing a big problem.Here are some interesting statements from Flannery. It seems that if all new greenhouse gasses were immediately stopped from entering the air, the ones already in the air would continue to heat up the planet until 2050 or so. Then the atmosphere would stabilize at a new higher annual temperature. But we are no way near halting our polluting ways! In fact, we should note that \\"half the energy\\" we have burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution has been burned in just the last 20 years. So our polluting is becoming more intense.Here is what we have to do to stabilize the climate around 2100-- we would need to reduce CO2 by 70% of the 1990 level by 2050. Then we would have CO2 at 450 parts per million. Flannery thinks it more realistic to aim at 550 parts per million with climate stabilization \\"centuries from now.\\" The earth would end up around 5.4 degrees F [or 3 C] hotter by 2100 than it is now.The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says we must prevent \\"dangerous\\" climate change. So what constitutes dangerous climate change? It seems the consensus is about 2 degrees C-- anything over that may lead to disaster. So 2C is the most we can stand for, and if we get to work NOW we may still get 3C by 2100, the outlook is not so hot (no pun intended).\\"Earth's average temperature,\\" Flannery writes, \\"is around 59 degrees F, and whether we allow it to rise by a single degree or 5 degrees F will decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of species, and most probably billions of people.\\"Besides oceans, rain forests and coral reefs, the world's mountains are also experiencing rapid change. You can forget the snows of Kilimanjaro and the glaciers of New Guinea. The CO2 already in the atmosphere has doomed them and they will be gone in just a few decades.As the earth warms the mountain habitat changes and animals who were lower down on the mountain move to the top while the topmost species go extinct. We are now in the process of losing mountain gorillas, panda bears and many plant species.Flannery says some species benefit from global warming. The Anopheles mosquito is spreading and the malaria parasites it spreads will soon be infecting \\"tens of thousands of people without any resistance to the disease.\\"Obama's stimulus bill, whatever else it does, may be a boon for malaria parasites. It contains one billion dollars for the coal industry to help develop \\"clean coal\\" [there is no such animal] which fosters the illusion that we can survive without closing down the coal industry itself.We can't save everything, but scientists think if we start taking strong action now we will ONLY lose one third of all existing species on earth. If we don't take action, then by 2100 we will have doomed 60% of existing species to extinction. Is burning coal and other fossil fuels really worth it?Don't think calculations have not been made. Economists working for the UN in conjunction with the World Meteorological Association have done calculations that concluded it was too expensive to really halt climate change. The rich nations will be able to deal with it. The billions of poor in the Third World will be the ones to suffer but, the economists calculated that the life of a poor person was \\"worth only a fifteenth of that of a rich person.\\" It is just not cost effective, according to them, to try and save the poor. At this point I wish Flannery would refer to Marxism, but alas he seems not to be a Marxist.Part 7 [Conclusion]One of the biggest problems facing the Obama administration is that of global warming and what to do about it. The Bush administration rejected the only international agreement to try and remedy the problem (the Kyoto agreement) and a new international agreement must be reached. Kyoto is not, as it stands, adequate to do the job that must be done. Flannery writes, \\"If we are to stabilize our climate, Kyoto's target [a CO2 emissions cut of 5.2%] needs to be strengthened twelve times over: Cuts of 70 percent by 2050 are required to keep atmospheric CO2 at double the pre industrial level.\\"In order to save the planet, as we know it, environmentalists will have to fight powerful international cartels that profit from the use of fossil fuels. The energy lobby in the U.S. worked full time with the Bush Administration to lie about, and distort the scientific. evidence of, global warmingThese forces, and the politicians that front for them, have known for 30 years that their activities were killing the planet but the profits they were making were more important to them than the future existence life on Earth!Flannery points out that ever since 1977 when the New York Times ran a story [\\"Scientists Fear Heavy Use of Coal May Bring Adverse Shift in Climate\\"] there has been a battle plan in effect to suppress as much as possible the scientific evidence of global warming.The eight years of the Bush administration was a kind of culmination of these antiscientific doings. The Bushites suppressed or actually changed the wording and conclusions of scientific reports from NASA, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency [read Destruction Agency under Bush], and the National Academy of Sciences, among others. Even lobbyists for the energy companies were amazed by the zeal of the Bushites to further their interests at the expense of the planet, one of whom remarked that it may be a long time before the energy sector has another President Bush \\"or Atilla the Hun.\\"You know something is wrong when your allies think of you as Atilla the Hun. The truth is that Bush, and the Republicans generally spent their time in office (with the connivance of conservative Democrats) in acting in ways detrimental to 99% of the people of the earth and to enrich the upper 1%. But that 1% will suffer too if the atmosphere gives out.So, what is to be done? We have to hurry, and Flannery sees the two great problems as 1) how to decarbonize the transportation system, and 2) how to decarbonize the electricity grid. We should concentrate our efforts first on the electricity grid (to get rid of coal) and then tackle the transportation system to get rid of oil and gas. It may seem that we will never get rid of these three fuels but we must or we will literally be committing suicide. Our civilization is analogous to those people who smoke three packs a day-- they know what is going to happen to their lungs and would be simply insane not to quit.Flannery discusses several ways the power grid can be weaned from carbon. We can produce power by nuclear, hydrothermal, hydrogen, wind, solar (and also tidal action) methods and thus eliminate the need for coal, oil and natural gas. The risks of nuclear power make it the least desirable. I don't think we should be playing with it-- we don't know what to do with radioactive waste and when I read that the EPA plans to monitor waste dumps for 10,000 years, and will makes rule changes after that period to cover the dumps for 1,000,000 years I think: Let's get real!The EPA is not going to be around for 10,000 years!One thing Flannery points out is that wind and solar energy can be produced locally and even by individuals and their families thus making for a decentralized system. If we go for nuclear or hydrogen power cells then \\"the big power corporations\\" will likely be in charge and survive. I think they should, if they survive, be placed under state control and treated as public utilities which should not be privately held for profit making.After dealing with the power grid, Flannery turns his attention to the transportation system. We will naturally have to develop alternatives to carbon based fuel-- and ethanol is not the answer. It is not cost effective, takes up too much land, and damages the food supply by taking food crops out of production in order to grow the crops to make ethanol. Rather we will have have to use electric calls, hybrids, mincats [CAT stands for compressed air technology], hydrogen based fuel cells, and other non polluting methods to apply to transportation, as well as beef up out systems of public transportation.One thing we can be sure of is that time is running out. I think anyone interested in the problems of climate change and global warming should read Flannery's book."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I was excited to tackle this book, but my excitement faded quickly. The prose are not streamlined and there is no substantive thread to tie the quote-fronted chapters together. Of particular annoyance was the author's obsession with going through a qualitative and repetitive laundry-list of species that are rare and in trouble. Perhaps if this list were presented in conjunction with some historical perspective this could have worked, but as is, it really doesn't.I would recommend taking a look at Ruddiman's recent book on climate and humans if you want a real perspective on the role that the \\"weather makers\\" have had on the physical climate system, but I have no suggestion for a good and historically-grounded book on the biological effects of human-induced climate change."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery shares many similarities with Jared Diamond as scientists who turned to a wider public audience - obviously there is money to be made in selling books. The trick to it seems to be to market your credibility as a scientist to the vast technologically illiterate masses with the promise of simplifying the details into cocktail party-sized morsels.The trajectory of Flannery's career from English major to Zoologist/Paleontologist and now the director of the South Australian Museum (of what is never mentioned) the world has produced the perfect sage to synthesize climate modeling, oceanography and the gritty details of Kyoto. Not being able to check all the facts in the Weather Makers, I have presented one example that stuck me as symptomatic of Flannery's breathless approach. Quoted below is a paragraph on nuclear energy from The Weather Makers (Chapter 30).\\"Three factors loom large in the mind of the public, however, whenever nuclear power is mentioned - safety, disposal of waste and bombs. The horror of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine was a catastrophe of stupendous proportions whose consequences, two decades after the accident, just keep growing. Thyroid cancer is a rare illness, with just one in a million children developing it spontaneously. But one-third of children under four years old who were exposed to fallout from Chernobyl will develop the disease. Seven per cent (about 3.3 million people) of the population of Ukraine have suffered illness as a result of the meltdown, while in neighbouring Belarus, which received 70 per cent of the fallout, the situation is even worse. Only 1 per cent of the country is free from contamination, 25 per cent of its farmland has been put permanently out of production, and nearly 1000 children die each year from thyroid cancer. Currently, 25 per cent of the Belarus budget is spent on alleviating the effects of the disaster.\\"Now compare this to excerpts from the World Health Organization report to the United Nations on the results of the Chernobyl accident:- As of mid-2005, fewer than 50 deaths had been directly attributed to radiation from the disaster.- About 4000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly in children and adolescents at the time of the accident, have resulted from the accident's contamination and at least nine children died of thyroid cancer; however the survival rate among such cancer victims, judging from experience in Belarus, has been almost 99%.- Persistent myths and misperceptions about the threat of radiation have resulted in \\"paralyzing fatalism\\" among residents of affected areas.- Except for the still closed, highly contaminated 30 kilometer area surrounding the reactor, and some closed lakes and restricted forests, radiation levels have mostly returned to acceptable levels.This then is my concern with this book - Flannery is obviously concerned about global warning but I would prefer a credibly researched approach to the problem."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"The author does a good job of describing the current dire situation but falls short when it comes to the solutions. For a much more broader and well thought out analysis of what it's going to take to solve this crisis, read Thom Hartmann's \\"The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight\\"."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Flannery writes the first two-thirds of the book wonderfully: he takes us around the globe, building a reasoned and informative case that our excess of C02 is factoring into the balance of life and habitats on the planet. The writing is engaging in this first part of the book, and Flannery's love of the interconnectedness of Earth's environments sets a fine tone. However, the last third of the book is a political polemic against \\"big oil\\" and \\"big coal,\\" and a confusing call for governments to band together to do something immediately to regulate CO2 emissions, while somehow trying to distinguish this from Orwellian, alarmist responses. Flannery goes from a sensible scientist to an extreme scenarioist (if there is such a word). Get the book for the outstanding opening two-thirds."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"I bought the book on the basis it would be an objective and well structured argument explaining how scientists had negated natural influences on climate change - Milankovich cycles, solar activity and plate tectonics - and isolated the anthropogenic influences.However, I discovered the book is written in a mildly hysterical tone common to environmental activists. If you want to read a scientific account of climate change and how human activity is affecting the climate, read the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"It has been estimated that the earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago and that human beings have inhabited the planet only about 10 to 12 thousand years - ever since the thawing of the last ice age. During our relatively brief time on this planet, we have been fortunate to enjoy moderate temperatures. However, according to Tim Flannery as well as many other students of climate science, the consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and wood is releasing so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that the earth is now warmer than anytime in the last 650,000 years. This is common knowledge to people who read and listen to the news. What is interesting about Flannery's well-written and well-researched book is that he describes in detail the consequences of a few degrees in temperature rise. If the earth's temperature rises a few degrees thousands of species and ecosystems will die, a few more still and it will kill off the human race.Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide stay in the atmosphere for well over fifty years. The kind of build up that is currently taking place will affect people beyond our lifetimes. Unfortunately the people making decisions today have a much shorter time horizen in mind. Flannery predicts that we will soon reach a tipping point, beyond which the damage will be irreparable.Flannery, an Australian paleontologist, first became interested in climate science when he noticed the rapid advance of trees in the mountains around his favorite hiking trails. He also noticed that the glaciers on the mountains were receding much faster than previously predicted. These observations led him do further research, which produced this book. He found that trends such as the ones he was observing in Australia were occurring on a global scale.Flannery found that the glaciers on the poles are receding at a rapid rate, and that vegetation is advancing in the polar direction. Vegetation is receding away from the equator and leaving the equatorial area more arid. This in turn is causing rising tides, more flooding, more hurricanes, and, ironically, more droughts. The warming of the poles is causing a decline in the krill population, which in turn is causing the demise of the emperor penguin and whale population. The polar bears and the caribou are also suffering greatly due to warming temperatures.The rapid change in climate is causing behavioral change in many species, causing them either to mate too soon, or too late, or not at all. From the golden toad to butterflies, to fish, and to migrating birds changing weather patterns are upsetting many fragile ecosystems.As a herald of global warming, Flannery will have many critics, not surprisingly from the oil and coal industries, and from politicians who do their bidding. Governments and multinationals have generally tried to suppress information concerning climate change or tried to cast doubt on the findings, but the evidence is speaking louder and more frequently. Last year, Australia's environmental minister even cited Flannery's book when he declared that global warming was indeed a reality and that action needed to be taken.Flannery argues that there are piecemeal steps that citizens and governments can take to reverse the trend. This book is a good overview of the problem and it is a good reminder that if something isn't done the damage will be lasting."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This is a great book overall on the topic of global warming. Flannery does a great job explaining the science behind global warming, and he also offers solutions for what we can do to stop it. Anyone who cares about the great Earth that we live on should read this book. Please do whatever you can to fight global warming before it's too late."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Essential reading for anyone concerned, confused, or living on this planet.Tim Flannery has the amazing gift of being a scientist who has the capacity to refrain from getting bogged down in scientific jargon when writing.

A great background reader for those who want to be informed on the nuances of the topic."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"Tim Flannery is described as a former global warming skeptic as I once was. That was before we could see global temperatures accelerating past historic highs.There will always be those who disagree. The pattern is always the same. Some say smoking tobacco is not that harmful, that CFCs don't break down ozone, that gasoline should have lead in it, that sulfur dioxides are not harmful, and that asbestos is fine to breathe. It is pure political motivation. The problem here is that we cannot learn this message fast enough.This book is not like Al Gore's journalistic message. Flannery gets down to the boring details that sometimes includes migrations of an endless number of species as a result of global warming.The bottom line appears on page 205. \\"...so enormous is the problem and so long it will take to ramp up any such solutions (e.g. towing icebergs) that in the face of swift climate change, they offer no hope for the great majority of us.\\" Later in the book Flannery offers suggestions that would alleviate CO2 emissions, and begin to make a difference, but...I suggest Flannery knows in his subconscious the situation is already grim. The problem is specifically the nature of the unwillingness of the non-consenters - the Rush Limbaughs, the John Stossels and the Ann Coulters of the world. In this case once the CO2 has accumulated beyond control there will be no going back and there will be no solution for the future. CO2 accumulation is spiraling out of control and the effects won't be felt until it is too late.We had paradise on Earth. It is, and to some extent, already has been gambled away. Nice effort Tim. You tried to save us."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"\\"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing The Climate And What It Means For Life On Earth\\"Mr Flannery is making quite a name for himself these days in the global change arena. He is a paleontologist and biologist by training so he is in a good position to know the score.Unfortunately he skews and cherry picks the data to make his points. And why does he abandon the International System of units?Being a meteorologist I just can't help myself! Take page 123: \\"...air at 104F can hold 470 times as much water vapor as air at -104F.\\" I'm not questioning the factor of 470; my references are at the office not here at home. But AIR DOES NOT HOLD WATER. To ask how much water air can hold is the same as asking how much oxygen it can hold, or nitrogen. Saturation vapor pressure is a strong function of temperature, yes, but Dalton's Law of partial pressures always holds -- the constituent gasses are independant of one another and act as if the others did not exist. We've been through this. If a scientist wants to lose my respect, just write as Flannery does here.Page 132: \\"The drought conditions in the American west are frequently portrayed in the media as being part of a natural cycle.\\" This is because they are, Tim. There is a regular 20-year cycle which became clear to me -- and would to any investigator -- when I did my thesis in 1977, \\"A Statistical Evaluation of 3 years Cloud Seeding in South Central Utah.\\" It was dry in the 70s, the 50s, the 30s, the teens and so on back to the 1890s, 70s, etc. Just look at the gol' darned data. And his use of the term \\"the media\\" is pejorative, seeking to discredit the conclusion by assigning it to this vague entity, the media. The media include just about every scholarly journal you can think of including LCD, local climate data published by NCDC. Did he bother to look?He starts talking about hurricanes and can hardly restrain himself. Page 136: \\"As the troposphere has warmed over the last decade, the world has seen...the first South Atlantic hurricane ever (2002)\\" Not true, it is merely the first recorded in modern times. We know nothing of what went on before the advent of satellite surveillance and the development of hurricane theory itself, with William Redfield in the 1840s and Herb Riehl in the 1940s. The word \\"ever\\" is totally unjustified here. In the very next sentence he says, \\"This...indicates that the potential for the new climate to generate extremes is already increasing.\\" Well Tim, as you learned in math class if your assumptions are false then your conclusions are invalid. If you are going to dress up assumptions as data then how can I believe you?He jumps into the world of modeling next. If you have read previous entries by me you know how I feel about models. I've been taken down the garden path by the models too many times to place unbounded faith in them. Faith is the operative word, too, and he acknowledges this when he refers to the Hadley Centre in England as a \\"cathedral of climate change research\\" on page 155. But he surrenders with statements like, \\"Computer models...at the Hadley Centre pass all...tests with a reasonable degree of accuracy...\\" What is reasonable, Tim? Would you care to define that? I guess not as the text is silent.In fact, he skewers himself on the same page with, \\"As long as skepticism is based on a sound understanding of science, it is invaluable...But poor criticism can lead those who are unfamiliar with the science involved into doubting everything about climate change predictions.\\" Where do you fall, Tim? How familiar are YOU with the science? What you imply is, throw out the data and the models are right. Voila!The final nail in his coffin for me is the illustration on the facing page, \\"The weather for July 1, 1998.\\" (Why he falls back 10 years to the 90s is not clear.) Chart A is the Hadley Centre's model output and below is chart B, the actual weather for that day. \\"The two images are similar.\\" Well guess what? Chart A is the output of the UKMET operational forecast model and has nothing to do with any climate model. No climate model I've ever seen would have any such output. For a single day? Either Mr Flannery knows better, in which case the illustration is mendacious; or he does not, in which case he has allowed himself to be duped. Which is it, Tim? Do you find it necessary to display false information in order to make your point? Why did you label that chart improperly?And isn't it funny that he uses the Hadley Centre which has just been seriously indicted in the purloined e-mail controversy. Page 166: \\"Researchers at the Hadley Centre talk of a \\"physical commitment to climate change,\\"\\" citing an internal report from 2002. I'd say their \\"physical commitment\\" (whatever the heck that means, quotes in original) became a metaphysical commitment, clouding their judgement and just about erasing a decade of scientific progress when their true thoughts became public.Flannery has fallen under their spell and drank their Kool Aid I guess. He picks and chooses his data; he demonstrates no real understanding of atmospheric science (thinks air \\"holds water\\") and so relies on the opinions of others; prefers model output to hard data; tries to confuse the reader with his mis-labeled charts.The fact is global warming is real; mankind has a partial responsibility. There is little room left for doubt. BUT LET'S BE HONEST. That is essential. There is no room whatsoever for falsification and dishonesty. This is the reason the e-mail controversy is so important. When you bend the data to fit your pre-existing conclusions you are doing religion, not science. The public has a right to be skeptical. No, to be pissed off! It is a misuse of public funds to mislead the public."},{"Title":"The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth","review":"This book is VERY intelligently written and a true wake-up call to what is VERY obviously a danger to the whole world, and life upon it; sadly \\"critics\\" like \\"Right-Wing Disliker\\" don't seem to get the message; and by the way \\"Right-Wing\\", the name is Carl ROVE and not ROWE. There is MORE than enough proof of Global Warming (let alone the alarming weather in the US this winter and the Fall before), and the hurricanes, tornados and tsunamis will be getting far MORE numerous and deadly; it is time indeed to start worrying.

As a perfect psychological match, Reacher is arrested by the FBI, but is released when another woman is murdered. Now Reacher has to use his skills to clear his name, and to do the Army and FBI's work for them.(This book is released as \\"Running Blind\\" in the US and as \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK.)This book features a new twist in writing style - the author Lee Child lets the reader know about the thoughts of the killer in between! These parts are also quite interesting even if the reader does not get any useful hints towards the identity of the killer. In general the book is well written, Reacher is charismatic and intelligent as ever, the pace is great and I hardly could stop reading the book. Even if the identity of the killer is really a big surprise and took me completely off guard I am not quite convinced by it since I do not think it was completely logical and especially believable.\\"The Visitor\\" is Lee Child's fourth book and to my opinion it is clearly better and more thrilling than his second and third novel (\\"Die Trying\\" + \\"Tripwire)\\". Unfortunately it does not reach the brilliance of his first book \\"Killing Floor\\". Therefore I could not rate it with the full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Not much to say about this book. In a review of another Reacher book (\\"Echo Burning\\"), I said that these books were fun reads despite their many drawbacks as novels (careless and sloppy writing, no attention to factual accuracy, one dimensional characters, plots that rely on coincidence etc). This book is not fun, just stupid.The plot is literally incredible in many respects. The mysterious villain is telegraphed. The facts are wrong (my favorite: Fort Dix as a Marine Corps base--at the time the novel was written, it was an Army and Guard/Reserve base as it had been for over 80 years). If you can even faintly buy the ending and explanation I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that I could sell to you. Don't read it.

Sooo - it has created some confusion."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Literary license is the authority readers grant a fiction writer to bend reality into an interesting story. The license is to bend, not to break. Running Blind smashes reality into some twisted mess that is impossible to accept. Impossible unless you have about a hundred pounds of brain damage.This book flat out violates the Pigs Can't Fly Rule. That is the rule that says that no matter what any fiction writer says, pigs just can't fly. Here are some examples of how this rule is violated in Running Blind (WARNING: the rest of this review contains STORY SPOILERS):1. The FBI Agents in an elite We Catch Serial Killers Unit are dumber than dirt. They can only see two or three possible solutions to the \\"who did it\\" puzzle. The have no ability to consider alternate theories or to ask insightful questions about the evidence. Now I know that not all FBI Agents are going to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, but if they were as dumb as they are portrayed in the book, they would not have enough brain power to find their way to work in the morning.2. The Serial Killer is an FBI Agent who is a big shot in the We Catch Serial Killers Unit (which should be renamed Serial Killers R Us). As an Agent, she has some phobia about flying on airplanes and refuses to get on one. As The Serial Killer she is flying all over the countryside. Nobody in her elite unit notices that she disappears at critical times, or ever suspects that she might really not have a fear of flying. Lots and lots of dead bodies don't bother her, but United Airlines freaks her out! And nobody wonders why. I told you these FBI Agents were dumber than dirt.3. The hero of this story is some X Army Major who goes through the entire tale (which takes a while and which requires him to travel all over the place) with just one pair of undershorts. This apparently gives him a connection to the murdered victims because after a while, neither the dead victims or Major Undershorts can smell too good. Further, Major Undershorts cracks a key clue in the case by deep french kissing a hot blonde 6 foot plus FBI babe who usually doesn't wear a bra but who otherwise wears men's clothing so that she will \\"fit in.\\" No contradiction there. And well, I guess when you think about it, lots of serial killer cases have been solved by having some stained undershorts freak tounge a hot blonde FBI Agent. NOT! Buy the way, Major Undershorts name is Jack Reacher. To many Middle Eastern Terrorists he is known, of course, as Asheets Madrawers.4. The Serial Killer's method of operation is to hypnotize her victims into, in effect, murdering themselves. There is no use of hypnotic drugs to assist in this effort. The problem with this nonsense is that only a very small percentage of people can deeply hypnotized to the point that they can be forced to take actions against their will, and have hypnotic amnesia. If we could really use hypnosis that easily, nobody would have a problem with losing weight, or with trying to stop smoking. We would just put them in a hypnotic state, and tell them to stop, and they would stop. And since The Serial Killer's motive in the book is financial gain, all she had to do was to open up a Hynosis Clinic that would guarantee its clients that they would stop smoking, stop overeating, stop having a fear of flying, or stop doing whatever it is that they wanted to stop doing and she would make boatloads of money. Boatloads! And without all the muss and fuss of killing all those innocent people.Of course, if pigs could fly than I could stop traveling on airplanes. But they can't, no matter what some fiction writer says."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Did I miss something.

Don't get me wrong, the story reads great, as always. However, the ending is completely disappointing. I don't want to give it away, but it's based on a stereotyped, way-overused, and completely false quasi-science that is impossible to happen the way it does in the book. When you see this plot in a TV show, you know that the writers are running out of ideas, as they always seem to eventually use this one. I expected better from Lee Child. Perhaps others can overlook that (or don't realize it's completely unreal), but it ruined the book for me.So go ahead and read it if you can't stand the thought of missing a Jack Reacher novel, but if you're new to the series, please start with another one, like The Persuader or Without Fail, or at the beginning with The Killing Floor."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am reading the series in order. I think this was the best one yet. It leaves my very excited to continue the Reacher series. We began to see more depth in Reacher as he struggles with understanding himself.

A character who has cheated death and dastardly villains in three books teeters on the brink of invulnerability, and that can be quite dull. Child has thrown Reacher up against violent counterfeiters, bloodthirsty anti-government folks, and (literally) cut-throat businessmen. How does he top himself in Book 4?First, by creating a mind-blowing mystery. Otherwise-healthy women are being found dead in bathtubs filled with military green paint, obviously murdered. Yet there is no murder weapon or even evidence that anyone else has been in the house. How can even the legendary investigator Reacher solve a murder with no weapon, no witness, and no evidence? The only link is that the dead women all successfully brought sexual harrassment claims against their superiors in the Army. Not much to go on, even for Reacher.Second, Reacher gets brought into this investigation unwillingly, as he is first tagged by a team of FBI profilers as the exact type who would commit this crime. A loner, a former military guy with a known violent past. As an MP, Reacher saw many senior commanders get busted for claims of sexual harrassment . . . so the FBI shoves a gun in his face and brings him in.After the FBI realizes that Reacher didn't commit the murders, they still remain hostile and use Reacher's beloved girlfriend Jodie as leverage to keep Reacher working on their case. As the FBI is about to learn to their chagrin, nobody threatens Reacher's girlfriend, and things don't work out quite as planned for the feds. (This subplot is both ingenious and allows Reacher to exercise his well-honed craft of cracking heads.)But the most interesting aspect of this fourth novel is that Child writes several passages from the killer's perspective, which is a first for this series. Getting inside the killer's head is always dangerous for a writer, for you don't want to say too much to give away a novel's secrets. Child tap-dances his way through the killer's twisted mind, and the result are several chilling passages where the murderer's crystalline genius stains the pages.Can Reacher track down this anonymous, untraceable murderer in time to save a friend, his girlfriend, and even himself?All in all, \\"Running Blind\\" is more of a mystery than the earlier Reacher novels. Child writes with his trademark economy and attention to detail, and the result is a highly satisfying thriller.The only criticism I have is that Reacher once again finds himself working hand-in-hand with a beautiful woman who meets his particular standards. While Jodie is still in the picture, she's on the sidelines for most of the novel as she is up for partnership at her New York law firm. Nevertheless, Child still gives us a \\"Reacher Girl,\\" his own not-too-subtle twist on the Bond Girl stereotype. I'm all for gorgeous, capable women, but the novels' symmetry on this score is becoming a bit stale. (This is a minor criticism, but keeps it at a four-star level.)"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is the ultimate bad A_ _ He's a hero to look up to, wish we had more people like him in our country."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The plot was good and kept the pages turning -- not sure about the ending although the twist was unexpected.

I can't wait for my next encounter with him."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"as usual a well written yarn, I enjoy all of lee child's books, plenty of intrigue, detective work and action"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I generally have liked the Jack Reacher books, and while totally too violent, at least keep you guessing as to the ending, which is usually fairly plausible. This is the only reason I have given it 2 stars instead of one. The ending is very obvious, as to who the killer is and like all of the other people wrote, it is totally implausible that none of the FBI agents would have noticed what was going on. The whole method of killing was ridiculous and made no sense and then .... now, for those who don't want to know the ending, don't read further........to blame it on hypnosis is ludicrous and a simplistic way to try to tie knots together. Obviously Lee Child doesn't know a thing about hypnosis, because it has been proven that while you can make people do silly tricks on stage, you can't make them do things that go against their character or will and the concept of these post hypnotic suggestions is totally bizarre. Maybe the novel should be called The Stepford Army Girls."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The compelling, lethal, yet mild-mannered, ex-Army MP major Jack Reacher can't win for trying in the opening stages of this interesting crime thriller. He foils a blatant shakedown attempt by two Syrian toughs at the small restaurant that he frequents by inflicting precisely measured pain in a back alley, as only Reacher can do, only to be nabbed by the FBI who has been watching him for a while. It turns out that Reacher is the common thread among several women who have been mysteriously killed after being forced to leave the Army after pressing harassment charges, which Reacher had sympathetically handled as a MP officer.After dropping the pretense that Reacher is a suspect in the murders, the FBI agents more or less force Reacher to assist them in this investigation by threatening to make known his connection to his high-flying lawyer girlfriend Jodie, despite their blatant animosity towards the Army. But how does one catch a killer when there are absolutely no clues, no evidence, other than that all of the victims end up in a bathtub of Army-issue green paint?Reacher needs time to sort through all the possibilities, but time is of the essence: the killer seems to be on a timetable. Reacher does not buy into the killer's profile constructed by Agent Julia Lamarr, but he has no substitute. They can do little more than operate in scramble-mode, trying to predict where the killer will strike next. It is left to Agent Lisa Harper, tall, lithe, and quite attractive, to shadow Reacher - to contain him.It is a time of uncertainty for Reacher beyond the investigation. His inheritance of a large house from a man he was close to in the Army, Jodie's father, has put him in a very uncomfortable position. He is a vagabond; he does not want a house. Furthermore, Jodie is on a fast-track to being a partner in her law firm - the very epitome of stability. Can he really live with the love of his life? On the other hand, Agent Harper represents daring - life on the edge.It is an intriguing story with good pacing and reasonable plausibility. Reacher has some tough questions to solve; sometimes answers can be ambiguous."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love the series but the murder method in this one is so incredibly unrealistic and lame and cheap and cliche that it totally spoils what would be a really entertaining book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I generally like the the Jack Reacher series and will continue to read Child. However in Running Blind the action keeps me interested until page # 157 when, he ruins the the New York sequence-and- repeats it. He refers to Ft Dix, New Jersy as \\"Dix\\"; then he increases his foolishness by calling it a marine base. The navy has bases, the Corps has camps and active army has \\"Forts.\\"my respect takes a dip here. Fort Dix is an active for reserves, National guard, and other activitries; too Partially active Army has camps. Come on Lee! Where were you when you wrote this? Is it \\"deous ex machina?\\" If it is, you fell through the thin Ice. He could have gotten a huey from someone. He dosen't the address scene for this unknown marine who owes him a favor. And then he repeats his mistake. I'm even more cncerned by the supedity of the editer who let this pass. Then through out the rest of the book are misspellings, mispronounciations. You know-I read rest of the book rather quickley. GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER, BOY! (BEING 72YRS I CAN DO THIS) I've been to both Fort Dix, and it's neighbor, McGuire AFB. I'll bet you never even roade past the fort.Andy Davis"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've been entertained by the previous Reacher novels. This one is weak and inconsistent with the others. Reacher takes no guff from anyone, routinely slaps around multiple thugs, breaks bones and kills when necessary, but becomes a complacent servant to pencil neck FBI geeks when threatened? Hopefully, Reacher will grow a pair for the next novel. Oh, and yes, the killer is obvious way early. Look for the person who is the most unlikeable and has the most idiosyncrasies. If the author of a mystery tells you something unusual, it is for a reason to be explained later. That's in the mystery writers manual. Please Mr. Child, try harder next time. And as others have said, the murder method is absurd. A zero star rating would be too high for this drivel."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is one of my favorite Lee Child novels. While the main storyline was a bit complicated, I loved it how Jack Reacher was able to solve the mystery using simple methods and logical reasoning. The animosity between FBI and Army was a bit exaggerated, and how the murderer actually killed the victims was highly improbably. But all in all, this was a fun and quick read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the fourth book I have read from Lee Child in the Jack Reacher series. They are very engaging and well written. The lead character is smart, resourceful, strong and ruthless when he has to be to put down the bad guys. He also has a heart and the character descriptions, interactions and dialogue all feel real when it could easily devolve into a comic book style. I have enjoyed his writing style and character development and plan to read the entire series over time. I can understand why they are so popular."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I enjoy the Reacher books. I have not been able to read them in sequence. But thats not such a problem. It would have been nice to read this one prior to finding out some of the facts in later books. A great book but the last few chapters don't have the same momentum as the rest of the book. Looks like a conclusion needed to be reached and that was it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"There are some Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child that have a higher body count, and others where there is more thinking and figuring things out. \\"Running Blind\\" is one of the latter. Reacher does not rack up a high body count of bad guys, but he still makes for a tough guy hero you can cheer for, and one that has his own problems and demons inside.This book picks up shortly after \\"Tripwire\\" and continues with some of the story that started in that novel. However, the new house and girlfriend from the previous book don't make everything a bed of roses for our hero. There are problems on the home front, as well as an FBI investigation regarding a serial killer that Reacher gets caught in the middle of. The \\"perfect\\" crimes that have the FBI stumped cause Reacher to scratch his head more than once too. The investigation that has Reacher and the FBI \\"Running Blind\\" takes them back and forth across the country witch with temptations and feelings that don't make things easier for Reacher back home in New York.Child's character Reacher is a thinking tough guy, and Child writes in an engaging and entertaining manner that keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next. There are a few twists and turns to keep the reader guessing as to where the story is going and who the clever killer will turn out to be. The dealings with the FBI might not be over, so I'm wondering if any of the agents will show up again, especially Agent Harper. It will also be interesting to see where the relationship that started in \\"Tripwire\\" finally ends. (Having read some of the newer Reacher novels, I know, but am looking forward to seeing how Child does things with the story line.)I discovered this series two years ago by reading a couple of the series from the middle, and have since read the newest Child books, but also went back to start the series from the beginning and throw one into my reading every now and again. This is the fourth book in the series, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a fun read, just like I've found all of them. I'm looking forward to reading the fifth book, \\"Echo Burning\\" as well as the new ones that come out as Child continues to write them.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From The School Of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I'm reading all this authors books in order. I like his style short straight sentences (He isn't into the adjective game with adjectives about adjectives on top of adjectives), the good guys are slightly flawed but prevail,the bad guys fail and the stories are involved and interesting. Simple straight comfort food for an afternoon read. The reason I rated this title so low is also simple. The whole story is about the identification of the bad \\"guy\\" but the person was identifiable by the reader very very.....very early in the book. Anyone that thinks about what they are reading will have to read the following 2/3 of the book knowing the ending. Very, very, ....very tedious."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Characters seemed stiff. Not like some of the newer Jack Reacher. Plot of story ended abruptly. Not as much detail in this story. Just an ok read.

Not a 5 only because as with most books, there was some slow points. Overall, a great, fast read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book grabs you right from the start and throws you into the tense atmosphere and tight action. It keeps you one the edge of your seat.Jack Reacher is blackmailed by the FBI to solve a series of murders that he's first been accused of and later been absolved of. Jack travels the country in an effort to solve these murders. Even at the end, when I just can't imagine how these murders are committed, Jack solves the problem and saves yet another woman.Jack is smart, interesting, well read and at times I even get a chuckle out of his comments and behavior. He is also hard and knows how to do what needs to be done in a tight situation. Jack takes care of the little guys and brings the big ugly nasties down to size. He is my new hero.This isn't my first Jack Reacher novel nor will it be my last. In fact, I even like the novels by this author that are not Reacher novels.Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I double if the FBI Blake and dearfield are realistic characters. It seems really stupid. I guess the hypnotism thing when the women can't remember what happen. The audio book reacher sounds slow and stupid too. Also mr child style is very naggy. Kept repeating the actions. I would expect Reacher to be efficient. So it seems unrealistic too."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"very angry, was told by friends to purchase books through amazon, being a jack reacher follower and having read all his stories, i thought i had a new venture in running blind only to read it is the same story as THE VISITOR!!, what's going on?."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I recently completed Running Blind during a trip to Las Vegas. I started on the plane ride there, consumed a few pages during some downtime over the weekend and finished on the way home. It was a nice way to go through the book. Although I probably would have been better off if I slept rather than read following a long weekend, I could not put the story down. Child kept me turning the pages. I started the Reacher series in the middle and am now working my way back through the early books in order. I never seem to grow tired of the character and the storylines. Running Blind is no exception. It may not be Child's best but I'm not sorry that I gave up sleep to finish. On to book #5"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This one started out well. I was soooo curious to know how and why the killer was able to kill 4 women in the same bizarre way (10 gallons of green paint in a bathtub) and getaway with no evidence left behind. It was a good setup.Other amazon reviewers have not recieved this book as warmly as others in the series written by Lee Child, and I too thought the set-up failed to deliver a good final end, but I haven't given up checking out other Jack Reacher stories, read excellently by Dick Hill...yet."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I see others give this a lukewarm rating, but I really enjoyed it. An unpredictable plot with a surprising end. Well done."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've read several in this series and really enjoyed this one as well. I had an inkling as to the killer in this one, but not the motive. Overall, well written a pretty quick read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is one of Child's best stories--his earlier books are generally better than his more recent ones. It is exciting, has a good story line, and holds your attention."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have read almost every L.Child book, this is one of the best yet, I cannot put it down. I love all of the Reacher books."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have commented on most of the Jack Reacher books. This one is fairly good; it has all the usual elements of suspense, intrigue, deduction, and revenge. It's good escape (and yes, I have used that before for these books as it is appropriate) writing that you just start reading and get in the flow of, and then suddenly you are hooked, and you have to know what happens. Childs is especially good at sucking you in to know how his hero will solve the problem(s)."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Of the first four Jack Reacher novels, this one is the weakest. I'm certainly not a reader who avidly tries to figure out all of the twists and turns before the big reveals at the end. I will quote this from the review: \\"The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader\\". If you are even paying half-attention to the story you will figure out the killer early on. I looked down at my Kindle when I figured it out and I had read about 23% of the book. Childs actually points it out fairly clearly. So when he unleashed the reveal at the end, I shrugged instead of gasped as I knew who it was for most of the book.I also felt the relationship between Reacher and Jodie was completely different in this book. You would be hard-pressed to tell they had secretly been in love for 15 years based on their interactions here. Worth a read, but not the best in the series so far."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've read about all the Jack Reacher books and I was terribly disappointed with this one. It tried to be a \\"whodunnit\\" and was short on the usual Reacher mayhem. That in itself isn't terrible, but this story seemed very mechanically cranked out, got awfully repetitive and after a while I really didn't care what happened. Although the ending is a big surprise, getting there wasn't worth it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Don't be caught out! I was eager to buy this book having read all the others in the series, but I see from other reader's reviews that this story is published under 2 different titles. In the UK this book is known as &quot;The Visitor&quot;. I find it a little strange that this one should be different as all the other stories are known by just 1 title. That apart this is just as gripping a story as all the others and I eagerly await the next one!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was my first Reacher novel and I know that Mr Child is a popular author so I had a reasonably high expectation. I actually found Reacher a little irritating, although street smart he is too much of a loner and too inclined to be difficult. The FBI came over as more manipulative then I would expect of your premier law agency and, while the story moved me along, it was a little obvious at times. I predicted the methodology of the murders very early on although the who and why was a little less obvious. Overall it occupied a couple of hours and was worth the effort but this was not the top notch thriller I expected it to be."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"As I've indicated in my previous reviews of Lee Child's novels, his hero-with-an-attitude, Jack Reacher, former Army Military Police major turned vagabond-who-attracts-trouble, is one of my favorite squinty-eyed tough guys - right up there with Dirty Harry himself.In RUNNING BLIND, Jack finds himself being coerced by a very nasty and un-American FBI to help the agency track down a serial assassin of ex-Army women, who, while in service, had been the objects of sexual harassment and had subsequently complained. Each of those murdered has been found in her bathtub submerged in camouflage-green paint, with no evidence of a struggle or apparent cause of death. Initially, he FBI tries to enlist Reacher's co-operation by pretending he's the chief suspect. When that ruse falls flat, they indirectly threaten to have his current girlfriend tortured and murdered by a local sadist. I mean, is this the FBI of Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. that those of us old enough to remember all know and love? (The \\"FBI\\" was a TV series in the late 60's/early 70's, in which the House That Hoover Built was depicted as the righteous, square-jawed defender of God-blessed America from sea to shining sea.)Inasmuch as Child has Jack pursuing a serial killer, this latest potboiler swerves close to becoming a conventional who-dunit. However, the usual excellence of a Reacher thriller is achieved by Jack's ability to stare down and outwit the Feds, carry on relationships (of a sort) with three very different women, and nail the Bad Guy besides. With a Man's Man like this, who needs Harry? The latter is definitely pass&eacute; and out to pasture in Carmel.The absolutely very best thing about RUNNING BLIND is the plot twist identity of the Perp. Even Reacher himself is fooled for a brief moment. (\\"Say it ain't so, Joe!\\") Because of this, I must say that this is Child's finest effort to date. Bring on the next one \`cuz I'm ready to buy!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"What can i say about a book in which i can pick out the murderer a quarter of the way through it? I'm used to LeCarre, Ambler, Greene, Sandford and others of far better quality. Child wants the reader to believe the FBI is run by morons. While this may be the popular view, I don't subscribe to it and neither will countless others after they think about what this book suggests. I can't detail the offending matters without giving away the plot, but trust me: you don't want to waste your time or money on this. Contact me and i'll send you my copy. It won't be in my library long."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The latest book in the Jack Reacher novels, Lee Child has penned an enjoyable thriller. Ex-MP Reacher, although he was blackmailed by the FBI into taking the job, finds that his hunt for the vicious serial killer of young women who were at one time enlisted in the US Army, is a job he is more than qualified to undertake. Well developed characters, and what seems like behind-the-scenes knowledge of the subject matter make this an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The fourth book in the Reacher series lacks the action, pacing and plausibilty of the earlier novels. A careful reader sees the ending coming long before one should. Like Reacher, the book feels burdened by house, girlfriend and responsibility. Put him back on the road, before he stops being as entertaining as he was in the earlier books."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is a great novel for adolescent sex addicts who 1. don't know anything about the military, 2. think the best way to keep a job is to insult your employers, 3. think it's cool to wear the same clothes day after day, 4. would like to commit sexual harrasment themselves.The dialogue is simple and extensive, which keeps the pace fast.What is most astonishing are reviews on the cover calling Mr. Child's efforts a 'masterpiece' and 'spectacular'. My response: a roll of the eyes and moan of \\"Good Grief!\\"."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Have read the first four of Child's Jack Reacher books. They all have had some parts that are really unbelieveable but so much of this one is it is unreal. Reacher is blackmailed into helping the FBI track down a seriel killer. Why is the killer taking out single women? The connection seems to be they were all military and filed charges of sexual harrasement charges against a higher authority. But is that the reason? We have Julia Lamarr and Nelson Blake, bad FBI agents and Lisa Harper, good FBI agent. I really think a lot of the actions by the FBI is really what is happening in the world today. Women keep getting killed in bathtubs covered in paint. How did they die? No one can figure out. Jack must be slipping, the FBI has followed him for a week and he is not aware of it. The crimes take place to far apart and it takes forever for Jack to explain to Lisa how he knew who the killer was. I agree with other reviewers that Jack needs to clean up more often. I guess I will read more about Jack Reacher but hope the next one is more believeable."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child's &quot;Running Blind&quot; is a novel about the FBI's efforts to find a sadistic and malevolent serial killer. The main character is Jack Reacher, a macho ex-military man, who is as sharp mentally as he is quick and capable with his fists. Reacher lives by a unique moral code and pretty much does as he likes. He has no job, has little respect for authority and doesn't play by society's rules. The FBI enlists Reacher's help when their best investigators are stymied by the aforementioned killer who is murdering women without leaving any obvious clues. Reacher is a brilliant investigator who thinks creatively and makes mental leaps that are helpful in solving difficult cases. &quot;Running Blind&quot; is fast-paced and action-packed, and Reacher is an appealing, if rough-edged, hero. Child would have us believe that Reacher owns one set of clothes and wears them all the time! That is a bit much to swallow. Another quibble that I have is that Child uses too much misdirection to fool the reader and I feel that he sometimes does not play fair. However, &quot;Running Blind&quot; does have sharp dialogue and many unexpected twists and turns. It is a page-turner and I doubt that anyone will be able to put it down in the last ten pages. I recommend &quot;Running Blind,&quot; since it is a clever police procedural that keeps the reader guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child has created an unusual hero in Jack Reacher which has provided the basis for quite a number of books now. I dimly think that the author Lee Child is British but regardless of whether he is or not his creation Reacher is designed to appeal to all of the trigger points of an American audience.Reacher is a person who can handle himelf in a scrape. He has done time in the militiary and has been trained in the art of combat.His combat traiing involved learning about firearms. He also spends him time in manual work so that he is fit. Yet he is not only an action hero.He has worked in the militiary police so that he has developed Sherlock Holmes skills in investigation. (Sherlock Holmes like skills because the Reacher books are not procedurals. No slow accumulation of facts and evidence. Reacher solves crimes by way of intuitive break throughs, just like old Sherlock)Most of the books have some referance point back to the army and Child the writer is cloying in his attempts to paint the United States Army in a posative light as an organisation which is on top of its game. One can imagine the pick up truck Republican crowd who are presumably the main audience for the books beaming with pride when there is some discourse in the books about the good old US army. Very limited discussion of the downside.Never the less the previous books have been effective enough as time fillers and a good read when one is going on a plane flight. This one however seems a little formulaic. Perhaps it is simply that I have read a few and the nuts and bolts of the construction has become clearer and makes it more difficult to suspend disbelief.The main problem however with this book is the end. Whilst it is perhaps a bit silly to say that it does not ring true.(It is a work of escapist fiction) It is perhaps harder to take seriously than some other of the books which appear to be better constructed. Still this is all subjective no doubt."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Like the Jack Reacher character..Jack is a fascinating character and the twists and turns keep you wondering who is the real bad guy."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"A disappointing end to the book. The plot built well but ended in an almost farcicle fashion. Left me with a feeling akin to many 3rd series TV dramas where the plot just gets silly."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was my fourth Jack Reacher novel in as many books. Lee Child delves deeper into the psyche of Jack Reacher, exploring his need to wander, his desire for the freedom of the road. In the previous book, Reacher finds what could be the love of his life, Jodie, the daughter of the general who made his career and was like a second father to the big lug. But Reacher needs constant change. He doesn't want baggage or a mortgage. He's an unusual guy, a constant ass pain to authority. He gets things done his way. Not theirs. This theme permeates &#34;Running Blind,&#34; where the mystery of former women soldiers appears impossible to solve. Child takes it right to the end before he lets any of this make sense. Fun ride."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Again a well balanced story of Jack Reacher. The storyline is good and has enough dynamics. It has a surprizing final. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am re-reading all the Jack Reacher novels I can find on Kindle. He is one he bes characters Mr Childs has written about.

The Jack Reacher series is well worth reading. I will read the entire series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Way too much about how hot is is in south west Texas.

This book is no different. It's not a deep book. Just good ol' fashion adventure and action fun. The story has enough mystery to keep it interesting, but not so convoluted and arcane to tax the mind that might want some relaxation after a tough day at work.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Kindle Version is formatted badly. There are no indents at the beginning of each paragraph (it's all left justified), making dialog exchanges and determining where new paragraphs begin a little to tricky at times. Hopefully we'll get a better formated version to \\"update\\" the one I just bought"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Our hero, Jack Reacher, always treats women well, and author Lee Child writes strong women characters that often match our hero in intelligence and determination. For the first time Child presents us with a really nasty female. At the same time Reacher is shown sympathetically dealing with rape victims and their long term problems. The book has a claustrophobic feel, as it is set in the city, Reacher wrestles with the horrors of home ownership, a love that might lead to real commitment, and a &#34;locked room&#34; room puzzle of a mystery. One can hardly wait until Reacher is back on the road and far from New York.As always the language is what helps mesmerize readers. &#34;He killed the motor and heard nothing but fog hanging in the air and the crunch of boots on his driveway.&#34; Then the reader learns the physics of attacking with a bat, done with dispassionate seriousness that makes Reacher intellectually appealing while he beats bullies half to death."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is at it again in this 4th book from Lee Child. He does an unsolicited good deed and has the FBI all over him as a result. While the Bureau doesn't look particularly good in this book, Reacher certainly does. It is sad that he can't settle in with the love of his life, but if he could where would that leave the readers? Another great book that expands the Reacher character and points the way to further adventures. Tight plotting, great character development and no let downs keep Child's books at the top of the list for me."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This one of the best in the Reacher series, very fast moving with unexpected twists all the way to the end.

Once I get the book in my hands I don't want to put it down. Lee Child is one of my favorite authors. Enjoyed book very much.PMA"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child plays the game well. Personally, I won this game, spotting the killer fairly early. That certainly didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book. It did free me, to an extent, so that I could carefully study some of the author's technique, his attempts to make me question my first certainty. And he certainly plays the game fairly. We are given many of the killer's thoughts from the very fist chapter on. So it's a case of matching the psychological profile we're given to the more superficial pictures of the characters. THis book also continues the subplot introduced in TRIPWIRE in which Reacher must make a crucial lifetime decision.I do recommend reading first DIE TRYING which introduces the Leon Garber character, and then TRIPWIRE in order to get the full subplot. The Jack Reacher novels are fairly fast reads in spite of the 400+ page length of each one, but I did find this one even faster than the others. Very highly recommended, but do read at least a couple in the series, preferably those I've mentioned, first."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"One of the best spy/thriller series going. Once you start reading about Jack Reacher's hair-raising adventures you will be hooked. This is 4 in the series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Follow Jack Reacher, an ex-MP, as he falls into another mystery to solve. Reacher uses his knowledge and past experience to put the pieces together in unorthodox ways.Child creates vivid scenes, interesting characters and a twisted story. His dialog patterns are just enough to keep the story moving and Reacher true to form.Try a Lee Child novel and you'll find yourself reading them all."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've read almost all of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child, and RUNNING BLIND is just a fair entry in the series. A serial killer is on the loose, and Reacher has been drafted by the FBI to help find the killer. This novel is essentially a whodunit, and I found it an enjoyable read because I like Child's writing style.As with most of the Reacher novels, the plot in RUNNING BLIND isn't even remotely realistic. The FBI in this novel is portrayed as laughably corrupt and incompetent. As a result, they must take Jack Reacher prisoner in order to force him to solve the crime for them. The way the murders are committed are absurd and have no scientific basis. The female FBI agent character is also ridiculous and something of an insult to female professionals everywhere (she's gorgeous, wants to be treated seriously as an FBI agent, but deliberately parades around in see-through blouses).In fairness, Child is not trying to write realistic books. His plots are deliberately sensational and over-the-top. Still, there's a limit to how much implausibility I'm willing to tolerate in a novel like this. There are plenty of good thriller writers out there who can write exciting books without tossing believability out the window.RUNNING BLIND is enjoyable and fun overall, but I strongly prefer other entries in the Jack Reacher series because they are somewhat more believable. In particular, I recommend KILLING FLOOR, ONE SHOT, THE HARD WAY and ECHO BURNING."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"You have to love this guy...and envy his sense of \\"keep it simple\\" by travelling light.

That being said, it does make sense to the reader at the end of the book. It's funny how I being into this series never guessed who the perp was until it was revealed to me. The actions at the end make sense though. There are many twists and turns and you just have to buckle up for the ride.

When reading his other novels, you are sometimes uncomfortable with what you suspect are cliches. In this one he writes about my home state, and it isn't simply cliche, it is absurd.

I am at #4, Running Blind, and love them, BUT, being an Army Brat and having lived with my parents when dad was stationed at Ft. Dix New Jersey in the 60's, I did find it odd that Mr. Child referred to the sprawling Army base as a Marine Base? Silly of me to be so distracted I guess, but it stopped the story for me and I am having trouble finishing the book, but I will. I am a huge fan, though certainly disappointed to hear the rumor that TOM CRUISE will be playing Jack Reacher? I Hope that's a joke. I am a fan, and will get through this and on to book #5.

Full of action and not sure if Jack will still be with us until the last page."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"RUNNING BLIND by Lee Child.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The story starts off in an exciting way with thugs demanding payoffs from a new restaurant owner. Reacher likes the restaurant and takes action. That was fun. But after that there was very little action, not enough. It was a long, drawn out process trying to solve the murders, but no one figured anything out until the very end. I'm reminded of the Michael Connelly books which have interesting discoveries along the way. That was missing here. For maybe the last third of the book, I had a good guess as to who and how, but Jack and others appeared kind of dumb because they never considered this. Sure, the author gave the reader more hints than Jack got, but I felt the characters should have been more open minded. Instead, I kept hearing it's impossible. The first third of the book was pretty good due to anticipation, but the end was a letdown.I really like the Reacher character and the series. Although I had problems with this book, it still kept my interest, and I plan to read the next one.The FBI does really bad things to force Reacher to work on the case. At the end, the FBI does more really bad things. I hated the FBI's actions and threats almost more than what the killer was doing. So I didn't feel good at the end of the book.I wanted the killer to suffer. So far in all four books, the bad guy is quickly killed at the end. I wanted to see them get caught, see them suffer, hear their words after they realized it was over. Especially in this book, I wanted to hear what the killer would have said about motive and methods. Without those insights and feelings, the ending was empty.I did not like the author throwing in one character as a red herring. The purpose was to confuse the reader. It wasn't explained, justified, or done well.One thing odd about Reacher is that he doesn't travel with clothes. He only has what he is wearing. He sometimes showers, but then he puts on the same clothes. He doesn't do laundry. I'm sure his clothes smell. In previous books he would buy cheap new clothes and throw away the old. He wasn't buying any new clothes in this book. This is one of those suspend disbelief items. Just don't think about it.STORY BRIEF:A serial killer is killing women who were raped or sexually harassed while in the military. The men who hurt them were put in jail or lost their jobs. The women left the military. The FBI profilers think the killer is someone like Reacher. Since the first two victims knew him, the FBI have Reacher under surveillance. They learn Reacher is innocent when a 3rd victim is killed while they were watching him. Now the FBI forces Reacher to help them solve the case. They believe his military contacts and experiences will be useful. They threaten Reacher's girlfriend to keep him in line.THE SERIES:If you haven't read any Reacher before, start with books 1 and 2. You do not need to read them in order. There are at least sixteen books so far. My ratings and order of the first four books are:4 stars. Killing Floor4 stars. Die Trying4 stars. Tripwire2 stars. Running Blind.NARRATOR:The narrator Dick Hill was very good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 13 hrs and 5 mins. Swearing language: I don't recall any. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: one referred to not shown. Setting: 1999 various other U.S. locations. Book copyright: 2000. Genre: mystery suspense thriller. Ending: Bad guy is caught, but there is no good feeling because other things are frustrating.POSSIBLE SPOILER:Michael Connelly published \\"The Poet\\" in 1995. \\"Running Blind\\" was published five years later. It's probably just a coincidence, but I felt like RB was a copy of or inspired by TP concerning the killer and methods used. TP was much better, I gave it 5 stars. I don't want to be too critical since there are thousands of books out there about killers and only a limited number of ways to kill someone. But the similarities were in my mind as I was reading this. I understand Agatha Christie has also used the same thing."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Most of the Jack Reacher books are above average, however...this one is NOT.I guess every book can't be that good.There is some good enough Jack Reacher action, but the method of serial killer is just silly.So if you have never read a LC book with JR, don't start with this one.His first book, Killing Floor was good, but too wordy and too much detail about the money. That doesn't seem to be a problem in his later books.I even liked Nothing to Lose - which got awful reviews."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Some Reacher novels are mostly \\"here is the dilemma, how is he going to get out of it.\\" This one is a real who-dunnit, and a how-did-they-do-it. He still kicks some butt, of course. All in all a fine member of the Reacher series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I recently \\"discovered\\" Lee Child and the Jack Reacher series. Fortunately with the help of Amazon and my Kindle it has been possible to read the books in order thus far. This does wonders for continuity and I never wonder who a character is. Mr. Child writes an action packed novel with a great story line. Maybe a little too much detail on some descriptions some of which almost sound repetitive, but this is true with a lot or authors and I have learned to overlook this. I have one major issue with the first four books and one gripe. First the gripe: Mr. Child does not know his gun lore. It seems as if he gets his gun \\"facts\\" down at the local pub. Glocks have no safety to click off, shotgun pellets do nowhere near the havoc and have a pattern completly unlike his descriptions. One nine millimeter pistol does not have any more knockdown power than another nine millimeter pistol. Maybe being a \\"gun nut,\\" I'm just sensitized to this. I've read worse. But by far the biggest problem I have with the whole Jack Reacher series is this: Does any one really believe that a sober, reasonably intelligent, attractive woman will co-mingle for longer than one day with a man who never changes his clothes? Come on! Take a shower or two or three in a weeks time and Jack is still wearing the same unwashed clothes? Really? I know he has the hobo spirit in him but hobos don't mix well."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book falls far short of other books, such as Tripwire, which i could not put down. The book, Running Blind, is spongy, weak, lots of gaps of what is certainly not even close to possible reality. Hope the next one I read by him is up to his previous quality."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Yes, I read it in one or two sittings as I did with Child's other books. He has the talent for making me do that.But the book was annoying because it lacked any semblance of credibility. I'm not a huge FBI fan, but the way Child has it violate Reacher's rights is beyond anything it would (or could) do. And give us a break: let the guy take a shower and a nap and change his clothes while traveling without sleep from East Coast to West and back again about four times in a week.Finally, the book also contains the kind of minor mistakes that add up to strained credibility. You do not take the Palisades Parkway to the Garden state. They run parallel. And Fort Dix is not a Marine base. It's Army, unless it's changed since I served there in the '60s. There are a few others, too."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have had one of these for several years and find it one of my most used gadgets in my kitchen. I use it for a variety of items but primarily to slice eggs and strawberries. I was afraid something was going to happen to my old one and ordered this one as a replacement. Very nice gadget."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"As with all the other Lee Child books (Jack Reacher), easy reading, can't put them down, can't wait to start a new one."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was not the strongest entry in this series. Personally I figured out who had done it and the motive by page 87. The red herrings were not believable in the context so they just screamed out that they were artificially inserted to confuse the readers."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love Jack Reacher novels--he's a great anti-hero. I was given a bunch of Lee Child books and have been reading them in no particular order. I assumed this was the first in the series because of so many character discrepancies ... what a disappointment to discover it wasn't. For example, Reacher checks his watch (even though in other books he never wears one because he has an odd always-knows-the-time ability), he lives in a house and has a girlfriend (even though he's all about nothing to tie him down), and he's under surveillance for a week and doesn't know it (that's not the Reacher I know and love!). I was ready to forgive these and other \\"errors\\" when I thought it was just the beginning of a developing character for the author, but not as a third or fourth book. I can suspend my disbelief when reading Child novels, but appreciate character consistency."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Child's Repaiman Jack is one of the most colorful characters I haveread. All his novels are very fast paced and intrigueing. I highlyrecommend this as a book you won't want to put down!!!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I'm a big fan of Lee Child...his character is a man's man who keeps his cool in tough situations and is a very accomplished warrior...he is good at creating interesting situations for his protagonist...I've read most of Child's books and will read his new ones as they come out"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the fourth of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. It's a difficult book to review for me because I thoroughly enjoy the characters, the fast paced plot, and the intrigues. As an action/mystery novel this is an outstanding book. I could barely put it down. I've really enjoyed each of Child's novels.Here we find Reacher getting himself into trouble once again by being in the wrong place at the wrong time and winding up smack in the middle of the hunt for a serial killer. There are many plot twists and some great false foreshadowing. The end caught me completely by surprise. Child fooled me and had me going down the wrong path of who the killer really was.The huge downturn is that the plot and set up is so farfetched and so unbelievable that it really ruined my suspension of disbelief. Granted, this sounds a little odd since most novels of this genre, including previous books in this series, have some pretty outlandish unbelievable plots. However, here Child paints an FBI that takes corruption to a level that only the most hard core conspiracy theorist could ever swallow. I think police organizations in this country,including the FBI are morally bankrupt and corrupt -- but Child goes beyond that to fantasy. What's worse is that even if the FBI is as corrupt as what they are painted to be in the novel -- the motive of the FBI officers in this case make no sense whatsoever. In short, the setup is absurd on the grounds of logic, if nothing else. He could have written a better novel had he not take such an approach.Thus, yes I enjoyed the book -- but at the same time am irritated by it and give it poor rating."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action, originality and excellent storyline twists which keep you guessing right to the last page.

A resourceful Reacher is able to rough up the goons without putting himself or the restaurant owner at risk. But FBI takes him under arrest as soon as he reaches his home. He is the prime suspect in a string of murders involving army women who had filed sexual harassment complaints. The profile of the killer matches Reacher.In the fourth book of the series, Lee Child casts Reacher in a role which he has long left behind; the role of an investigator. This time around, Reacher is not working for the military but teamed up with FBI. Like the earlier novels, Lee directly hurls the reader into the vortex of the events without wasting time. With a killer to catch, Reacher is running against time. This helps in building the pace and Lee can handle fast paced action with words. The events might be unbelievable but you are carried away. There are many times the investigation is sidetracked. This is the downside of the plot.Strictly for Reacher fans."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I chose five stars because, the case is hard to solve and very interesting.

This is a very good series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The movie with Tom Cruise deserves discussion--haven't seen it, but just bought a sweet 'smart' TV and signed up for Netflix streaming, so I may watch it eventually. I'll just say here that, regarding the movie, and despite Mr Cruise's pathological delusions about what passes for 'real life'...I confess that I'm a fan. TC's (usually) fun to watch on screen.But casting him as Jake Reacher...what were they thinking?Reacher graduated West Point, served honorably and heroically for 15 years, including 'Nam, as an Army MP. He was awarded a Silver Star for digging out and rescuing Marines from the rubble of the terrorist bombing of their barracks in Lebenon. Everyone who knew him in the Army speaks highly of him, not a few with reverence. He's also, at 6' 5,\\" 220 lbs, a highly-trained killer, and as a civilian, he continues to kill...the very, very bad guys he encounters. Meanwhile, the elfin Mr Cruise, when standing ramrod straight and executing a last-second (surreptitious) tippy-toe move just before the camera clix, is, at best, 5'5\\"--a foot shorter than Reacher... in a narrative where Reacher's investigative skills AND his physical size and prowess are essential. His appearance alone makes him intimidating, a crucial element in the reader's ability to suspend disbelief.In any case, the series is good, good stuff. Solid writing. (Don't be put off by the Hemingwayesque shite, at the beginning of first Reacher novel. The writing gets better, so good you don't notice it.) I've just ordered #5...gotta be ready to follow Jack Reacher and his exploits when I'm done with #4. Good plots, good stories, great character/hero. Having read the first 3, I can tell you they're the proverbial page-turner. Maybe not quite as good as the wizard himself, Elmore Leonard, but close enough. There's nothing not to like about the character and the writing gets better and better with each book...did I mention that a good series such as this is a godsend, a blessing, frickin' welcome, big time, anytime. Sorry, gotta finish #4.Jack Reacher, for the time being, has officially taken over my brain."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I read this in strict sequence. It is as easy to read as the other Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' books. I have read five of them in a bit over a week so you can assume they can hold your attention. I thought I had the bad guy picked about a third of the way through this one even if I didn't know the name but I was only half right. That's the good thing about this book. It takes you to different places and then throws you off the scent before you realize.This book didn't have the graphic violence that a couple of the others have had. It was different in that respect but the plot was pretty simple and there were enough blind corners, rough stuff and sexual tension to make it a good read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"They should have made a movie out of this book instead. Great plot...keeps you on the edge of seat the whole time. If the ending were better I would have given it five stars."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"It was a typical Jack Reacher novel, fast paced, lots of surprises and a satisfying ending.

He is unique in his anti-maerialism personna. The story is fast-paced and entirely readable"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"We're big fans of Lee Child and his hero Jack Reacher, an ex-military police investigator who can apparently solve any crime! \\"Blind\\" is loosely a sequel to \\"Tripwire\\" in that Jack has just inherited a house, is busy loving star-lawyer Jodie, and is at odds with himself over \\"settling down\\" compared to his normal nomadic meanderings around America sans ID cards and luggage.After foiling a protection racket at one of his favorite little restaurants, Reacher is nabbed by the FBI, who promptly uses that \\"crime\\" and \\"threats\\" on Jodie to blackmail Jack into helping them solve a tough set of serial killings that seem to point to someone so exactly like Reacher he's at first the best suspect! Three women have been killed and found in tubs full of paint, yet their cause of death is unknown! A common thread is that all are sexual harassment \\"survivors\\" in prior military service situations.The mental meanderings and skullduggery of the FBI (portrayed rather poorly, a major detraction to the story) and Reacher combine to very slowly close in on the who, how, and why of the murders. The killer's identity and capture is a stunning surprise revealed only a few pages from the book's end, which, aided by a few red herrings, manages to sustain suspense and intrigue until virtually the last gasp of the pages. Child also manages to resolve the growing conflict over Reacher and Jodie's future, although in a manner that we notice has disappointed many of his readers. Still, we found this to be a fine entry in this growing series, and we look forward to the next fun and entertaining Reacher novel!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"In Lee Child's \\"Running Blind\\" we find ex-MP hero Jack Reacher entrapped by the FBI. Reacher was unwittingly observed by an FBI surveillance team using strong arm tactics in thwarting an extortion attempt against a restauranteur of an Italian place that he frequented.Reacher was reeled in on the pretext that he fit the profile of a serial killer who had eluded apprehension by the FBI. The cerebral killer had murdered a group of former female members of the Army who had filed sexual harrassmnet charges. They were all found immersed in bathtubs filled to the top with green Army camouflage paint. All victims were apparently not drowned but killed by a means so far undeciphered. There was an unprecedented lack of clues and no clear motive.Reacher was coerced into helping the FBI investigate using some thinly veiled threats to his girlfriend Jodie Garber. Garber, a high powered New York attorney and daughter of Reacher mentor, the late General Leon Garber, was on the verge of being made a partner in her firm. Throughout the book drifter-like Reacher who inherited General Garber's house was wrestling with the feelings of being tied down. While he and Jodie were very much in love they were both unwilling to follow in each other's lifestyle.Reacher, of course, is instrumental in ultimately solving the paradoxes behind the killings. Child in this work explores the inner workings of Reacher's psyche which gives \\"Running Blind\\" a more expansive picture into the human side of his main character."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is enlisted by the FBI, most definitely against his will, to act as a consultant on a serial killer case. The case is baffling to say the least. So far, 3 women have been found dead in their bathtubs and the killer has left absolutely no clues behind, including how the women were murdered.This is a tense battle of wills between Reacher and the FBI agents, with continual antagonism between them setting the boundaries. This turns to frustration as Reacher comes up with theories that he presents to the FBI, only to have them repeatedly rejected. It turns into a battle on two fronts as Reacher is up against a killer who is sure to kill again and the FBI who seem incapable of accepting his ideas.The Jack Reacher books are frantic action thrillers starring a protagonist who is ultra-capable and prepared to push boundaries, whether it&#65533;s legal or moral. This particular book is no exception, although the pace does tend to get hampered by the unwelcome intervention of the FBI."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Mr. Lee Child has written another winner with his &quot;Running Blind.&quot; Jack Reacher once again gets involved in solving a horrendous series of murders. There are lots of twists and turns with an almost complete surprise ending. I will admit I was starting to suspect the true villin about 1/2 to 3/4 through, but it didn't detract from my reading enjoyment. Let me warn you though, this is a one sitter -- you will not be able to put it down. Mr. Child: keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have been reading Lee Child's books in order and this one was kind of disappointing. Knew fairly early who the killer was because I happened to remember one sentence in the beginning chapters.Fort Dix is NOT a Marine base! Heavens, what a boo boo!(My husband is a formr Marine)and his Mecca is much further south. And I really hope our FBI isnt similar to the protrayal in this story. Altho the premise was a new one for me, the ending left me wanting for some other explanation. Still, I will read Mr. Child's next. Jack Reacher is getting to be a cult figure!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"My first Jack Reacher novel and all I can say is WHAT A RIDE! Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, you're thrown a curve ball and it's off and running again. I can't wait to go back and read the previous books!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This story is all story - absolutely riveting and page turning. The mystery is a mystery like no other I have ever read, and the brilliant mind that is the killer's is fascinating. Women are dying, and Jack Reacher has a mind almost as cunning as the killers. For a long time, even the cause of death is not known, so clever is the M.O. It is a race against time as Jack Reacher has discovered the names of 11 women that are on this insane hitlist. Inside this twisting plot, lies another plot, that of Jack Reacher and his girlfriend, and yet another plot, that of Jack Reacher and the street mobs of New York. The author manages to weave it all together so brilliantly that you don't realize you have read three stories in one until you are done, and they all connect with a fluidity that is all too rare these days. It's a smash ending, leaving you breathless with excitement and waiting for the next Jack Reacher book. GREAT!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I really enjoy the Jack Reacher stories. He is the best. This one was really compelling. It was driving me crazy trying to figure out what the victims were choking on. What a concept. Mr Child, you are an incredible writer. All I can say is bring on the next Reacher novel. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"You'll enjoy this one if you can willingly suspend your disbelief. A plus: you'll never guess \\"who done it.\\" But the plot is based on an incorrect premise and the author hopes that most readers will not know that the premise is incorrect. Also, in building suspense, and he does that, he gets a little tedious. Prose like, \\"She walked out of the house, unlocked her car, opened the door, got in, closed the door and locked it. Started the car, put it in reverse, etc. etc.\\" You think, \\"Yeah, yeah, get on with it.\\" Reacher comes to a major life-style decision in this one. Read \\"Tripwire\\" first, as awful as it is."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've read all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, and for the most part they are entertaining and well written. Reacher is the loner wandering the countryside making things right. He's tough, experienced, and practical.Running Blind tells a story of women being murdered in a most bizarre way. They are found dead in their homes lying face up in their bathtubs filled with green paint. The women appear to have a connection because they all were involved in military sexual harassment cases. The bodies have no apparent wounds, and there is no trace of any intruder.Up until the very end, the story moves at a good clip - keeping the reader on the hook. But... and it is a big BUT, the end is absolutely absurd. I'm all for surprising the reader, but the chosen method here is just ridiculous. Frankly, more than surprised, I was disappointed. Child surely knows that the method described is completely impossible. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I won't describe it. But I think many of you will find it to be so implausible that it adds a bit of amateurism to the book. If you're a first time Lee Child reader, definitely do not start with this book. The series is very addictive, and I'd hate for you to stop after just one book.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of \\"Process of Elimination\\" - a thriller that pits a martial artist against a world class sniper out to shape the Presidential election."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack just keeps on surprising you, and keeping one reading, theseries should never end, when is the newest Reacher coming out?"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This Jack Reacher/Lee Child book kept me reading long past my bedtime.I usually read action/mystery/thrillers, this book stands up along side my other faves from Baldacci/Flynn."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"One of Child's best. As usual Reacher captivated the reader and drew us in to keep reading for hours. Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was a great book, fast paced and holds your interest.

Definite improvement over #3 in the series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Of all the many Lee Child books that I have read, this is by far the most slow moving as well as boring of all. A complete disappointment."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I also fell for it and ordered The Visitor, and started reading it right after I finished Running Blind. I thought I picked up the wrong book. Yes, it's a dirty trick, and I was a victim. Shame on you Lee Child.

Then you have to wait till he writes the next one. Have read the entire series and can't wait till the next one. If they ever do a movie, the guy that stars in the \\"Human Target\\" TV show on Fox would be a great Reacher.Steve Venghaus"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I started with book 12 and then decided to start from the beginning. Every book has started quickly and kept me hooked. Reacher Is certainly a charismatic character, but I have one question. How does he get all of those very attractive women, despite the fact that, after five books, he has yet to change his underwear. Traveling light might seem cool, but there has got to be a downside to that."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Running Blind by Lee Child and read by Dick Hill was an exciting and entertaining audiobook for a long car trip. Running Blind is the 4th book in his Jack Reacher series.Former MP Jack Reacher is recruited by the FBI at the beginning of Running Blind. A serial killer is at work and FBI profilers have identified Jack Reacher (or someone like him) as the likely killer. Once they rule out Reacher, they decide to recruit him because of his military background. The victims were all women who were once on active duty in the military. They all filed sexual harassment charges and then quit the service. Three different victims were found dead in bathtubs filled with army-green paint. There were no signs of a struggle, not a clue left behind and the medical examiners were unable to prove a cause of death.The FBI doesn't take Reacher's ideas seriously at first, and he's under the guard of young agent, Lisa Harper. But Reacher is coming up with theories faster than the FBI, and Reacher and Harper go rogue in trying to track down the killer. Although I guessed the killer's identity pretty early on, I had no clue as to the motive. Child kept us guessing until the very end.My husband and I are happy to have stumbled upon the Jack Reacher series and plan on listening to them all. It definitely helps to read or listen to them in order. We already have Without Fail lined up for our return trip."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is one of those mysteries where you keep reading to learn how the killer did it. You just know that knowing how and why will tie the whole story together. Unfortunately, Lee Child apparently didn't have a clue about how to pull everything together when he started this book. Child's explanation might make sense in some alternate universe, but certainly not here. The ending wouldn't have been any less believable if the crimes had been blamed on space aliens.Others have already commented on Jack Reacher's poor hygiene. Instead of carrying just a folding toothbrush, couldn't the poor guy at least carry a duffel bag? That wouldn't tie him down too much ... and he could at least have a change of underwear and socks. This should have given me a clue to what was to come ... a stinky ending."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The murderer becomes clear reasonably early, exposed by peculiar behavior and a couple incongruous factlets that the author pulls out of mid-air and tosses into the story. I am usually quite good at missing such clues, but not in this case - they were too glaring.Beyond this, there is the typical Reacher activity - chasing around, dealing with thugs, etc. And those things can be fun if you can gloss over the clues and accept the pretty much impossible method the killer uses to do in the victims."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I believe on average the book should show more stars than it does. It's been published in the UK & Canada under \\"The Visitor.\\" Some are rating on the premise it's the same book under a different title. It is true & it happens more than one thinks. But that's not a true indicator of this Lee Child book.Now for the book. It's a solid Jack Reacher thriller. Fast paced & a page turner. He's a biased FBI's suspect in the murder of former Army women he knew when he was an Army MP. He now sets out to find the real serial killer of these pretty bizarre murders. He has an ally in a rogue female FBI agent. Together they set about the task of proving who the real killer is.The sexual tension between the two adds a nice touch. The small twist at the end works as well. It's well written & worth your time"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have recently been turned on to Lee Child and his larger than life character Jack Reacher. He is larger than life but he is also grounded, realistic, and approachable. Thus far it is a great read, real diversionary and a wonderful escape from an ever increasing maddening and pressured real world; in fact Jack likes to get away from that same world."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"If you love a fast paced read, then you have to get to know Jack Reacher. Love the whole series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book is awesome. I finished it in two days. All of Lee Child's books are. I will read anything he writes. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"this keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering who done it. a great suspense thriller."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"it was great! have read all the other jack reacher novels and this rates up there with the best...i liked it alot"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Good read! Jack Reacher is an odd character, but Child makes him believable. The story is full of righteous action. Looking forward to the next Reacher book...Echo Burning."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child never disappoints with his Jack Reacher! I recommend any book by this author. Child has what it takes to keep you interested, puzzled and thrilled with what is going to happen next. Man, wish I had a Jack Reacher friend!Lee Child is probably the very best author I've ever read in the mystery/thriller genre. Now you have to like &#34;justice&#34; and be of the mind set, that when others start things, you will finish them. I am... and the vicarious thrill of seeing the bad guys get their just desserts is just great! Don't hesitate to try any book by Child, each is well worth the money paid.I prefer to actually have the book so if something happens to my Kindle, I can still read these gems again. So I have both! Does that say enough about how highly I recommend the Reacher books?"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I was the usually well written book, and I will get the next one too.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Great book, as with all the Jack Reacher novels. I would definitely recommend if you are a fan if the series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the fourth in the Jack Reacher series and Lee Child continues to develop the character. The irony was that while reading this book I saw the promo of the new movie &#34;jack Reacher&#34;. In this book Jack Reacher recalls that there came a time when he walked down the streets and he had become an intimidating &#34;scary guy&#34; that everyone avoided. The Jack Reacher in the series is a big guy, tall and heavy set. I can't believe they selected one of the world's puniest actors to play his role in the movie ... Tom Cruise. Go figure. The Visitor is a smokes and mirror book. Without giving away the plot it suffices to say that Lee Child has created many blind alleys which he takes the reader down before a final twist. It is a good read. I can't wait for the next Jack Reacher novel."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"You discover why excessive descriptives, but could literally skip read through much of this. Not normal narrative for Child books"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"A well contrived mystery, even though the MO seems a bit implausable. I am more than half-way through the book and find myself looking forward to the next page."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I could not put this down. I suspected who the real killer was fairly early on in the book, but loved seeing all the pieces put together. Plus, I just love Jack Reacher. All these people complaining about innaccuracy and how unrealistic this is, here's the deal: it's called &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; and is critical to any story that is not about our own tedious and boring lives. I do not care if Ft. Dix is a navy base (even though my dad and father in law were stationed there while in the Army, I was so into the story I never noticed that)or if it is even in New Jersey (yes, I know it is). No, normal people do not live in the same clothes day in and day out. No, normal people do not outsmart the FBI and hop from bed to bed. If you want to read about normal people I will be happy to send you pages from my journal about potty training, homework, laundry, etc. I read for a brief escape into a completely different life, for the mental challenge of figuring out &quot;whodunnit,&quot; and for the pure joy of a good thriller. If that's what you're looking for, buy this book. If you want an accurate accounting of military policies, I'm sure they have a fascinating manual you can pick up at your local Army surplus store."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I'm a horror buff but I dig a good mystery once in a while ( I happen to think the best horrorstories are the ones which have a mystery element to them. Like some of Peter Straub's books and the excellent 'Scream' movies).Anyway I picked this book up at my local library. It was an english edition which had the alternate title THE VISITOR (one I don't think is at all inapproriate, since the killer in this story is in some way invited into the homes of his victims). I haven't read any of Child's others books, but after this one I might read another one.I say 'might' on purpose 'cause although RUNNING BLIND is a good book I figured out the plot and the killer fairly easily and (I really hate that) early on in the story. And in my opinion there lies the problem with this book. It's good and clever thought of, but there are clues left all over the place and I don't think Child did that all on purpose. I think it's because (and RUNNING BLIND isn't the only mystery novel which suffers from this) when you start to read this book you just know the plot and motive are going to be so farfetched that you start looking for the least likely suspect and just assume he's going to be it...and voila!This book also has a so called 'locked door' element in 'how the murders are committed' is as important as 'who's doing it'. I also figured that out fairly easily, once again there's more than a fair share of clues for that.I'm not that all negative about the book though (Why else would I give it three stars? And as an aspiring writer I wish I could come up with a plot like this). It's because I really liked the character Jack Reacher a somewhat cliched hardman and drifter and it's great fun seeing your theories proven to be right.I read somewhere Child is a former tv writer and it shows in some parts of the book: the stereotypical portrail of the FBI and the gangsters, the beautiful woman FBI sidekick etc. RUNNING BLIND isn't at all realistic. But I think no reader would come in expecting that!Like I said earlier it doesn't make it a bad read though. Just not great."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Well, I have some good news and bad news.The bad news first. I am going on a driving vacation with some of the family and I thought I would save this book for the car, something to help pass the time. The bad new is.....I have already read it, I couldn't wait. It was sitting on my shelf calling to me and since I am a great fan of Jack Reacher and Lee Child, I couldn't resist. Now, the good news! It is a great book. How on earth did Mr.Child think of this murderer's m.o.? I could not put this book down. Bravo Mr. Child.....as soon as I see your next one listed on Amazon., I'll put in my pre-order. For anyone who likes a book with a great hero, a few laughs, lots of suspense and mystery and a twist at the end, read this book! If you haven't read the other Jack Reachers, do it now!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've read 5 other Reacher books and thoroughly enjoyed them all. This one, however, was a bust. The FBI characters were absurd and the book had a very disappointing and ridiculously unrealistic killer and method for murder. When I realized what was going on in the middle of the book, I kept hoping that there was some other explanation, but the end brought disappointment with the realization I had been right all along. I would recommend skipping this book and sticking to the other Reacher titles."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"First, let me say I have read almost all of the Reacher series in a short time. Here in Thailand, I rely on used bookshops, reading well-worn copies dropped off by travelers. (Sorry Amazon, but when I'm in the USA it's You, baby, Only You, trust me!) I started with the one so many people gave thumbs down to, \\"Nothing to Lose\\", in which Reacher is bouncing back and forth on the plains of Eastern Colorado between the towns of Hope and Despair. The whole concept seemed pretty fresh to me, and I liked the character, so I started reading the series. Two more and I'm a Reacher Laureate.The Visitor (aka Running Blind) is pretty lame stuff. (Believe me, I'm a fan and hate saying bad things about the series BUT:) The FBI depicted in this book does not exist. They would not force an unwilling lone wolf (\\"bum\\", actually) to work for them by coercive threats, as depicted in this book, keeping him a virtual prisoner, even though he manages to slip away and \\"go Reacher\\" on those who need doing. My main beef (here's the SPOILER part, beware) is with the hypnosis element. In all of my reading on the subject, one thing comes up over and over...a hypnotized subject will at least balk at doing something which goes against their internal moral code. Also, a post-hypnotic suggestion has a limited life. You can't plant a suggestion that can be triggered months or years later.That wasn't much of a spoiler, really. Most people would see this shaping up early in the book. I hate writing negative reviews, and usually don't. Lee Child has created quite a great character here, and he keeps things moving along nicely. I especially like the little details he throws in about mechanical things. If Lee Child's name is on the spine, I'll read the book. But this one...I dunno."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am currently reading Running Blind and was thrilled to find some of the older Jack Reacher books on Amazon. Not thrilled to see an old book with a new title. Books cost too much to pay twice. I admire you Lee and would hate to see my favorite author do something that I know Jack would not think is kosher. Please rethink this issue."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have all of the Jack Reacher books on my Kindle. When I saw this title I thought I had missed one. Luckily I aways read some of the reviews and noticed it was retitled. Thanks to most of the reviewers, I saved a duplication. Dirty pool on the publisher.

Now Reacher has a house, a car, and a girlfriend and when he's picked up on a murder charge and, as Reacher always does, is found innocent and enters into the investigation, he begins to enjoy the freedom the investigation gives him.Women are found dead in their bathtubs, full of military-green paint. The murderer leaves not a single clue. It's up to Reacher to find the killer before another woman on the list is dead.Very inventive, very clever story...and so gripping that it kept me up waaay past my bedtime as it came to the conclusion."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Read this when it first came out and thought it was very good.

Just like Killing Floor and Die Trying, this novel flies along at a frantic pace that you try hard to keep up with.Reacher is the suspect in a bizarre series of murders in which ex-army women (who left the force because of a variety of sexual harassment cases) are left naked in their bathtubs filled with green army paint. The killer leaves no clues and what is even more bizarre, they have no idea how the women died.Even after Reacher's name is cleared, he is blackmailed by the FBI into unravelling this bizarre case. He must get to the killer before more women die, or face the consequences of the FBI's fury.Read and Enjoy"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"My thanks to the other posters for the \\"Truth in Advertising\\" warnings that \\"The Visitor\\" is really a re-titled \\"Running Blind\\". The Jack Reacher series for me is a \\"buy on sight\\" type of thing and I might have been misled if it was not for the other reviewers.That being said don't be put off from the original novel by the Publisher's shady marketing. Running Blind is one of the best Jack Reacher novels:Running Blind"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I was very disappointed when I realized the book, \\"The Visitor\\" was the same book as \\"Running Blind\\". Where is the integrity and honesty? They should be ashamed.

Thank goodness I looked here and found it is just RUNNING BLIND with a new title. The one star I gave it is for the publisher. RUNNING BLIND gets five stars."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have now read all of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child and I believe this one to be the best of them all. Not that it doesn't have flaws - some of the activities carried out by the FBI are pretty questionable, Reacher at times approaches super-human in his skills, and there are probably a few too many red herrings and digressions. Nevertheless, for what it is, this is an extremely fast-moving and exciting thriller. It is genuinely hard to put down and the ending will likely surprise you (though admittedly a careful reader will probably see it coming; there are clues aplenty). Child plays fair, however, and you buy the whole thing. I do wish Child's novels &quot;reached&quot; (pun intended) a wider audience; he is a good writer who has created an interesting and charismatic character. This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Repackaged with the non-US title - You should pull this from sale since it the same as Running Blind. Shame on you for peaking my interest. I almost ordered it - wonder how many you will sell to folks who have already read it under the Running Blind title. Do the right thing and make it more plain that it is the non-US version. The book is great - the one star ratings is because I hate that Amazon seems to be attempting to mislead us."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is a very shady practice and if Amazon is truly concerned with protecting the best interests of their customers they should add an entry to their standard descriptive summary that shows the Copyright Date, as do all paper published editions.The Publishing Date alone can be more deceptive than informative. And yes, sometimes there are good reasons why copyrighted works aren't published immediately....but at a minimum at least it gives the prospective buyer/reader a clue that this may be a repackaged edition rather than a brand new release."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"A very fast paced book that grabbed your attention from the first page and never let up. One of his best books."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is my fourth Reacher novel and the lone wolf business is wearing a little thin. I am halfway through the book and struggling. Our anti-hero has yet to change his clothes and must be getting a bit ripe. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, writers are not required to notify readers every time a character changes clothes--it's assumed. But, since the author makes a major deal out of Reacher traveling only with a toothbrush (fold-up, no less), it becomes an issue. I find myself waiting for Reacher to launder his clothes, or as is his custom, throw them away and buy new ones. Other irritants: Everybody (Reacher obviously excluded) wears \\"pressed\\" jeans. Who the hell irons their jeans these days? And what's with the braless FBI agent? Finally, our man of honor is becoming increasingly obnoxious. You simply can't say ANYTHING to him without getting a fairly lame, if snotty reply. His hatred of the FBI's use of \\"profiling\\" to catch serial killers borders on the pathological. Reacher has some real issues here. Sadly, I have a few more Reacher books in the Amazon pipeline and will have to slog through them, periodically stopping, sighing and glaring at the picture of the author conveniently placed on the back cover."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Ok, long time fan of Lee Child Reacher series. I only have 3 left to read (listen to). This one just too much FBI blackmailing threats without good ol' Jack finding a way, his way, to remedy the situation. Either Lee should have not had the FBI chief be SUCH a a-hole and somehow come around to give Jack props OR Lee should have had Jack emit revenge on this this guy in a way smackdown way or had him get fired/arrested. Jack rolled over way to easy on this guy and had a weak way of threating the FBI jag at the end. Otherwise, the plot was great. Keep up the normal great work, Pursuader rocked and I'm on Enemy another great writing."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Although Child takes the reader on an interesting ride that keeps him from putting the book down, much of the book is a bit over the top. After exciting the reader throughout the book, Child disappoints with an unrealistic half - baked ending resulting in a poor rating."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child writes a engaging thriller every time. I'd already read this Jack Reacher novel when it was first released and enjoyed it as much second time around on my new Kindle. Child creates a sense of slow burning tension, frequently defused by Reacher's deceptive laid-back manner, and manipulates the plot with such dexterity and finesse that, if you've not read the book before, the end will surprise. And if you have read it once, twice or thrice previously, it still delights with it's masterful deployment of intelligent twists and turns in the plot. What's not to love about each and every Jack Reacher story?"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher novels, but this one is by far my least favorite. Not believable in the least."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Great storytelling. More than one plot developing at the same time. Mr Child ranks among my favorites."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"For those such as myself, who were a bit disappointed with Lee Child's &quot;Tripwire,&quot; take heart! Jack Reacher is back at his very best; not too smart, not too slow witted, but just right. Also, he's still very capable of handling most adversaries and charming all (well, almost all) women and pissing off most men. It is a fast paced thriller in search of a serial killer which takes many twists and turns, but entertains all the way. It leaves you a bit exhausted, but exhilarated at the same time! No author seems to get along with the FBI, but this book has a lot of fun with their procedures, while bending a few military rules along the way. Read it!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Mr. Child could use better words to convey a deeper feeling or situation. He is so deep that makes other thriller writers appear an inch shallow and down under. Jack Reacher is so far one of the most(not too many) interesting characters that ever created by a writer, who are actually on a par with each other. What amazed me most is that Mr. Child's writing is such an internationally standardized modern English not just British English that used to be zigzagging and indirect. The flow of the sentences and paragraphs are so smoothly putting out that always makes you apprecitate his width of knowing how to choose a better and deeper word to describe a feeling or situation. This talent and knowledge are rarely to be found among other so-called thriller writers and making his every word worths the money you've paid for. The burden of relationship of his newly acquired secular belongings, either real estate property or romance, only makes Reacher more realistic. But the FBI people created this time seemed to be quite unconvincing. The way Blake treating Larma and the latter's insubordinate attitude is absolutely impossible and inprobable in FBI's ethics, unless they have some sexual relationship, therefore did not ring true at all. All of the other FBI's characters, well, Harper seems to be more acceptable as an FBI agent and more normal, others are just a fine line away from thugs; a situation Mr. Child should pay more attention to fine tune before or during writing. Also, a nation wide serial killing rampage is also fundamentally weak this time that made me feel a bit impatient to read along after two third of the book. Again, I jumped over those hateful and stupid itallic paragraphs and I can assure you, Mr. Child, lot of readers might be just like what I did. So please don't try to use too many lean to right itallic sentences, especially long and tiresome paragraphs. Also, how to realistically show the readers the way that the real FBI is dealing with a nation-wide crime, Mr. Child should do a deeper research before production; a more authentic and convincing task force or just of bunch thug-like agents? Don't &quot;running blind&quot; is what I would like to give to Mr. Child this time. A good book means that when readers think it twice, all the logic premises still could stand fast albeit bleaching the paper money."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"It is a refreshingly good thriller. One could consider it a tongue-in-cheek sequel to Silence of the Lambs, and it is way better than over-hyped Hannibal."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Typical Reacher, doesn't let fools divert his own intelligence; goes his own way about flushing out the perpetrator. Diversionary Colonel will throw you - for a while, anyway !"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher outfights and outsmarts as only he can; if you didn't already harbour suspicions about the ethics of America's mainstream crime-fighting organisations (aka FBI) you can hardly read this book without feeling some level of concern."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"A good read, not one of the best but consistent. Jack Reacher character works to get the truth out of the situation."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love the Jack Reacher novels.

Lee Child is a great wordsmith; does everything right to build setting, characters, and develop the story without ever wasting any events or even details of setting. It all comes together from beginning to end. HOWEVER, I really don't enjoy reading his sexual events. Yes, he always gets the girl, but, please, just leave an illusion there. I'm not interested in the sweaty details."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was a good Jack Reacher but not the best I have read. Child used too much, in my opinion, contrived misdirection to keep the reader quessing. I say contrived because they really added nothing to the story but to throw the reader off the scent. The sections about the mysterious person in the pentagon is my main point. Other than that it was a good read and held my attention to the end but has made me a little reticent to jump right into the next one."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST COUPLE BUT STILL NOT TOO BAD.

And I'd agree, if I hadn't guessed the perp after about a third of the way into the book. Child's Reacher thrillers are good because you are not supposed to guess what comes next. But in the Reacher mysteries, his clues are often pretty obvious. Read it anyway; see if you agree."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book had me guessing until the end. I have a couple of sticking points that bothered me however. One was how vicious the FBI treats Jack at the end. It was way over the top in my opinion and the bit about the priest that makes an appearance towards the end is never really explained. I don't want to add anything else that may spoil the book for anyone. Aside from those two things I would recommend this book. I like the character of Jack Reacher, he always stays so calm and cool. Definitely worth the price. Ree-views"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I started reading the Jack Reacher series because I didn't have anything else to do. Waiting in a hospital waiting room I bought the first book on my Kindle because I'd remembered there was a movie about them coming out. Anyway, the first book wasn't that bad. I enjoyed it. Then second and third were okay, but not as good as the first. Then we get to this one. Book four. Running Blind. When I finished it, it left me feeling angry and confused. Which is not emotions a writer should want to leave his audience with.The book follows Jack Reacher's involvement in a serial murder case being led by an FBI task force. There were several problems right from the beginning with this whole setup. First, Jack Reacher was involved with the FBI before in Die Trying (book 2). He rescued the god-daughter of the President, a rising FBI agent. One of the main characters in the book was the director of the FBI. Fast forward a year and now none of these people exist? They're not even mentioned in the story, like the author even forgot he wrote the second book. It's very annoying, because it makes a lot of the driving force behind Jack Reacher's involvement in the FBI case unbelievable.Second is the method used to commit the crimes revealed near the end of the book. It's just plain stupid. It's like someone commits the perfect crime and at the end the author couldn't solve it himself. He made the crimes too implausible. So the explanation at the end is terrible and leaves the reader angry and confused.Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've become addicted to Reacher novels. They have a viewpoint that is very refreshing, and a main character that is well defined. He sees everything from such a different - and very human - perspective that it makes for a very good read. The action, the strength, are all there, but the character and the situations are truly unique. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've never written a review before but I am baffled by all the people who think this is the best Jack Reacher book. This book was offensively thin. The \\"bad guy\\" was so glaringly obvious early on and repeatedly supported as being the bad guy that I had to stop reading and come here to see what people were saying about it. I couldn't believe that I wasn't missing something. There must be a great twist the reveals a different bad guy. But the twist came and... it was exactly who they told you it was all the way through. I don't want to belittle anyone, but how thick headed must a person be not to know the end of this book a third of the way through. And the clues as to who it was were so heavy handed. I thought fur sure this character is our ruse. But it wasn't. I loved the first three reacher book, then I hit this turd and he's lost his luster. Maybe I just guessed the bad guy early and when you read with that person in mind the clues punch you in the face with striking clarity or something. Ugh! I want those hours back. And now all I've probably done is made you curious to read it and see if it's really as transparent as I said it was. I'm sorry if you do."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have just started reading the Jack Reacher series and am quite taken with the character, although I do not see Tom Cruise as the main character. He did a good job with the movie but I had pictured someone else. Anyway, the series is a good read and recommend that you start with the prequel titles #1 The Enemy and #2 The Affair as it seems to lay the story of Jack out a bit better."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"As a Jack Reacher fan, Lee Childs continues to impress the reader with great story telling ability and always provides outstanding technical information."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"as normal Lee child keeps you guessing all the time to what if going on and who the bad guys are and Jack always seems to getting in the middle doing what he believes is right,"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Of the 11 Reacher books I have read this is by far and away my favourite!The book starts out filled with action in typical Reacher fashion with a beating for some unfortunate thugs as Jack tries to fix the world one problem at a time and then leads the reader into a deep and complex mystery which is only pieced together in the final few chapters. A crime which looks to be unsolvable is put together perfectly, making you check back to see if you really did miss all of the clues that Jack has somehow joined up.The story also puts Jack in a somewhat unfamiliar position of being settled down and having a proper relationship which adds another dimention to our hero.I finished this book in 2 days and it would have been sooner if i hadnt been working. Would recommend this book to any one the best in the series!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The great thing about Jack Reacher novels is that they aren't really cumulative. Yes, there are some details about his personal life that carry over from one to the next, but for the most part, each novel's plot and characters are separate and each book can be enjoyed on its own, without the preceding novels in the series. For that reason, you should seriously consider skipping this one and moving on to the next.It starts promisingly. Such mysterious murders! The perfect crime! Why are the victims willingly participating in a bizarre, sadistic procedure before death? What is the actual cause of death? And, of course, whodunit?But the murderer will be apparent early on to any seasoned reader of murder mysteries. As for the other two questions -- the death ritual and the cause of death -- both are based on fallacious psychology and medicine and are so absurd you may throw the book or even a brand new Kindle at the wall. Until now, I had thought that Lee Child was a meticulous researcher, so I'm wondering why he thought he could use a murder technique that is beyond implausible. Apart from the hilariously bad psychology, the most essential physical element in these murders is, literally, medically impossible. You don't need to be a scientist to know this. Anyone with common sense will Google it and realize that Child has tried to pull a fast one on them. Now I'm wondering if his seemingly expert descriptions of firearms and other technical subjects are also nonsense.Some may want to read the novel just to find out what the ridiculous ending is. If that's your purpose, and you go into it with low expectations, at least you won't be disappointed or infuriated by it. But if you want a solid, logical, satisfying ending, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have now read the first four of the Jack Reacher stories. I very much enjoyed the first. The second was not great. Not bad, either. The third and, finally, the fourth have pushed my tolerance level to the limit. I strongly wished the author would do more research before he puts &#34;stuff&#34; in the books. Nothing intolerable by itself, but they start to add up. For example, Jeep is copyrighted trade name and does not apply to all SUVs. (book three) There is a difference between the US Army, Air Force, and Marines. One cannot use the names and commands interchangeably. I found the portrayal of the FBI somewhat distasteful and not realistic. (book four) Artistic license is certainly expected. They should, however, try to stay within reasonable limits. After researching the author's background, I suppose a greater level of &#34;bad America&#34; conspiracy theory is expected, but I am not obligated to read it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"i have just finished reading this title and given it only 3 stars due to its printing format. The book was good as one has come to expect from Mr Child. The story was taught and one was in suspense as to who was the killer right to the last chapter. But it did not have any chapters, this was confusing as one would be reading one scene with one set of characters when half way down the page the scene completly changed and we were having conversations with other characters! If this was a cost saving excercise it did not work!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have just started reading this series and really enjoyed this book. Can't wait to read the rest of them"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've just started this series and I can't seem to read quick enough. Great suspense and action. keeps you constantly thinking."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I'm basically reviewing this book in order to get my rating on record, because it is an honest opinion of the content - not quite as polished to fit the 'I love it' catergory where I would put the other Reachers I've read but a perfectly good puzzle, and well worked out, which is not reflected by the average ratings.For sure, it is unethical on the part of the publishers not to make it clear that the novel was previously published under another name, but I'm not convinced that giving the BOOK only 1 or 2 stars for this reason is ethical either. It is certainly not helpful. One of the reviewers issued the warning - which was helpful, but neverless rated it 5 stars, also helpful to those who have not read the book before. Isn't that what these reviews are about?This is good, standard Reacher. He is put under pressure by the FBI to help them find a serial killer whilst being watched like a hawk. The hawk beig an entertaining character, and not beyond flashing an absence of bra when the context requires it. Like the Reacher we know he deals with the pressure, then follows the trail his way, not via the FBI's definition of the killer (of course). He does get side-tracked, but this is part of the action, and necessary in order to tick off the possibilities so as to arrive at the final probability.Be warned,(and this has nothing to do with stars) the killings, and their MO, are bizarre and call for a real stretch of the imagination. But then this is fiction, after all, for believable killings we can read the Sunday papers."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child is one of my favorite authors. What I didn't realize was that it was a book that I read shortly after it was first published as Running Blind in the USA. It was received on time and new and I was so hungry for a Jack Reacher novel, I was nearing completion of the book before it was scheduled for delivery. I find Amazon very good when it comes to delivering things on time or earlier."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is the same violent loner that he was in the first, second, third... twenty-third book. Just too much violence and the end of the book is just as silly as the end of all of the Lee Child books. Lee Child writes so well, why don't the stories live up to the writer."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Running Blind was excellent, like all of Lee Child's books. The condition of the book was alittle less than I expected, but still very readable, not torn or pages missing."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Another great Reacher book from Lee Child. I was just told about the Reacher seriesearlier this year and have been hooked ever since. Love the underlying theme that copsand the FEDS are either corrupt, inept or hamstrung by politically motivated bossesand that the military runs circles around them. If we had real citizens like Jack Reacherour country would be a better place!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is a great murder mystery starring the hero ex-MP Jack Reacher. It's got one of the smartest killers and one of the most complex murder methods, with all the clues present to solve this yourself--and the ending will leave you gasping with surprise."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The title is new but the book is the same as the pursuwader I think. I sent the visitor to a friend so I can't confirm the match 100% but it is definitely the same Reacher novel as another with a different title. Seems strange to give it a different cover."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Childs gets better with each mystery he writes. Only one negatgive, too much detail i.e., what the scenery is like, the weather etc. I like a book right to the point. Otherwise, excellent book!!!! Loved it."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack saves the little guys again but this time the plot has a sinister twist. You get the feeling that Jack enjoyed dispersing justice and you may not like his dark side."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped in good time and good condition. I would buy again."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"For me, Running Blind is amongst Lee Child's best Reacher novels. It was an exciting book, the plot was good and I really liked the charactrs. Usually, I am able to solve the Reacher novels quite early but this wasn't the case with Running Blind."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"In this novel, a serial killer is targeting female victims of harassment of the US military. With two dead bodies found in their own bath tubs full of green camouflage paint, No marks, no signs of violence and no apparent cause of death - somehow, Jack Reacher - our Jack Reacher - is the prime suspect.In this, the most untraditional Jack Reacher novel so far, our hero uses the most traditional detective skills and powers of deduction to track down the killer and save the life of an old flame.This one I give 4 stars out of 5, for another world class writing performance from Lee Child."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I had high hopes for this series. I started the first novel, Killing Floor, not long ago. It was a fun read, heavy on the action and the violence, but a little light on the plot and suspense. All in all, I thought it was above average and a good start. The 2nd novel had a really odd-ball plot, but over-the-top action. Reminded me of those 80's action movies. With the 3rd novel, the author starts going off track, and in this one, the 4th, I think he's crashed into the ditch.The \\"mystery\\" is a joke. A careful reader knows who did it about 1/3rd of the way into the novel. The \\"twist\\" can be seen far, far in advance. Maybe when the book was written this was considered a surprise, but nowadays many other novels and movies have covered this same ground. How the murders are committed can also be guessed early on, but most readers will hold back on that line of thought since it is so improbable. Events that took place in earlier books seem to have no meaning or impact here. For example, the FBI plays a prominent role in the 2nd book. But neither Reacher nor the FBI recall events from the previous book.This book is more of a \\"who did it\\" novel, and less of an action packed adventure. To me, Lee Child is a much better action writer than he is a mystery writer. Reading about all of the different ways that Jack Reacher can hurt or kill people is entertaining. Reading page after page of Jack Reacher, ace MP investigator, overlooking obvious clues is frustrating and annoying.EDIT: I thought about stopping after this book, but decided to try one of the books that were written more recently. I had read earlier reviews stating that the writing gets better over time. I took a look at the book list, and there were two books that jumped out: The Enemy, and The Affair. The were both written much later, but in terms of the events in the books, occur while Reacher was still in the Army. I felt it was OK to read these now without creating any \\"spoiler\\" situations.I liked these two books much, much better. The stories were tighter, with more plot, mystery, and investigation. Maybe it helps that it was Reacher's job, so there was a point to everything and not a guy in the right place at the wrong time kind of situation. I would gladly read more novels of Reacher's time in the military."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I really enjoyed this novel as I do all of Lee Child's novels. It is always amazing to me how as you end one chapter you have to immediately begin the next. I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I have lost due to the content of his novels. I strongly suggest this one if you haven't read it!!!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This novel had its elements, but the basic premise was so preposterous that it undid any good aspects. The \\"bad guy\\" all but acquired magic powers in order to carry out his crimes. (In the interest of not giving away the plot, there are some misleading terms in this review.) If this sort of thing was possible, people would be using it all the time in criminal activity, but they aren't -- because it's not possible.In short, I didn't believe anything about this novel. The author must have been in a desperate mood during its composition -- even Reacher's breakup was abrupt and not well explained. I wanted to read the whole series, having started out with the first one. This one makes me want to abandon the project entirely."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child has a UK version and an American version for all his books. Running Blind is the American version and The Visitor is the UK version. Same book...different country."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I enjoy the Reacher series, but for someone who is as successful as Mr Child one would think he could afford someone to fact check his books for glaring errors.A couple examples that undercut the stories:1. He discusses a trip Reacher made (in book #3) to \\"The Army flight school at Ft Wolters, TX\\". (It may have been still \\"Camp\\" Wolters, but I need a fact checker for that.) Wolters was closed and all functions transferred to Ft Rucker before I went to the Army flight school in 1960, so it had to have been closed in the 1950's.2. He discusses at some length the Marines at Ft Dix. (Book #4) Ft Dix is an all-Army Post. (Except, of course for the inevitable jarheads in liason-type positions.)"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I usually enjoy reading the Reacher series of books. But this one disappointed me. I know it is a fiction, but Reacher's relationship with the FBI was unrealistic - a bit of a stretch. The ending was weak. This book could have been much shorter."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I discovered the Jack Reacher series last December when I splurged and bought a few dozen used books from amazon to read beginning over winter break for sheer escapism from work. I finally got around to starting the series (in order) a couple of weeks ago. I gobbled up the first 3, really enjoying the ride, and started on this one. Like the others, it has an intriguing premise that hooks you right away -- in this case, women being murdered in an undetectable manner and being found naked in their bathtubs, which are filled with Army green paint. Reacher is basically blackmailed into helping the FBI find out who the killer is. So far, so good -- Lee Child really knows how to keep you turning the pages. The problem is, I figured out who the killer was and the killer's motive WAY too early -- before page 100. I kept hoping I was wrong -- I actually like to be surprised! -- but I wasn't. The ending was a huge disappointment, as it seemed HIGHLY unlikely that such a thing could ever work. In addition, I found several plot holes in this book that were annoying -- e.g., since there's no way Reacher could have contacted his colonel-friend-who-owed-him, how was everything set up and ready when he got there? And the \\"problem of the box\\" (hopefully that's vague enough to NOT be a spoiler) raises obvious questions that are never satisfactorily answered, just followed up on a couple of hundred pages later when they should have been figured out immediately. In addition, it became REALLY annoying when Reacher would figure something out but when another character would ask him to explain, he would say something like \\"No time,\\" or \\"Later,\\" or whatever -- this happened over and over and over again, and the ONLY reason for his idiotic responses was that the plot needed him to not reveal what he knew at that point, even though of course in real life any real person would have. And finally, I found Reacher's \\"interludes\\" with the new FBI agent annoying too -- not to be overly moralistic, but come on -- isn't he supposed to be crazy in love with someone else? Overall disappointing, although not enough to turn me off the series -- in fact, I am already 100 pages into #5 and so far so good on that one."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Typical Lee Child; keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Always a great storyline/plot with plenty of true-sounding action."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child is a great writer and I highly recommend the Reacher series to anyone who likes well written and emotionally engaging stories."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"In Running Blind, Jack Reacher is caught up in a bizarre mystery when he's picked up by the FBI as a suspect in a string of murders. Someone very smart is murdering former military women across the country, leaving no trace evidence, in fact not even evidence of how they died. All they women have one thing in common, they were the victims of sexual harassment in the military and Jack Reacher was the military cop involved in their sexual harassment cases. There is another military link. All the women's naked bodies are found in their own bathtubs filled with drab green military grade camouflage paint. The lead FBI profiler seems to hate Reacher, saying her profile indicates either Reacher killed them, or someone exactly like him did. He convinces them he's innocent, and they pressure him to stay on the case by threatening his girlfriend. So, he joins the case, but in usual Reacher style slips away w/the help of military friends and makes sure his girlfriend is in no danger. Then in his usual enigmatic way, he pursues musings and hunches that lead him to a truly surprising killer. What was chilling to me was the way the killer enlisted the cooperation of the victims in their own murders. I thought the portrayal of the FBI as near criminals themselves, who threaten an innocent woman, was unbelieveable. Other than that it was riveting."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"If you haven't read Tripwire, I recommend that you precede any reading of this book with that one.Running Blind has more suspense in it than most of the Jack Reacher novels. Unlike the other stories where Reacher has it all under control, he has just the opposite here . . . everything is coming unglued.If the plot had made sense, this would have been a heart-pumping, five-star page-turner. As it is, the book was more of a puzzling, heart-pumping page-turner.In the beginning of the story, Reacher finds himself in the middle of unwanted attention from law enforcement authorities. The reasons for this don't make a lot of sense . . . and that inauspicious beginning (while revealing about Reacher's character) left me scratching my head.The story is one I've been dying to read ever since I finished Tripwire. In that book, Reacher rekindles an old love in a new way. How will Reacher handle a committed relationship? It's a good premise for this story, but most of that premise is unfulfilled in this plot.Someone's killing women who were sexually abused in the Army. The killer seems to be some evil genius whose very method is in doubt. I was kept busy trying to figure out the murder method throughout the book.I was profoundly disappointed when the M.O. turned out to be one that didn't ring true with me. Perhaps it will with you. If you see the M.O. as plausible, you will probably rate this as a four or five star book.As for the puzzle itself, Lee Child does a nice job of showing you enough to keep you interested but mostly holding back on what the real story is. I didn't find it hard, though, to figure out who did what to whom and why. He should have held back a little more. But it's a fair mystery in the sense that all the clues you need are there for you to identify the murderer."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book is very similar to \\"The Poet\\" by Michael Connelly...except for the Edgar Allan Poe references. For The Poet, though, it was homicide detectives instead of woman miliary officers. But there are many similarities that makes you wonder if Child ripped it off. I would name more similarities but don't want to spoil plot for both books that were both good reads. Ending was kind of disappointing but as always, this book kept me interested and had me laughing all the way through. Jack's lack of social graces are perfect and I always love when he makes other people feel stupid when they try to prove them wrong. This book is not as strong as the others in the series, in my opinion, but definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I drive an hour to work and listening to the Reacher series is a great way to make the drive go by.

I thought this one was new, and wanted to see if there had been some sort of improvement in Child's basic writing skills set, but no. Same old same old. Or that's what I thought till I realized I had already read it, long ago. Given that recognition, the clumsiness of the characterizations, the fantastic contrivance of plots, and the slavish devotion to vigilante themes were like former friends that we outgrew as adolescents. If there was some slightest shred of plausibility I missed it. Initially (when I finished reading it on Kindle) I gave it two starts because one way or another I did finish it. Then I realized that I finished it because I just couldn't believe there was any rational explanation for the plots, and it turns out there wasn't. I wouldn't have expected the depiction of the FBI to bear much relationship to reality (although anybody could do 5 minutes' research and do a better job) but Child's depiction of the Army, and of military matters, is so far removed from reality that it is a joke. These are vigilante fantasy stories that will appeal to the few who can suspend enough disbelief. I cannot recommend this book, and if I had paid for it (I got it through a library loan) I would be asking for a refund."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child does not disappoint.

I won't give it away (it's not quite as bad as \\"then he woke up and realized it was all a dream,\\" but not too far behind that). Let's call it a plot device you definitely wouldn't expect from a good writer. If you can overlook this big problem, and you like Reacher, then you'll probably enjoy the rest of the book. Two and a half stars, leaning a bit toward three."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"What woman finds a man who doesn't use toothpaste, deoderant, or clean underwear, and never changes clothes attractive? Maybe a cave woman. I couldn't enjoy the book thinking of the poor people in a car or on a plane with the reeking Jack. The ending with him, of course, with a single crashing blow breaking the neck of the killer and the F.B.I. saying \\"now we own you\\", well this part wasn't even a one star. The book had a lot of potential, but was disappointing."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Give me a break. I like Mr. Child's Reacher so I'm willing to suspend quite a bit of disbelief to get a good read. But the idea of the FBI threatening to let some mob person beat up your girlfriend if you don't serve them and then keeping you in a locked room while you're helping them? Hello Mr. Attorney General? Hello CNN? I don't think that's going to be happening in America. Not to mention them standing around watching as Reacher beat up a couple of hoods while under surveillance. I'm sure that broke a few laws too. Pull the other leg please.And then we have the MO. Please. I doubt that scenario could be pulled off once much less four times. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it couldn't be accomplished without the victim thrashing around and getting paint on the floor. Certainly wouldn't be a quite, peaceful death.And if Jack doesn't start changing his clothes and practicing some better hygiene all his women are going to be singing is Hit the Road, Jack.......OK, I'll have to say that even with one preposterous thing after another I still read every word. Mr. Child is a talented writer and I look forward to continuing improvement as he puts Jack through his paces. Maybe I should have given this one three stars afterall."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"For the first 300 pages, this is the best of the Jack Reacher novels. I am not a believer in series and this one proves my argument that one character needs one book and one book only. Jack Reacher is a walking nerve end, likely to take offense at almost nothing and likely to give offense for no good reason. He is a hero who is very hard to like over the course of a book, though we often root for him. He is almost autistic in that he knows a lot about fighting and police work and the military, but hasn't got a clue about how the rest of life works. And you just know a guy like this is going to get into big trouble.Though there is a nasty murderer and vicious gang members in the book, the FBI also comes off as a major villain. If the agency really acts the way it does in this book, then it ought to be deep-sixed immediately.All those gripes in place, the story is very compelling and Reacher's resourcefulness keeps your interest. However, the payoff, the ending where all of the terrific mysteries are explained, was totally unrealistic and an insult to the reader. That is pretty much all I can say without giving too much away, but, you have to be pretty gullible to believe the story could have happened that way.Lee Child has a ton of talent and I hope he puts Reacher to sleep for awhile and works on some books with new leading characters. And, hopefully, next time, he won't paint himself into a corner where a fantasy ending is the only way to escape."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"RUNNING BLIND, the newest novel by Lee Child, continues the saga of ex-military policeman and drifter, Jack Reacher. But wait! Reacher has settled down in this book. He now owns a house, a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and has the undying love of attorney, Jodie Garber, who fans will remember from TRIPWIRE. Is this our hero? Is this the life he was cut out for? Maybe not. Anyway, things kind of get disrupted in Reacher's life when the FBI suddenly pull him in for questioning with regards to the deaths of three ladies, each of whom was mysteriously murdered and left in a bathtub of green paint. The ladies had two things in common with each other. All three were involved in sexual harassment cases while still in the Army, and each knew Jack Reacher. One of the FBI agents, Julia Lamarr, thinks that the killer's profile matches Reacher to a T. If he isn't the serial killer, then it is someone like him with a military background. The FBI believes that the killer will continue his spree of perfect crimes, unless Reacher agrees to help. The only problem is that when Reacher finally joins the hunt, the Feds choose to ignore his advise. He doesn't think that it is a soldier, but they don't want to hear that. When another lady dies, Reacher knows that he must find the killer himself, or it simply won't get done. While he is visiting crime scenes and talking to potential victims, Reacher is also trying to decide the future of his relationship with Jodie. Does he want to remain a &quot;settled&quot; individual, or does he want to get back on the road again? The first half of RUNNING BLIND started off like a heat-seeking missile, but by the last quarter it kind of fizzled out for me. If the reader follows Reacher's advise about looking for motive and who has the most to gain, they will figure out who the killer is long before the FBI does. Mr. Child does throw a number of &quot;red herrings&quot; into the mix, trying to redirect the reader's attention from who the real killer is. One of the &quot;red herrings&quot; more or less appears from out of nowhere, then disappears, and is never fully explained to my satisfaction. It was something I didn't appreciate on Mr. Child's part. Also, I didn't quite buy the method the killer uses to murder his victims. I have heard of death occurring in that particular manner, but I just couldn't see using it to kill four different people. It seemed far-fetched to me. Finally, I felt that RUNNING BLIND didn't have enough action on Reacher's part, and that the ending was a simply a little too weak. Now, I'll say this. Mr. Child's first book, KILLING FLOOR, was one of the best debut novels I have ever read, and I still highly recommend to friends and strangers. His last three books, however, have not been in the same league as the first, which I find disappointing. DIE TRYING, TRIPWIRE and RUNNING BLIND are good reads, and I know that Mr. Child is certainly trying to write as good a novel as possible with each succeeding one. I wish he could just write another one as &quot;GREAT&quot; as KILLING FLOOR."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I would like to get my money back from Amazon.com.

One can appreciate the originality of the author's idea (there is great potential there), and I can see what Lee Child was trying to achieve, however, the manner in which he achieves is preposterous at best. Don't blame him. Blame his editor.There are so many things that don't make sense with the plot that you lose count after the first 50 pages. And to make matters worse, the book contains very little suspense. Chapter after chapter nothing much happens, except characters going around in circles, waiting. There is a deadline to aim for and people are dying or are in mortal danger but the protagonists are content to sit around and admit they've run out of ideas without making the slightest effort to think of something else. The manner in which Jack Reacher is brought into the story is bizarre and non-sensical.And perhaps the one thing that really is bothersome is the manner in which the author treats the FBI agents. Reacher is the anti-establishment. That is clear. And you can't get much more establishment than the FBI, but to portray all of them (except one, whose only role is to fawn over Reacher's manly prowess) as criminal and stupid, is lazy.The whole book betrays signs of laziness on the part of the author. The most blatant example being his complete lack of background or even interest in criminal profiling. He didn't do his homework and he covers it up with weak and silly arguments. And if he couldn't bother to work and develop a proper plot, action and suspense, at least he could have developed characters. Instead, these people are not even two-dimensional. They're one-dimensional, mere shadows. Heck, Reacher himself barely reaches two-dimensions. Bad, bad, bad! It's a good thing I didn't read the book on a flight or else I would have jumped out for sure."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love Jack Reacher...I would however, love him more if he bathed more often. The man sleeps in his clothes with no more luggage than a toothbrush!In the past, Jack has been a larger than life hero and in &quot;Running Blind&quot;, he becomes a larger than life slob, vigilante and all around disgusting bully. He is handsome, smart and has powerful connections with the military, and I find it demeaning the way he resorts to solving all problems by either denial or violence. The way he treats Jody is obscene!I think Mr. Child was out of line in his portrayal of the FBI. I would like to think Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity still mean what they used to.I enjoyed the book, but, figured out the killer and the &quot;how&quot; very early on.

Fortunately I read the preview of the first chapters and realized this before spending my money.Running Blind (Jack Reacher, No. 4)"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the fourth or fifth \\"Jack Reacher novel I have read and I enjoyed the others far more. I can't help thinking that this was actually Lee Child's first Jack Reacher novel that he hadn't been able to get published earlier, because there is a much more unpolished style to the writing and plotting. More glaringly, Reacher himself seems less mature as a person and we are to believe that he really would go weeks without a change of clothes or a shave, with no one complaining about the smell, and beautiful women still drawn to him.If this wasn't sophomoric and jarring enough, somehow Reacher has forgotten that all he has to do to get his FBI blackmail problem to go away is to call the head of the FBI and tell him about it. If this is really book four in the last couple of years in \\"Die Trying\\" Reacher has bailed out the FBI by rescuing a high level FBI agent and saving the FBI from a huge embarrassing scandal. We are somehow to believe that he doesn't remember this.In \\"Die Trying\\", FBI agents are appropriately quite bright and only realistically misled from within. In this book we are to believe that even in a high end Serial Killer task force unit, they are inflexible and totally unable to even consider a new idea from a man they blackmailed into helping them. This is as ridiculous as the murder method is impossible.You can see in this book the seeds of an excellent writer and if you let yourself go can be carried along for quite awhile (and I can forgive phony red herrings like the office in the Pentagon scene), but this is neither the quality of character or of plotting I have come to expect from Lee Child. This is a first novel kind of effort, not the polished output of a \\"Best Seller\\" quality writer.If this is your first Reacher book skip this one completely and start with \\"Killing floor\\". If not, jump to book five and let this one gather dust on the shelves as Lee Child's worst and probably first effort."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"As an avid fan of Lee Child's novels I leapt on this as soon as it came to my attention. Fortunately my enthusiasm was not without warrant. The plot is slightly more complex than the other 3 Reacher novels as it continues switching between characters throughout the story, however the twists and turns more than make up for this. The basic solution to the mystery comes early on in the novel although it's easy to miss, but when it sunk in a part of me wanted to turn straight to the back page of the book to see if I was right,(instead I called my father who'd bought me the book but sneaked a read first. Parents! ). Fortunately the truly genius twist had eluded me and I was forced to stay awake until 3 in the morning, determined to get the answer before sleep claimed my energy. Reacher's character is as usual, very much a 'don't mess kinda guy' and this can wear thin at times as he can be a little bit too incredible on occaision. HOWEVER, if you can suspend disbelief for just a while then the book is as thoroughly enjoyable as you could hope for, with gang warfare, invisible assasins and continuous murder, mystery and suspense. I'm now looking forward to the next one in the hope that mr child serves up more of the same"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the fourth Reacher novel I've read and they've steadily gone downhill from \`Killing Floor'. From Lee Child not knowing diddly-squat about the military life Reacher purports to come from to the unbelievable string of coincidences in the storyline, Child totally stretches the realm of credibility.Jack Reacher is coerced in to leading a FBI investigation of several murders, and all the while the FBI steadfastly refuses to entertain any of his ideas. If that isn't bad enough for Reacher, the FBI is persistently trying to blackmail and pin crimes on him. Of course, that cannot stop our hero, Reacher, from solving the murders. Heck, he even gets all the girls, but just temporarily.I guess what really turned me off about this book was that: Reacher is seemingly infallible, the FBI is an incompetent modern day Gestapo, and the egregious errors about the military i.e., Fort Dix, NJ being a Marine Corps Air station, C'mon!Jack Reacher would be a somewhat interesting character if Child didn't continually try to turn him in to a psychic superman who never changes his clothes."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"OK, so Lee Child isn't exactly Tolstoy or Dickens, and his hero is a misanthropic thug, but who hasn't daydreamed about being a non-person, wandering about using wits, wiles, and fists to right injustices and settle scores? And that's Jack Reacher who does not try to subvert or trick the system with false IDs and such. He takes the bus, pays cash, buys new clothing when the old stuff wears out. No family, no friends, no entanglements, no regrets - a strong, self-reliant character who floats on the surface, diving deeper only when he feels an injustice has been done. The premise is strained, no doubt, but the writing is just good enough to make it readable. I find it a guilty pleasure and enjoy watching Reacher get himself into and out of difficult circumstances, trying to make things right. So, yep, most of the one- and two-star reviewers are correct, but then they probably think James Bond is not entertaining. If you don't much care for Bond, Reacher won't please you much either, for Reacher is the crude American cousin to Bond. Who says sociopaths aren't entertaining?"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I bought this with the two \`Soft Target\` novels by Conrad Jones (electric thrillers!) only to find that the storyline seemed way to familiar to be a Reacher book that I hadnt already read...low and behold it is the same as Visitor but renamed and rebound.....not very fair really on Lee Child fans...there is no mention on the cover of either book that they are the same...which is naughty to say the least.Good job my two other purchases were brilliant!!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The first book I read of Child's was Without Fail. The book was brilliant with a wicked main character and plot. I immediately went searching for more. Other reviews have pressed the notion that Reacher's vagrant style is slightly unrealistic and anti-civilization. Although I'd agree that in Running Blind (aka the Visitor) Reacher's near sightedness when it came to his living was rather annoying, in the other books I liked it. It added to Reacher's personality and his character.However, Child has begun to take Reacher's need to isolate himself way too far. Running Blind made Reacher come off as slightly self centered and a rendition of the loose cannon hitman in the movie The Protector.I don't have as much respect for the plot of Running Blind as I did the other books (especially Without Fail). It was predictable and highly unrealistic (in the sense of motive and killer).I felt like the book built up so much and then just bombed completely in the end delivery.Child has established his pattern. Reacher meets girl. Eventually has sex with her. Kills some bad guys. Girl gets killed (or they split up undoubtably never to see each other again).It would be nice to see Reacher with the same woman for more than one book. Or to have him settle down even a little. Although it seems that this is the event which Child seems driven to never let happen.One other thing that bothered me in RB more than it did in other books was that it seemed to me Child used a lot of shorter sentences in clusters. ie Reacher sat down. It was raining. Got up and opened the closet. Pulled on his coat and shut the door.It seemed more pronounced in this book, but maybe it's just me.It is a little hard that Without Fail was my first book. It set such high standards for the following reads, but I'll still read the remaining books. I have faith that there's at least one more great book in Child's line."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I enjoyed the previous Jack Reacher books - except for the author's irritating use of the word &quot;guy&quot;. The plots were intricate, yet (almost) believable. Good movie material. This one, however, was stupid. OK, I'm not a citizen of the U.S.A., and in fact I have never been there. But really - the F.B.I. threatening and blackmailing Reacher? the F.B.I. shredding the Constitution in order to compel one retired MP into helping them? No. Never. Not in a thousand years. Child, it seems, has Reached the end of Reacher. The plot's flimsy, the story's unbelievable, the writing... Childish."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I followed the advice of another reader and flipped to the last few pages to confirm what I'd suspected.

And while riding in New Jersey, he sees Pennsylvania on his right.

And _Running Blind_ is the best one yet, which is saying something. Former military cop Jack Reacher is in New York City, reconsidering the impact his inherited house and relationship has on his beloved \\"vagabond\\" lifestyle. He happens upon a small-time protection racket and quickly, violently deals with the situation. Within hours, he is pulled off the streets by a SWAT team of feds.It turns out he was already under surveillance; he's one of the prime suspects in a serial murder case. Several retired female soldiers have been killed in their homes under circumstances that are truly bizarre. Since he had served with two of the women, he's one of the key suspects that the FBI profilers have identified.Proving his innocence, inciting a mob war, and tracking down the real killer are all on the agenda. Reacher is tough, sarcastic, and a completely entertaining character. And don't worry about reading the Reacher series in order - I didn't, and did not miss a beat. Each story seems to stand alone just fine."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"that Lee Child writes about his pseudo-hero, Jack Reacher, are less than satisfying.To be sure, I read both at almost a single setting, because Child has an uncanny way of absorbing your interest while reading the book. It is after you've finished, and think about your reactions, that you'll wish Running Blind was as good an outing as the first 3 Reacher novels.There's a killer loose in this novel, and the victims are three women, all of whom have a tie in the past to Jack Reacher, while in the military. Naturally, with crime scenes that are incredibly far-fetched, the FBI is sniffing around for a serial killer...and Jack is a prime suspect. Once he is off the hook, the FBI decides to use him to help find the killer. It's a plausible theme, with an interesting M.O., but Child loses his way in the story.To begin... Jack needs to be on the road, not settled down with Jodie; Child does find a creative way to take care of that. But, despite the excitement of the tale, the story is unsatisfying, much of the characterization missing or lacking, and there are the usual editing errors you find in each Child work.I'm hanging in there with the series, because Reacher is one of the more interesting (if over the top) leading characters developed in serial thrillers in the last few years, but Running Blind could have, should have, been a much better story."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child is my favorite author(hence my last name &quot;Reacher&quot;), and I am sure you can read all the other reviews to see what this is about. I think the only reason I dont give this book a 1 is because Lee Child wrote it. There isn't the action represented in the first three books. Reacher takes the long way of finding out who the bad guy is when it is staring him in the face. My favorite kind of book has me guessing who the killer is throughout the whole thing. The author should make me change my mind a million times, until i finally settle on one person, who turns out to be wrong(As Child does in his previous three books). I had the bad guy pinned within the first 150 pages, and nothing after that gave me any reason to doubt my hypothesis. If you are looking for a great suspense author, you have found him, but dont waste your time with this book. I suggest his first three."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Wow, I've put other things off that I should be doing so I could finish the latest Jack Reacher novel.

First and foremost, Lee Child is a very good writer, and although this one moves a little slower than its predecessors, it still maintained my interest---and also &quot;riled me up&quot; a little.I think Mr. Child definitely has a poor opinion of the FBI. This is the third of the series that has some really nasty FBI agents---bribing, blackmailing, insinuating absurdities, and even more! (If you've read the previous three, you will know what I mean!).The plot is great; the killer's m.o. is quite unusual and even if really far-fetched, works in that the reader never knows how the victims died! However, I must admit, that I had the killer figured out very early. Oh, yes, Lee did try to throw us some red herrings (including the enigmatic appearance of an Army chaplain, who comes out of nowhere, and disappears back, without any explanation!).And maybe I'm getting old fashioned, but come on, Jack. You have turned into a really self-centered, insensitive, self-pitying moron who refuses, yes REFUSES, to live in a civilized, realistic world. I know many readers think that Jack's meandering all over the globe makes him a free spirit, an independent guy, no chains to hold him down. It also makes him shallow and annoying. He says he loves Jodie--bull, Jack. You love the sex you have with her. If you really loved her, would you be so enamored with FBI agent Lisa Harper? And all this gobbledygook about commitments and normal living, it's just more self-centered crap focusing on your inability to live in a real world. And Child should be chastised for making Jodie the culprit in the end of the book. Oh, Jack, I had really started to like you, but even in &quot;Tripwire,&quot; I started seeing a side of you that made me respect and enjoy you less and less.You are a great detective, a remarkable physical presence, but society doesn't need guys who take the law into their own hands without any moral ramifications, and a man who uses women for his immediate pleasure but just can't bring himself to face the truth that he isn't worth their time.Now, with that out of my system, it's still an entertaining read, but I don't think I'll venture along with Jack any further. I enjoy escapist entertainment, after all, that's what it's all about. But don't give me a hero who breaks all the rules and invites us to see him as a hero.Goodbye, Jack!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"...you'd have to be to enjoy this book.

Though at times he goes outside the law, he always makes life better for the person he is protecting. At a new Italian restaurant in New York City, former MP Jack Reacher observes two thugs hitting on the owner for protection money. When they return to collect their fee, Jack provides personal payment, sending both punks to the hospital.FBI agents greet Jack with the knowledge that they believe he is a serial killer targeting female soldiers complaining about sexual harassment. Apparently, Jack knew three victims, but he has the perfect alibi since FBI agents had Jack under surveillance at the time the fourth murder occurred. The agents want Jack to help them uncover the identity of the killer because a department profiler insists that his personality is a match to that of the perpetrator. Jack refuses until they threaten his girlfriend. Jack begins his unique gathering of information that leads him to conclude that the FBI is traveling down the wrong paradigm, leaving former women in uniform in jeopardy unless he can persuade the department to change course.RUNNING BLIND is an exciting thriller starring a sensitive, honorable person struggling with keeping one foot in the civilized world. Anyone who has &quot;profiled&quot; F. Paul Wilson's &quot;Repairman Jack&quot; novels will realize the characters share many traits with the biggest difference being that Reacher is grounded in the physical realm while Repairman Jack deals with supernatural elements. The crux of this mystery lies in the intensity of the killer whose extraordinary energy matches that of Jack, thus freshening up the serial killer tale. With more novels like this one, Lee Child has the talent to become a superstar.Harriet KLausner"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Only recently caught up with Jack Reacher.I have one more in my library but it's becoming a bit hard going.

I read five books of Lee Child's, this being the sixth. The others I would all rate four or five, this one is bad. What makes it bad? Well, I had selected the perp but as I continued reading I became confused. Good writer's share the protagonist's knowledge of the crime as it develops with the reader but in this case Child definitely tries to insert false clues. He uses italic type when he switches from Reacher's point of view, I will give him credit for that, he does use third person view point for one of his other characters but then inserts second person point of view for yet another, and I assume he thinks he is playing fair with the reader. We are supposed to know these two italicized inserts are two different people? How many people would know that? Not only that, they are so smoothly inserted I admit I was confused, thought they were the same and was forced to change my choice of perp. When the new one was unfrocked I had to admit I should have known, but that was only because I had taken creative writing courses. I would not think the ordinary reader would note the change in point of view, even I had to go back over the inserts and see that he really did maintain the point of view between the two. I felt cheated, and stupid. The story was interesting, why did he feel he had to use the inserts? They were not essential to the plot line except to confuse the reader. I still have nine Reacher stories to read, I hope I do not encounter this type of writing again."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is one of my favorite heros, and all of his books are excellent. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child has done it again!! I have now read a total of 5 books featuring Jack Reacher. The first book I read was \\"Without Fail\\", that book prompted me to by the entire Jack Reacher series, and I am not disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Women are being killed; the one thing that they all have in common is the fact that they are recent sexual harassment victims who have left the army. Forced by the FBI to be their consultant, Reacher must find the murderer and also decide if he is willing to stay in New York with his girlfriend, Jodie, or continue his transient ways. The greatest part of this thriller is how the women die. They are all found naked in the bathtub coated with three cans of army paint. There is no evidence left at the scene, and the FBI can't even figure out how the women are killed. Reacher is the only one who does not believe in the FBI's profile, and he sets out to prove them wrong. Lee Child delivers another masterful thriller."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I've only read one other Lee Child book: &quot;Killing Floor&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it. (Gotta go back and get the ones I missed!) This book is a great read, but the crime is impossible. It could not have happened, if everything I've read on the subject is true. For the sake of those of you who have not read the book, I won't elaborate on &quot;the subject.&quot; But that's my gripe. This scenario could not have happened as he wrote it. So... read it (you won't be bored) and see if you don't agree with me."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"When I first sat down to read this book, I was a little scared that it might not me as good as his other Jack Reacher novels. But after finishing it in one day (I just couldn't put it down) I was very impressed.This thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire novel and makes you come back wanting for more.After reading the other reviews, I noticed there were some negative comments about the italic paragraphs throughout the book. Personally I loved them and couldn't wait until the next one appeared. There were also comments which I may agree with. The FBI does seem a little harsh in this book but that may be what it is actually like. Who knows?Despite very minor flaws like the one mentioned above, I think this book is another great hit for Lee Child and a smash read for anyone who likes a great thriller. I can't wait until the next Child book comes out later this year!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"i was so impressed with this book i read it in two days and couldn't wait to turn the page. usually i can figure out bites and pieces of who did it, in this book i only figured out a small piece at about page 300. then at page 340 when the book was almost ending i got it. this is really a big 10. now i want her to write more and for real readers to read this truly very good read. carl marciano"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"About 1/3 of the way into this book it's painfully obvious who the killer is.

Throughout the whole book obvious red flags should have... WOULD have caught the attention of any characters with enough brain power to scramble eggs. It's as if Jack Reacher's IQ is the only one high enough to add two and two together. This is a DUMB book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am a fan of the Reacher series and this is the fourth book in the series and the fourth I have read. And I will keep going with the series, but I might not have gone on if this one was number one. It is far below the quality of the others. Jack Reacher is a loner but in this one it is too extreme. Hope for better in number five."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Make this my fourth entry into the world of Jack Reacher, having already read the first three books in this series. Of those, I loved Killing Floor, didn't love Tripwire and enjoyed Die Trying. When I started Running Blind, I was just happy to be back with Jack Reacher, a character who guys can relate to and women can fall for. Who doesn't like the brooding bad boy type with the Robin Hood vigilante mentality?I was so caught up in this book right from the beginning. As a matter of fact, I emailed a friend of mine just to say how much I was enjoying the Child's book I was reading. At the time of that writing, she was already on his current book so I was far behind her. This book was everything Tripwire wasn't in my opinion. It was fast paced with Reacher helping the FBI, obviously under duress, and his relationship with Jodi is still in tact. As with all of Jack's appearances, things will start to fall apart shortly.While Jack is always chasing someone very smart, we all know that he is that much smarter. In this case, it's a serial killer bent on doing away with former Army employees who have left the force due to sexual harassment. The FBI profilers have narrowed it down to the exact type of person the killer is....someone exactly like Jack. This hunt will take Jack from the east coast to the west coast and back again until he figures out who the culprit is. We already know he's smarter than they are so we know he's going to be successful.I loved this book until......it got to the ending. I see many other reviewers have complained about this so just add me to the list. When are authors going to stop neatly tying up their books with ridiculous scenarios. I have something else to say and I don't want anyone who hasn't read the book yet to read what I'm going to say so please move on to the next review.I said move on to the next review or else you're going to read something you don't want to read. Okay so here's my beef. Am I crazy? Weren't there more than two paragraphs in the book where a colonel is sitting at his desk, forty to forty-five minutes away from Quantico, looking at the list of eleven women, four of which had already been killed. If this wasn't the killer, who the heck was he? Was he the chaplain who appears out of nowhere in the end. A chaplain who comes walking, not even driving, up a hill in the Pacific Northwest. And I'm so sick of authors making everything an inside job. It's like if a woman gets killed, the authorities first look at the husband. I'm now beginning to think that every time I pick up a mystery, I should just look at the cops investigating the case to come up with the killer. I'm sick of it, I tell you. Okay, enough of my rant. I'd love any of you who have read this book to please leave me a comment so I can know who the heck this colonel was and what part he played in the book.Up until the ending, this book was almost five stars for me....the ending dropped it down to three and a half."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I have read several of the Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels and enjoyed them. Up until now. Child creates great characters (Reacher being preeminent) and has a talent for great individual scenes. His endings tend to be a bit clumsy, but I've forgiven that in the past for the joy of the ride. I can't do it with this one. The solution on this one, re. how the murders are committed, is so absurd that it has effectively ended my interest in the series. I figured out the probable solution early on during the book, but I kept telling myself I must be wrong as such a solution would be ridiculous. Unfortunately the ridiculous solution was the solution. I apologize for mentioning the ending without going into detail as to what it was and what specifically was wrong with it, but there's no way to do this without being a \\"spoiler\\" and I don't want to mess up the (already bad) ending for people who do choose to buy the book. If you like Lee Child, please continue to read him but know that he has done better work than this."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Wonderful book when I read it under another name.

This is absolutely wrong."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that this was a \\"retitled\\" book. I use Kindle and couldn't figure out why it wasn't offered and was considering buying a hard copy -- Another copy.

What a poor policy."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Author Lee Childs brings back the invincible ex-MP, Jack Reacher. This time, could he be the serial killer the FBI is after? Could he be the maniac that leaves dead bodies smeared with camoflauge paint in their own bathtubs?In, &quot;Running Blind&quot;, we are privy to an edgy laser paced thriller. After some shennanigans from the government with Jack's galpal, he willingly searches for a killer who leaves no clues. Jack begins with a few common threads; all of the victims brought gritty sexual charges against their military superiors, all won their cases, all then resigned, and then they were all found dead in their own bathtubs.I do not want to take up too much of your time with this review...when you can be engrossed in this blazing blitz of a book on your own!other reading suggestions: &quot;Messiah&quot; by Boris Starling and &quot;The Empty Chair&quot; by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the first Lee Child book I've read, which is perhaps unfortunate, as several of the other reviews indicate that this book is not as good as some of the others in the Jack Reacher series. (By the way, this book has two different titles: \\"Running Blind\\" in the USA and Canada, and \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK and elsewhere.)To start with the positive stuff, I love Lee Child's writing style. I'm a fan of thrillers, and this means I'm used to fairly mediocre writing, so this book was a very nice change.The basic idea behind Jack Reacher's character is also interesting. He's a sort of vigilante Robin Hood, righting wrongs around him that the normal forces in society don't take proper care of. And he's not just muscle and weapons and fighting techniques, he's also very intelligent and knowledgeable and observant.I also liked the basic story line, with a serial killer who has the FBI outsmarted and a motive that will come as a surprise.So all-in-all I found the book appealing in many ways.But now comes the list of problems that I have with this book, problems that are sufficient that it's doubtful if I'll ever get around to reading another book by Lee Child.The characters aren't really believable. Jack Reacher is supposed be a loner, but not wanting to own anything other than a folding toothbrush must be a bit problematic. Lisa Harper is having problems with sexual harassment in the FBI so she gives up wearing a bra. Jodie Jacobs has found her long-lost secret love from her youth, but still prefers to pursue a high-flying career rather than make the relationship her top priority. And the nasty FBI guys are so nasty that Internal Affairs would be after them if they were ordinary cops.On top of the unbelievable characters we have a story that lacks realism and seems contrived. The most unrealistic part involves the method by which the murderer kills the victims, which in my opinion is totally impossible on two different counts. Unfortunately, I can't describe this problem in detail without revealing too much and getting this review labeled as a spoiler.So I think I'll wish Jack Reacher good luck in his continuing lonely travels, and continue my search for thrillers that appeal to me on other shelves in the bookstores of cyberspace and elsewhere.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am a Jack Reacher fan and am currently finishing the tenth novel by Lee Child (The Hard Way). I was astonished to discover a Jack Reacher novel I had never heard of. But then, when I read the description of the plot, I am fairly certain that this book was re-published under the title \\"Running Blind\\" which is the fourth Reacher novel."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"While fairly well-written for the thriller genre, this book contains some of the worst use of psychology I have ever encountered since the early '40s, when people really believed that hypnosis was this terrifying, all-powerful technique that could drive anyone to do anything. However, the science has since then progressed and even we the hoi poloi now know better. The most cursory research should have informed this author of the basic unsoundness of his murder method. His insistence on its use grated on my nerves and utterly destroyed any enjoyment I may have derived from the book. Characters are badly fleshed-out, awkwardly motivated, and flatter than a stack of pancakes. I guessed the murder's identity and the murder method one-third way through the book, thought to myself, Nah, it's too ridiculous, flipped to the end and Lo, I was right! What a waste of time."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Continuing with the Jack Reacher series, I'm up to the 4th installment... Running Blind by Lee Child. Still liking the series a lot, and this one had me guessing until the end...Reacher is coerced into helping out on a case by the FBI. He happened to be in a restaurant when part of a gang came in looking for protection money. Jack took matters into his own hands to break it up, but he also stumbled into an FBI stakeout. Now if he doesn't help solve a potential serial killer, he might end up getting blamed for the deaths. The women being killed all were ex-military and had filed (and won) harassment cases against superiors. Reacher knows them, as he was part of the military police presence that was involved at the time. The women who are dying are all discovered immersed in a bathtub full of camouflage paint, and apparently have gone under voluntarily and without a struggle. No clues, no reason why, but they're still very dead. The FBI is relying on psychological profiling to narrow down the killer, but Jack figures that's all a crock. The struggle is to figure out if they'll listen to him before another victim shows up...Like the other Reacher novels, you're never quite sure who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I figured there would be a plot twist somewhere, but the one I got wasn't the one I was expecting. Definitely a page turner to see how it's going to unfold. The subplot at play here is the relationship between Jodie (from the 3rd book) and Jack, and whether his foray into the world of responsibility will send him packing back to his nomadic life once again. That came to an interesting point at the end, and I'm curious to see how it will play out in installment #5...Fun read..."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I strongly suggest that anyone who contemplates buying this book on the basis of the strong overall rating go immediately to the one-star ratings for a dose of reality--and nevermnd the fact that they contain spoilers.Those slashing reviews point out many of the outrageous faults of this book. I shall therefore limit myself to just two areas.Jack Reacher is a totally immature, highly disfunctional, neurotic thug who, for some wholly elusive reason, seems to be irresistibly attractive to most women. The fact that he owns just one set of clothes which he NEVER changes over the whole course of the book and for heaven knows how long before the book starts and after it closes strikes me as making that attractiveness more than slightly improbable--but, hey, maybe some women like a man whom they can smell before they can see.The killer's identity is painfully obvious about half-way through the book, not from any logical analysis--for their is no logic here--but from the endlessly unnecessary prominence given to the character, that character's relationships and that character's motives. If that is not bad enough, the killer's overall plan is an ancient wheeze that was executed with infinitely more skill by Agatha Christie in \\"The ABC Murders.\\" Finally, worst, is the actual method of killing, for which I have just one word: ridiculous!There is only one way in which to enjoy this sort of book: turn off all your higher brain functions and simply enjoy the rush. If you are of a disposition to do that, then this is a three-star book, otherwise it fully deserves its one-star (or lower) status.LEC/Am/1-10"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Running Blind is a definite step up from TRIPWIRE, which absolutely stunk, but that's still not saying much for this book.Frequent readers of this genre will figure out the motive, the method and the identity of the killer hundreds of pages before Jack Reacher and the entire FBI do. Sure I was momentarily distracted by some of the red herrings Child threw at me, not the ridiculous appearance of an Army chaplain from out of the blue towards the end, that was just lame.KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING remain my favorites in this series. The Jack Reacher character is getting annoying by now with his steadfast refusal to own anything that doesn't fit in his pockets. That includes any changes of clothes! Jack just sleeps in the buff and lets his clothes air out to wear day in and day out. I'm about the same size as Jack, six foot five and 260lbs, and believe me, if I didn't change clothes daily there is no way bra-less FBI agents or gorgeous Wall St. lawyers would be throwing themselves at me. Not that they do anyway, but that's another story.I may pick up another Jack Reacher story in the future but only if I can find it in my local library where I found this title.

Now I could be wrong about that, but the connection seemed closer. The second and third person narative in the resulting books is dryer, less visceral, less involving. Lee Child crafts a believable mystery with but a few stumbling points. His television series background makes for a visual style that moves along and shows the story rather than telling it.

This was an older one and I was very pleased to obtain it so easily."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Weak plot, thin characters, repetitive action. I'm sorry, but I actually believe that you can write action and still challenge your readers just a little bit (and though even more than that would be desirable I don't always expect it).As with the previous Reacher book I read, this one takes us around the US (did Mr. Child have a past as a geography teacher?), this time hunting down a serial killer. So smart is this Reacher that he has figured out the answer around the middle of the book and his childish \\"just-won't-tell-because-I'm-smarter-than-you\\" is probably intended to keep you glued to the book but frankly it's a cheap turn-off.The fact that all the characters, especially the FBI agents that he loves to hate, are one-dimensional stereotypes doesn't make the young blonde special agent he's partnering up with particularly attractive despite multiple reminders that she is or isn't wearing a bra (apparently depending on whether or not her plan today is to seduce Reacher or not). Not even the contemplating of whether or not, and ultimately why, to sell his house doesn't really give him much depth. Nice try, but try again.The only thing I will comment on regarding the plot [spoiler alert!] is voluntarily swallowing your tongue because you are under hypnosis. Oh, gimme a break!Due to the many positive reviews for Lee Child and his Reacher series I bought 3 books. The first was readable. This one, the second, kills time, at best. It will be a while until I read number 3. If you are looking for good entertainment, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I started on Lee Child's books with audio CDs in my car. Bad Luck and Hard Times introduced me to Jack Reacher amid other characters of Delta 10. As I advanced through the novels that came after that, I could see that Reacher had an interesting history that kept reappearing in many of the books. Some, like One Shot, The Enemy, and 61 Hours, were amazingly strong. I decided around Christmas to get those earlier books in the series to see how it all started. The Killing Floor showed me Reacher's connection to his brother, and it revealed that he was not always the existential hulk, big on principles and cold on consequences. I could see that Child had empathy, an interest in bad guys and what made them tick, and knew how to keep the story moving forward. Each book explored new territory, and each brought Reacher back to rediscovering an America he never knew growing up and helping small town Americans rediscover the values they had traded for entitlement and a life cut off from a concern for others. But, with Running Blind, Child seems to be stuck and running blind, himself. He moves into pure mystery, one designed to look at sexuality, Reacher's present relationship that forces him to consider settling down or moving on, and what are his personal priorities. But, to accomplish this, he gives us a novel where the killer is obvious from the beginning and the only way to keep his readers from knowing this all along is to throw cooked-up red herrings in their path. Then, he attributes bumbling attitudes to people who don't deserve to be slighted so easily just to make Reacher an outsider rather than the one who leaves everyone wondering, \\"Who was that masked man?\\" To, then, rename the book as The Visitor has repeated the error of getting Child's readers excited by something that is not what it seems. Let's be happy that the real novels that have followed have brought us a hero that addresses our need to straighten our spines, increase our empathy, and bulk up our principles to deal with the problems facing us today."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is a 5 star Jack Reacher novel. The 2 star reviews made me hesitate to buy it and left it as my final book in the series. How I regret my decision! The 1-2 star reviews are basically about this novel being re-named by the Publisher (hardly the fault of Lee Childs!). None of the reviews tell you about the brilliant blot, the classic Jack Reacher attitude and approach to solving mysteries and the twists and turns that keep you awake at night. The overall experience is pure magic.Buy it now and make your own mind. If you agree, write another 5 star review and advise potential readers of the joy to come. Wishing you the best."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I was very disappointed to find when I started reading the book that I had already read it under another title."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was a very entertaining book and the best Reacher novel I have read thus far. Several women have been murdered throughout the country and they all have one thing in common. Each of them knew Reacher from the military. However, the murderer is very efficient in that no clues remain as to what caused the death of each woman. Reacher has been coerced by the FBI to assist them with the investigation and he reluctantly decides to help the agency. Unfortunately, most of the agents on this assignment really do not respect nor like him with the exception of a very attractive yet inexperienced 29 year old named Lisa Harper. She also proves to be a valuable ally to Reacher in his search for this cold-blooded killer.Very graphic with intense language but very exciting book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child spins wonderful tales, convoluted and popping with curious and intriguing characters. his failing is he lacks pace. Long descriptive paragraphs are fine as he gets his plot going. He does them well. But when the action gets perking along he seems to forget the drama and instead lessen by long, needless descriptions that do nothing but clog up the pace. In Running Blind, he also makes one of his few factual mistakes. He has his hero Reacher say: &quot;You ever been to Israel? Women in the front line there too....&quot; I don't know where he got this mistaken idea. Women in the Israel Defense Force serve as secretaries and other noncombat roles, usually as the concubines of the officers."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"My sole and only problem with this book is that fact that it's a big mystery...that I figured out less than a third of the way into the book. All you have to do is ask yourself the right question about what seems to be going on at the right time, and both the ultimate motive and the perpetrator are obvious.Otherwise, the book is competently written and the protagonist engaging. Child also steps away from the previous book where he gave Jack a wish-fulfillment ending that threatened to remove all of his character."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher usually is a bit more physical than in this novel. Instead of busting heads, he's really figuring out a mystery. I'm not complaining though, I raced through this book as quickly as the 3 earlier Reacher books. I'm glad to see that author Lee Child figured out a logical way to get Reacher back out in the world and having adventures. At the end of the last book it looked like he might be stuck in a bucolic country life with his new girl friend. Fat chance! I personally hope the business of Reacher vs. the Feds doesn't continue into other books, though. I think that's a bit overdone, the evil feebs who will stop at nothing to protect their agency. Summary: buy this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable \\"twist\\", especially as Reacher books go.

If you're not, save your time and money."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I recomend this book to anyone who likes James Patterson, David Balducci or Lee Child. Great suspense, lofty characters, and quick reading."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I started reading this series because of the film, planning on continuing up at least through the book that was adapted. The first three in the series were okay, with some creative violence, but nothing really spectacular. Running Blind, however, was really really awful.The book followed Lee Child's Reacher pattern: Inside man, a pointless subplot, and an improbable romance.The biggest flaw of Running Blind is the total lack of continuity between the volumes. In the 2nd book, we had Jack Reacher risking his life to save a cherished FBI agent from a kidnapping, rooting out TWO corrupt FBI agents, fanning the fires of Romance between two FBI agents, and stopping a terrorist bomb. By any measure there should be a number of FBI personnel, including some high ranking ones, who owe Jack Reacher a great deal. But for some reason, the FBI is essentially able to kidnap and blackmail Jack Reacher into doing their work for them. Nobody mentions \\"That business out in Montana\\" and his friends/allies in the FBI somehow don't help him with no explanation. The character Deerfield is as corrupt as the agents that Reacher exposed in Die Trying, but somehow he gets away with all of this as well as trying to get a female agent to have sex with Reacher on camera to have more leverage over him. It's truly ridiculous and far fetched.Pushing the envelope further (and this is a spoiler if you haven't read it) is that the killer relies on hypnotism to coerce the victims into killing themselves. Yes, that's right. Mind control. I had to double check to make sure this wasn't a Stephen King novel or something.Finally, there is a ridiculous red herring point of view character who is manipulated to seem like the killer, but when he shows up finally he is there for a page and then never seen/heard from again. It's a POV that has nothing to do with the plot at all and serves only to make the reader think the killer is a male in the army.Other than a handful of scenes with some creative violence, this book is a huge mess."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"The book Running Blind is just an old Reacher book that was written years ago.

I don't get those that thought this was something less than a wonderfully told mystery, but I respect their right to think that way.There is a serial murderer on the loose and Jack reacher gets roped into the search for him by the FBI who had actually considered him as a candidate for being the killer. Women who complained of sexual harrassment while in the service and who brought charges against the men who harrassed them are being killed in a ritual fashion. Because of his familiarity with the service (Reacher is a retired Army Major who served in the military police) and because while the FBI had him under surveilance they saw him banging the heads of two guys who were working the protection rackets and could charge him with a crime if they chose, Reacher agrees reluctantly to be a consultant on the matter.The leader of the group is very big into profiling and she believes she knows the type of person who would be doing this crime. Reacher has to battle her misconceptions during most of the book as he finally gets drawn into the hunt in earnest.The author has done a first class job in this tightly drawn mystery and I have to admit that when the identity of the killer was revealed, it was a total surpise. I have nothing but praise for this effort and found it very rewarding to read."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery. Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for. Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out. I'm as willing as the next person to suspend reality for the sake of an exciting storyline, but this is too implausible to be ignored. Buy a John Sandford novel instead."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Well he may be as lazy as his friend Douglas Preston says he is but he has put out a book every year and that's got to be tough. I can't think of a bad thing to say about any of his books. I am wild about them. He has inadvertently started a cult following with readers calling themselves \\"Reacher's Creatures\\" of which I am one. I love Jack Reacher. I will admit the first one I read I kept looking back at the photo of Lee Child thinking \\"this man wrote this big tough guy?\\" He looks so mild mannered and Jack Reacher is anything but mild mannered. He was a military MP and he was one of the best. Problem is Jack can't stop. He's wonderful and he is a true hero which we don't have many of any more. These are so well written that when you realize you are coming to the end I begin to slow down so it won't end so soon. He's rough, he's tough just as he has to be. But he can't settle down. Everybody that reads these wants to at least know him. He is a real character. We want him to be our friend. Lee Child made him come alive for us. I'm anxious for more and Lee Child says we can expect at least 10 more. These are my very favorite books right now."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is the first Lee Child book I've read, which is perhaps unfortunate, as several of the other reviews indicate that this book is not as good as some of the others in the Jack Reacher series. (By the way, this book has two different titles: \\"Running Blind\\" in the USA and Canada, and \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK and elsewhere.)To start with the positive stuff, I love Lee Child's writing style. I'm a fan of thrillers, and this means I'm used to fairly mediocre writing, so this book was a very nice change.The basic idea behind Jack Reacher's character is also interesting. He's a sort of vigilante Robin Hood, righting wrongs around him that the normal forces in society don't take proper care of. And he's not just muscle and weapons and fighting techniques, he's also very intelligent and knowledgeable and observant.I also liked the basic story line, with a serial killer who has the FBI outsmarted and a motive that will come as a surprise.So all-in-all I found the book appealing in many ways.But now comes the list of problems that I have with this book, problems that are sufficient that it's doubtful if I'll ever get around to reading another book by Lee Child.The characters aren't really believable. Jack Reacher is supposed be a loner, but not wanting to own anything other than a folding toothbrush must be a bit problematic. Lisa Harper is having problems with sexual harassment in the FBI so she gives up wearing a bra. Jodie Jacobs has found her long-lost secret love from her youth, but still prefers to pursue a high-flying career rather than make the relationship her top priority. And the nasty FBI guys are so nasty that Internal Affairs would be after them if they were ordinary cops.On top of the unbelievable characters we have a story that lacks realism and seems contrived. The most unrealistic part involves the method by which the murderer kills the victims, which in my opinion is totally impossible on two different counts. Unfortunately, I can't describe this problem in detail without revealing too much and getting this review labeled as a spoiler.So I think I'll wish Jack Reacher good luck in his continuing lonely travels, and continue my search for thrillers that appeal to me on other shelves in the bookstores of cyberspace and elsewhere.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is shockingly bad considering the first 3 Reacher books.Three main problems:1. Reacher is completely infallible compared to everyone else. It's bad enough that his chest is bulletproof, but in this book an MP is smarter than everyone at the FBI. The Behavioral Science Unit is not perfect, but they are certainly smart. This idea that Reacher is the only intelligent person is ridiculous. Consider the scene where he tells the profiler/hypnotist extraordinaire that what she calls 'profiling' he calls 'common sense.' So, that means that although the art/science of profiling took years and years of refining, failure, attempts and effort, our little MP-turned-Navy Seal-turned Sherlock Holmes-turned Clarice Starling has the same investigative abilities because of....common sense. He isn't superman, don't make him out to be. By the middle of the book I hated Reacher, hated what happened to character and was legitimately rooting for him to be wrong at every turn.2. Learn the absolute most basic, fundamental information about hypnosis before writing a ham-fisted Manchurian Candidate plot. Ridiculous.3. The \\"just in time\\" ending is preposterous. Like a bad episode of Criminal Minds without the attractive people to look at. If you can't find a way to get Reacher/Harper in the same area as the murder fluidly, then don't do it. Let the murder happen and go about your business. The contrived deus ex machina of Reacher keeping things to himself so no one else can be involved and go check on the victim first is nonsense.Don't buy this book. Really. For the reasons above, and others, it is a weak, contrived book showing how the author's work must suffer when he cranks these out so quickly. Personally, I'm giving Reacher and Child one more shot. Unfortunately, I expect that Reacher learns to fly and becomes omnipotent in the next book changing this from some decent thriller fare to out and out superhero-fantasy."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Twice doing my frequent Amazon purchases I have purchased the same book or cd twice due to possibly? double clicking in error.The refund is not enough to justify the hassle and money to return.Thanks to all the CONSIDERATE reviewers here I avoided another double."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I read a lot, and some fraction of what I read is junk, but this book goes way past my junk tolerance level. Jack Reacher, the central character, is a mere cartoon. Some of the blurbs in the paperback edition compared Reacher to Dave Robicheaux or Spenser or Travis McGee, but each of these guys has a real, complex personality. Reacher just never comes alive. And it's hard to see how he could. He inhabits a book devoid of a single believable situation or person. It's an action comic for ten-year-olds, translated to prose."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help someone.This book revolves around Reacher being forced to help out the FBI to solve a pattern of gruesome murders. The serial killer seems to be 2 steps ahead of Reacher and the FBI, a very well planned out antagonist.I loved the way the story unravels; the evidence comes together without spoiling the ending and with plausibility. The only issue that I had was that the ending seemed a little rushed. The question throughout the book was how is the killer doing it, and at the very end the reader is told how in a very unsatisfying way. The how was very implausible and kind of a copout; seemed a little rushed.Worth reading, especially if you are a Jack Reacher fan, but not the book I would recommend for newcomers to the series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love the Jack Reacher stories. I've read six or eight so far, and I'll keep reading them, but this one just didn't do it for me. As some others have said, it stated unravelling at about the halfway mark. I stopped believing in the characters or even caring what happened to them. Child's writing is always good, but the structure, characterizations and some of the action scenes just failed to come together, and stretched believability. I'm probably wrong, but it felt as though Child made some assumptions about his readers' going anywhere he lead them, believing anything just because his fans are loyal and he's built such strong stories before...resting on his laurels, I guess is a way of saying it. He didn't seem to try that hard in the last half."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"...meaning that in \\"Running Blind\\", Lee Child's stoic vigilante, Jack Reacher, slides a notch below Genghis Khan on the scale of body-count and mayhem. In \\"Running Blind\\", Reacher actually strings together more than two consecutive sentences, expresses conflicting emotions, and considers - ever briefly - \\"settling down\\". Yikes! Next we'll hear than Howard Dean is voting for \\"W\\". This is Child's fourth Reacher installment and, while definitely not his best, is still another fine example of Child's lean, unadorned prose, sticking close to the plot and keeping the reader in suspense. In a plot somewhat less believable than most we've come to expect from Child, Reacher is drawn into a series of bizarre murders of women all that've had a connection to Reacher. Most engaging is the manner in which these women died - no one can find a cause. The mystery involving the murders keeps the reader guessing to the end that, if a bit far-fetched, is certainly clever. If you're a Lee Child fan, you'll want to read \\"Running Blind\\". But if you've not yet been exposed to this fine writer of popular mystery/thrillers, I'd recommend becoming a fan first: start with \\"Tripwire\\", Killing Floor\\", or, my favorite, \\"Persuader\\"."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was a great read ,Kept me guessing till the very end , another holiday another great book . cant wait for the new one in sept"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I really love the Reacher series.

You know your going to get a brilliantly constructed thriller, the quality of which is guaranteed, and you can just sit back and enjoy the ride. Reacher never disappoints and I love the way that no matter how busy he is or tired he is from running down the bad guys, he always manages to squeeze in a little time for the ladies...a truly lovable rouge."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"With this Reacher adventure I had to \\"suspend belief\\" several times, especially relating to the way the victims died. It just made no sense. It was fast paced and there were interesting twists, but it was fairly easy to unravel. Some of the irritating staccato dialogue was eliminated which is fine with me, but the book was still peppered with phrasing that no one in America would use. In general I enjoy the Reacher novels, but IMHO Lee Child needs to give Reacher a backpack with a change of clothes and a stick of deodorant. Female readers want to think of Reacher as a tough, sexy guy, but a week without a change of boxers gets in the way. Really!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Running Blind by Lee Child is another of the Jack Reacher series and pretty much what I have come to expect from any of them, which is tightly written, excellent murder mysteries. I have to admit that though in this one all the clues were there, the guilty character seemed just too obvious and I missed all of them! There is one other benefit to reading Reacher stories I'd like to mention. I am a poor traveler and generally expect the worst and over prepare and over pack. There's a lot of travel in this story and I read it just before leaving on a trip to cross the country myself. I was surprised that I not only packed much less for the trip, but did not suffer the usual anxieties either. Nothing bad ever happens on my trips and nothing happened on this one. The difference was I didn't spend so much time waiting for the sky to fall. I had my trusty toothbrush and was ready to take on the world."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"RUNNING BLIND is not your typical Jack Reacher adventure. For one, Reacher only injures, threatens, kills a handful of people. Secondly, there is actually a semblance of a plot. The killer is painfully obvious, but the side characters are excellent. One of the better books in the series."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Jack Reacher is my very favourite tough guy characters. I have all of Lee Childs Reacher books on my Amazon Kindle {whichby the way I couldnt do without} the Reacher character is really different, his own person, so to speak. I recomend these books to anyone!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I am working through the Reacher books from oldest the newest. I did stop and read The Enemy as that takes place before The Killing floor. I am enjoying these books more in audio book format than reading. I will agree with most of the positive reviews of this books so I am going to focus more on what bothered me. First of all his relationship with Jodi. It's hard to tell if it is \\"fall\\" right after he is shot in June in Tripwire or if a whole year has gone by. But Jodi didn't seem to mind Reacher's living by his own rules in Tripwire. In fact, she seemed to be impressed by the way he handled the thugs who were ripping off deceased soldier's parents. She didn't complain when he kept the car either. And when he saved her life and took the bullet for her she didn't seem to mind that. But all of the sudden she changes. Everything that represents who Reacher is now bothers her. Yet she loves him. That doesn't make sense to me. But suddenly what bothers her is his living by his own set of rules. But in Tripwire that didn't bother her at all. Secondly, the fact that Jodi got so upset with Reacher when he stopped calling her, yet she left for London merely hours after he left NY for Quantico. At no point does she tell him she might be going to London. So a trip to London comes up in a matter of hours, she leaves and she is bothered that he stopped calling her? Thirdly, the relationship with the FBI. It is not too long ago when he is working with the head of the FBI to save the Cheif of Staff's daughter and then we are to accept they now suspect him of being a murderer and they threaten him and Jodi? That really makes no sense at all. I think, honestly that is the biggest flaw in the book. I don't like the direction Child's took Reacher and Jodi's relationship. I understand Reacher's struggles but Child's treated this as Jodi's issue not Reacher's issue. And suddenly the love of her life is not that important to her. I am only on book four and have many more to go. I get that he is going to get involved with other women but if Child's is going to make this relationship in Tripwire remotely realistic he will bring Jodi back in future books. Hopefully in Reacher's self discovery and reflection Child's will reach out and bring back Reacher's memories of Jodi rather than just passing her off like another fling that lasted two books rather than one. I also hope in future books Child's (or his editor) pays attention to what he wrote in previous books. When you read them in sucession you pick up on the inconsistencies more and these inconsistencies can completely ruin the story."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Although I enjoyed the book, the killer's method revealed at the end was implausible to me. All through the book, Lee Childs gave clues and passages indicating that the victims were somewhat willing participants. I was expecting some mass suicide pact or that the killer might have some hostage or threat that would make the victims follow instructions. (I can't get around it. SPOILER WARNING!). I cannot believe anyone would ever commit suicide (with full knowledge that they would die) under hypnosis.Also, the military reverend was a cheap trick to make the reader doubt the obvious conclusion about the identity of the killer. The character played no other role in the book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child has written seven novels about Jack Reacher, a former military cop with formidable combat skills. The strength of the Reacher novels is the plotting; Child is excellent at throwing red herrings and plot reversals in to keep the reader off-guard. The results are usually effective thrillers, with plenty of action.Running Blind fails as a thriller. All of the Reacher novels, indeed just about every thriller, have inconsistencies, coincidences, or illogical behavior by the characters. In effective thrillers, the force of the plot pushes the action at such a pace that the reader doesn't care about these problems. After all, no one readers a thriller for realism. Here, Child's plot has women who were sexually harassed being killed under bizarre circumstances, with no obvious cause of death, and without the killer leaving a trace of how the crime was committed. Enough clues are given that most readers will realize who the killer is and how the killer pulls it off half way through the book. And the means used to pull it off would not be believed in a comic book. The sheer impossibility was so great that once I realized what the answer was, I skipped to the end of the book to confirm my belief, and then gave up on it. Child painted himself in a corner with this book that he had to rely on something that might have been used in the B movies of the thirties, but is ridiculous today. I suggest skipping this book and going with the rest of the series. Certainly, any one who has not read the other Reacher books should avoid this one -- they may be so put off by the absurd ending that they will not read the others and thus miss some great thrillers."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Gripping and Exciting, a book you will not be able to put down. This is definately one of the best books in the Jack Reacher series yet! If you loved Lee Child's previous 3 Reacher novels, you will definately love this one. In this fourth book of the series Reacher is cohersed by the FBI into helping them track down a serial killer who is killing women around the USA and then placing their bodies in bath tubs filled with olive green army paint. At first a suspect and then a consultant, Reacher reluctantly aids them in their search. This book has it all... an interesting story line, great characters and plenty of plot twists and turns. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This is my third of the Jack Reacher series, after Die Trying and Tripwire (have not read Killing Floor). Reacher is an interesting and likeable but highly flawed and frustrating character. Flawed not in the sense of human flaws, which always makes characters richer, but because the author--Lee Childs--has handicapped his own creation. We are told that Reacher, a former Army MP, is highly intelligent, magnificently large, strong and intimidating, a crack shot, an experienced and skillful investigator, and a creative, intuitive thinker; he is also an Army major who has mustered out and -- no other word for it --deteriorated into a bum. In Die Trying, Reacher explains that he lived his whole life on foreign bases and is traveling around the U.S. getting to know his own country; by Running Blind, he has no such excuse; he has simply become Willie Nelson--on the road again. No rhyme or reason for his restlessness and certainly no excuse for his reluctance to own anything, even an ID card or a comb. Any rational, intelligent, sensible man, no matter how relucant to be \\"anchored,\\" should be willing to carry something besides a clip-on toothbrush--a small bag containing clean underwear, an extra pair of jeans and a shirt or two is not a major hindrance to traveling light. And not carrying ID is just plain idiotic. Childs, in order to make his character iconoclastic and therefore more intriguing to readers, has made him seem almost simple, immature, unreasonable, and ultimately, unbelievable, especially when there is no convincing reason for it, and considering Reacher's repeated assertion that he is \\"always happy.\\" In Running Blind, I became very impatient with Reacher's stubborn refusal to assimilate even to the point of asking for and wearing clean clothes. I can't believe that anyone who grew up under military strictures as Reacher did--it's all he's ever known--could possibly be comfortable looking as disreputable as Reacher must look, wearing the same clothes--not to mention the same underwear!--for days at a time, and to appear finally, at a party important to someone he loves, in the same clothes, now smeared with paint! His lifestyle gives the Army and his army training a bad name and looks not so much like characteristics of a different kind of man as of an author's manipulation of the reader. I'm equally disappointed in Childs' unconscionable disruption of the one longstanding, terribly important relationship in Reacher's life, done for no other reason than to put him \\"out there\\" so that he can get involved in other cases, other bad guys, and, of course, other women. My quarrel with the character of Reacher aside, I can't help liking him and I find Child's writing imminently readable. Although I knew the identity of the villains in both Tripwire and Running Blind long before Mr. Reacher explained things to us, and although Childs failed to make clear the identify of the colonel who was reading and marking the list in RB--was that the padre colonel?--he manages to maintain good narrative flow and suspense. Still, I keep thinking of how the great Donald Hamilton would have handled this character. Childs should take a page (no pun intended) out of Hamilton's best writing and allow Reacher growth and change and maturity before he becomes ridiculous to the point of absurdity and wears out his welcome both in our towns and on our reading lists!"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"What book is &quot;The Visitor&quot; from Lee Child? Looks like &quot;Runnig Blind&quot;. Under different titles same books??"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This was my first Jack Reacher book, and I think Lee Child's series is worth checking out, so I'll probably read the other three. I like Jack. He's a tough, no-nonense guy and you never know what he's thinking. He almost appears bigger than life, but the rest of his character is so understated that it seems to work. This thriller certainly has a different twist to it than most, but I must admit I figured it out about halfway through. That didn't detract from the story though because it moves fairly quickly and I wanted the time to get to know Jack. I too was a bit disappointed with the ending. I think it could have been done a bit better and not just left flat. The book would then rate a 5 in my opinion. Even though you could see the ending about halfway through, I thought the book interesting enough to finish. The paint thing was a bit \\"over the top\\" though. I enjoyed the previous three in the series more than this one, but I'm sure the next will be good again."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I made a mental note within the first 90 pages of this book &quot;I bet I know who did it and how&quot;. I was right. I did enjoy the book, but thinking I knew the person and the method (and being right) made it a lot less of a read. This is my first &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; book, I did enjoy it enough to try the other two.One thing about reading a series about the same person is that you are familiar with their home, job, and city. Looks like with the Reacher books you can't count on any of those being the same."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I don't know much about the military or the FBI, but whoever is teaching Lee Child psychology needs to be reprimanded. I'm not a total expert in that, either, just a BA, but anybody who's had a year or two of psych knows that that is NOT how hypnosis works. I'm afraid that completely ruined this book for me. I read it through, but since I already knew who the bad guy was (in what was surely the most telegraphed foreshadowing I've ever seen), and I knew the manner of killing was completely unrealistic, it was hard for me to get into it. Thrillers are cool because they *could* be true -- there was just no way this premise could be true, that's all.I don't ask much out of thrillers. Consistency and coherence and some modicum of real-world fact -- that's all I want."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"with the reviewer who wrote \\"Did I miss something. Two books ago, Jack saves an FBI agent who just happens to be the daughter of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and grand daughter to the President.

What world does the author live in, in the real world one call to the agent he saved would have heads rolling...\\"Reading \\"Die Trying\\" (the book referenced above) ruined this book for me.

A series of vitims fall foul of an unknown murderer. The killer's victims have only one thing in common--all of them brought sexual harassment charges against their military superiors and all resigned from the army after winning their cases. The manner, if not the cause, of their deaths is gruesomely the same: they died in their own bathtubs, covered in gallons of camouflage paint, but they didn't drown and they weren't shot, strangled, poisoned, or attacked. Even the FBI forensic specialists can't figure out why they seem to have gone willingly to their mysterious deaths. Reacher isn't sure whether the killings are an elaborate cover-up for corruption involving stolen military hardware or the work of a maniac who's smart enough to leave absolutely no clues behind. This compelling, iconic antihero dead-ends in a lot of alleys before he finally figures it out, but every one is worth exploring and the suspense doesn't let up for a second. The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader, and as Reacher strides off into the sunset, you'll wonder what's in store for him in his next adventure.

The problem is the mile-wide STUPIDITY plot potholes i fall into on EVERY book in the Jack Reacher series! Case in point: Reacher and Harper drive 6 hours to meet with Scimeca because she has a \\"item of interest\\" (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the book) in her house that they are looking for... one that logically would still have it's shipping label and thereby take them further in their hunt then they've been able to go so far. They find out that Scimeca had a roommate that took the label and they don't ask for her name, they don't call her from the room and ask Scimeca every detail about her they can.... THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LEAD UP AT ALL.... THEY JUST GIVE UP AND SAY \\"OH WELL, DARN, BACK TO QUANTICO.\\" That is completely illogical, and more to the point, NOT standard OP for these investigators. This type of author interference beyond the logical, just to sustain his plot eslewhere is EXTREMELY frustrating and almost makes the WHOLE BOOK fall apart. And it happens several times thru every book I've read so far. If they don't follow up on SO GLARING A TRAIL, then you have to tell the reader WHY and it has to be LOGICAL and REASONABLE. Not just blank and not there! WHY, WHY, WHY is your editor allowing you to get away with this! F-R-U-S-T-R-A-T-I-N-G and FIXABLE! These books are still worth the read, I mean, you had me at page 3 of your first book, Killing Floor, with \\"I wasn't going to lie on the floor. Not for these country boys. Not if they brought along their whole police department with howitzers.\\" The main character, Reacher, is highly intelligent and methodical, besides being a wandering gypsie, so when he lapses into these periods of illogical stupidity it really frustrates me, the reader, and pulls me right out of the story and instead of being engaged in the plot, i'm yelling at the author for leaving me right in the middle of an intelligent lead and closing in on it, and then just giving up for no reason, when it wasn't necessary."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"We have enjoyed listening to the Reacher series on unabridged audioboks. This one was on cassette tapes and they sounded like a distant echo chamber with muffled narration. In addition the story line was fluffed out with the meat being less than 40% of the time.

Lee Child never fails at intriguing and entertaining the reader from the first to the last word."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I love the character of Jack Reacher. So, like others I am reading through the series. Killing Floor was a great introduction to Reacher. I was disappointed after reading Die Trying and Tripwire. Those books were just boring in comparison to Killing Floor. All of the Reacher novels have action and suspense, but in Running Blind you actually get a more complex mystery than in novels two and three.Sure the blackmailing by the FBI is far-fetched, but this is fiction, right? If you overlook the unrealistic aspects of the book, then you will not be disappointed by the plot itself.On a side note, isn't it odd that Reacher being the genius that he is can outsmart anyone he faces. Yet, he is terrified of owning a large wardrobe because he can't figure out how to do laundry. Huh? That was actually in one of the previous books, but it just stuck with me."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child writes American fiction with English diction. His style is lithe and flexible. I found his book engaging and engrossing and very annoying.I wanted to write him a disgruntled email asking him why he took me out of my pleasant suspension of disbelief by making me ask questions that the book had no answer to. Why does his character take only a toothbrush and have no clothes to change into? Why does he concentrate in minute and loving detail on Lisa Harper's clothes changes and forget that his hero is equally human and in need of clean clothes? Surely a hero who takes two showers in an eight hour period has some notions of human hygiene.Lee Childs notably has no long and gushing list of thanks and praise for everyone from his turtle to his manicurist, and I presume he has no editor either. I suggest he hires one."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"This book contains things that are unique, exciting, and amazing."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Lee Child's previous books were all rated a perfect 10, which made rating this one difficult: it was even better! You just can't be disappointed in reading the ongoing travail of Jack Reacher. Child's talent is developing with each book, and he now takes his place with the spellbinding authors of today.I don't like to give away the plot of any books I review, but please do yourself a favor, and read this. But make sure you have time when you start, because you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I loved this book. It started out kind of slow and I didn't think I was going to care for it, but it picked up speed. For those of you who are real &quot;sleuths&quot; you will figure out the killer fairly early on, but there are enough twists and turns for everybody to enjoy. Jack Reacher is a &quot;real&quot; guy with foibles and all! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"I enjoyed the book. It is an exciting and intriguing twist on the serial killer genre, though I think the book went on a little too long. Perhaps that's because I figured out who the killer was fairly early in the book, and because there was no real investigating going on until late in the book.I do agree with the readers who find Child's portrayal of the FBI less than credible. I'm perfectly willing to accept that there are some corrupt agents, but could the entire agency really be this stupid? Nothing they do makes any sense. If they really thought ... was the killer, they wouldn't hire him as a consultant. If they want him as a consultant, why don't they listen to anything he says? Why not just ask him to help (for a modest stipend?) why threaten his girlfriend?"},{"Title":"Running Blind","review":"Up until &quot;Running Blind&quot; I thought that Lee Childs' books were the best thing to happen in the genre since the death of Alistair Maclean. I read this one in a single day and was intrigued until the last 4 chapters. I kept hoping that Childs' untracable &quot;murder weapon&quot; would turn out to be something original and clever. Instead it is based on an old myth that holds no truth, no I will not give it away, but expect to be disappointed. I wish that Childs' had done a little more research since his whole premise is based on something that research has showed to be impossible. The writing and the characters are so clever and interesting that to be honest I feel cheated. I feel like I have read an Agatha Christie novel all the way through, only to be told at the end...&quot;The butler did it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five Beds for Bitsy (start-Right elf)","review":"This was one of my favorite childhood books. No, it's no longer the right thing to do to buy a child a puppy as a birthday present, but barring that out of date idea, the book is a timeless classic. It's one children enjoy having read to them again and again. I'll always remember Bitsy's beds. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spoken Italian (Spoken Language Series)","review":"This book is excellent, but severley dated. It is one of a series done for the U.S. government during The Second World War, when the best linguists of the day were hired to produce courses that would teach foreign languages to soldiers fast. This is the same methodology now used by the Foreign Service Institute to teach languages to U.S. diplomats.Many courses since The War have been produced that use this methodology with updated content, and most students will find them more congenial. See &quot;Ultimate Italian&quot; for an example."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Well, I read it but it was tough to finish. John Culbertson certainly admires the 5th Marine snipers but they weren't the saviors that he makes them out to be."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culbertson is my late mother's brother. He is one of the most remarkable outdoorsman I have ever known. More like a big brother to me than an uncle, the two of us walked many trails after his return from Vietnam. When my parents divorced, he took me under his wing, teaching me most of what I know about guns and nature. We chased grizzlies in British Columbia, mule deer in Colorado, quail in Oklahoma. In a lifetime working with hunters and riflemen, I have never seen a better shot. In my youth, all my pals and I thought John was ten feet tall. Looking back, I realize we felt that way because he really was larger than life.Some reviewers may question his skill or knowledge, but I know from personal experience he could move through the woods like a ghost and strike like lightning with a rifle, handgun or bow. And like a ghost, he was haunted...by Vietnam. He didn't talk a lot about it, but enough for me to know forty years later his books ring true.If you want to read about Vietnam by someone who was there, not a ghost writer or press agent's version of a hero, I recommend John Culbertson's books. The real deal.Dr. J. R. Satterfield Jr."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"The author mainly describes a SITREP in a particular area of I Corps. Very little is written about snipers other than complaining the snipers had very little to do at no fault of their own. The author also seems to want the reader to know about his resentments such as Jayne Mansfield coming in-country to visit the Marines and soon after getting killed in a car accident after she returned to the States. His point being that an aging Jayne Mansfield got more press than young Marines dying in Vietnam, which is flat-out untrue. This is just one example where the author swerves off topic only to proclaim this sort of subjective matter. Also, it appears the book is written by two authors. The writing style changes midway in the book. His mentor, Sgt. Casey, a drop-out from the Citadel, is over dramatized and worshiped with such descriptions as a scene from Platoon with Sgt. Elias looking up at the stars. This book is non-fiction, fiction, a journal, dairy, and movie script rolled up into one. It would have been better suited as a series in Soldier of Fortune magazine rather than a published book that ended up in a public library. I actually spent money to read this book. I wish I had got a copy through the inter-library loan service instead. It has about as much value as an enemy body count report in Vietnam."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"This book seemed to me to be a platform to fire off complaints and accusations at other more famous snipers in Vietnam than anything else. I understand that there were other snipers served in Vietnam, just tell the story and leave it at that. Don't make your story your personal soap box against the government and Carlos Hathcock. There was some good story in here, that is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. I don't reccomend this one."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"The book is poorly written and edited. He never does get the name of the Viet Cong sniper rifle spelled right. The author without mentioning any names calls into question the actions of late Gunnery Sgt. Carlos N. Hathcock II. I wonder why he doesn't write another book calling into question the actions of Sgt. Alvin York or Lt. Audie Murphy. If you want to read a good book skip this one. I was let down by this one."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I purchased this book hoping to get a detailed look at the legendary Marine snipers in Vietnam, and how they fought. And while Culbertson does well to honor the comrades he fought with, I found this book more of a recruiting pitch for the Corps, rather than a historical account. Even more annoying was Culbertson's attempts to revise military history... telling us how the Marine's won WWI for the French, or how Hanoi could have fallen if we'd just sent in an airborne division and a Marine Assault Force.When the author manages to stick to the subject, we get to see Culbertson's ample knowledge of firearms, sniper tactics and the conditions these men fought in. But unfortunately for readers, we have to wade through pages of jingoistic and Christo-righteous tangents to find it."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Have to agree some of the others reviews, this is a poor example of writing. The haphazard fashion in which the stories are presented destroys any continuity for the reader. I found many of the extraneous details included add nothing to the story and are distracting. The author slips back and forth between a third person narative and first hand narative which at times degrades into rambling personal rants with no point and even less substantiation. My older brother is a jar head from the same era, he too suffers a pervasive bitterness resulting from his stint. They say they are proud to have served but seem mentally and emotionally wounded. I wanted to love the book, but the author made that impossible.June 20, On rereading the reviews for this book I can't help but think the two &quot;A Readers&quot; reviews are written by the same person. They seem awfully defensive of a book they are merely reviewing, overly concerned with the other reviews, and the only ones that see truth as the major asset of this book. Where does the author live now?"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it would give me either:a) a personal glimpse into the world of the Marine Sniperb) a report of stories and circumstances of the Marine Sniper from an objective source.The book offered neither of these. It appears Culbertson is writing from the perspective of one who was there, but had little involvement. He speaks at the beginning of the book, of a get together with some of his sniper buddies many years after the war. One gets the impression this book was written as a result of this get together. I would like so much to have read about the authors experiences rather than much of the politicialy commentary and Marine propaganda that the book expounds upon. The book really taught me nothing about what these men went through. It represents the vague recollections of the author's and other experiences. Not enough meat in it for my liking."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Extreamly disappointing. I have read several other books on snipers and I would recommend all before you read this one. He rambles on and on with details about broader subjects than the sniper action. Very little about sniper activity. He does set up the way that snipers were used in war, but very little story about the actual action that snipers were involved in. Read any book about Carlos Hathcock and you will enjoy those 100% more. I will read no more books by Culbertson as his writing style is booring. Seems as though he is telling the story to a well informed high ranking officer who is interested in all the division names and who reported to who. Was hard to follow."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"'13 cent killers' suffers from too many repetitions, from chapter to chapter and even on the same page - even the explanation of the title's meaning is repeated. Why? All this - filler - seriously takes away from the reading experience. This is sad because the narrative is excellent and all business when it comes to the details of various missions and the task of being a sniper in Vietnam. However, many other details are probably aimed at other Marines and offer little meaning for other readers. The final disappointment appears when you flip through the 12-page glossary and conclude that it carries no entry for the M-16 assault rifle."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I read this book as background on military sniping but it ended up being a great book on Viet Nam from a grunt's point of view. It does not have much good to say about our political leadership but it does pay fair tribute to the Viet Cong fighter and the marines."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culbertson never served as a sniper in Viet Nam in my opinion, He went to division sniper school and came back to H 2/5 and was in my Platoon untill he left Nam. I can not recall ever using him as a sniper! His purple hearts was also under suspicious circumstances. I was with 3rd Platoon H 2/5 from Jan 1967 untill Feb 1968 and as a leader I can tell you that PFC Culbertson was never entitiled to as much personal info as he indicates!!"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I've highly recommend this book! After having the privilege of speaking to real scout/snipers and numerous Vietnam veterans, this book is very accurate. I thought also that John Culbertson did a great job in setting the background for each of the main characters too. While reading, I could feel and imagine being in the jungle, feeling the heat, humidity and pressures. If you want to read a book about what is was like in the delta and the world of scout/snipers, I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I've known this author for 20 years and have hunted with him numerous times. John's a true warrior and an American patriot who fulfilled his duty to God and country during the Vietnam war. His knowledge of firearms and proficiency with same have amazed me on numerous occasions. If his only fault is being opinionated as to questionable facts, then let there be more like him. I, too. am a combat veteran of the VN war, and I saw my share of fighting. I've read most of the sniper books on the market and find a number of the stories therein somewhat difficult to except as 100% factual. In 13 Cent Killers, the author points out that a number of these claims defy probability. Dossn't mean they are false, doesn't mean they are true. But it does question the likelihood of factuality. No one can ascertain the truthful rendition of an event but the person or persons who were there. Many of the events that Culbertson describes are verified by only one or two witnesses. Many veterans question the Hathcock story about keeping and NVA company pinned down for days while killing 70 of them. How could a pair of snipers carry off this feat? How do two men keep an enemy unit in place through the hours of darkness? Who confirmed the kills? Why did enemy reinforcements not arrive on the scene? Why did the NVA not attempt a mass exit? Two snipers can't put enough rounds downrange to pin down an entire NVA company for days. Any veteran who has fought the NVA should know this. Christ, were these guys supermen requiring no sleep or sustenance? Did it not affect their ability to hit their targets? And did the enemy just lay there and take it the entire time? Highly doubtful. You have the right to criticize the author's book if you didn't enjoy it, but don't cut down the man for challenging something so highly unlikely. It's easy to create a legend, but it should always be based on proven facts. No one questions the fact that Hathcock was badly injured saving his comrades on the burning APC, but some of the other claims are beyond the pall."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"For this one book I wish there was a rating below 1-star! Yes it is THAT bad.After 8 years I no longer remember at what page I stopped reading. But for all of the various reasons listed in the other 1-star reviews. Mainly lack of proper editing, and especially Mr. Culbertson's attempt to add a further shine to the tales of himself and his buddies (factual though those might have been) through unsupportable, nay hateful and ignorant denigration of a well known, and well respected personality in the field about which he claims to be writing. Not only made me stop reading but so disgusted me that I could no longer stand to have his previous works about his Vietnam experience (which had lead me to purchase 13 Cent killers in the first place) on my bookshelf.As the title of this review states, I wish I had the money and time I spent reading all three books back. Further than that, the words that properly describe my views on \\"13 cent killers\\" in particular would not be appropriate for a venue such as this.To Mr. Culbertson, what you wrote of yourself, your friends, and your combined personal experiences may have been truthful. But just because none of you were witness to something and possibly found it hard to believe that it was done, does NOT make it untruthful. The attacks, both in the book and in this review area, against Hathcock (by name or not) and those who researched and documented him, deprive the rest of your own works and words of the credibility they may well deserve."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Unbelievable! Someone (Culbertson) has finally written the true story of what being a Marine Sniper was all about. The camaraderie and dedication of these men jumps off the pages as if you were there with them. Sgt Casey must have been the type man that has made the Marine Corps special. Cudos to Mr. Culbertson and the men of the 5th Marine Sniper Platoon. I look forward with great anticipation to the follow-on book about their experiences during the larger battles described by Culbertson."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Here we have yet another book by Culbertson. It's poorly written, has a tendency to jump around, and is, basically, a biography of this man's lover, Tom Casey. It's sad, really, how much this author tries to make a martyr out of Casey. As a sniper in the U.S. Army, I've read just about every book about snipers, and this book, along with SHOOTER by Jack Coughlin are by far the worst written. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culbertson has lifted the mystic of the sniper and has shown us the reality. The vast majority of snipers in the Marine Corps traveled with infantry companies, not as single \\"hunter killers\\". The sniper is and has always been a vital weapon in the Corps arsenal, since 1775 Marine sharpshooters have lived by the well placed shot.The snipers of the Fifth Marine Regiment in Vietnam were the best around, I know I worked with them on every operation I was on. This book should be on the Commandants required reading list for all Marines."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"While I am glad to see another book about the 5th Marines in Vietnam, the saying goes, if you don't grab a reader within the first few pages...well, they tend to quit reading or throw the dang thing against a wall. As painful as the ordeal was, I actually read it and my opinion remained unchanged to the bitter end. I mean no dishonor to the valiant Marine snipers the author writes about. Every single Marine Sniper who served in Vietnam is a hero to me--not just the infamous Carlos Hathcock. Sadly, the author's writing disability gets in the way of the stories he recounts. To me, 13-Cent Killers pales in comparison to earlier books by some of the Marine Corps finest--other true heroes, including the author himself."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I seldom write reviews, but this book cries out for it. The actual \\"13 cent killer\\" part is ok, except the author repeats himself throughout the book. But the book constantly puts in the author's personal opinions about the war and the people running it, and he makes potentially libelous remarks ... without citing a shred of evidence to back it up. If he wants to write a political commentary on the Vietnam War, with supporting evidence, a bibliography, etc., more power to him, but defammation unsupported by any cited evidence is inappropriate."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culbertson is in my opinion, a true patriot, and has an excellent way of presenting his stories. I have read his books and especially enjoyed this one as I, quite surprisingly, found my name mentioned as an F-4 pilot! Having always fantasized about how I would have performed as a grunt, rather than a pilot, I can, through the eyes of John, vicariously live the life I've always wondered about. His stories put me there as though I am living the part and appreciate his attention to detail. I sense his accounts are factual, not over dramatized, and leaves me with a real appreciation of not having had to experience the ordeals he and so many of his comrades had to endure. I highly recommend this as well as any other books or articles John has written. A job well done!!"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"This Book is a no-nonsense story of what it was like to be a scout\\\\sniper in the 5th Marines in 1967-68. The Author was there and gives the Reader the feeling of being there too. The Book also attempts to dispel some of the outrageous myths and stories about Snipers in the Nam. Every War has both its authentic Heroes and its phony Legends. Vietnam was no different. This book has a lot of Truth in it and if that is what you are looking for it is a must read. I would have given it 5 stars if the writing had been better. The run-on sentences and the skipping around in the story line took away from the overall rating of the book."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Culbertsons book is a military club best seller because it shines the light of truth on much of the exaggerations and out right lies that have come out of the vietnam war. When Culbertson speaks of himself in combat action with the rest of his fifth marine buddys he is using a writing technique called a &quot;flashback&quot; . many combat veterans see past events like a movie where they view themselves merely as a participant. The reason many of the stories in the book seem disjointed is because each sniper team operated with different units in different places during the same time period. This is the most technically accurate portrayal of the Fifth marines in Vietnam that exists. This book also contains the names of operations , list of snipers, and battles that were led by specific officers . Check out the usmc history annals on these events and you too may learn the truth about Vietnam."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"This discussion is an attempt to clear up the misunderstandings and lack of knowledge about USMC sniping in Vietnam. Many people have complained that 13 Cent Killers does not accurately portray sniping as it actually took place in Vietnam. First of all, Gunnery Sgt. Vernon D. Mitchell USMC was the commander of the First Marine Division Scout Sniper School during the Vietnam war. The school was located at Happy Valley near the Seabees rock quarry in Da Nang. The First Marine Division sniper school was never located on Hill 55. Furthermore, Capt. Jim Land was not the commander of the divisional sniper school, Gunny Mitchell held that position. Carlos Hathcock was not an instructor at the First Marine Division Scout Sniper School in Vietnam. I list 40 plus Matines who attended the First Division Scout Sniper school under Gunny Mitchell. Not one of those Marines ever met or saw CArlos Hathcock or Jim Land for that matter serve as a sniper of instructor in Vietnam. Charles Henderson who wrote the book Marine Sniper never served in Vietnam. I have read his fanciful stories of Hathcock's supposed combat feats and I can assure the reader that virtually none of this is true. Carlos Hathcock evidentally distinguished himself at the Quantico base sniper school along with Jim Land after the Vietnam war was over. The real heroes of Vietnam sniping during 1966 and 1967 are presented in the true account of the Vietnam war in 13 Cent Killers. I am sure many people feel that 13 Cent Killers is a slight to Carlos Hathcock since their reviews say that. I can only say that I was there at the First Marine Division Sniper School, I fought on many violent operations with the snipers mentioned, and I know Gunnery Sgt. Mitchell as well as I know my own father and have spent countless hours listening to and documenting his 21 year distinguished Marine Corp career. I cannot in good conscience allow Charles Henderson who never served in Vietnam to besmirch the career of a great war hero and undoubtedly the finest sniper instructor in the history of the Marine Corp. Mitchell's uniforms, certificates, world records and pertinent military documentation are on display at the Oklahoma Historical Museum. I encourage anyone interested in the real facts to check this out.John J. Culbertson"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Several elements of this book require explanation. Why the author switches from the first person to the third after seventy or so pages is but one.For reasons known best to Culbertson, several times throughout his book he calls to question the ability and veracity of Carlos Hathcock, the legendary Marine sniper. Without naming Hathcock, he dismisses out of hand many of Hathcock's accomplishments without providing a single document, official or otherwise, or even quoting the usual unnamed sources. He merely labels it nonfactual. For example, he describes Hathcock's elimination of an enemy company in Elephant Valley as \\"BS\\". It may well be, but before one hopes to undermine a Marine institution like Hathcock, it would serve you well to have some source for the assertion other than your opinion. Lacking even a modicum of evidence in support, other readers may well conclude as I did that Culbertson was engaging in building up his crew by tearing down another. That effort falls flat.I did not finish this book. I abandoned the effort on page 101 when I read these words: \\"The 5th Marines constituted a very exclusive club and operated under a contract signed in hell by the Grim Reaper himself.\\"The story of the 5th Marines Snipers deserves better than this and so does the reader."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I have not read Culbertson's other two books on being a Marine sniper. However, this book does not encourage me to read those other two. Of the 30 pages that I have trudged through, there was a lot of repetition and plugging of Culbertson's other two books. The other reason I did not finish this book was because of the first 30 pages, at least 50% of the time is spent on denigrating other Marine snipers and other Marines who have written books and/or are subjects of other books.Culbertson does not provide proof or reason for his belief that other Marine snipers made false claims of achievement. Culbertson claims that one of the most prominent Marine snipers, Carlos Hatchcock, exagerated about the number of kills he made without citing a source for this claim. Hatchcock is one of the most well known snipers in military history, and a Marine hero. Culbertson should cite his sources if he is going to make claims like this.If you want to read about a personal account of a Marine sniper, I recommend \\"Dead Center: A Marine Sniper's Two Year Odyssey in the Vietnam War\\" by Ed Kugler. If you want to read about Hatchcock, then read \\"Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills\\" by Charles W. Henderson.I would not recommend buying this book. If you really want to read it, find it at a library."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I am not an authority on Vietnam, but I am an avid hunter and competitive rifle shooter. Many of the details in this text are wildly inaccurate and more fitting for a hollywood b-movie than a book that claims to be historical. Just one example is the reference to Vietnamese soldiers being lifted off their feet and thrown backwards through the air by .308 or .30-06 rounds. This claim and many others like it are laughable to anyone who knows anything about firearms. Mr. Culbertson needs to stop watching re-runs of \\"The A-team\\" and research his facts, or else drop the pretense that he is writing history."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"For a book about a deadly business, this one is boring. it switches from place to place, is repititious, and switches from first to 3rd person, for some reason.For some reason, without naming names, he denigates Carlos Hathcock, another Marine sniper, claiming he either did not exist or did not do all that was claimed in the 2 books written about him by Charles Henderson. The Marines thought enough of Hathcock to name a building after him. A Marine Officer I met, who wrote 2 books of his own about his experiences said Hathcock was real and probably did a lot of stuff not in the books.For a extremely interesting book about Marine sniping I recommend Silent Warrior by Charles Henderson"},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culbertson is a novice writer who is so desperate to fill pages that he intentionally tells the same story twice; at the beginning and the middle of the book, because the story \\"bears repeating.\\" He blethers on about hippies, Army Generals, The President, the Military-Industrial complex, college professors, the Army and Navy, REMF's, until he reaches the conclusion that himself and his close associates were the only true patriots in the war. The saddest part is that he has logged on to the Amazon review pages and gave his own book a 5-star review (check it out)."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"As a Vietnam veteran and former Marine, I bought 13-cent Killers after reading Operation Tuscaloosa and expected a fairly good recounting of the operations of the 5th Marines in 1967. But 13-cent Killers is a book in search of an editor. Poorly written, repetitive, and filled with the author's unexplained bitterness, Maggie's Drawers should have been waved at this book before it was published. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"This book falls far short of it's target. While Culbertson was an in-country player and is writing as part of this elite group, his style is very melodramatic and jingolistic. I've had to roll my eyes at John's many attempts to paint the 5th Marine Snipers as yah yah heroistic types and the bad guys as the incarnate of evil.He gives some good info on rifles and ammo but continues to repeat this info throughout the book and I guess he needs to fill white space with this unnecessary additional information.The author comes across as a narrow-minded, stuck in the mud, stereo-typing jarhead. He describes the Vietnamese as sneaky blah blah blah dirty Communists who were more likely trying to rid their country of the Americans as they had with the French, Japanese and Chinese. I find it distasteful to describe the 5th Marine Snipers as killers/murders who fought for the exitement of the hunt. If a human life and the sacrifice these people gave for their country is worth only 13 Cents, then the value of this book is far less. There are better books about those who fought but this is not one of them."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"John Culberson gets lost in grinding his own ax of complaints about everything from the lack of government support of the war, (for which he is DRT, dead right there), to the political pork barrel that resulted in the much inferior M-16 replacing the venerable M-14, (again a valid point). But he spends far too much time repeating military jargon, repetitiously identifying every spot on the Viet Nam map, and using the book as a forum to name countless comrades who fought with him in Nam. The recurring names do nothing for the story except serve to detract. And the cruelest cut of all may be indicative of his poor research when, on page 166, he disparagingly refers to a vist to the troops by Jane Mansfield and describes her as \\"an aging American icon..who had to be in her late forties or early fifties at the time.\\" For your unfortunate information, Mr. Culbertson, Jane Mansfield died in 1967 at the ripe old age of 34 years, 2 months and 10 days, hardly what I would call an \\"aging\\" time. What the book lacks in readership it makes up for in confusion."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book. It was very repetitive. Just simply two peoples accounts of the same incidents. It was only so so. The only thing I found to be of interest, was the mention of the Lake City Army Ammo plant here in Missouri."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I have read this book (13 cent killers) and \\"Marine Sniper\\" many times over and the jealousy I see displayed by Culbertson is almost laughable. I'm surprised he didn't try to say that the story of some \\"unnamed\\" marine(again Hathcock) pulling 7 other Marines out of a burning amtrac and nearly dying from the burns recieved was also a bunch of bs too.I think this book is a joke. Just the title alone \\"13 cent killers\\" is funny. I mean, I thought a sniper wasn't supposed to take pride in being a \\"killer\\"? Anyways, he tells some good stories of the men he served with but, because he himself wasn't famous he knocks down many of the stories told about Hathcock. What's so ironic about that is that even Hathcock himself didn't want these stories out. He just wanted to live the rest of his life in anonymity until he met Henderson. Who might i add, had to work very hard to earn his trust to get those stories out of him at all.Basically, buy this one for the stories if you like to read about Marine snipers in Vietnam but, keep a sharp knife handy so you can cut through the cynicism in this book. It's pretty thick."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I picked up this book expecting to gain additional insight on Viet Nam, and specifically the areas of Chu Lai, Antenna Valley, and Phu Loc that I saw from the mountains and ridgelines while serving with 1st Force Recon. I was so disappointed that I am writing my first review after reading more than 200 novels and histories of the Viet Nam war.My first concern involves the repetitious personal opinion, misinformation on both current politics and pre-1966 VN history, and the unnecessary duplication of individuals, actions and editorilizing repeated in every chapter. As a previous reviewer noted, this appears to be a series of independently written articles that were combined without critical review or even minimal editing. Were Mr. Culbertson's three volumes to be professionally edited, they would easily fit in one volume and the important things he has to impart would not be lost in the high grass of bombastic rhetoric.My second problem is with the inferences concerning then President Johnson's only concern being selling helicopters. The truth was that the Marine Corps preoccupation with 1940's tactics, and our forced dependence on 1950's equipment, frequently contributed to the unnecessary death and disability of literally hundreds of Marines. Only the excellent courage, toughness, and loyalty of individual grunts allowed the resulting high kill ratios, and frequently the bare survival of the units involved. Had the Marine Corps had even a fraction of the air mobile assets of the Army (and the updated tactics), a lot more kids would have made it home while doubling the damage against the enemy. I was saddened that the poorly planned and implemented Operation Tuscaloosa was glorified without being critically evaluated. Yes, those kids stood up and charged directly into a well planned and executed ambush. What was never questioned was why Marine blood was so generously shed to save a situation that they should never had been blindly and overconfidently led into.My final point is that Mr. Culbertson needs to forgive Gunny Hathcock, and others, who did their jobs utilizing different tactics appropriate to and highly effective in different tactical environments. I do not understand his bitterness, but it discredits his own admirable achievements and again detracts from the experiences that he has to relate.Brother, I also am unforgiving of LBJ, traitor Fonda, Strange MacNamera, and all those others who abandoned and betrayed us. Move on. Become as professional a writer as you were a Marine and a sniper. Do not let the lessons you can teach be obscured or discredited by your pain.

Lightweight read, nothing deep. Generally poor writing, on what could have been an interesting and insightful series of events. The author repeats himself a few times and I got the impression the 'book' is a combination of a series of essays, often on the same topics/people/events. The author is in desperate need of a good editor and guidence. A fascinating theme but the result is disappointing. Nothing outstanding and full of the usual American fixations. Lacks historical depth and feels very one-dimensional. Still, it passed the time on the flight, which is all that one can ask of this genre."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I have just completed reading &quot;13 Cent Killers&quot;. I have also read volumes of other so-called &quot;true stories&quot; of Marine snipers feats of virtually inconceivable exploits. &quot;13 Cent Killers&quot; is only one of the few humble books I have had the pleasure of reading. It is not a book written out of arrogance and conceit, but of his &quot;Brothers in arms&quot;, of which this man truely loves.After reading &quot;13 Cent Killers&quot;, I had the great honor of speaking with John Culbertson personally. I found him to be a genuine &quot;down to earth&quot; Marine.This book was written to honor his Brother Marines who had fought at his side, and for the &quot;True Heros&quot; of the war, his fellow Marines that had made the &quot;Ultimate Sacrifice&quot;, for God, Country, and Corps.John Culbertson, Tom Casey with whom I have also spoken with personally, Vernon Mitchell, Billy May, and countless more Marines are truly &quot;The Few The Proud&quot;.

Culbertson, the 5th Marine snipers in Vietnam get to tell their amazing stories from &quot;the bush&quot;. The best part about 13 Cent Killers was the detail that the author provided. Culbertson was very descriptive and did not miss any details as he relived the time that Ron Willoughby and Tom Casey spent fighting in Vietnam. Culbertson describes everything in great detail from the snipers hide, down to exactly what the enemy was wearing as Casey watched them sneak around through his scope. Culbertson makes this book great by providing as much detail as he did.There is one part about this book that could use improvement. I thought that Culbertson could have spent more of the book talking about the fighting and the time that the snipers spent out in the field. Most of this book was spent talking about the newly developed sniper school and how Gunnery Sergeant Vernon D. Mitchell, a veteran sniper who served in World War II and the Korean War. This makes the book a lot more boring than it should be.The theme of this book was war. Even though war was the theme, the snipers still got an uneasy feeling every time that they got an enemy troop in their sights. I guess that the theme of this could also be that in war it is not easy to kill a human. This theme is shown throughout the book. Every time the snipers record a KIA (kill) they are happy but only because they survived. The theme of this book was war.This was one of the best sniper books that I have read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in war or snipers. The Culbertson makes this book so interesting by the way he describes Willoughby and Casey sneaking around the jungles of Vietnam to get the best shot that they could at the enemy. If you like stories about the Vietnam War this is a book that you should defiantly read."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"I bought this book to read about the 5th Marine Snipers during the Vietnam war and their stories (or \\"tales\\" as the book's cover promises). The 256 paperback pages that I read were mainly a diatribe about how anyone involved in the war that wasn't a Marine was average at best, and anyone from the USA who wasn't in Vietnam during the war was a traitor or worse.The stories that I wanted to read about take up less than 20% of the book with the reader having to wade through most chapter beginnings about the author's very biased and narrow political views being repeated again and again.Repetition is the theme of the book due to its poor construction of short stories with points that were not interesting or relevant to me, the reader, turning up constantly (rifles use bullets, got it...\\"match grade blah blah\\" is only interesting once) to where military acronyms are used but not explained in the text or glossary losing context in one of the few interesting bit.While I have no doubt the Vietnam war was a political gambit that failed it was much more complicated that the nave view that the author portrays, and having to have it repeated in most chapters is both boring and annoying. I also wonder whether the author knows that the US lost it.As a non-American reader this political rhetoric is coupled with the macho stereotyping of stupid military school boy descriptions of \\"shoot em up\\" action, makes the book feel more fiction than fact based. It is also very unfortunate as it undermines a bastion of the United States Marines in particular and military in general who do perform very well on a global stage, and are still being flung into political gambits today.A book for that narrow band of like minded lowest common denominator Marines to get enthused about. Not a book that delivers what it promises on the cover, and not to be recommended to anyone else. One has to assume that all of his books are equally repetitive and biased, which is unfortunate as the author had the opportunity with this reader to educate him about the already confusing Vietnam War and didn't."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Johnny Culbertson is my friend. He doesn't claim to be the greatest writer in the world. But he is a fantastic story teller, as he has done here in this book. He lived it at An Hoa. Jumping around was what we did.

BUT, it was kind of hard to understand fully because there was a lot of confusion during the first 5 chapters or so. The rest of the book, however, is very well written and I think I would like to read other books concerning snipers in Vietnam."},{"Title":"13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam","review":"Insofar as he is relating personal stories from other snipers, I have no complaint, nor any way of verifying their accuracy. Sadly, much of the book is filed with repetitious rhetoric about the American Youth of his beloved Marines. The book meanders without a continous timeline and repeats information about the same persons from chapter to chapter, almost as if it had been written as a series of articles for a magazine and had never been edited for book form.At least one anecdote was spurious, to say the least. He reports Jayne Mansfield as being a star from the 1940's and '50's when Mansfield actually came to fame in the late '50's. He says she \\"had to be in her late 40's or early 50's at the time\\" and had fat and wrinkles on her legs, as reported by Sgt. Tom Casey, who spied her through his binoculars. Officially Mansfield was 33 when she died. If Casey saw wrinkles on her legs, it was probably her hosery. USO entertainers lived out of their suitcases and had to use their show clothes over and over without cleaning, drying or pressing. I once followed a USO entertainer around several camps in Korea and will tell you that despite heat and humidity, she wore hose when dancing, and had a pretty ripe odor as well.When any writer uses unsubstantiated hearsay and it is found to be untrue, it puts all his other hearsay in doubt.Once again, a good editor would have called this to his attention."},{"Title":"Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings: Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets","review":"I bought this book anticipating it would give me a better understanding of asherons call 2 and help me find out more about all its functions. This book is mostly filler and pages about different skills and magic mostly fill it. while it did list all the ingredients for crafting which can be useful, it didn't outline where I could find the objects needed (which is the biggest part) for the different crafting receive in the game. The books real downfall is that it was created using the beta world of Asherons call 2, so they really didn't have much time to really Decipher the game. Hopefully the book will be revised. As for the book containing strategies and secrets, there really aren't any that it told about, it does give great info on the basic quest and vaults, but after you hit Level 5+ in the game, its of no use at all. All in all the good things I got with the book, were its great maps and ringway guides, which can really help you out for where you need to go, and some great websites to visit on more detailed stuff about asherons call 2.

This guide runs you through everything from layering your clothing to the type of boots that you should have. It's a comprehensive guide to Winter camping. Sounds great, but that carries some dangerous implications.Winter camping has an additional level of danger in it, due to the inherent climate conditions, so going in unexperienced in clothing layers, boots, and gear is a potentially hazardous undertaking. I would get experienced with backcountry Winter day-trips, and be a pro at 3-season conditions, before taking on Winter camping (even after reading this book).All in all, good book, but it's a little fluffy in the wording, and not very rich in more advanced info (health hazards, altitude+cold issues, tent anchor techniques (in high winds, low winds, soft snow, ice, etc), bad/extreme weather). In other words, if you've never been Winter camping, and you're beginner/intermediate with backcountry Winter explorations, consider that you may be heading into a dangerous situation, without proper experience and only a elementary understanding of the Winter camping environment and the potential hazards that exist."},{"Title":"Winter Camping, 2nd","review":"This guide covered a lot of issues I had concerns with prior to my first hardcore winter packpacking trip.

The size is nice, and the dictionary sections themselves are easy to navigate.As I started to read the introduction, however, it became clear that this dictionary is targeted towards British readers/students rather than American ones. The information boxes discuss \\"differences between German and British life\\" and talk about choosing the correct definition for \\"flat\\" (apartment).Looking up either \\"apartment\\" or \\"flat\\" leads you to \\"die wohnung,\\" but looking up \\"die wohnung\\" only gives the definition \\"flat,\\" with no mention of the American \\"apartment\\". I have already run into this problem with several other words, including \\"petrol\\" (gasoline).If you are familiar with the nuances of the English language, you may not have any trouble with this dictionary. But, you have to know that \\"color\\" is spelled \\"colour\\", \\"inquire\\" is spelled \\"enquire\\", and \\"program\\" is spelled \\"programme\\" when you are searching on the English side of the dictionary.Although I'll be keeping this dictionary, I probably wouldn't buy it again based on what I have discovered.

While there are some fine photos which cover, naturally, the entire 20th century (the subject was born in 1900 and still lives!) their chronology in this book is immensely flawed, as if seemingly by a mixmaster.

The story is superficial, and tells little of historical interest about a woman whose life encompassed the entire 20th century and then some. It is best described as a 'coffee table book'.

If the name doesn't immediately ring several bells, you *have* to study these beautiful and mind-boggling games! There's also considerable biographical material, and a few photos. Unfortunately, this book is not well edited, even by chess book standards. Two glaring examples from the very start of the book: 1) Game #2 includes the annotation &quot;17. Bxe6?! The tempting Bishop sacrifice leads to the win, but should have lost the advantage,&quot; but no variation is given in which the advantage is lost; 2) The &quot;An Appreciation&quot; chapter contains the odd passage &quot;It is the game Flohr-N., USSR ch 21, Kiev 1954... Flohr was in his prime and preparing to play a match with Alekhine...&quot; [Flohr peaked in the 1930s, and Alekhine died in 1946!] Apparently this is based on a misinterpretation of IM Rashid Ziyatdinov's original text (he contributed this introductory chapter).

Moreso that any other player that I have seen, Nezhmetdinov was an attacking player, trying to make it beeline to the opponent's King like a rabid attack dog. It is a testament to Nezhmetdinov's style and competence than he was an early teacher of Mikhail Tal, and defeated many famous Soviet-era GMs over the board.It is unfortunate that Nezhmetdinov was only able to obtain IM status, because after looking at his games it is obvious that he was one of the greatest players of his day; it is sad that the Soviet system hid Nezhmetdinov's light under a bushel.

This book has 24 chapters that are both theoretical and practical. The first three chapters introduce activity-based costing and management and discuss how they work in health care. The benefits of activity based costing versus volume-based costing are identified as: &quot;(1) more accurate costs of services delivered, (2) better discrimination between profitable and unprofitable services and service lines, (3) improved pricing and contracting strategies, (4) improved management decision-making capability, (5) greater ease of determining relevant costs, and (6) reduced nonvalue-added costs. (p. 27) The book gives a detailed step by step procedure for doing a time study. The importance of structural choices such as direct costs to be traced and indirect costs to be allocated is stressed for determining the organization's costing framework. Because ABC provides a mix-and-match menu of costs and their financial and operational interrelationships, it is important for management to determine that the ABM reporting depicts what the organization wants to measure and manage. The book relates quality measures, budgeting, standard setting, benchmarking , Pareto analysis, and clinical pathways to activity-based costing and management. Content is illustrated through case studies about family physicians, primecare, hospitals, home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities, and a school-based health center. The final chapter is about the future for ABC/ABM in health care. There is a glossary and index.

One of the strengths of this volume is that it helps bridge the gap between educational psychology and what happens in classrooms. The book is written for teachers, and as such, it provides a series of exercises they can use with their classes to help students become better learners. The authors have taken into account their audience by providing explanations that teachers can understand. A glossary of terms is also provided at the end of the book. The contents of the book are grounded in recent educational and psychological research. Bandura's social cognitive theory (and the importance of self-efficacy) provides the theoretical framework for the book. The book provides a very useful and succinct introduction to the principles of self-regulation and learning and then goes on to address five key academic skills that underpin academic success. Each of these key academic skills are described and a series of exercises are provided so that they can be developed over a five-week period. I found the description of self-regulation and ideas associated with each of the five key academic skills to be excellent, and I highly recommend the book on this basis. I have not implemented the exercises the authors have provided and I'm not really sure that I would.

He later mentioned that he had written this book for children. I ordered it from Amazon and we gave it to our 4, nearly 5 year old grandson. It seemed to be about right for his age group. He loved it, and we had to read it aloud to him several times. The book has beautiful illustrations, too."},{"Title":"Louie the Buoy a Hurricane Story","review":"What a wonderful and refreshing story for any child, especially any child who has experienced such a scary phenomenon like a hurricane. My 3 year old niece, Eden, loved hearing me read the story while finding all the fishes and such on each page, at the same time witnessing the transformation of Louie the Bouy. She was very proud of herself each time she found him on the next page, altered by appearance but not spirit.I am wondering when Mr. Andry will produce for us his next hurricane story about Katrina for I am quite convinced there must be an adventure to be told therein."},{"Title":"Dirty Deed, A","review":"\\"A Dirty Deed\\" is a great sequel to the first book \\"Across the Steel River\\". I was caught up once again in the lives of the two young boys as they fought to overcome ignorance, prejudice and injustice - and of course, the most powerful, evil man in their hometown. Through scrapes, fights, dog attacks and narrow escapes, the characters learn something about themselves, and the men they want to become. The interaction between the boys is delightful. Their rough and tumble comraderie brought many a smile to my face. There is also a powerful moral lesson to be learned about shame and how it can prevent people from embracing those closest to them. \\"A Dirty Deed\\" is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone, young or old, male or female. The storyline will pull you in until you find you can't put the book down until you finish it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This was the first book I have read by Francesca Lia Block, but definitely not the last. I admit, it was the cover that initially drew me to and encouraged me to buy the book, but once I began reading it, I felt I couldn't stop. The tale of the fiery pixie named Mab and the sullen model named Barbie pulled me in like a tornado, swirling me around and around in a mass of vivid images and descriptions. Block complimented all teenagers by including real-life issues in the book that other teen books leave out because the issues seem &quot;inappropriate.&quot; &quot;I was a Teenage Fairy&quot; told of Barbie's maturization into her own sexuality and the overcoming of cases of sexual abuse.I only have one critism of this book, and that is that the ending was filled with too much &quot;fluff&quot;, as my English teacher would say. There was so much grit in the book, real-life problems and such, but the end wrapped everything up by Barbie formulating this unrealistic strategy to finally get revenge on the pedophile photographer who molested her as a child. It didn't make much sense to me, I guess. A better way to have ended the book could have been to have more of a reconciliation between Barbie and her mother, but I'm not Block, so it's not up to me.Overall though, this book was very entertaining and a worthwhile read. Go out and buy it today"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"First of all, if you have read Francesca Lia Block's other books, don't expect that sort of writing here. Granted, it has the same descriptions of places you would kill to go to, but that's about where the similarities end. This book is more of a gritty Y/A novel than a fantasy, ie Weetzie Bat. It's the story of Barbie, a young girl haunted by her burn-out was-model mother, who wants Barbie to be to be a model so badly, she will go to any lengths to ensure it. So along comes Mab, a pinkie-size fairy with fuschia hair, who is Barbie's best friend, guidance counselor and, on occasion, psychiatrist! She is the best part of a fantastic book. Yes, I liked this book. I loved this book. I will read this book until the end of time!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Barbie's mother always wanted her to be a model, to fulfill the dreams she could never fulfill herself. So it is no real surprise when Barbie ends up at photo shoots, getting head shots done so she will be able to be a famous model. Her mother doesn't seem to realize that Barbie's photographer has molested her. This is the sort of thing that would make a child fall apart completely--but Barbie has Mab to keep her together. Mab is a tiny little fairy, a tempermental, moody little thing who tells Barbie she is a queen. Mab hates Barbie's mother and says all of the things about her Barbie wishes she were strong enough to say.Even when Barbie grows into adulthood, Mab is still there for her. Barbie becomes a famous model and has hurtful relationship after hurtful relationship. Her mother is still running the show. Then Barbie meets a wonderful guy who really seems to like her and want to take care of her. She also meets up with a boy she recognizes from years ago, a boy who was photographed by the same man Barbie was photographed by as a child. The boy seems to have the same pain inside as Barbie has. Can she help him? Can tiny Mab solve everyone's problems?Although these characters went through a great deal, I liked where they were at the end of the story. They seem to have gotten things worked out for themselves, and I had hope for their futures. I loved the descriptions, especially the way the cities were compared to people. I didn't like the leap in the story from Barbie's childhood to her adulthood, with nothing in between. And I found it hard to like a lot of the characters a lot of the time."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I Was A Teenage Fairy by Francesca Lia BlockBlock's unique, trippy poetic prose fills this book about a spunky fairy that helps two teenage models/actors that were molested as children by a photographer. Playing with Peter Pan, the supermodel culture, and fairy folklore (changeling tales, glamour and obsession with physical beauty), she creates a modernist tale that is more about the dreamy writing style than substance. Grade: B"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"\\"I was a teenage fairy\\" is a fantastic book for people who love to read fantasy novels. This book is like a fairy tale, however it was written for teenagers. With Francesca Lia Block's unique writing, her words turn into images. Barbie Marks, the main character in this book, is a lovable teenager who has a mother who was a former model, and wants Barbie to follow her footsteps. Her father, Dr. Markowitz, is a psychiatrist. With all the troubles going on in her life, a mom who pressures her to becoming a model, and a father who rarely speaks with her, Barbie manages through her traumas because of Mab. Mab, a fantastic pinkie-sized fairy sticks by Barbie's side, and helps her become a more outgoing person. As the years go by, Barbie has successfully become fashion model, with Mab still around. Whether Mab was real or not, Barbie always relied on her. As the readers read on, Griffin comes into the picture, and Mab is able to help both Barbie and Griffin with their pain hidden inside of them. Mab is the healer of both Barbie and Griffin, and is able to reach into their soul and heal all the traumatic experiences they've been through. I would definitely recommend this book to whoever loves to read a good fantasy novel, and enjoys Francesca Lia Block's imaginative ideas. With her one-of-a-kind writing, this is a great book for people who are just looking for a book they can read outside of school. It truly is a page-turner, and you won't be able to stop reading it. The greatest thing about this book is that the writer leaves the readers with one question, does Mab really exist, or is she just imaginary?"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is sooo good -- just like EVERYTHING that FLB writes! I wish I had a sassy talking fairy to keep me company, and to help me figure stuff out....Peace!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"this book was awesome, you have to get it!!! being a francesca lia block fan, i am definitely not disappointed :)this book is mainly about barbie, a beautiful and deep girl who loves nature, a model, who always wanted to be a photographer instead, she gets molested by one of her photographer during her early teenage years. she survived through her mum's constantly trying to control her life, her dad abandoning her by meeting a little pixie/faerie/insect (lol)when she's 16, she meets a guy called todd and his friend griffin, that has gone through the same thing as she has, and they both went to the same photographer before.barbie finds courage and live in the end, this is a really beautiful book, and the writing again, is typical francesca lia block's, lyrical, poetic, enthralling. you cannot put this book down! thanks to this book, i practically failed my exams :pa must read for especially block fans!!!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"When I started reading this book, I wasn't completely ready for the look it would give me into Barbie and Griffin's worlds. Essentially, Barbie and Griffin are child models. At first, they both attend the same photographer, and both share the same horrible secret. Around the same time she met Griffin, Barbie met Mab. Mab is a feisty fairy who represents everything Barbie wishes she could be. Jumping forward to five years later, Barbie and Griffin truly meet. Griffin&#65533;s roommate, the gorgeous actor Todd Range, is interested in Barbie, and she wants to love him. As Mab guides both griffin and Barbie through their complicated lives, the truths about them are revealed. Will the two be able to overcome the dreams forced on them by their washed-out parents, or will they continue to live in fear of what the world brings them? Read the book, and find out.I recommend this book to anyone. It's wicked cool, and will definately change the way that people look at child and teenage stars. While reading this, you'll find yourself angry at Barbie's mother, who's trying to change her daughter's dreams and life. And you'll feel the way the Barbie and Griffin do, as they try and stop the man who changed and ruined their lives. As corny as it sounds, you'll laugh, and you'll cry."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I am liking this author a great deal, and think she has some extremely important lessons to teach young adults. She incorporates a number of relevant themes - like love, the notion of beauty, acceptance and homosexuality into her work, but does so in an innovative and interesting manner which reeks of the stylisms of Magic Realism.Her most famous work is undoubtedly the Weetzie Bat series, and I would be inclined to say that these are also her best, along with 'Violet and Claire'.Whilst I find her all her works short and enjoyable, I do not think this particular work is best reflective of her talents, and whilst I would recommend it, 'Dangerous Angels' is probably a better introduction.Whilst the author incorporates the same elements in this work, the characters feel a little undeveloped and the reasonings are not always clear.I must admit, while I like Fransesca's books a great deal, I find her topic matter somewhat repetitive and some of the examples she sets a little unsuitable.The characters are always young, smokers, having sex and the author continously emphasises how thin they are, in this novel clearly equating small size with beauty.If anything, my main criticism is that the author never breaks away from these sterotypes, and it would be nice to see a little evolving on the part of this clearly slinster-cool writer."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I've heard so much of Francesca Lia Block and this is the first book I bought which was written by her. Her writing style is beautiful and unique. Tt makes you want to just go on reading and not stop. &quot;I Was a Teenage Fairy&quot; tells a story about a girl who, with the help of her fairy friend, Mab, explore the wide world out there and overcome obstacles in life.However, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. Block used a lot of &quot;metaphorical&quot; language and it sometimes seemed as if the story line was not clear enough. I didn't quite like the ending because I found it too &quot;rushy&quot;. Everything just ended with a woosh, like when someone talks without pausing to breathe. One thing that bothered me was that there was no specific &quot;ending&quot; to the relationship between Barbie and her mother. Instead, it focused more on the &quot;transformation&quot; of Barbie to Selena Moon. Overall, it's still a good book and will leave you feeling all magical inside."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block in I Was A Teenage Fairy exhibits great suspense and realism throughout the novel. Mab, a fairy, introduces the element of fantasy, which inevitably leaves the reader hanging on to their seats grasping for more. With this fairy, Lia Block uses realism along with fantasy to create a familiar atmosphere. Her tremendous talent to bring out teen realism, makes the reader understand that the problems they are facing are the same all teens are going through. Lia Block can be considered a rebel for exploring the real issues of teens.Perhaps the greatest example of Lia Block's talent is her use of fantasy in a dark world. She express a childhood activity of make-believe in a teenage life. \\" Maybe Mab was real. Maybe she was the fury, the courage, the sex. Whatever Mab had been, now, joined with her tiny winged red-haired biscuit, Mab was the love, flying through night like an errant star that had longed to be know, even briefly, what made planet Earth's children weep and sing.\\" (Pg. 186, I Was A Teenage Fairy) It is through the fairy that the protagonist Barbie Marks can find herself and her true identity in the world. In her fantastic use of description, Lia Block brings the fantasy to life.Hence the fantasy mixed with realism is what gives the story character. Mab, the fantasy, and Barbie the realism, come together to help each other in their journeys of self- discovery and acceptance. \\"Barbie was no longer afraid of anything. It was like that thing Mab had said about belief. The belief is sometimes the biggest part of it all. You can choose to believe in your published book being held in the loving hands of strangers, your name tattooed forever on the heart of the one you adore: you can choose to believe in tiny red-haired pesky piskies- all the things \\"they\\" may tell you not to believe in. But who are they anyway? What do they know? What makes them any more real? And now, Barbie realized , I am telling Mab to believe. I am telling Belief herself to believe.\\" (Pg 179, I Was A Teenage Fairy) They bring out the truth in each other as they begin to understand, who they are is who they are. With this friendship, Lia Block captures the essence of childhood in a teenage world.Furthermore I Was A Teenage Fairy reflects the inner truth of issues all teens are forced to deal with. Parents, money, drugs, alcohol, and sex are clear in the life of a normal teen, however society has chose to ignore what is really going on in hopes that they aren't present. Lia Block helps to clarify to all teens that the problems they are facing, are normal, and that it is ok to hold on to childhood imagination. She has become the light in an otherwise dark life in which some teens live in. They live in embarrassment and fear as the feel they are alone in the choices they make. Through this novel the reader is shown that the greatest asset of life is the uniqueness of your spirit and how each problem faced can be considered normal."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Mab is the best fairy ever created in a story. She is strong willed and very funny. She has an attitude to match her ego. Mab is a unique and refreshing change to your average fairy."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"If you love fairies or magical tales, this is amazing tale for you! This is wonderful tale for ALL teenagers! I DEFINATLY recommend this book to ALL teenagers!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is very edgy, and goes well with the rest of the Block collection. This is one of my favorite books, and I will keep it FOREVER. Her seductive, healing writing, leads you into the lives of Mab, and Barbie. Offering a very blunt, depressing look at a teenage girls life, this book doesn't just leave you feeling miserable. The end is cleared up with a healing, empowering discovery, that is NOT cheesy. In fact, it leaves you questioning the entire story. Did Barbie go crazy and invent this perfect world she finds herself in...or is it true? The surrealism perfectly melds with the hard-core reality of the book, and you MUST HAVE IT, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"this is one of the best pieces of writing i have ever read in my life. the description is fabulous and every word written sounds like a song. its beautiful and fantastic and undescribable how wonderful this writing is. read this book now if u appreciate good descriptive writing."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is the first book of Block's I'd ever read and really enjoyed it. Although in the ending, the conflicts in the story were resolved a little too smoothly to be realistic, it is a fairy tale, so one has to expect that. It didn't suprise me that the author wrote for Spin, because at times the book assumed the same tone as the magazine. The writing style is very distinctive and entertaining. The story is a pretty uplifting one. In the course of the book, the author makes some very revealing insights. I can't believe I'd never heard of her before."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Blah this book was horrible! It isnt anything that i thought it would be.

Everything is just so real. Francesca Lia Block blends poetic prose with raw emotion to create an amazing book. It is the story of Barbie, whose ex-beauty queen mother wants to live through her, and turn her into a supermodel. It is the story of Mab, a pixie (though she hates to be called that) that keeps Barbie company. It is the story of Todd, a gorgeous celebrity. It is the story of Griffin, a quiet androgenous beauty, who hides his pain from everyone else. It puts into words everything that you've ever felt."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I just read \\"I was a Teenage Fairy\\" and it was one of the strangest books I've ever read.

But all in all, it was a good book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Wow, this book was great. I'm at a loss for words. It really keeps your attention--of course, any of Francesca Lia Block's books do. Block uses her poeticness to make great starts for the beginnings of each parts of her book.

Her books keep getting better and better and &quot;I Was A Teenage Fairy&quot; is no exeption. I won't go into what it's about because the readers before me have already done that. I do recommend this book to anyone who is into fantasy, entertainment, or just the joy of reading."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Though not as satisfying as the Weetzie Bat books, I Was a Teenage Fairy is a very enjoyable and memorable book. The main character, Barbie, (yes, she is named after the ubiquitous fashion doll), is taken on a journey dealing with pain, loneliness, confusion, abuse, and inner turmoil--you know, everyday life for most of us. What is different about her journey is the people that she meets along the way. Think independence and personal acceptance. Fans of Block's writing will not be disappointed. When someone mentions the name &quot;Barbie,&quot; perhaps because of this book, the doll won't be the first image that is thought of. In all, a great book, and a great introduction to Block's style, if you are new to her writings."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I have read close to all of this authors books but this one left me disappointed. Block's lyrical writing fell short this time. I felt like I had read it all before. Enough about the jacaranda trees, Francesca, we get the point. Purple trees in LA. Maybe I didn't like this book b/c the writing style was just an attempt at recreating her other books. A lousy attempt. Or maybe it's b/c I live in LA and I know what it's like already. But it all just seemed to cliche to me. The stage mom and the uninterested girl. It's been done. I really didn't feel that the characters developed at all. They were presented and weren't displayed in any more depth for the rest of the book. Oh well, there's always Weetzie. (However, if you've never read any of her books before read this one.

She takes the horrible things that give us nightmares and makes them fantastical.When you read I Was A Teenage Fairy, you won't even know which parts of the story are real and which part the story teller is embelishing on.

This book contains little of the offbeat charm and irreverance of Block's earlier works; even her normally beautiful language seems stilted and pretentious. The characters in the novel are one-dimensional and Block, usually so good at evoking emotion, does not seem to be able to rescue them from the confines of the page. Much of what makes the novel so disappointing is the feeling that she has rendered all of these characters much more fully and luminously in her other works. I'm not sure if Block is finished with the Weetzie Bat series, but if she is looking for a new series of characters, she hasn't found them in &quot;I Was A Teenage Fairy.&quot; Those new to Block's work should try &quot;Witch Baby,&quot; &quot;Cherokee Bat and the Goat Guys,&quot; or &quot;Missing Angel Juan&quot; to glimpse this extraordinary writer at her finest."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Nice quick read.

'I Was A Teenage Fairy' did not disappoint in this area, but this was definitely not my favorite book of hers so far. I liked the idea of Mab coming to Barbie and Griffin, who both experienced the same trauma in their lives, and their differences in dealing with their pain. The idea of a tiny fairy living in your purse or your flowers like a constant miniature best friend is comforting and made me wish I had one! 'I Was A Teenage Fairy' was a quick read (I read it within 24 hours), the language and imagery as always making the book a great escape, and had a satisfying happy ending. I would recommend this book to fans of Block's work, but maybe not the best book to start out with if you've never read Francesca Lia Block before."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Unlike Francesca Lia Block's former offerings, most notably the Weetzie Bat books, this story has a realistic plot, although the sparkling poetry/prose that is her style still remains. It's a fantastic work of literature, with shining characters who drive their stories home.Setting? LA, of course. Barbie Marks is a young girl who flails to be herself as her mother vicariously molds into a supermodel lifestyle. Coupled with the fact that she was abused by a photographer as a child, it's no wonder that Barbie begins to retreat into herself. As her situation begins to seem hopeless, a winged psychiatrist named Mab decides it's time that Barbie is fixed up.Then there's Todd (who's last name escapes me), a kindhearted movie star, and Griffin Tyler, his reluctant, careworn roommate who's head over heels for his male best friend. There's also the fact that the &quot;crocodile pedophile&quot; photographer molested him also. As the three humans grope for their bearings (and Mab makes choice comments), their stories intertwine. The story climaxes in New York City, where everything falls into place - - or utterly collapses.Mab's clever sallies and hilarious terms (I've started interchanging &quot;biscuit&quot; for &quot;cute guy&quot; myself) snatch at the reader's attention. Griffin's plight is heartwrenching; the character is so utterly vibrant and brimming with his own tale that isn't ever really fulfilled. One of the reasons the story didn't get five stars is because of the . . . I suppose not undevelopment, but the skimming over of his story.My only other gripe with this book was the rather inconsequential, seemingly rushed ending that didn't measure up with the rest of the story.However, this book is definitely worth more than a casual read. Pick up a copy and dive into Block's world! :)"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is a beautiful book. Wickedly well written and enchanting. Nothing like reading a F.L.B book to make a girl from Southern Manitoba dream of a cooler place, filed with Mabs and lavender. I must have read this book 10 times by now and I think I'll probably always read it. It's inspiring and challenging and wonderful. I can't say enough good things about this book without repeating myself a million times so I'll stop. Just finally to say that this book should be read by EVERY teenage girl, and probably teenage boys too. Read this and all her wonderful books. Well I can't vouch for her latest, Rose and the Beast, yet, because I haven't read it yet, but I'm expecting another masterpiece."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read.

I recomend it to teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block's writing makes you fall in love with the characters, and, because it is written in third person, understand the way each is feeling. She attacks so many issues that are important to today's teenagers, while the characters grow and learn not to live in the past. I reccommend this book for every teenage girl who ever wished she was a fairy, or dreamed of meeting one."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is one of my favourite book, and the 1st that I read by Block and while I love this book with all my heart, it is NOT written for the younger audience it has been marketed for. Honestly, the book shouldn't be touched until 10th grade. Otherwise a good read, if you're looking for a modern fairytale."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"SPIN magazine writer Francesca Lia Block perfectly depicts a portrayal of a fairy tale-esque story set against a modern-day backdrop of Hollywood glamour and ideals. The story chronicles the adventures and misadventures of Barbie Marks and her best friend, a fairy who goes by the name of Mab.Ever since Barbie has been a young girl until the age of 16, her mother has been living through her. She's wanted her to be a model for ages but Barbie has no intentions of ever wanting runway success or to become a carbon copy of her namesake, the buxom Mattel doll. It's a good thing Barbie has Mab for a companion. The two perfectly balance each other out. Barbie is a quiet and timid girl while Mab is feisty and totally outspoken. She never has a problem telling Barbie what she thinks of her - Mab's opinions are uncensored and completely no-holds barred.Due to her mother's wishes and many photography sessions, Barbie is a successful model at 16. Her world is one of star-studded glamour and the sort of life envied by many. Though some may aspire to work Barbie's profession, she is not happy. She and Griffin Tyler, another child model, were both photographed by the very same pedophiliac photographer and now share the same dark secret and both have washed-up parentals who live through them because of their own failures. With Mab's guidance, is it possible for their emotional scars to be healed?Well, the changing of Barbie's name to Serena Moon at the end of the novel signifies a new beginning, a new life Barbie - er, Serena - will live just the way she wants to. The little girl she was and the mature woman she becomes, along with fairy tale elements, make this an unusual yet enjoyable read."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I Was a Teenage Fairy tells the story of Barbie, a beautiful, gentle, passive young girl and Mab, a somewhat arrogant, brash but nevertheless adorable and lovely faerie. Their relationship formed when Barbie was a child, desperately calling out to the fae to show themselves to her. Her friendship and conversations with Mab helps her to endure through and cope with the hardships she continually has to face. As a young child, Barbie is forced into the world of modeling, pageants, and glamour by her conceited, shallow, and severely depressed mother, who seems to think the only way to live her dreams is through her daughter's life. While her mother is too controlling, her father remains cold, distant, and detatched, eventually leaving to start a new family. Barbie quietly complies to her mother's dreams of beauty and modeling, while she secretly wishes to be a photographer - on the other side of the lens. Photography takes sinister undertones in this novel - Barbie is molested as a child by a photographer who uses the cover of his occupation to take advantage of young, helpless children. However, with the help of Mab, Barbie and Griffin (another victim of the child molester) are able to put their past and shame behind them, grow stronger and self-assured, and begin a new life of love, freedom, and creative expression. This book is about belief regardless of what others believe, overcoming hardships, letting go of the past, and learning to believe in yourself. I deeply relate to the themes in this book, and imagine it would be a beautiful and inspiring read for anyone interested in indulging in yet another bizarre, glamourous, fantastical, and mesmerizing world combined with darkness and truth that is signature to Block's works."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This was a masterfully created novel by young adult author Francesca Lia Block. While some might be skeptical that a plot involving fairies and such 'para-realities' would hold the interest of teenage readers, Block is so adept and powerful in her style, she writes with an almost clairvoyant knowledge about what or who (as characters) will capture the love and loyalty of young readers everywhere.'I Was a Teenage Fairy' tells the story of the young Barbie Marks growing up in the star-struck California world. Ever since she could remember, Barbie's mother has been determined to make her into a successful fashion model, even if she has to destroy Barbie to do it. Of course, the situation only worsens as Barbie's photographer turns out to be a child-molester who sexually abuses her when he steps away from the camera's lens. Broken in spirit and despondent, it is only when Barbie meets Mab, a pinky-sized, smart-talking fairy with a passion for &quot;biscuit-hunting&quot; who nudges and cajoles Barbie through life with her warmth, wit, and love, that she can endure.As she grows older, Barbie moves on and becomes fairly successful, being invited out to parties at the houses of famous Hollywood actors, including Todd, a chic yet compassionate party-leader, who is attracted to Barbie's delicate soul, and his roommate/admirer, Griffin Tyler. It is through her interactions with the two of them, and the gentle persistence of Mab, that Barbie manages to reconcile and bring justice to the pain which has marred her past, as well as to grow and expand and become more than what meets the eye on the glossy pages of a fashion magazine.This novel, with its flint-edged lyrical prose, yet dazzling enchantment, is provocative and thoughtful enough to impress the most prolific literary critic, while gripping enough to hold the attention of the most lacking reader. Block deals well with the subject of sexual abuse for teens in that she does not deal graphically with specific episodes. Instead, she simply provides implied aftershock and the main character's discomfiture as key-indicators, thus more characteristic of the way many teens feel after such an incident. She also points out that abuse never begins with one person but is simply a vicious cycle, which a person who has enough stamina can terminate. Even the very title 'I Was a Teenage Fairy' leaves a melodramatic impact on a person, making them feel as though they have heard the story from the point of Mab far in the future, after a maximum resolution. There is little to disappoint in this work of fiction, with its inspiring conclusion, except for the fact that it does indeed have an ending. Yet will leave readers mesmerized and revisiting the days of their youth when fairies did exist."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block's stories all tend to resemble modern day fairy tales but this one reminded me more of a current day myth. The main character, Barbie, is constantly surrounded by fairies, giants, a \\"cyclops\\", and other monsters.The book first joins Barbie at age 11. She is a lonely girl who is wrapped up in her own idea of beauty. Things like flowers in gardens and her pinky-sized fairy friend, Mab. But her mother has big plans for her, specifically to be the famous model she never got to be. And her mother's dreams will come true no matter the cost.Not long her doings become destructive and we fast forward 5 years. Barbie is now 16 and a party goer. Luckily she always had her special companion, Mab. The two often argue but despite that their relationship is a magical one.The ending is a happy one but too soon. I really liked the characters and would have enjoyed the book being even longer."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is a rather short book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 14. I like the diversity of the book. I found Mab to be actually charming in that typical faery sorta way. This does go into detail in ways that some people might not like. I look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"\\"I Was A Teenage Fairy\\" by Francesca Lia Block is so far, the best book I have ever read written by her. The book is almost like poetry itself, and on the very first page you are drawn into a world full of cosmic candy and spun sugar. Absolutely a must-have teen book. You'll totaly love it. It has romance, drama, fantasy, comedy, and of course, class. Very, very good."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block is a fantastic author, and this book is one of her best. It catches the pain and anguish of the teen model Barbie Marks. She (Block) uses the English Language in a whole new light, bringing together all your senses included taste, smell and sound. When you are read \\"I was a Teenage Fairy\\" you wont be able to stop yourself from saying some of the exotic words aloud."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block is a fantastic author, and this book is one of her best.

I enjoyed all the characters very much, but my favorite was Mab (a pinkie-sized fairy). She was so spunky and truthful, what's not to love about a mini teenage girl that speaks her mind? The story itself was tragic, but with characters such as Mab, Barbie, Griffin, and Todd, it was a very exciting and colorful book to read. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in modern fairytales and likes to be entertained."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book was amazing! I picked it up in the Library when I was in a mood that made me want to be alone... I liked this book because it shows closure on Barbie's part- read it!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Based on other reviews written about this young adult novel, one might think of it as surprisingly graphic for readers as young as 13 years old. Upon reading it for oneself though, it is noticeable that, at least until the central character (Barbie Marks) turns 16, descriptions are very mild so as only to give us an idea of what is really going on. Yet, it seems that this slender volume, sitting on young adult shelves, gets caught in an identity crisis, its main themes being sex, drugs, molestation, and family issues, matters not taken lightly by the more conservative in our society as well as not generally thought suitable for children. What is here meant by identity crisis is that Francesca Lia Block gives us a tale that could be societally relevant if it were not wanting more description, more elaboration, and more exploration. The novel is caught between being classified as young adult fiction and something else. That something we cannot say until it is written in more, uninhibited, detail. Then it wouldn't be a children's book anymore, but it could perhaps be a more powerful story with greater impact, more than just a quick glimpse into the shadow side of life."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"In I was a teenage fairy Block conbines brillant and lyrical dscriptive style with dramatic adolecent issues to create a beautyful and realistic story. The issues of sexual abuse and child labor lend a realistic feel to Block's otherwise fanciful and light writing style. The metaphors and imagry she uses is amazing, creating a world so real the reader could step right into it, the highlight of this creativity is her metaphors for describing cities. The characters are realistic, appealing even with their faults. The summary suggests that Griffin plays a role tantamount to that of Barbie but in the actual book he is a supporting character. I found this volume better than her other works because it has a plot her other books have virtualy nonexistent plots. The only complaint I had was that it took to long to develop setting , characters, ect. I was in the second half before I was really grabed by the storyline. But when I got to the point where it ot good I could not put it down, deffinatly worth the wait."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Thrown off at first by the context of I Was A Teenage Fairy, I began to believe that this book was for someone younger than me. After giving it a second chance I became intrigued with the majestic imagination of the book and the characters, Barbie and Mab. Block connected the real life events of a spoiled, wealthy, selfish mother and a beautiful lost little girl with a secret friend she has always dreamed of meeting. Mab symbolizes Barbies emotions, fears, curiosities, and love. And within this reading there are many examples of the common struggles of an average teenager. I have now realized that this book is not only enjoyable for all teenagers, many others younger and older can benefit for it just as much."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"It was a great book about friendship, and it shows that a friendship can occur in the weirdest places! It was really good. Mab had an attitude that made her unique! Francesca Lia Block is my favorite author, and again she makes an effort and a masterpiece is created! You will not be dissapointed, especially if you are familiar with Francesca's work! Check it out!!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read! I love Francesca Lia Block's writing and I find them very true to life unlike most other books! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I found every part of it to be satisfactory! I definetly reccomend this book to anyone who has ever doubted themselves and found their lives but yet on the edge! Laurel"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I am a devout Francesca Lia Block fanatic! I love everyhting she writes. Her sensious poetic style of writting is unmatched by any other modern artist and in her latest book, 'I Was A Teenage Fairy' she shows us her magical powers once more. This time we wander into the life of Barbie Marks(who is constantly feeling 'like the plastic doll she was named after') and her pesky piksy friend, Mab. Other character such as todd and Griffin(aka Mr. Biscuit) almost take the reader to the wonderful life we experience in 'Cherokee Bat and the Goat Guys'. And in the end you feel the same love in your heart that you feel at the end of every Francesca Lia Block book!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I have been a fan of Ms. Block since Weetzie Bat, and I anxiously await the arrival of any new book. Unfortunately, IWATF was a huge disappointment. Her choice to give her main character the painfully obvious name of &quot;Barbie&quot; seemed like a slap in the face. How unoriginal. And the name of the book itself was irksome, a goofy title where magic could have been made. On the whole, I found no truly loveable characters and felt everyone was too spoiled to care about. Violet and Claire continued the trend, and now I hope upon hope that her next book will return to the punk rock slink-chunk charm of Weetzie Bat or the lyrical mystery of The Hanged Man or the inspiring magic of Girl Goddess. Anything but this."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book for me was just okay. I t was kinof flat, and didnt have much adventure or intersting parts in it. The book centers around barbie, griffin, barbies boyfriend,(all rebel teenagers) and Mab, a fairy smart allec. Mab was the only reason i kept on reading. without her, the book really would have been bad!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book was too shallow for me. Barbie was a very confused girl growing up in a messed up family but was too passive and weak for my kind. She found a fairy named Mab outside. Mab was the best part - a pinky sized fairy with red hair and a wonderful attitude. Mab was strong willed and independent but you see a soft side of her at times. She's gentle and timid underneath a shield of stubborness. But Barbie, with her shallow, controlling mother and pathetic, passive father, was much too naive. Barbie was forced to be a model - beautiful Barbie with her rail-thin figure and blond hair - and was taken advantage of at a young age. One would think an eleven-year-old could see what was going on with the photographer, but you can see how something like that could happen. When Barbie's sixteen she's a gorgous too-thin model with a drunken mother. Barbie does drugs, lets guys leer at her and people take advantage of her, and can easily be considered a slut. Barbie, Mab, Barbie's lameass guy Todd and Todd's gay roomate make up the story that is at a loss of the magic it promises on the back. I wasted money buying this book and should have just checked it out at a library to save bookshelf space from a book I won't read again. This story covers sex, drugs, child molestion and a world of shallow people."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block has the ability to take you anywhere in her beutifully writtern books and in this she takes you to the over exposed world of the Valley. All her books are magical, this one espescially so. I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"this book was the best one from all books I have read..It's about a girl named barbie who..NOOO im not telling what's it about..you go get it..you'll love it..really..trust me.. :) READ IT!! you'll really enjoy it.."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"The talking fairyThe story is about Barbie and her best friend Mab. Mab is a fairy who's going to get mad at Barbie because she thinks Barbie is a dork, Mab going to go to New York and live Barbie in California alone with her mother. Do you think Mab would come back to Barbie since she's her best friend? Mrs. Foster (Barbie's mom) wanted her to be a supermodel, because she thinks Barbie has the perfect body to become a wonderful supermodel. But it's not just that, she wants Barbie to be a supermodel because when she was a teenage girl she had it all what it takes but it's just didn't work out for her. But is Barbie want to be a supermodel or is it just her mom's idea!?The only thing Barbie wants is to go to New York where she can be her self, and live with Mab and be Tyler's girlfriend.The friendship between Mab and Barbie difficult but yet playful.Maybe Mab was real, maybe she wasn't, maybe she was the courage after all!!This book will inspire you to believe in a creative fairy.What I learned from this book is it has a lot of imagination and I learned that you can make your imagination a fun thing, like this book I liked the fairy and I kind of believed in it when I was reading it, so now I learned that we can make our imaginary anything we want and make others believe in it as a real thing."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"After reading good reviews and liking the idea of the story I just couldn't get into this book. I was really excited and was very disappointed! It was vague and just didn't flow. I tried and tried and couldn't get through half the book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I may no longer be a teenager, but when I saw this book, I could not resist purchasing it and reading it at once. I became captivated with Ms. Block's work through Dangerous Angels (the Weetzie Bat books, so much an influence that I named my beloved cat &quot;WitchBaby&quot;). I was a Teenage Fairy kept me equally as spellbound. Blending horrific reality with imagination and beauty, Barbie and Mab are a wonderful pair. This is a gorgeous book, that I recommend for anyone."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is such a beautiful book. Francesca Lia Block appeals to Y/A in this book, and demonstrates the growth of a girl and self-confidence with her vivid use of the english language and symbolism. If I was ever to have a daughter, I would want her to read this book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I absouliutly LOVED this book! It combinds fantasy and reality, but in a weird way. At the beginning it describes San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles as two different women, that gets you into the book. Francesca Lia Block show the secrects behind a perfect looking model. It shows you that even if life looks easy for them... its really not. I think girl/women from the ages of 13+ should read this book.A little note: Life is filled with many suprises"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"'I was a Teenage Fairy' was a really good book.

Barbie describes every teenage girl out there: lost, afraid, confused. it was like F.L.A. was reading my thoughts, my feelings, and writing them down magically in her book just as i was reading it. she spins a magicical protective web around me, and i wish i had a mab to talk to and be my free psychatrist. or maybe i once did have a mab when i was little, and just forgot. well i think it's time to remember. for all of us to remember the magical mab we once had. we all should look within our selves to find our strength, our own pinkie-sized mab. and we should never forget. i will never forget this book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is really great. As usaul Fracesca Lia Block blew me away with her imagery that absolutely transports you to wherever you could want to go. You know every character and the writer gives you an indepth understanding of each of them. Even the most detestable characters are given a background and history that can move you to understand their actions. The best part of this book is the way the setting is described. You feel like you're there. I can't tell you about it..... you have to read it. The pictures that it created in my mind are beyond beautiful."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"this book has got to be the best i have ever read, it's fantastic, any girl who's ever been pressured by their parents (or any guy) will know whyit touches on a lot of issues many would rather ignore but i think that is part of what made it so good, the fairy (mab) is a great character and so is barbie, they're so well written you'd almost beleive they're real, every emotion they have, every word they speak seems so real and vivid it's hard to beleive it's only a book...it makes you wish you had your own mab"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I found &quot;I was a Teenage Fairy&quot; to be one of the best novels I have ever read. It is a fairy tale that also deals with real issues and problems. Perhaps there is sex and drug use in the novel, but young people are exposed to that on television and in real life."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I loved this book almost as much, or actually, as much as her book Violet and Clair. I could see and feel and touch Mab, the fairy. It was really amazing and I feel now as if I have a Mab that lives with me. I read it in less than a day (in class....:) It was really great, and I would recomend it to anyone who believes in fairies."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block writes an amazing tale in I Was a Teenage Fairy. This is a mesmerizing tale that will expand your imagination. Barbie Marks a girl pushed into a world paved with secrets and lies, the world of modeling, by her own mother, struggles with a terrible secret of being sexually abused by her photographer. To help her along the way is the pinkie-sized friend, with wings and a fairy like structure, a Mab. Mab is Barbie's only friend. Mab is the only one who acknowledges the sexual abuse that Barbie has taken from her photographer, Hamilton. The story also follows a boy, who's gay, who struggles with the same secret as Barbie since he to has been abused by Hamilton. Follow the adventure where Barbie and Griffin, find courage, love and more importantly themselves, with the help of the fairy like friend, Mab. I recommend this book because it is a story of finding courage to standing up against what is wrong. Barbie must find the courage to stop the abuse on others but she must first stand up to her mother who knew of the secret but did nothing to stop it. Mrs. Markowitz was so involved in Barbie accomplishing her dream she never figured out what Barbie's own dreams were. Barbie soon stands up to her mother and moves out. She then falls in love with Griffin's roommate, Todd. She speaks to Griffin about how the must stop the abuse on others and put Hamilton out of a job. Barbie is daring and goes to the Hamilton's studio and takes a picture from the window of the studio of Hamilton abusing a little boy. The photographer goes out of business. And Barbie now can completely follow her dream. Another reasons I recommend this book be because it tells a story of great friendships between Barbie and Mab and Barbie and Tom. Mab pokes at Barbie to find the courage to do what she needs to do to follow her dreams. Ever since Barbie was a little girl Mab has existed as a friend. And ever since she has had Mab she has had the dream of fairies in picture books. But Barbie knows that none of these compare to Mab. Barbie's dream is to take photos instead of being the one in them. Mab is her first model. Barbie loves to show everyone her friend who is more beautiful than any fairy in a book outside and in. Her friendship with Tom grows to be more than friends; Todd is the one who also gives her the courage. It is Todd who helps her publish a book with photos of Mab. Barbie is thrilled to show the world the beauty of her friend. With the help of these two amazing friends Barbie finds Courage, love and herself. Although this book is very good it has a flaw. The author did not build on the character Mrs. Markowitz; you know very little of her. But this flaw is minor and can be looked over easily, since Mrs. Markowitz is not the main character. Also this book is thrilling, and just because there is a flaw does not mean you should pass up on this story. This book will move the soul, and make your heart beat with joy."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is i think the best Francesca Lia Block book i have ever read! The begining paragraphs were so wonderfully written! she makes such insightful analogies to every-day things! i am such a huge fan of her writing style no matter what the topic.

It had everything I, personally, like to read about. It also gave me the chance to live vicariously through Barbie. I've always wanted to go to LA and have a fairy for a best friend. Ever since I read the book, I always look in every bush I see. I've read it twice already and I will probably read it again. I have no idea how anyone could not have enjoyed the book. I think they should read it again with a more open mind and hopefully feel everything I did."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"francesca lia block is one of my favorite writers - her stories are so magical and beautiful. this is a great choice for any teenage girl"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This was all in all a fantasy book but it felt so real. The writing was unique and the structure of the story, amazing. I enjoyed this book a lot and it really got me thinking. To the point and interesting, I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Even at 20 I am still able to enjoy one of the staples of my teenage years. Francesca Lia Block never fails to amaze. The prose is minimalist, yet very descript. Like the Hanged Man, my favorite of the Block books, I Was A Teenage Fairy introduces new characters with real problems, and manages to evoke a sense of magic without glamorizing the decadence of the scene where the action takes place. The Weezie Bat books are great as well, but I had been hoping Ms. Block would take a break and try a new tack. I'm looking forward to more from Mab and Barbie. Always a treat."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I found this book to be very well-written and real. Mab was a little overly-nasty at times and Griffin being gay was an \\"eh\\" storyline line but the way this was written and the characters overall.. outstanding. My favorite parts were in the beginning, the party scenes. Barbie's getting through to her mother, finally, was also beautiful. Read this book. This and \\"Violet and Claire\\" were possibly her best."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Someone on a mailing list of mine highly recommended the 'Weetzie Bat' books by Francesca Lia Block, so when I found this book by the same author in a bookstore I went ahead and bought it. The absolutely gorgeous cover art by Suza Scalora drew me in.Sadly, that was the best part of the novel. The book reminds me of a beautiful, yummy-looking French pastry, that seems like it should be heavenly. However, after you've eaten it you find it was mostly air ~ beautiful to look at, but of no real substance. Having looked forward to it with such anticipation, you find yourself still hungry.The way Todd (he of the tattoos) was 'redeemed' in the end struck me as completely fake, and the 'happy ending' for Griffin with his 'fairy-found' lover Damian equally suspect. After a sincere look into such serious issues facing teens as child abuse, parental neglect, sexual expression and identity, it was disappointing to see the unrealistic happy endings that Block provided, thus negating the impact of her story.I liked the character of Mab, the little green fairy with the red hair, but lamented the lack of depth to the character and the story. I have to compliment Block for writing a book for teenagers that deals with modern issues teens face. However, this isn't a profound book by any stretch of the imagination.Think of it as the 90's version of 'Nancy Drew' or 'Sweet Valley High' - of monumental importance to young readers, that they might remember fondly as an adult, but nothing that will have any lasting influence. If you're not a teenager this book probably won't mean anything to you. Pure mind candy."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is about a young girl named Barbie blessed (or cursed) with beauty and forced into modeling by her controlling mom, an ex-model herself, living vicariously through her child. When she's 11 she meets Mab, a sarcastic fairy, who almost reluctantly becomes Barbie's friend. During this same time she's molested by a lecherous photographer. Her mother tells her not to cry, that life is full of problems and she had just better learn to deal with them.Fast forward 5 years and Barbie's a rail thin, jaded model. Mab is still part of her life, encouraging her to have sex which I found bizarre seeing as she's only 16 but maybe I'm getting old . . .This book was just \\"eh, so what\\" for me. I didn't connect with the character and the sparse writing style left me cold. The issues of molestation, teen sex, drugs, homosexuality, etc. seemed to be very glossed over but I guess that couldn't be helped seeing as the book was so short. Overall it wasn't a memorable read despite the dark subject matter."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I just don't think it is a good idea to advertise the factthat many parents haven't a clue about protecting their children.Or that children are so very vulnerable...The book is written well enough and all, but being a big fan ofJames M. Barrie and tales about fairiesdoesn't endear this book to me.Kids grow up way too fast in this society as it is.Innocence once gone, is gone forever."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"See, coming from a kid, its the best place to get a review from, being that this book was written for young adults. I am a thirteen year old and when I saw this book \\"I Was A Teenage Fairy\\", I thought \\"could that really be a bad book?\\" Being a very curious person, I got the book, wondering how a book about a fairy could be so perverse and wrong. Turns out it was true... This book was on my recommended reading list in my school for rising eight graders, which my parents could not believe. They ended up writing a letter to my principle with some excerpts from the book and the dude was appalled. I cant even tell you the things in that that book that are so inappropriate for young teens or teens alone. I know my parents, and they dont freak out over every little thing, but when I showed them some of the things that were \\"appropriate\\" for young teens our age, it was the last straw. Many reviews say that this book is filled with \\"realistic fantasy\\", but I have a eighteen year old sister, and I know its not like that. That part that my dad had a problem with is that although many things that are written in this book are legal, some things are not, such as smoking marijuana and other illegal drugs. Things such as these could set an influence on many naive teenagers who think there are like the ones in this fantasy book. Maybe if you are an adult and you happen to like this kind of book pornagraphy, this would be the book for you, not a teenager looking for a \\"clean\\" book to read."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I was very suprised to see this book in a Middle School Library. It has very strong profanity, sex, drugs, alcohol, masturbation and homosexuality. All of which, I feel are not suitable for young readers. As an adult, I found this book to be offensive. Our Middle School has removed the book from its shelf so that no other 11-14 year old can read this subject matter. In my opinion, it condones drinking, drugs, profanity and sex in our teenagers. Parents please be aware of what your children are reading."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I've read most of the other reviews about how this book is horrible and so forth and so on because of the subject matter. While this book probably shouldn't be on a list for 12 and up, if a kid is honestly still so naive by the time they are entering highschool that they can't handle this book, maybe its good they are being exposed to the world. The book discusses sex, drinking, being molested, nothing more than is talked about on Oprah or Dr. Phil. Parents may not be ready for their 8th grader to be exposed to this, but its definitely the real world. I read this book going into the 7th grade and it didn't hurt me to read it, it just opened my eyes to a life I had never experienced. The book is well written and will suck you in if you are open minded enough to read it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"at the age of 15, this is one of my very favourite books. i loved it so much i had to go out and buy it. this book is full of emotion and if you read it, it will forever enthrall you. this book taught me things that no person ever could. i love this book so very much, and i suggest any teenage girl (whos really a faerie on the inside, like myself) read this magical book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"First of all, if you have read Francesca Lia Block's other books, don't expect that sort of writing here. Granted, it has the same descriptions of places you would kill to go to, but that's about where the similarities end.This book is more of a gritty Y/A novel than a fantasy, ie Weetzie Bat. It's the story of Barbie, a young girl haunted by her burn-out was-model mother, who wants Barbie to be to be a model so badly, she will go to any lengths to ensure it. So along comes Mab, a pinkie-size fairy with fuschia hair, who is Barbie's best friend, guidance counselor and, on occasion, psychiatrist! She is the best part of a fantastic book.Yes, I liked this book. I loved this book. I will read this book until the end of time!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"first of all, i'd like to state that i am a huge fan of lia block and also a very harsh critic, so i hope other FLB fans don't get offended. i do not wish to discuss the actual summary of the book, that would be tedious and you can click on the whole 'look inside' thing for that, so rather i'll just share my opinion. i found barbie to be one of the must un-sypmathatic, shallow, vile, and boring character in any FLB book. i could not relate to her -at all- and was extremely upset upon finishing this book. FLB claims to write books about real girls for real girls, and i believe she did a much better and more complete job with characters such as weetzie bat, voilet (never was a big fan of claire), and especially lady ivory and albaster duchess (of 'girl goddess #9' fame). there are more obviously, but i felt a connection with them, i cared for them, and especailly for non-'cookie cutter' girls like the aforementioned lady ivory and albaster. while FLB claims every girl is uniquely beautiful, why does she continue to write mostly of conventionally beautiful and seductress girls? albaster, who was described as 'voluptous' and ivory who apparantly does not remember her natural haircolor (a tad ditzy, i suppose) seemed a little more real, because not everyone in l.a. is blond and rail thin... and i don't think all the girls FLB writes about should be either. another thing was that i found barbie's virtual muteness extremely nerve-racking. this was not the kind of girl i thought FLB should choose, one who was totally dependent and frankly pathetic, even in her incarnate, 'selena moon' (i'm sorry, but francesca, what were you on that night?!). i also get irritated by little kitsch punk culture nods, as can be found in IWATF. the only book i found where i felt it was real and appropraite was weetzie bat, not with some dumb sheltered supermodel the reader has no sympathy or patience for. lastly, i am appalled by angry parents proclaiming this book is inappropriate for teenagers. i read this book for the first time when i was 13 and did not find it unnerving at all. most teens and pre-teens are exposed to the 'horrors' described in IWATF (sex and drugs mostly, hopefully not molestation :) and would not find them shocking. i don't think virginal teens would pick this book up anyways. and if they do, and then find it offensive, they can always stop reading it, this is a so-called democratic nation and nothing in that book is john waters material or would scar a child for life. trust me, it would do more damage to plop your children in front of 'the man show' (hehe. althoughi have to admit i find it funny. when the juggies aren't on.)... in conclusion, if you are an avid FLB fan i recommend you read it anyways, just for common knowledge, but if you are a block virgin i suggest you start with the (way better) weetzie bat series, voilet and claire, or girl goddess #9, all of which are much betterly developed and altogether zesty..."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"When I was told about this book and that it would help me, a past victim of Child Molestation...I thought what? Especially when I picked the book up and saw the cover. How can this help me in any way? But I decided to go ahead and purchase and read....I found that even though this was a fictious book, my life and my feelings related to the past pains suffered. The fantasy of the book helped me to understand my reality.What a remarkable book this is.I also want to mention Nightmares Echo as being another book I was told to get, also helps with healing. To say i am amazed at this book is an understatement. thank you to the author"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I Wasa a Teenage Fairy by Fransesca Dia Block was a very magical, invigorating, bizarre, and startling story. I loved this story. It had a realistic feel with a fairy tale twistThis story is about a girl, Barbie, who is forced by her mother to model. Her mom didn't make it as a model and thought she could fix her mistakes through her daughter. When she was about 8 she met a fairy named Mab. Mab was about 4 in. tall with a 8 foot tall sex drive, she had the attitude of a girl with permanent p.m.s.Something happened at one of her modling shoots that would change her forever. Barbie wanted to tell her mom but couldn't, Even if she wanted to her mom wouldn't listen. If it wasn't for Mab all of Barbies feelings would be locked up inside.16 year old Barbie, more beautiful than ever still being forced to model. Barbie meets a some friends and enimies that will change her life always.This was a great book and I recomend it to you who have just read my review."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This gritty novel isn't quite like Block's other books. It's still fantastic and a definite for any Block fans, but it's more real and harsh. It's the story of Barbie, the daughter of a has been model whose life is suddenly turned upside down when the &quot;crocodile pedophile&quot; Hamilton Waverly gets a hold of her, and her father leaves. It's the story of Mab, the pinkie sized fairy who is Barbie's only friend. With Mab by her side, Barbie can find the courage to go on. It's also the story of Griffin, another victim of the crocodile, and his actor friend Todd who loves Barbie. This sweet yet sinister (at times) story is fantastic, but can be hard to read if you don't like the subject. However the scenes aren't all that graphic, as in some of her other books. I highly recommend this book to any die hard Francesca Lia Block fan. It's a winner all the way!Also read: Dangerous Angels, Violet and Claire and Girl Goddess #9, all by Francesca Lia Block."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Francesca Lia Block's books are very light and pleasant... teenage love stories with a hint of the fantastic. I am not a teenager (college grad), but i love her books for a step away from reality. She deals with modern issues (homosexuality, tattoos, popular music, rape, sex, etc.), but adds details like fairies and magic to keep it light-hearted and wonderful.This book was sweet and entertaining... but by far not her best novel. I'd recommend Violet &amp; Claire (a story about 2 best friends), Nymph (her book of adult erotica short stories) or Girl Goddess #9 (a young adult book of short stories.)"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is amazing! I never thought that it would contain such incredible writing in it. This book makes you laugh, and smile, and giggle. It makes you feel like your concience is nibbling at your ears. This book is incredible, and I assure you that it is worth all of the money you spend on it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I never had, until I read this book. Mizz Block's writing is absolutely amazing!! I could not put the book down. From its catchy beginning to the very last sentence, it will make you think and ask yourself how an author could be so brilliant. I encourage anyone to read this book. It's whitty, smart, and modern. Do yourself a favor and read it"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This was a beautiful book. The writing is deep and emotions are real. My only complaints are that I wish it was way longer and the ending seemed a little to sicknigly sweet and perfect. It is the story of a girl, aged 11, and then 16, named Barbie, her \\"boyfriend\\" Todd, his male friend Griffen, and Barbie being pushed in to a modleing career by her mother. Not to forget Mab, a pinkie-sized, outspoken fairy who helpd Barbie and Griffen discover who they really are inside. I would recommoned this book for teen girls. This book kept me wanting more, even after it ended. This book tackles issues that are real today; teen deppression, love, figuring out yourself and your sexuality, child molestation, as well as drug and alcohal use, but all is presented as an appropriate and fitting part of the story with a beautiful use of the English language. This is a beautifully written book, I only wich it was longer and a bit deeper in to emotions."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I love all of Francesca Lia Block's books except for &quot;I Was A Teenage Fairy&quot;. This book doesn't have any of the magic or silliness of Miss Block's other books. The only character that was remotely interesting was &quot;Mab&quot;. I hope the next book is better then this!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I'm sorry, but I can't follow the crowd on this one. I really didn't enjoy it. I found it disjointed, distasteful and disappointing. Let's face it, the fairy type creature Mabs was a bitch. She was never happy, was constantly whining and was generally in-fairylike. I mean, fairy tales are supposed to be uplifting. All little girls either want to be a fairy or a princess. Had they met this Mabs character they would all narrow that decision down to being a princess.And what about the main character? Miss snooty model? I don't know, there was something off putting about every character in this book. Even if they all do live happily ever after by the end, I see divorce, drugs and alcoholism in their futures. Anyway, I would suggest this book to nobody and am even feeling leery about passing it along to Value Village in case some poor sap picks it up for $2.99."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book has been in my TBR pile for a long time, and I had high hopes going into it. Unfortunately, this book was not really me.What I liked: I thought the book had a wonderful underlying message. It ended on a high note which is something I was not sure was going to happen. The characters undergo some major issues, and actually find a way to work through it.. kudos for that.What I did not like: I found the book hard to get into with it starting with a mass of descriptions that I am still not sure were needed, and to be honest, left me a bit confused. I constantly found myself lost in the beginning since it would randomly have flashbacks without a set up or warning. I also had a hard time connecting with the characters: Barbie was mostly blah to me, her mother annoying, her dad was always angry and I did not always understand why, Mab- I am not really sure what I think about her. She annoyed me and I liked her at the same time if that makes any sense. I also found the sex references odd and really unneeded for the most part.Overall, the word disjointed kept coming to mind while I was reading this book-- this may be due to it having no chapters (but it could be the writing style too). I think that I would have liked this book better if it was pieced together differently. While it has major flaws for me, I really did like its message of overcoming issues and learning to move on."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"First, I'd just like to say that Francesca Lia Block has one of the most beautiful writing styles in YA literature today. I'm from LA and reading her descriptions of the city made me fall more in love with the place than ever before.This book touches on many difficult themes like child abuse, but it's not perverse like others have said. It deals with real issues that affect kids (unfortunately), but that doesn't mean that kids shouldn't read about them. In fact, it may warn them of the dangers lurking around every corner and it may help them deal with the emotional and physical trauma that often stem from these issues.I first read this book as a pre-teen and I wasn't at all offended by the storyline. In fact, I think it may have opened my eyes to all the dark aspects of society. It made me wiser.Mab is a metaphor for inner strength and courage. She helps Barbie, who has experienced something horrible, deal with the pain and come out a braver, more mature person. The message is that no matter how hard life gets, you can always recover and shine on. Great story and lesson."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I love this book, and I have loved it since I was about 12 ( im 22 now). I am also a parent. I would allow my 13 year old to read this ( when they get that old), but I will say its not for immature or sheltered teenagers. It does use some curse words, talks about sex, and about molestation. There are also parts about homosexuality in it. I must say, ire ad some reviews and people were so mad. I have to ask, what do you think your kids here about at school everyday? I did however understand the book more as I got older, like 16 and up."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Getting into I Was a Teenage Fairy was a hard task. At the very beginning, the reader is suffocated by a mass of description and plunged right into a confusing, out-of-focus, plot. Soon, though, the haze clears out and a message begins to form. You'll find yourself wondering pretty existential questions throughout this read. Who--or what--is Mab? Is she a figment of Barbie's imagination? Is she Barbie herself? Is she supposed to symbolize all or none of us at all? While there doesn't seem to be much other than a rough outline of a plot in this book, it's still an enjoyable read--far better than Block's Weetzie Bat series. It's still filled with the same kind of hazy wording, but there appears to actually have a point, while Weetzie really didn't. There is a point to the stories that are being told, and it is a hauntingly poignant one.Rating: 4/5"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I really liked the book I Was a Teenage fairy because it really relates to the things that actually happen in high school to a lot of teenagers. In this book there was a girl named Barbie and she had a fairy the size of her pinky named mab. Mab helped Barbie out on a lot of problems that she has in the future"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"First off, I am an avid fan of Francesca Lia Block and have read basically everything she has ever written. I read this book for the first time when I was 13, and was stunned at the beauty of Block's honesty. The murky quality of narration is accurate of any coming-of-age story, especially one dealing with the issues addressed in this book. Block's ability to weave fantastical themes into real, contemporary life awes me every times. The discovery of honesty and strength at the end of the book was not only beautifully written but also very powerful for me as a girl struggling with her own life."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This novel is very intense. I read it as a teenager and it took me a while to comprehend. The book is amazing, the style of writing is poetic and unique. The plot is hard to swallow and difficult to understand, but once you take yourself out of the story and see what the author's message is it becomes a lot less threatening. The only problem I see with this book is the complexity of the ideas. It is not as depressing or \\"rancid\\" as it seems once you realize what the author intends to convey. However, it is difficult to discern the message and some may end up confused and believing it is a horrible thing to teach a teenager.Personally I believe the decision to take from this book what one will is left up to the reader. I admit I was initially baffled by the seemingly-depressing \\"moral\\" of the book, until I was able to digest what I had read. I quickly realized that it is a marvelous book filled with important hard-learned lessons presented in language of the highest creativity. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book really got me thinking. Francesca really puts a special poetic feel to her storIES. All her books are wonderful. Especially Violet &amp; Claire. I recommend this lyrical book to any girl who believes in fairies."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I Was A Teenage Fairy is one of the best books I have ever read. I have a hard time finishing books, but this one I could not put down. Even when I am older I know I would like to read this book again."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This is the most fabulous book I have ever read. At 13 years old I have read many books but even when I'm older I'm sure I'll be reading this one a gain and again!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"A light fairy tale with a serious undertone. I'm 29 and I still go for mature YA fantasy like this from time to time (Annette Curtis Clause is another.) Kudos for not beating us over the head with the child abuse issue. I look forward to reading more about Barbie, with or without Mab, if anything more should be written."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"If you would like to read this book you better have alot of time on youre hands because once you start you can't put it down I think this book is addicting! I reccomend this book for 13-18 readers it has a bit of swearing but it makes it better and more interesting it is a bout a fairy who finds a friend the friends name is Barbie, Barbie is the main character. Barbies mother, Ms. Marks puts Barbie under tons of pressure to be a model and become famous But Barbie doesn't like all of the photo shoots The book makes you feel like you are Barbies best friend Barbie grows and she picks up a Boyfriend along the way! I think this is a super book aND IF YOURE A TEENAGER THIS IS A ROMANTIC FANTASY!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book was the best book I've ever read. It gripped to read it (at age 13) in less then 2 days, and I don't doubt that I'll be reading it again! The mystery that slowly reveals catches your emotions and brings out your anger and love towards the characters in this book. A definite read for ages 13+."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I thought that this book was great. I think it is good becauae you cannot really tell what is real or an illusion. It is a good book."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book was awesome! It never got boring like some good books do. I love it! As soon as I put it down I wanted to read it again!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"First off, let me start off by warning you. Once you start reading this book, you'll never be able to put it down. It was written so well. Aside from the fairy, its very realistic and modern. It's so great. Its a very great book, i recomend you read it. Although it does have some sex things going on and lots of bad language. Get it today!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I think this book is a very cool book! At first though it was sort of boring but then it got very intrusting and turned out great! I like reading wierd books like this one!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I've never read anything by this woman (girl?). This book was like... Beverly Cleary but &quot;modern&quot;. It wasn't very involved and seemed like it would have been more accomplished if it had been a children's story book complete with illustrations and such. It was like she started writing this book for a group of friends as a christmas present - complete with allusions that only they can understand in unmentionable detail - and she decided to publish. It left me the whole time wanting more. She gave everyone an out, even villains (Washed-Up-ExModel-Mother and Molesting-Fashion-Photographer) who some people would rather see horribly punished for their crimes against the Pop-Teen-Set... it was a great piece of pop culture that seemed to be written in an unaccounted for MiddleSchool style... I wanted so much more."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"As an adult reader who knows nothing about this author, I kept thinking, &quot;The writing here is very frail, like a novel for young adults.&quot; Surprise, it is! And that explains a lot. The story is laid out in a very simplistic way, and what's worse, its tired ideas aren't shaped to build any momentum as the story unfolds.For instance, heroine Barbie was molested by a slimy photographer at age 11 and has understandable misgivings about intimacy. But when she willingly sleeps with a man for the first time, her inhibitions immediatly disappear in a passionate romp before a roaring fire. (Well, there goes that theme.) And did it bother anyone else that Todd, the man in question, is a movie star who's sneaking the 16-year-old Barbie into bars and sleeping with her when she's underage? (Todd also has a frail, big eyed, gay &quot;roommate&quot;, another child model. What is with this guy?)Even the title I WAS A TEENAGE FAIRY is off. This isn't a book about a teenage fairy, it's about a teenager who befriends a fairy. (Get it together, people!) And I also hated its underlying message, which is, &quot;All molested children have a chipper little fairy that comes to help them through the bad times.&quot; Oh, really? That's sort of like what we heard in the movie A BEAUTIFUL MIND, which essentially said, &quot;You can overcome your schizophrenia with a little will power and the love of a beautiful wife.&quot; Ick."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"eeek. Let me start with Block's writing. It is completly prestentious and skin deep. I have read so many of her books and am yet to like on of them. She makes me feel like she thinks we will fall for her big, overly descriptive words. To tell you the truth, I don't think there's much going on underneath the visuals and words of this story or any of Blocks peices. They are very sad tales with insanely happy ending. They are written to cater the teenage mind, as if the teenage mind is a model wannabe idiot. It seems to me that the author assumes we arn't paying attention to the words... that's my opinion..."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I love faeries. they are beautiful amazing creatures that allow people to escape reality. So, as you could expect i was instantly attracted to this book. I regret that. I had my mother buy it for me, and when i got home i read it in about an hour. the beginning is amazing. truly amazing. but the end is weak and dumb. i expected more. the boy barbie hooks up with is extremely vulgar and wrong. this book is not about a faerie or a girl. its simply sexuality. i am 12, and know a lot for a child my age but even for me... this book lakced a good ending. poor. dont buy it."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book is the worst book a reader could read! From the completely awful title which barely reflects the book to the very last page of the book, it is horrible. In general, the book could best be compared with a a bad sandwich. The beginning is awful, making it a piece of moldy bread. When the story jumps to Barbie being 16, it gets good for about 30 pages. This part is fresh and yummy lunch meat and cheese. From then on, it is another piece of green rotting bread.Her childhood is dreadful. The only positive aspect of this section is the introduction. It uses great language to illustrates an interesting picture for the readers. After this, all the details are obviously trying desperately to be full of imagery and metaphors. All it becomes is a shallow mess.Barbie for the most part is a boring character as a child. Though she does magically become clever out of nowhere in the middle. Mab gets very annoying, very fast. But she is a necessary character since she is the only thing in the book that justifies its cheesy title. Mrs. Marks, Barbie's mother, is completely insane. Not to mention she is very immature, between her comments and lack of a life. Her father's story is completely unsurprising.Most of the plot is completely obvious. The main \\"issue\\" of the book is given away one page into the book. Plus, as soon as the reader meets the character the issue is linked with, it is very obvious he or she is the one it is about.The story then jumps to when Barbie is older. As stated, it started out pretty good. The 90's lingo is sure to get a giggle or two. Block attempts to dabble with some parallels between Barbie's childhood and her older years. She gets a few successes with the idea, but it simply turns into a cheesy, \\"oh my goodness! I think I know you,\\" redundant mess.The reader meets Todd who starts out as an amazing character, but slowly fades to an annoying and bland aspect of the story. Barbie follows the same pattern as Todd. However, Mab become more of an enjoyable character in the section.But, after about 25 pages into part two of the story, it goes down hill. T moves far too fast with too many unnecessary lose ends. Plot twists become uninteresting but appear to be an attempt at being surprising. Every bit of it, even up to the very last page, is garbage.In addition, this book contains some sexual themes which get annoying. Especially with Mab who need to call attractive men \\"busicets\\" for some reason. Swearing is a minimum with only a handful of colorful words weaved in.Over all, the book is one of the worst books out there. It has pretty much nothing to do with faeries, and is not a good read. It is simply a mess of shallow teenage-appealed rubbish that is sure to keep readers saying, \\"did a 5th grader write this?!"},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I bought this book for my 15 year old grand daughter and decided to read it before I gave it to her. I did not think the book was well written. It also was very sexually explicit and not appropriate for someone of that age."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"My review is geared more towards parents and/or other adults being asked to buy this book by their children-this book is just plain horrible! This poor young girl, Barbie, has a wretched stage mom, and a completely uninvolved father. She's forced by mom into modeling, left alone at 12, then molested by the photograper!!! Her mom's answer to this is \\"life is full of problems, deal with them\\". Even the fairy, Mab, says horrid things to her, and encourages her at 16 to drink, smoke and have sex!!!I cannot believe this is on middle school reading lists, and I'm no prude, this book shouldn't be suggested to anyone under 16 at least. None of these adult subjects are handled in this book with any sensitivity-just titilation value.Horrible! this book is rancid :(no stars."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"I got this book from the brief summary on the Middle School summer reading list - which sounded pretty good, with a little fantasy, some hard times, some inner strength. Unfortunately, I did not read any of the book before handing it over to my 13 year old to read. After a few hours, and not quite half-way through, she handed over the book and said \\"This is REALLY awful\\". She pointed out to me one of the MANY excerpts of the book with the words \\"F*** you\\" in it. It's all over the book. Then the references to smoking pot, and going to the nightclub and drinking. Then she asked me what it meant when a guy \\"came\\", in reference to what a character was describing in a homosexual fantasy. OK?...GET THE PICTURE?? I am not a prude, and neither is my daughter, but we do have some standards of moral values here.I read some other reviews saying this book was fabulous,(wish I read all the reviews before wasting my money)and all I can wonder is: What kind of home are you people growing up in and just what DOES bother you if this is considered innocuous reading?! The Principal of the school was emailed this info, and I certainly hope she also considers this book as good as GONE from the list."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"This book describes unwanted details. Not all teenagers are oversexed. The characters only mentor, this fairy, is portayed with the air that she is cute and lives a little on the edge and that she's really helping pull this young girl through tough times. Yet this \\"mentor\\" encourages Her to drink and have sex like your not normal if you choose to wait until marriage. Not a good book for any way no matter the age."},{"Title":"I Was a Teenage Fairy","review":"Really did not like this book.

I don't consider myself a beginner knitter but I also don't feel up to knitting an Aran Sweater.. no matter how beautiful they are.The book isn't outdated by any means and there are a lot of interesting patterns for experienced knitters but about two for a beginner.My suggestion is to go to www.lionbrand.com and find free patterns there."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"Using this book helped really seal my addiction to knitting socks and mittens.

I made my first hat from the &quot;Basic Mohair Tam&quot; pattern in this book, and it was gorgeous. There's also a design for a ski-mask sort of item, and patterns for them are hard to find!Designers can overlay their ideas for color or texture on these simple shapes very easily. This book was written to inspire, not to overwhelm.I think this book belongs in the library (or knitting bag) of every knitter who wants to knit any of these items. If you only knit sweaters or afghans, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I am usually pleased with anything done by Interweave Press, and this book is no exception. It is beautifully done - nice photography, clear directions, short bios of the contributors, easy projects, more challenging projects....need I go on? It is printed on nice quality paper, and the book is big enough that it will lie open as you follow the directions on your needles. This book contains a lot of smaller projects that will be great to work on in the summer months (think Christmas!) when I don't want a heavy project on my lap. Some of these projects I have seen in other books, but it is nice to have them here together. A good choice for your home library."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I own lots of knitting books and this one by far is the best. I do a lot of charity knitting and there are lots of patterns I use.

I love this book, need I say more!"},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"These patterns are frumpy and something you'd see on a spinster. All the patterns for caps, socks, mittens, and gloves are just plain dowdy and sad looking with not one happy thread in the color choices either."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I purchased this book used and was pleasantly surprised that there were so many patterns. Hats for all ages, booties for babies, and mittens for all with fiber that is even and uneven (nothing wrong with that!). The handspun used to make these items looks like my own handspun, not perfect - but perfect for me.The patterns are well written, the photos aren't the best, but they're good enough. If you're a novice spinner and you see patterns with multiple colors, you will realize that you can get all the colors you need from one braid of hand dyed fiber. Just pluck the colors you need and off you go.This book is a nice showcase for handspun yarn no matter what your experience level. It will inspire you to work your handspun up (to worsted weight) or down (to lace weight), and to experiment with color."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"This book is out of print but if you can find it, and you knit or you know a knitter, you want it. It is worth it for the baby set alone but sheep mittens and the slipper socks are pretty niffy too. Patterns range from basic garter stitch to color work and fair isle. Don't let the homespun throw you. Purchased yarns are easily substituted. But be careful and get the origional. They have put out a new version with the same name. Have not see that one so can't comment on it. This is about the 1987 edition edited by Linda Ligon.I'm happy with it and plan several more projects out of it.Reviewed by Mrs. James H."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"Someone previously explained that these patterns were \\"Old Fashioned\\", well I can tell you that is a lot of the charm of this book. Not only are the patterns much like those that my Grandmother use to make, but I aspire to be half as good a knitter as she was. The patterns in this book are for all levels of knitters, and although I am not a spinner I get lots of my yarns from both spinners and the craft store. The illustartions are beautiful and clear, and the instructions are well documented and easy to follow. Lots of helping hints in the side notes too. This would make a fantastic gift for any level of knitter. It was given to me as a gift long ago and as my level of understanding of knitting goes up, I start to do more and more projects. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in knitting, and wanting to explore different knitting techniques."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"this is a fine book i bought years ago.Recently i ordered it from Amazon used for a friend as it is out of print. it has many fun usable projects. Linda Ligon gives good solid instruction that really take the reader/knitter through the steps to a successful project. A friend who is a splendid knitter told me recently that she learned how to knit socks from this book! It is especially helpful that this book addresses the issues of home spun wool. I know of no book out there today that provides specifics for spinners, good solid instructions and provides basic, beautiful projects real people can wear."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"If you are a knitter and spinner, I think this is a nice book to have with some nice patterns."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I discovered this book as a beginning spinner, and I was thrilled with the opportunity to see so many different small projects which would let me experiment with a variety of yarns. I soon realized that I kept coming back to it for information on knitting techniques, for inspiration for gifts, and for the well designed small projects. The editors inspired me to branch out in my knitting, to try hats and socks, and to try new techniques in my spinning as well. Although each project is designed by a spinner for handspun yarn (and includes information on spinning a suitable yarn), the editors also provide excellent recommendations for substituting commercially available yarns"},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I really like this book. There are projects that even children can knit, as well as challenges for the experienced knitter. This book was written as much to showcase the skill of the spinners as to show off the designs.They are not &quot;primitive&quot; designs, as one reviewer called them, but rather on the classic/practical side. As in actually worn by people to keep warm--imagine that! Since most of them are in natural yarn colors for the most part, it is easy to see why someone who is used to the latest &quot;big bucks&quot; manmade yarns often featured in most of the magazines these days might not like them.The book does offer guidance on substituting commercial yarns for these designs, so you can use whatever you like, and the designs will look quite differently. IMHO, the only difference between Vogue Knits and other patterns out there is the fact that it says Vogue, and that the yarns almost always cost a bundle.This book is great for anyone who doesn't like knitting huge projects such as sweaters and afghans, which seem to take forever. Many of the projects in this book work up quickly and are quite portable, making them great for traveling or waiting. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"The instructions, from various knitters, are easy to understand and follow. The resulting projects all have turned out beautifully, and I have made many of them several times. Favorites are often requested by family and friends. There is no better way to share warm feelings than by giving warm fingers. This book has been a mainstay of mine for nearly 10 years."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"I hate buying knitting books! You spend 20 bucks on an entire book because you're in love with 1 or 2 patterns. This book was different. I did buy it for 1 or 2 patterns, but have made a bunch of them now. The patterns are not at all difficult, and are easy to vary a little with color or size so not all projects look the same. They are also pretty easily personalized.I use this book as a way to use up my leftover yarn from other projects, and it works out great! I especially love the mushroom cap and mittens. There is a nice balance between single color patterns and multi-color patterns; easy and difficult; small needle/thin yarn and bulky with big needles. You use this if you are a beginner, and still find a challenge in it when you are experienced.I've had to photocopy some of the pages to keep in my knitting bags because, like most knitters I usually have 4-5 projects going at once. 2 or 3 of them are from this book! Plus, I used the book so much it's getting a little worn.Don't be hesitant to invest in this book, because the variety of patterns will keep you going back to it again and again."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"Opening &quot;Homespun, Handknit&quot; is like sitting down with Grandma for a knitting lesson. This unpretentious little book's beautiful color photos of knitted hats, socks, gloves and mittens warms you up just by reading it. Once you pick up your knitting needles, you're hooked!There are beautiful patterns here for every skill level, with projects small enough to tackle in a weekend and challenging enough to engage your intellect as well as your fingers.I can't wait for snow to fall--I'll be the lady cozied under the afghan, knitting up a &quot;Homespun, Handknit&quot; storm."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"If you are a handspinner of wool yarns, this book is an invaluable resource. Many patterns written for use with commercial yarns simply don't work with handspun. The patterns in this little book are classic, adaptable, and well suited to the special characteristics of hand made yarns, which tend to be less elastic and \\"drapey\\" than factory products. They also work well when knitted oversize and then felted. I refer to Homespun Handknit frequently, and the family mitten pattern is one I've made in homespun dozens of times, always with excellent results."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"This book is great because the projects are simple, useful, classic, and practical. Beginner knitters can tackle many of the projects, but there are plenty of complicated designs to keep more advanced knitters busy.The designs are classics that won't go out of style, which is important for a knitting book. I've also found that I've been inspired by the projects in this book to experiment with new methods and yarns. The photos are also very nice and very helpful in choosing a design.The finished products will appeal almost anyone; I've also made a lot of gifts using this book!"},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"As a novice knitter, I found this book to be right on target with my abilities and interests. Many knitting books that I've seen have had one or two patterns that I would consider trying, but this book has about a dozen that I can't wait to get started on! Contains simple directions for basics and some variations (swirl pattern mittens that could be made as tube socks, for example). The directions include the weight of the yarn so that you can substitute what you find locally, you don't need to buy specific (expensive!) yarn to do these projects. Directions are clear and concise, easy to follow. Plenty of clear photographs of finished items, charts, etc. Also has plenty of \\"tips\\" on how to do certain techniques (like sock heels) and extras for finishing your items. If you're looking for a book that has great basic patterns as well as projects using more advanced techniques, this book will fit the bill!!"},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"One of my favorite knitting books. It has practical, classic designs which are interesting, though simple enough for a beginner. I find the projects to be truly &quot;portable&quot; ie, not just small enough to tuck into your bag and carry with you, but uncomplicated enough to take out and knit a few rows waiting in line at the supermarket or the bank. Great source for small gifts that can be made up in a short time as the occasion demands."},{"Title":"Homespun Handknit","review":"This is a nice book with pretty simple patterns, good for a beginner. The projects look a little primitive compared to a book by say Vogue, but that's fine for some of us. Happy Knitting!"},{"Title":"Who Named the Daisy? Who Named the Rose?","review":"The author loosely applies the label \\"North American Wildflower\\" to all blossoms now running free on our continent.

The books are a good clean exciting christian read. \\"Forgotten\\" had that extra element of excitement and interest for me the idea of making Jennie lose her memory was a really good idea and kept u on the edge of your seat.

I found that she is a lot like her characters. The first book I ever read was #3. It was addicting. I had to start from the beginning.

They're not anything like the Nancy Drew books, because Jennie McGrady is more life-like, I think, than ND, who is more animated. I would recommend starting at the beginning with TOO MANY SECRETS(Just so you know what's going on in the following books!). FORGOTTEN is probably the most exciting of these books, though.

Here and in the Hereafter","review":"Dannion Brinkley has had several encounters with 'the other side' through his near-death experiences. The wealth of information gained from these experiences is what he shares in his books.In 'Saved by the Light', the intensity of the experience is what percolated through to me; the fact that an ordinary person, with no particular claim to spirituality, could have such a totally transforming, other worldly experience, after being struck by lightning. The visions that he had, extraordinarily enough, seemed secondary, maybe the authors intended it to look that way. In the sequel, 'At Peace in the Light', Dannion Brinkley describes his attempt to ground the experience. This is done by his attempts to establish the centers that he envisioned, and, more explicitly, his hospice work, where, he guided people in their transition from this life to 'the other side'. In 'Secrets of the Light', Dannion's latest and most esoteric book, he makes an attempt to display the perspective and wisdom gained from three decades of working with 'the Light'.The above is what gives this book an other worldly dimension, making it seem anchored in a different reality, that sees our earthly struggles from a different viewpoint than the win-lose game that we play. This is done very skilfully by Dannion, whose efforts have been expertly supplemented by his wife and co-author, journalist Kathryn Peters. There is not an iota of a holier-than- thou attitude in the book, not the slightest glimmer of self righteousness. It strongly negates subtle notions and impressions that most of us conjure up and live with, 'spiritual people do not fall ill', 'when one has had access to what is happening behind the scenes, one is protected from misfortune' , and so on. This book bears ample testimony to the fact that the above concepts do not apply, at least to Dannion Brinkley, who despite his more than extraordinary experiences makes no light of his earthly struggles with pain and illness. Somewhere, in the book, he even mentions our spiritual arrogance when we decided to incarnate at this time in this world, knowing fully well of the obstacles we would face.Nevertheless, the material is not at all heavy reading. It is replete with humor and jokes directed at the author, and despite the suffering and self searching, is adequately interspersed with a sense of the love and acceptance that Life is known to bequeath us all. Reading this book renewed for me the sense of belonging that our daily grind and 'promises to keep' keep taking away.The last chapter of this book is a vision of what the immediate future holds for us, earthlings. This is the sensational part of the book and though it tests one's credulity, the drama is underplayed, by the short coverage it receives. The major statement of this book, as I see it, seems to be 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof'.A book to treasure, to read and to reread"},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"I'm eternally grateful to Dannion Brinkley for having written his books and sharing his three NDEs... amazing stories. He comes down on the side of challenging times ahead, backed by the accuracy (so far) of 117 predictions the \\"Council of Thirteen\\" has given him, along with the forecast. Not all in depth NDEs do so. I'm not 100% sure of \\"channeled\\" entities such as Abraham, Adam and Pursah. Could it be that those on the other side are as subjective as we? Nonetheless, Dannion gives us what he believes is a set of \\"rules\\" to live by, useful, I'm sure. I kind of like to figure out my own \\"guidelines\\" based upon the facts as shared by various authors. To me, the facination of NDEs comes from the sharing of the description, not from the preaching that follows."},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"I have read all of Dannion's books and this is by far the best! Dannion has an intimate relationship with theSpiritual Realm and Spiritual Truth that is unparalleled among writers in this milieu. Dannion offers sincere, heart felt, hard won wisdom on the practice of Spiritual maturity. This book is not those who are looking forsuperficial titillation, but rather for those who are in earnest about living a deeper life of transformational Truth and Power.Vaishali, author of \\"You Are What You Love\\""},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life...

Here and in the Hereafter","review":"Dannion Brinkley has one mission: to dispel the fear of death. He does this by sharing his experience of what it's like on the other side. He should know, as he so humorously states. After all, he's already experienced death three times! (I wonder if he holds the record for the most NDEs in one life.)In this third book he's written about his experience, he reveals information which, as he says, he was reluctant to share before. That is the story of the souls who are stuck, wandering in limbo, who have yet to complete their journey. Witnessing their state inspired Dannion to outline the secrets of divine living that can help us now and in our transition to the other side. To read Dannion's accounts is to catch a glimpse of the unknown so we can start preparing now."},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"I found Dannion Brinkley's 3rd book, in his own \\"spiritual trilogy\\", \\"The Secrets Of The Light\\" - to be a wonderful addition to what his first two memorable books delivered. His words once again, take the sting out of death and what is awaiting for all of us beyond this worldly life. The book will also help empower those who pay attention to the many pearls of truth and wisdom that he drops throughout the entire book.This book will take you a little further along on the journey that he started with readers in both \\"Saved By The Light\\" and \\"At Peace In The Light\\". An interesting prediction in the book (published in 2004) states that the price of oil would go up to $150 a barrel by 2008. Today as I write this (June 26, 2008) it has gone over $140 and seems full of steam to head higher!The better part of his book is the last few chapters as he talks about \\"The Seven Truths\\" and goes into some detailed comments on them. Lots of gold in those pages for serious readers. In some ways, this is his best book to date. The actual writing style seems softer and more loving- and it enhances the message of love that seems to underline his over-all theme.The work that Dannion does for the dying is very well known; however, he is also actively working with PTSD veterans. He is one of the National Projects Directors for the Veteran's Village.I give this book my personal and fullest endorsement - a must read for all spiritual seekers and those looking for self-realization![...]"},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"I was gifted this book two years ago, by Dannion himself, at a Conference in Sedona, Arizona. Of all of my books in my library, this is one that I never lend out to anyone. When I need to share it with someone, I just buy them their own copy. It is a book that I continue to go back to again, and again. I highlighted more passages in this book than in any other book I own. I love the Wisdom of the Seven Truths that Dannion has included in this book. And on page 121, Dannion lists a way of being health conscious so as to take care of our Earthly body, and it is done so lovingly. My life was definitely empowered after reading this book, and integrating those spiritual strategies that Dannion spoke of, into my daily life. Thank you, Dannion, for the gift of your teachings! Thank you, Amazon!Love and light,Charmaine"},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"Highly recommended! Dannion knows what he's talking about when he says we are \\"great, powerful and mighty spiritual beings with dignity, direction and purpose\\". He's been killed three times (dead an astounding 28 minutes the first time) and nearly died a fourth.Having been to the other side and back, having contributed to Dr. Raymond Moody's research into near death and death experiences, and having personally sat with a few hundred veterans as they crossed over into the next phase of their eternal lives, Dannion knows what he's talking about! In this book, he gives you the scoop on the wisdom he's brought back with him about what's real and what's not. These are seven simple principles to remember as you go about your life, written clearly and sprinkled with lots of stories as well as Dannion's spitfire personality (you can almost hear his Southern coastal accent as you read).A must-read and a must-reread to glide through the crazy turmoil that appears to be happening now in the world around us."},{"Title":"The Secrets of the Light: Spiritual Strategies to Empower Your Life... Here and in the Hereafter","review":"I largely purchased this booked based on the good reviews of it on amazon, as well as a seperate extended raving review on a different website by one of the same reviewers. While the actual true life story of Dannion Brinkley is fascinating, the book really is not. I do appreciate his straight forward style and his sense of sincerity. However, its not that interesting of a read. In fact, I made it roughly 1/2 way through, and I havent really picked it up again. Its just too boring (which I feel it shouldnt be based on his life story thus far). I pick it up and read it here and there.The overall style, despite the candid and sincere approach, is very corny and new agey. I can only see really enjoying this book, if you are for the first time exploring such concepts as the life after death state, have had an NDE yourself, or are for soem other reason all hyped up for the topic. I give the book topic and story behind it 5 stars, but the actual read and style I give 2 stars. I was dissapointed. Maybe my hopes were too high for this book. Its for corny new age types. Also, I give the cover 10 stars. Its SO bad, thats its good!Also...Way too overpriced.. Which probably adds to my dissapointment. I would not have been as bummed had I paid a few bucks for it.

An extensive detailed collection of essays chronicling such events as the Lakota struggle for the Black Hills, an acute perspective on the Navajo-Hopi land dispute, a stringent presentation of the American Indian diaspora, and more, make Struggle For The Land a core addition to community and academic Native American Studies collections."},{"Title":"Struggle for the Land: Native North American Resistance to Genocide, Ecocide, and Colonization","review":"I found this book to be very well put together and supported with mountains of evidence. Recently Mr Churhcill has come under fire from the right for some remarks he has made in the classroom. This does not surprise me since this book is a rather damning indictment of past american treatment of native americans.I was interested in this book for it's environmental implications since that is my field. Regardless, I found myself more and more interested in the humanitarian issues contained within as the book marched on. So, while I lack the socio-ethical background to provide any in depth critique of those issues, I will say that it is well put together, is interesting, and won my sympathy.All in all definately one of the better books I've read."},{"Title":"Threads of Love","review":"I picked this up in hopes that it was written by one of my favorite authors, but was hugely dissapointed. The writing is just not very polished at all. It was written in the sixties, so might be seen as a vaguely interesting artifact from that time, but there are much better books that can give you the flavor of the sixties. I believe that this is a first book, as it seems to hit many of the cliches of romance. The characters are okay, but nothing special, and the plot is so cliched as to be embarrasing. I honestly cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Spanish for School Personnel","review":"The review talked about the CD-ROM and work book that comes with the book.

His novels are not of the &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; variety and this novel is vintage L'Amour. It is a story of revenge, and the strength of one woman's resolve to avenge the death of her young brother. But it is L'Amour's skillful use of flashback sequences which defines this book. The tale is actually told from the point-of-view of a man whose parents were killed causing him to spend three years living with Apaches, as well as time in Europe and as a Union Officer in the Civil War. It is his story as much as hers and it should be obvious that this is a complicated plot. But L'Amour successfully pulls it off. L'Amour's storys are always &quot;real&quot; in that the locations are real places and many of the characters are historical. Few historians are as knowledgable of this era as L'Amour, and it shows in his novels. Enjoy reading Kiowa Trail!"},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"It's difficult to give voice to characters in the Old West without making it sound almost like a parody. However, with his expertise and acumen actor Ron McLarty brings Louis L'Amour's characters to life with authenticity and vitality.Men of the Tumbling B were tough, having survived hardship and danger during a recent cattle drive. The town they came to is described thusly:\\"The town to which we had come was ten buildings long on the north side of the street, and seven long on the south, with stock corrals to the east, and a Boot Hill on the west, and in between an edging from the mills of hell.South of the street were the shacks of the girls, and north of it the homes of the respectable businessmen of the town, where no trail driver was permitted to go.\\"In that last sentence lay the problem. Foreman Conn Dury had made that clear to his men - they were forbidden to go on the north side of town. However, temptation in the form of Linda McDonald, was too much for Tom Lundy, and he paid with his life.His sister, Kate, owner of the Tumbling B well knew that the townsfolk liked the money the cowboys brought in, but disparaged the men. That was one thing; her brother's murder was quite another. She determined to get revenge for his killing, but at what price?This is one more Western adventure as only L'Amour could write them. Enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"The main plot is revenge. The people in a small town, controled by a ruthless man, murder a young man. The young man's sister, Kate, wants revenge but not in the way the town people expect. She leases the land around the town and fences it in with barbed wire and no cattle herd is allowed through....she wants the whole town to die. The main character is Conn Dury and the story is told from his POV, in many flashbacks his story is told from his childhood and through this war with the town, Kate being the woman he loves and her brother the son he never had. This story has well crafted characters and is an epic story not fully realised, told much too simply. Though not a bad novel it's a long way from being as good as it could have been. Still, I enjoyed reading it and let my imagination fill in what I felt was missing."},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"This was a gift for my Dad last Christmas. He loves western books.

The plot is somewhat generic (a group of rough-around-the-edges cowboys clash with peace-loving townfolk and a fight ensues), but what makes this one stand out from the pack is the fascinating back-story of Conn Dury and his voice as narrator. L'Amour was so immersed in the culture of the West, lines like, \\"Two men had fallen before Comanche rifles, but the Comanches sang their death songs in the light of a hollow moon, and the Kiowas mourned in their lodges for warriors who fell before the guns of the Tumbling B,\\" roll so naturally off his tongue you get the sense that you are audience to the real thing - a true cowboy from the Old West. If you enjoy Louis L'Amour, this is one of his best. If you have never rode a trail with L'Amour, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"Kate Lundy has driven her cattle herd from Texas up the Kiowa Trail to a Kansas cowtown. With her have come her hard-bitten foreman Conn Dury, and her brother, Tom Lundy. When young Tom ventures north of the street to see his sweetheart, where no cowboy is permitted to go, he unwittingly ignites all-out war between Kate's ranch hands and the townsfolk.Early in his career, Louis L'Amour wrote a short story called \\"End of the Drive.\\" Although it had some of L'Amour's most beautiful and poetic language, its characters were lifeless, its plot limp, and it had no interesting female characters. The story was deservedly unpublished at the time. In 1964, L'Amour dusted off the story, reworked it, expanded it into a novel, and published it as Kiowa Trail, which may well be the best novel L'Amour ever wrote. Comparing the short story with the novel is a powerful testament to how good a critic of his own work L'Amour was, and how well he could rectify the original story's weaknesses while enhancing its strengths.L'Amour obviously recognized the lack of female character power in \\"End of the Drive\\" and attacked the problem head on. Kate Lundy is one of the most memorable heroines in pre-feminist Western literature. She rides a wagon right along with her cowboys, and when Indians attack she shoots back with her buffalo gun. But what makes her a distinctly feminine character is the trait she shares with thousands of frontier women who helped tame the West without ever firing a gun: unshakeable endurance. Absolutely nothing can make Kate Lundy quit - not even the combined guns of an entire town.The novel is essentially two stories in one: Kate Lundy's battle with the townsmen mixed with Conn Dury's autobiography. This is an extremely difficult trick to pull off - most attempts end up with one story feeling like a distraction from the central tale - but L'Amour balances the two narratives flawlessly.The most remarkable thing about Kiowa Trail is how it simultaneously adopts and subverts the conventions of Western stories. The conflict between city folk and country folk is central to hundreds of Western novels. Conventionally, cities are shown as solvents of moral values, corrupting their citizens into a degenerate, libertine, relativistic lot, while rural dwellers' traditional values are shown as superior: more honest, virile and hard-working. L'Amour's tale is also of conflict between city dwellers and rural people, and again the rural people embodied in the cowboys are the heroes. But at the same time, he turns the convention on its head. Here the city represents traditional morality: sexually repressed, rigidly divided by class and wealth, denying individuals' liberty to direct their own lives, choose their friends and lovers, or even to (literally!) cross the street. Kate Lundy and her cowboys hold to a newer, younger creed of personal liberty, freedom to better themselves, and refusal to respect class distinctions.L'Amour also inverts ordinary sexual conventions: Kate Lundy, the sexually experienced widow, is the heroine, while the virginal, \\"pure\\" Linda McDonald is an icy-hearted villain. L'Amour would only go so far with this assault on convention: even Kate won't go \\"all the way\\" with Conn until they're married. But in an age before birth control Kate's behavior is common sense, not just religious or cultural prejudice.Here, clearly, in the midst of the 1960s' battles between young and old, is L'Amour's effort to ensure the survival of the Western novel. L'Amour meant to show the youth of that turbulent decade that they, too, shared values with the cowboys and had something to learn from their frontier forebears. All this, in the context of the rollicking action and excitement of a traditional Western story. Few Western authors since L'Amour have had the same skill or vision."},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"Conn Dury has been living with Kate on her ranch for how long? Ten years? Fourteen years? Oh, well, a long time. And he loves her desperately. So why hasn't he married her? Because he never could find the right words? So they've mended fences together and branded cattle and fought Indians, just like a married couple, but he can't find the right words? Come on! Besides this flaw in the plot, there are a host of others. There are too many different villains, too many flashbacks, too many fast forwards, and too many digressions. I knew that Conn and Kate would beat the bad guys in the end, but by the time they finally wrapped it up, my only reaction was \\"Whatever!\\""},{"Title":"Kiowa Trail","review":"I read this book after reading the review of others. I have to say this book will not go into my library of books to keep. I really expected alot better from this author, since his books continue to sell despite his death.The book had little action, and did not excite me. I found the confrontation at the end to be the most exciting part of the book! Really thought it could of used more action throughout.Most of the book was building its way to the final 4 chapters, guess what I am trying to say was that I was really just plain disappointed by this author."},{"Title":"Orchid House","review":"Very captivating. A psychological/suspenseful thriller. Once you start reading the book, its hard to put it down. The characters in the book are very fascinating with their deep dark secrets and emotions that the author explored without any inhibition.Murder, mystery and love are intertangled in this drama, which though maybe a little far fetched, kept the book interesting. It was hard to pinpoint the suspect and there were a few different stories going on at the same time, all of them eventually converging at one point.Not much of a mystery book reader, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Orchid House","review":"This was an excellent book, especially for a first effort.

This is a clear and penetrating study of both Kierkegaard's own work and the way that it can be used to address current issues in moral philosophy.

Rather than choosing sides in what often becomes a simplistic debate, Theberge provides a balanced account that, uniquely, puts digital instruments in a broad social and historical perspective. This book has much to recommend it, but the high points for me are the last several chapters, in which Theberge formulates a theory of how instruments work not only practically but symbolically, that goes beyond almost any other book on the subject. As such, &quot;Any Sound You Can Imagine&quot; is heady stuff, but it's also accessibly written. Anyone who thinks they know something about electronic music, whether it be techno or the electronic avant garde, should read this book and see how many of their assumptions are left standing at the end."},{"Title":"Any Sound You Can Imagine: Making Music/Consuming Technology (Music Culture)","review":"An exceedingly well researched and elegantly written text explaining the social and cultural impact of electronic music and especially synthesizer technology on musicians of all levels.

The beauty is in the details, however, as he builds up concept after concept working with the simplest of actual language examples. Joint projects, common ground, grounding, layering, double tracking are some of the top level gems that popped out at me as he demonstrated them. But Clark finds little regularities, rules, and trade-offs at all levels. Every couple of pages brought out a new generality or a new insight. The book made me work and think a lot, but it was hugely worth it. Clark is very clear that his theory is about the usage rather than the structure of language. All us conversationalists know that there are tons of little messages and social adjustments in every utterance; Clark brings these situations and language strategies out like walking into a planetarium to see stars."},{"Title":"Using Language","review":"I have already read some Clark's papers.

This book is a wonderful resource I recommend without hesitation for anyone who is considering taking lessons, or shopping for their first horse. While it is geared to the new horse owner, it's full of information that even the most experienced owners and riders will find valuable.The photos and illustrations have clear 'before' and 'after', 'right' and 'wrong' examples, the language is conversational and easy to understand without being simplistic. The 'Did You Know' boxes and Pop Quizzes are clear, pointed, and friendly.I especially like the questionnaires and check lists on evaluating professionals in the industry. Farriers, vets, riding instructors, trainers, and even tack shops. I know the beginning horseman is often lost in these areas and at the mercy of shysters or incompetents. As a lifelong horseman, it is heartbreaking to see, over and again, the excitement of that first horse turn into frustration and anger as the owner realizes the horse is not suitable, possibly dangerous and in many cases not even ridable. Ms Snyder-Smith offers the reader specific points to look for, either to embrace or avoid, giving those new to the industry the ability to make informed decisions with her evaluations and questionnaires."},{"Title":"The All-Around Horse and Rider","review":"Really enjoying reading this, as well as getting lots of useful info out of it.The section on balance over rough ground alone was worth the price.Compare price of book to a single 1hr lesson ..."},{"Title":"The All-Around Horse and Rider","review":"The All-Around Horse And Rider by Donna Snyder Smith makes me wish I could go back and do my equestrian life all over again... to do it right!

Once I owned a horse, I read a number of \\"how-to\\" books... but I found it difficult to put the information into actuality. Enter The All- Around Horse And Rider...

I am constantly quoting chapters out of the book to some first time horse owners and some very experienced owners to help guide them in their decisions when it comes to the health and happiness of their horse as well as finding a cost effective way to solve their equine/equestrian problems. When you own a horse the chapter \\"When to ask for help and how and where to find it\\" can save you thousands of dollars and perhaps even from serious injury/accident. I have a few clients who just love to ride but don't want to show, and Ms. Snyder-Smith gives lots of alternatives as to fun activities you can do with your horse, that don't involve showing. It is an excellent reference book, even for the experienced horse owner who did not get a good foundation.

WILD AT HEART opened my eyes to the possibility of doing something so seemingly crazy. TALKING WITH HORSES and THE HORSES OF PROUD SPIRIT along with many of the comments by horse rescuers, and people such as Dyan of Missouri Foxtrotters A - Z have been the wings beneath my wings, if you will, for this voyage. The forementioned are a stand for the wellbeing of horses, coming from a place of compassion and kindness. Just like the Dahli Lama says when asked what his religion is - he replies \\"Kindness\\". Donna Snyder-Smith's book seems directly opposite. First, it is a 'school text book', with too many uses of the word 'obedience' to be a stand for the welfare of horses. Two, it is geared to winning.

NO SECRETS, NO LIES: HOW BLACK FAMILIES CAN HEAL FROM SEXUAL ABUSE by Robin D. Stone, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, is a book that discloses the actual stories as told by the victims. In each chapter, Stone provides us with self-help instructions in overcoming such a devastating act of violence.In most cases of sexual abuse, the victim is ignored or made to believe that what happened was just their imagination. Children are easy prey because the perpetrator can easily entice them with money, candy or toys, etc. The perpetrator can be anyone - a family member, the next-door neighbor, a school employee or the well-respected member of the church. Threats of bodily harm to the victim or members of his/her family, aids the perpetrator in committing this violation.We are all under the assumption that only women are sexually abused, but there are a vast number of men who are abused by men and in some cases women. Most males do not report that they have been abused because of the label placed on them by society as growing up and becoming gay. They also deal with issues concerning their masculinity and have feelings of being inadequate and vulnerable.Once a victim has revealed that they have been sexually abused, some are shunned by family members or made to feel that what happened was their fault. Victims with understanding family members, such in the case of Ms. Stone, sometimes years later, still suffer from being abused. Through Stone's self-help guides at the end of each chapter, and each survivor that shares their story, victims of sexual abuse will understand that what happened was not their fault.This book was an eye opener for me because it brings to the forefront the effects that being sexually abused can have on the victims. Even after the abuse has stopped, victims continue to suffer. NO SECRETS NO LIES: HOW BLACK FAMILIES CAN HEAL FROM SEXUAL ABUSE was very informative and lists many resources for use by victims of sexual abuse.(...)"},{"Title":"No Secrets, No Lies: How Black Families Can Heal from Sexual Abuse","review":"Review of No Secrets, No Lies: How Black Families Can Heal From Sexual Abuse by Robin D. Stone, 2004, Broadway Books, NY. Hardcover ISBN 0- 7679-1344-2The author of No Secrets, No Lies is a survivor of sexual assault. She has been an editor for Essence magazine, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Detroit Free Press, and Family Circle. She also teaches journalism at New York University. This impressive writing experience is evident in her clear, concise, compassionate, and culturally enlightening work: No Secrets, No Lies. Throughout the book, Stone offers \\"Fast Facts\\" in the margin, adding relevant material to the readers' knowledge. For example, Stone states, \\"Blacks are sexually victimized in childhood at the same rate as Whites. In one survey, they reported being more severely abused with greater force.\\" Stone cites her sources in an extensive \\"notes\\" section. She also offers a valuable resource list and index.The title of the first chapter is: \\"Was It Sexual Abuse?\\" Stone writes, \\"For many of us, we have buried sexual abuse so deep into our psyches that we would never connect it to today's physical illnesses and pain, our depression or addiction, our inability to hold a job, get out of debt, find satisfaction in a relationship, nurture our children, or simply say no to people or situations that do us harm.\\" Indeed. No matter the gender, race, religion, socio-economic class, or ethnicity, victims of sexual abuse will experience the devastating ramifications. Victims suffer initially with the abuse, then again with each result that limits our human potential. Stone tells the reader: \\"in addition to the trauma of sexual violation, survivors must also deal with the trauma of being born and raised in a racist and sexist culture.\\" And therein lies the roots of our troubled society.Stone offers case examples in each chapter. We read about Kim, who says, \\"I'm always afraid that people will leave if they see the real me.\\" The \\"real me\\" is the child who was molested by her stepfather until she was nineteen; even as a young woman, he slapped her for resisting. Kim's mother kicked Kim out of the house, leaving Kim to fend for herself with friends. Kim learns that a relative had sexually abused her mother. This addresses the frightening fact that perpetration is all too often generational.The author incorporates the limitations placed upon Black survivors. \\"When Blacks seek help from White institutions [they] find little sympathy or understanding.\\" \\"Blacks [have] a deep mistrust of a majority White medical profession. Blacks have been slow to embrace traditional therapy.\\" \\"We often find ourselves sitting across from a counselor who hasn't a clue about the complexities of our culture, our history, and our challenges, and who can only see our problems solely from a White or middle-class perspective.\\" However, Stone encourages counseling: \\"We have historically turned to our own support systems...sister circles...but for many of us the problems associated with being sexually abused run far too deep for untrained experts to help us tackle them in a meaningful way.\\" Stone tells the reader: \\"...experts have developed multicultural approaches to therapy that incorporate the values, customs, and traditions of non-Whites.\\" In chapter four, Stone suggests methods to finding \\"African-Centered Healing.\\" Stone uses a statement from Rhonda Wells-Wilbon, a social work professor and sexual assault survivor, to define \\"African-Centered\\" as: \\"using Africa as a geographical and cultural starting point for the study of African people.\\" Stone then shares Rhonda Wells-Wilbon's Aya Model: Ten Steps Toward Healing\\" for a culturally sensitive method.At the end of each chapter, the author offers a \\"Help Yourself\\" section. In chapter 5, \\"Protecting and Saving Our Children,\\" Stone tells the reader to \\"act on suspicion\\" and \\"get involved.\\" She also offers \\"The Child's Bill of Rights.\\" In the final chapter, \\"Reconciliation...and Moving On\\" Stone offers exercises to confront an abuser, if the victim finds it necessary for healing.review by Lynn C. Tolson"},{"Title":"No Secrets, No Lies: How Black Families Can Heal from Sexual Abuse","review":"Robin D. Stone, a former executive with Essence Magazine, Boston Globe and New York Times has covered every possible aspect and cause of sexual abuse in her newly released book, \\"No Secrets, No Lies - How Black Families Can Heal from Sexual Abuse.\\" She accurately discusses the reasons and terrifying consequences that are plaguing numerous African-American families that have suffered from sexual assault. The powerful resource guide seeks to assist families to thoroughly understand, prevent and overcome the devastating impact of sexual abuse on adult survivors.Ms. Stone, an abuse survivor herself, realistically has written a one of a kind book that addresses the physical, emotional and psychological scarring and horrific effects of sexual abuse within the dysfunctional family. Through a collection of powerful and deep personal interviews with abuse victims, abusers and additional family members, \\"No secrets, No Lies\\" speaks out to survivors, parents, caregivers, family members and friends designating and furnishing detailed and practical steps for imperative healing.The book is divided into three distinct parts. It covers immensely important material on the background and \\"WHYS\\" of child sexual abuse, interviews with more than thirty survivors and then easy to follow guidelines by professional experts who work with and treat the survivor and the abuser. Included also are compelling advice, poignant anecdotes, as well as contact information for legal help, therapists and advocacy groups throughout the USA. It provides invaluable insight necessary for overcoming and understanding the horrific, overwhelming experiences and effects for recovery and resolution.This book is an eye opener that sexual abuse is wide spread, vastly occurring and must be recognized. The sexual abuser must be reported to the proper authorities, regardless of who it is because this is a criminal offense. The offense should be dealt with, the abuser charged and the acts eradicated for the sake of the innocent victim, the child. No longer should this evil atrocity be kept silent.Readincolor ReviewerEmily Means Willis"},{"Title":"No Secrets, No Lies: How Black Families Can Heal from Sexual Abuse","review":"This book clearly shows how sexually abused non-white women are still forced into a double bind.

There is an appreciation of the words that cluster around each poem, fighting to be included. This is not to indicate that the poems are minimalist in any sense, but rather that they carry no unnecessary baggage. The heart of the vision stands clear and unencumbered.Most of the poems are personal. Ms. Garren writes about what she knows and what she feels, but she does so in such a way that a broader context is conveyed to the reader. She does not become everywoman, but rather someone we already know, perhaps ourselves.from &quot;Picinc&quot;I saw my dead one, my unborn, wearing her dark swamp hairwave to me from a place on the grass.

He then takes you through Draw, 7 Card Stud, Hold 'Em and Omaha. He does a good job of introducing you to some of the differences between a casino and a home game. This can help the novice player feel a bit more comfortable when sitting down at a table. Then, he goes on to the 15 Winning Concepts of Poker as well as an introduction to bluffing and discusses money managment.His analysis of Draw and 7 Card Stud are very good. He skimps a bit on Hold 'Em and Omaha. His rather abbreviated discussion of these two popular forms is why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.If you follow the advice in the book, you will become a bit of an A-B-C player (a tight player who plays the same hands the same ways), but you can expand as you get more comfortable."},{"Title":"How to Play Winning Poker","review":"Avery Cardoza writes another winner.

As he can't get his plane out of the cornfield until harvest, it only makes sense to help Kaylee, the widow who runs the farm, with the help of her kids.He doesn't realize that a clash between local warlords has created a very real danger for Kaylee's family, the farm, and the entire community. Robert must fly his new family to safety. In the process, he finds himself right smack-dab in the middle of the warring factions as both sides envision the addition of the Hellcat to their battles of sword and sorcery.The plot to \\"Flight of the Hellcat\\" reminds me of \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" However, Mr. Cross' obvious love of airplanes and detailed depiction of an alien culture lift the story above the line of old-style time travel. I was impressed by the way he handled the concept of bigotry without vilifying or sanctifying characters on either side of the age-old problem. His characters are people, combining warts, sulks, and sweetness in a convincing fashion. While the story changes direction several times, it doesn't drag or lose its interest.Even now, a couple of weeks after I read it, \\"Flight of the Hellcat\\" lingers in my mind.

It is meant for parents and teachers and is done in an easy to read and succinct manner. It touches on every aspect of sensory integration. You will find information here on smell, taste, touch, vision, the effect of the environment in general, and more. It wone me over with the sentence All children need discipline. It has been my experience that many parents whose children receive a diagnosis of anything that affects behavior, simply throw up their hands in resignation and say \\"There is nothing I can do, he/she has _______________. This benefits no one, least of all the child. I always wonder if these parents have ever considered that their child will one day be an adult, with these same issues and their lives will be more difficult than it has to be. It is hard work to raise any child, more difficult when the child needs a little extra help. The information in this book will help the parents identify possible problems and give suggestions on how to begin to help their child.There is a lot of very useful information here, as well as explanations. It is not a book that says do this, because I say so, it is one that says do this, and here is why. It tells you how to do it, when to do it and gently guides you through the difficulties that you will face while you do it.I work in a special needs school. None of my own children had issues of this kind. I see sensory issues on a daily basis, often exhibited in the most extreme ways. I have attended in-services on sensory integration, and work with it every day.Helping Hyperactive Kids- A Sensory Integration Approach is a book is meant to address these issues in typical children, but I feel that it is also a valuable resource for me, and the team that I work with.

Blake for Reader Views (9/07)A basic introduction to the approach of sensory integration is presented in this collaborative effort, \\"Helping Hyperactive Kids,\\" by Lynn J. Horowitz and Cecile Rost. Written for the layperson as well as the professional, the book gives a better understanding and insight into the behavioral patterns and factors that might cause the hyperactive behavior of the child. The book includes a study of how the brain works, and helps the reader in their understanding the main sensory systems, of balance, touch, hearing, sight, feeling, taste, and smell.The purpose and process of sensory integration therapy are developed and include the environment and atmosphere needed to make the treatment a success, play as therapy, and the structure of the treatment.The tips for dealing with the hyperactive child are especially designed to help the parent. They include tips on communicating, organizing, and nurturing calmness. The tips also provide suggestions for giving directions, for adapting toys and games and for negotiating in the classroom.Well-documented with complete endnotes, a sequential format, a complete table of contents, a helpful index, and detailed case studies make this book a useful reference tool. A full chapter is dedicated to a questionnaire for parents.

(2004), this volume introduces a therapeutic system pioneered by Dr. A. Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist and developmental psychologist, in an attempt to assist parents, caregivers and therapists, in coping with the impulsiveness, restlessness, hyperactivity and inattentiveness of the hyperactive child. Ayres' sensory integration (SI) therapeutic stance views (presumes) such a child to possess information-processing problems endemic to their intrinsic nervous system functioning, and is championed by the current authors, Horowitz & Rost, both of whom use SI therapy techniques in their daily clinical practice. Written for the non-specialist, these authors afford their eight chapters with a focus upon assisting the hyperactive child in particular, and rather than proposing that one deals with the presenting symptoms alone (behavioural problems), they suggest focusing instead upon the neurophysiological level, by improving each child's capacity for integrating sensory input. The repeated claim throughout the book, is that sensory integration problems make it difficult for some children to select and respond appropriately to everyday stimuli or events in their environment, and in turn, thus prevent/hinder development of their learning and socialisation skills. It is this problem that SI therapy is here introduced to solve.Clearly written and easy to read, the authors introduce both theoretical issues and practical skills, with simple (perhaps sometimes too oversimplified ?) discussions concerning how our brains process sensory stimuli, and how each of our sensory awareness channels (incl. vestibular, tactile, auditory, visual, and proprioceptive systems; our sense of smell and taste) operate at different stages of child development. More importantly perhaps, each of the core chapters offer practical and helpful advice for immediate behavioural monitoring and intervention, including the use of calming techniques, deep pressure application and so forth, in assisting hyperactive children to function in a more appropriate ways, both at home or in school. Some of the \`tips' for dealing with aberrant/disruptive behaviour are presented in \`case study boxes' occasionally placed within the text pages, and may appear distracting to some readers (better organization/layout would easily remedy this), though largely so presented in order to provide examples of real clinical cases relevant to the adjacent text information each time. Indeed, and although overall convincing, the current reviewers remain concerned re the lack of independent empirical evidence and controlled outcome-studies available in support of the assessment and evaluation of SI therapy, perhaps lending many readers to feel doubt and uncertainty for the effectiveness of SI therapy in countering the hyperactive child's aberrant behaviours. Indeed, this book would be more appealing if clearer evidence of the more successful claims of SI therapy were also presented, together with extensive case studies, thus also providing a more interesting and grounded discussion of the effectiveness of SI as being a more unique therapeutic tool.The final chapters of the book also offer informative reference tools in its conclusion. A well-documented and published research listing allows the reader to learn more about studies which in particular have involved ADHD children (given the title !). However, the potentially useful behaviour checklists provided will by no means allow parents, or those practitioners who work with children, to adequately self-diagnose the extent of any ADD/ADHD spectrum conditions presenting for intervention panning. Lacking in clear guidance as to the use of such assessment tools as provided in the final chapter \`A Questionnaire for Parents', this inclusion was perhaps both premature, and is clearly in need of additional text with regards how one might \`score', or at least interpret, the significance of the results obtained with its use - an inclusion in the current reviewers view possibly a dangerous option to have provided the concerned reader/parent, if completing this questionnaire without informed professional advise to hand !This said, the core introductory content of the book does, however, provide a good Primer for anyone wishing to know more about Sensory Integration (SI) Therapy, and will certainly be of some value to anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of hyperactive children. The stated purpose of SI therapy is simply to \\"improve your child's ability to process and organize sensory information\\" (p. 89), and proposes therapy techniques which necessarily engage each child (usually 1:1) in client-centred, playful and exploratory activities, specifically designed for the achievement of success and enjoyment of pleasure. SI therapy is thus surely a pleasurable supplemental form of treatment. Many a hyperactive child is likely to benefit from such a pleasurable intervention as SI therapy, if provided by a trained therapist, as a non-medicating child-centered therapeutic intervention.Failing this, however, it is always useful to encourage your child to raise themselves from the sofa/bedroom, and to \`get out there', and play some active sports such as football or soccer, which will readily enhance sensory-motor integration skills, whilst also burning off a significant amount of pent up nervous energy.

Drawing on their own work on the &quot;culture industry&quot;, as well as the ideas of the key thinkers of the Enlightenment project, (Descartes, Newton, Kant) Horkheimer and Adorno explain how the Enlightenment's orientation towards rational calculability and man's domination of a disenchanted nature evinces a reversion to myth, and is responsible for the reified structures of modern administered society, which has grown to resemble a new enslavement. Furthermore, Horkheimer's and Adorno's treatise was one of the most ambitious attempts to synthesise Marxist economic analysis with Freudian psychoanalysis, and is developed with much complexity and skill. Their philosophical and psychological critique of the Enlightenment concepts of reason and nature (which they identify as the loci of domination) spans almost the entire history of Western thought up until recent times, from Homer to Nietzsche. The book was written in 1944, during a phase of the war when the threat of Fascist victory still hung ominously over Europe, and when Horkheimer and Adorno themselves had to flee Germany to America. &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; thus represents one of the most pessimistic strands of Marxist thought, giving up all expectations of a people's revolution in Western Europe. This was, in addition to the outbreak of the Second World War, due to the meteoric rise of extremely right-wing reactionary parties in the twenties, and their subsequent popularity, which ruled out by fiat any chance of a popular support for the left. The proletariat, instead of embracing the cause of the people's revolution, opted to give their vote to the Fascists. In their psychoanalytic investigation of this phenomena, Horkheimer and Adorno identify the rise of Fascism with the return of the repressed."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This Amazon page is a disaster. The sample pages are from the earlier, terrible translation published by Continuum. One of the reader reviews is (as it notes) actually a review of the earlier translation. What is it doing here?? In fact, all of the reviews predate the publication of the new translation.By all means read the Dialectic of Enlightenment! But be sure to use only the new translation published by Stanford."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"These comments refer to the old Continuum edition, NOT to the Stanford edition, which is a fine translation ...While not wishing to detract from what has been said about the importance of this book, it is worth mentioning that the English translation is scandalously bad and in need of replacement. I've had occasion to make extensive comparisons between the German original and the translation and the results are not encouraging. Much is simply flat-out wrong (e.g., sometimes the translator mistakes one German word for another) even more is unnecessarily clumsy. While Horkheimer and Adorno adopted a rather dense style of writing, nothing they produced is quite as cumbersome as what readers of this translation have had to endure.One can sympathize with the translator -- he did the translation at a time when very little by Horkheimer and Adorno was in English and it appears that he worked under a rather tight schedule (it is possible to find errors piling up on a page and then suddenly ceasing -- suggesting that the poor fellow took a break and came back later on, with happier results). But there is no forgiving the publisher for leaving this text uncorrected for so long despite a long-standing consensus among students of the Frankfurt School that this is a deeply flawed translation. That anything of the power of the original makes it through the muck of this translation is a testimony to the force of Horkheimer and Adorno's ideas.A new translation is long overdue. Until then, readers coming to the work of the Frankfurt School might want to seek out Max Horkheimer's Eclipse of Reason, a summary of the argument elaborated here which Horkheimer delivered in English at Columbia University at about the same time of as the publication of the German original of this book."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, the editor of the Stanford edition of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT, has taken a dense, difficult book and made it more work to read. Horkheimer and Adorno's \\"philosophical fragments\\" reward the reader not only with sustained analyses of capitalist culture, but also with pithy one-liners worthy of the authors' role as the philosophical Statler and Waldorf heckling Euro-American civilization. But Noerr's pedantry constantly gets in their way and yours.The edition has two problems: insufficient translation and worse-than-useless endnotes. First, the translation. Edmund Jephcott does what I can only assume is an admirable job translating (nearly) all of the original German into English. Unfortunately, he does not translate the French, the Latin, or the Greek (though, to his credit, he does render the latter in the Roman alphabet). That would be fine if I read those three languages, but I don't, and neither do most Anglophone readers of this book. Classicists aren't the major audience for Frankfurt School culture criticism, so you'd think that Noerr would do us a favor and get somebody to translate the dead languages with the living. Nein. When Horkheimer and Adorno quote Seneca, you're on your own.Second, the endnotes: never have so many endnotes been of so little use to so many readers. Noerr preserves H & A's original endnotes, putting them not at the end of each fragment, but at the end of the book. Fair enough. But interlarded among these are Noerr's much more copious endnotes, with their own numbering system, notes that deal almost entirely with the publication history of variant editions of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT. What percentage of readers wants this information? Ten? Five? Anybody writing a dissertation on this book is reading it in German anyway, and has the different editions ready to hand. To a general audience, these textual notes are clutter. Putting them in a different location within the book would at least have spared readers the labor of sorting through them.Were these the only endnotes that Noerr provided, one could ignore them altogether (difficult, considering their ubiquity on the page). But Noerr sometimes provides content-related notes--for example, explaining the idiom \\"white trash\\" as a \\"derogatory expression for white workers\\" (267). So all that Latin, all that Greek, and all that French Noerr left for you to puzzle out on your own, but when a familiar American English idiom appears in a book published by an American university press, Noerr opens the lantern shutter and dazzles us.A second example should convey the stunning inutility of Noerr's endnotes. On page 102 appears this sentence: \\"Even before Zanuck acquired her, Saint Bernadette gleamed in the eye of her writer as an advert aimed at all the relevant consortia.\\" This is the first time either name appears in the book. Now, a great many readers of DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT are students of mass culture who will at least recognize producer Darryl F. Zanuck's last name as connected to Hollywood, if not to 20th Century Fox. But in case we don't, Noerr helpfully supplies a note saying as much. But Saint Bernadette? No endnote. Noerr does not tell us that she was 1) a 19th century Frenchwoman canonized for her visions of the Virgin Mary, or that she was 2) the subject of a now-forgotten 1942 bestseller, or that 3) 20th Century Fox produced a film adaptation of the novel in 1943, a film that netted four academy awards, despite being forgotten in subsequent decades.My question is this: who is so steeped in Hollywood lore that he or she can follow Horkheimer and Adorno's oblique, dated reference here--to a 1940s hagiography exploited by a big-five studio into a successful but forgotten biopic--yet at the same time needs a footnote to decrypt the name of Zanuck? Nobody. Endnote both names, endnote neither, or endnote the MORE obscure of the two, but don't endnote ONLY the LESS obscure! Can an editor possibly write worse endnotes than this, short of supplying counterfactual notes? (\\"Zanuck\\": Zanuck IV, Martian conqueror of the thirty-ninth century, CE.)So be warned: this edition is extremely labor-intensive. You'll have to look up a lot of dead words, internet-search a lot of names, and grit your teeth through Noerr's vanity-project endnotes. Let's hope Stanford puts out a more useful edition as an apology for this one."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, both prominents of the Frankfurter Schule of critical theory, wrote this work during WWII. In their own words, the purpose of the book was to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism. Obviously their experiences as Jewish intellectuals fleeing for the national-socialist regime to the United States was a strong impulse for this view, but the book is not limited to a critique of nazism or even totalitarianism altogether.The main subject of the book, though that itself is already difficult to disentangle, is Enlightenment's betrayal of its own liberating capacity. Adorno & Horkheimer analyze this by means of various cultural metaphors, which in highly abstract, contradictory and aesthetic language (especially the parts by Adorno) trace the development of Enlightenment and its subsequent 'dark side' throughout an equally metaphorical history of culture and ideas. In a certain sense this may most remind readers not familiar with both authors of Foucault and his use of concepts like the Panopticon to express a view of power relations. The method of Adorno and Horkheimer is however not so much genealogical, as Foucault's is, as dialectical in its idealist form.The book consists of an introduction, two \\"excursions\\" and two chapters on the Enlightenment itself, as well as a series of aphorisms provided at the end as \\"notes and sketches\\". Each part of the book consists of a very abstract, very metaphysical and almost entrancing analysis of, in turn, the development of Enlightenment as myth out of earlier myth, the form of modern Enlightenment as instrumental reason and mass deception, and the limits of Enlightenment to its own rationality, in the form of anti-semitism. The language of the book is extremely difficult, even in English, and in the best (and worst) traditions of continental philosophy it contains a very great amount of layers and meanings, not all of which are free of internal contradiction. Readers familiar to Situationist works are perhaps best prepared for the effect, which is somewhat similar in method, if not in style, to Guy Debord.The introduction, \\"The Concept of Enlightenment\\", posits Enlightenment as thought liberating man from his natural shackles, and creating man as master of the earth. This process of liberation entails at the same time the possibility of man to protect himself from, and understand the workings of, nature, and also mankind's loss of being one with nature. In this process, the self is created as a subjectivity divorced from direct experience of the outside world. Man's memory of this is very vague and distant, but is present in everyone as a certain inchoate feeling of loss.This is also the main subject of the first Exkurs, \\"Odysseus, or Myth and Enlightenment\\". The story of the Odysseia is here used in many ways to provide metaphorical expressions for the role of myth in and against Enlightenment. Myths are primitive descriptions of the world, and in being so are already classifications used as a form of instrumental reason, which is the seed of Enlightenment. The role of sacrifice to the Gods, for example, is presented as manipulation of those Gods, and in so doing already expression of an Enlightened mind avant la lettre. Odysseus' adventure with the Sirens is metaphor for man's loss as described above: Odysseus, the Enlightened ruler, knows his loss but is constrained by his knowledge from acting on it; and the shipmates, the great mass of modernity, is only vaguely aware of the loss, and are not affected. But Circe, the Cyclops, and many other themes are used besides.The second Exkurs is \\"Juliette, or Enlightenment and Morality\\". The works of De Sade, in particular Juliette, here provide an expression of Enlightenments freeing and therefore contradictory character. Kant is contrasted with Juliette; where Kant is the restrained form of reason, reason as classifying and ordening power, Juliette is reason's destructive power of old orders. Because Enlightenment destroys the validity of any appeal to tradition, religion, etc., it falls pray to itself, in that Enlightenment's appeal to its own absolute values is undermined, in the same way that Juliette uses and is used by Catholicism in undermining it.The third chapter is \\"Enlightenment as Mass Deception\\", covering the subject of the culture industry. Here Adorno rants against all the vapid and degraded culture forms he perceives in the United States, although he never states it as valid only for the US, of course. There are many interesting insights and observations about modern culture and still valid ones too in this chapter, but Adorno's general tone is that of the \\"hochb&uuml;rgerliche\\" bourgeois annoyed about the offenses against good taste he sees. Yet to dismiss it based on that would be superficial, even if we cannot agree with Adorno's hatred for radio and jazz. His observations on American movies are very poignant, and in between his cultural criticism he hits on certain relations between the capitalist mode of production, its Enlightenment ideology, and the cultural superstructure that are very worthwhile for a patient radical.The fourth chapter is called \\"Limits of Enlightenment\\", and addresses directly the subject of anti-semitism and fascism more generally. Fascism is posited as Enlightenment turned against itself (it must be noted Adorno & Horkheimer were among the first to state this, even if it is somewhat of a cliche now). Enlightenment's general instrumental reason knows only power as a measure of behavior. Therefore, it cannot tolerate the existence of groups that thrive, yet never have power, such as Jews and women. Whenever Enlightened society fails to satisfy the needs of its members, their anger is turned against such groups.The last chapter, \\"Notes and Sketches\\", is as said a series of aphorisms, familiar to people who have read situationist works, or for example Walter Benjamin's notebooks.Overall, this book is an extremely complex, but very worthwhile philosophical critique of modern culture, and a very pessimistic and negative analysis of Enlightenment and its possibilities. It is hard work to get to the bottom of it, but nevertheless rewarding for any student of philosophy."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"\\"Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts back to mythology\\" (xviii). This statement is likely one of the most explosive philosphical theses penned in the 20th century, for not only did it give expression to much of the suspicion and pessimism that people experienced in the early 20th century, particularly under the Nazi regime, but this statement set into motion much of the later suspicion concerning the Enlightenment project and its relation to not just freedom, but domination under freedom's guise.Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments is the most important work ever written by any of the members of the Frankfurt School; it stands as a type of manifesto really for the possibility of Critical Theory as a post-positivistic discipline. It is easy to miss, but this is not just a work of philosophy - it is not a work written by old men with elbow patches on their jackets pondering various ideas in a scientific and socio-historical philosophical vacuum. Quite the opposite: this is a book that drew upon then-current sociology and anthropology (particularly pertaining to religion), in addition to the history of philosophy and philosophical currents such as Marxism (Western Marxism, to be specific). This is a book that draws - obviously - on history; it is a book that has much to say about media and the effects of what Adorno called \\"The Culture Industry\\".Several authors, such as Jurgen Habermas and Leszek Kolakowski, have noted the the structure of the book - what we might call its \\"poetics\\" - is quite abnormal for a work of philosophy. The subtitle of the book comes well into play here as a means of understanding the book; \\"Philosophical Fragments\\" very much describes what it is like reading this work. The genuinely fragmentary nature of the book - it begins with an essay titled \\"The Concept of Enlightenment\\" before two excurses (one on Odysseus and the other on Marquis de Sade), the chapter \\"The Culture Industry\\", a series of theses titled \\"Elements of Angi-Semitism: Limits of Enlightenment\\", and the closing section \\"Notes and Sketches\\" (which is anything but smooth) - only adds to the sense of urgency.The attempt to ascertain \\"why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism\\" (xiv) animates the work. This regression ultimately has to do with the very nature of myth, which is \\"obscure and luminous at once\\" (xvii). It is with positivism that science believes it can banish all mystery from the world such that humans become masters of it (1); art itself has fallen prey to this myth (14). Perhaps surprisingly, this does not begin in the 18th century European Enlightenment, but with one of our most ancient of founding myths: Odysseus. The deceptive nature of the sacrifice in Odysseus is the beginning of our journey towards enlightenment, for it places us on a similar footing with the gods. The attempt of persons such as Sade to advocate a world without superstition not only turns us into beasts with \\"the innocence of wild animals\\" (77), but means that we still must hold onto one myth: that we can actually live in a world where all is entirely as it seems. Transgression of the previous morality (Catholicism) is the necessary mythical supplement to this view; it brings no pleasure but only violence. Both the Culture Industry and Anti-Semitism ultimately have the same totalitarian goal: to make everyone the same, as economic cogs in the machine, devoid of their individuality. Thus Enlightenment is necessarily violent against the Other, who doesn't fit in. The book ends with Notes and Sketches in a kind of anti-climax; Dialectic of Enlightenment is left open.In many ways, this edition by Stanford University Press, in their uber-fine series \\"Cultural Memory in the Present\\", is like a critical edition in English. Dialectic of Enlightenment was printed various times and in various editions from 1944 thru 1969; this edition collects each of the prefaces for the various editions, and notes every single textual variant for each edition, some of which are seen as rather unimportant, but others of which show that the text was very much a continual work in progress for Horkheimer and Adorno. In addition to an Editor's Afterword, there is an essay appended at the end of the book titled \\"The Disappearance of Class History in \\"Dialectic of Enlightenment\\": A Commentary on the Textual Variants (1944 and 1947)\\", which many will likely to find insightful reading. This is an important addition to the library of many different fields - political thought, intellectual history, philosophy, theology, religious studies, and social theory, among others - regardless of how it has been produced. Stanford University Press should really be commended for producing it in such a way that it is a fine addition to one's library as well.One does well to remember that this work should not be simply taken at face value. In their 1969 Preface, Horkheimer and Adorno mention that they ascribe a \\"temporal core to truth\\" (xi), which means that as an older text, what remains applicable in it should be used today, and what no longer applies should be left alone as having been applicable at one time in the past. Neither author ever endorsed the irresponsible usage of their work in the 1960s by protesting students who had become little more than mobs; that they have been linked to irresponsible New Left anti-politics (via their friend Herbert Marcuse) is not their fault. Rather, what Horkheimer and Adorno endorsed then (and would continue to endorse, were they still alive) is not a brutal application of a particular theory, but a sustained, thoughtful and well informed engagement of theory with the whole of the modern world. \\"As a critique of philosophy, it does not seek to abandon philosophy itself\\" (xii). In short, they believed in wisdom: and this is what philosophy is ultimately all about."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Adorno and Horkheimer are associated with the Frankfurt school of thought in post-WWII Germany. In this book, Dialectic of Enlightenment, the two thinkers disect the post-war condition looking at all aspects of cultural identity as based on ancient enlightenment-esque ideals. This book illuminates the devestating results of progressivist models of history in late capitalism. Probably the most famous essay deals with the culture industry and how, in post-war capitalism, movies, books, television all become tools of subjegation through which a falsified sense of individuality is produced and commodified to the ends of keeping the consumers of this industry distracted enough to ignore the insideousness of that which we allow to control us.A very dense read, poetic in areas, but challenging throughout. Adorno is often criticized for being a cynic, but I think that under his often scathing view of modern culture is a message that through exacting self-reflection change of the \\"total system\\" can occur.These themes are expanded on in Adorno's other works: Minima Moralia, and Negative Dialectic."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"One of the more important, and somewhat more readable, founding texts of the Frankfurt school of critical thought, this book (probably because of the influence of Max Horkheimer) is more readable than Negative Dialectics (by Theodore Adorno) but less readable than Adorno's book of short essays, Minima Moralia. Its orange cover, and alarming, intellectual, title, make Dialectic of Enlightenment somewhat of a chick magnet :-).The unreadability of Frankfurt School texts is an artifact of the very phenomena they criticize. Educated people in America at the time Dialectic of Enlightenment was written were influenced, directly and indirectly, by the pragmatism of John Dewey and English Logical Positivism as mediated by Bertrand Russell and A. J. Ayer. A bit later, the Continental school of Logical Positivism came to America fleeing Fascism.Pragmatism is the homegrown American philosophy that the useful is the true and the true, useful. Logical Positivism in Britain and on the Continent is the view that the meaningful is only the verifiable statement of natural science. Both traditions are completely inimical to the older Continental views of Adorno and of Horkheimer, based as they are on those of Hegel, Freud and Marx.Adorno would probably see straight through the question begging that goes on in both Pragmatism and Logical Positivism. Both these philosophies fail to self-apply, in a logical failure which is also a failure to exhibit the intellectual virtue of humility. If we ask the Pragmatist about the utility of his view that truth is utility he cannot answer. Similarly, Logical Positivism's own claim, that meaningful statements are either verifiably true or verifiably false using the procedures of science, fails, even less than Pragmatism, to self-apply, because we simply can't verify the nonexistence of a meaningful but unverifiable statement. This result, which conclusively has shown nearly all major-league philosophers that Logical Positivism is deep nonsense, has been generalized in recent years to show that there are even apparently scientific statements, such as statements as to what transpires inside black holes, which are not verifiable.However, the nonsense of Pragmatism and of Logical Positivism had in the period 1930 to about 1980 much influence, again direct and indirect, on educated Americans. Directly, they were exposed to it in undergraduate survey courses and of course as philosophy specialists. Indirectly the ideas were in the air, and they have had strong influence on the management, and the mismanagement, of America's economy and its foreign policy.For this reason, and because of the deconstruction of a decent educational system, contemporary post-moderns in America find actual post-modern classics including Dialectic of Enlightenment tough going.But to be constructive. \\"Dialectic\\" in the title refers to a form of logic which commencing with the early 19th century German philosopher Hegel. It is presented, superficially, in survey classes as a weird kind of pseudo-logic in which things become their opposite, and then the thing and its opposite \\"synthesize\\" to form a higher, more involved thing.But this superficial nonsense fails to account for the dialectic at all. The dialectic is a response, in the real material conditions that have obtained in developed societies since the end of the 18th century, to the fact that mere traditional logic is a closed system. Mere traditional logic seems to the ordinary person verbal games and, strikingly, it is the same to the evolved modern mathematician if he's of the \\"formalist\\" school. You merely have to change the axioms to get the results you want in mere traditional logic.Tradtional (and modern) logic is like a machine for accomplishing our purposes that it becomes (in indeed a dialectic fashion) the opposite of what we need. The 17th century philosopher Leibniz was so impressed by the apparent power of primitive forms of modern logic that he thought that any dispute would be by now, at the close of the millenium, settled in gentlemanly fashion with \\"let us calculate, sir.\\" As what would now be termed a high-paid \\"consultant\\" to the CEOs of his time and place (petty, and small-minded, German princelings) Leibniz included political and social matters in this view.Leibniz saw in logic a machine that would remove decisionmaking from passion and self-interest and indeed logic, and its technological, embodied form the modern digital computer, does so with such thoroughness that the \\"fair\\" decision machine becomes its opposite. We merely have to change the program to get the results we want, whether those results be true and fair and just, or deep nonsense.Hegel, Marx and Freud were healthy and human reactions to this manipulative spirit, and dialectical logic, far from being anti-modern-logic (as its more hysterical opponents like Quine seem to feel), actually rescues traditional and modern logic from criminal manipulation. For example, in human and in social affairs, the very fact that each actor is not a thing and has capabilities to react to features of the system in totality, consistently makes social planning self-defeating. In the Five Year Plans of the Stalin era, the very fact that factory managers were more or less informed of the direction of the whole caused the numerical decision procedures used in determining whether those targets would be met to be distorted towards optimism that caused famine and war. In the Reagan White House, the commitment of an autistic Chief Executive to meeting impossible economic targets likewise caused his budget director, David Stockman, to fudge the numbers using a primitive spreadsheet and what Stockman called \\"the magic asterisk\\" to identify needed savings, not yet identified, that would balance the books.Traditional and modern logic is a babe in the woods as regards such chicanery. But the dialectic, centering human over technical relationships, sees and can account for this behavior. Its overall procedure is to weigh irreconcilable interests against each other, to predict the synthesis that will result. In Horkheimer and Adorno, the dialectical claim is that the very science and technology produced by the 18th century enlightenment would over time produce its opposite. Kant's individual freedom to be a knower (a scientist or independent entrpreneur) would turn, amid the pressure of real human events, into a higher form of enslavement."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Most educated people think of the Enlightenment as an era that ushered in a much desired trend toward rationalism and cultural progress. In \\"DIALECTIC OF ENLIGHTENMENT,\\" Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer counter with the startling proposition that the Enlightenment, far from advancing the cause of modernity, progress, reason, and order instead created a new age of barbarism whose basis was centered on a tyrannical manipulation of every aspect of each citizen's life, habits, and environment. Such an interpretation begins with the founding of the Frankfurt School in Germany in the 1920s with Adorno, Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Georg Lukacs as the creative Marxist core. Originally located in Germany, its creators first thought of calling their school the Institute of Marxism, but wisely concluded that such a name would render widespread acceptance of its name as unlikely. They then settled on the harmless sounding Institute for Social Research. After Hitler became Chancellor, the Institute moved to New York, and then, after 1945, back to Germany. The Institute was determined to advance Marxism as the dominant political and economic theory in the world, but its founders were wise enough to recognize that Marxism, as it was then constructed, was simply not up to the task. Classical Marxism was based solely on its undiluted appeal to workers as a marginalized class beset by a cabal of greedy capitalists. The Frankfurt School widened the net of victims by including women, gays, and assorted ethnic minorities as the newest downtrodden. To accommodate this widening net, Adorno and the other founders dreamed up what they termed \\"Critical Theory,\\" which as its name implies was a criticism of nothing less than society itself. Out went capitalism as the Marxist bogeyman. In came anti-Semitism, sexism, racism and homophobia as the newest allures for converts. Thus, the Frankfurt School melded Marxism, which was originally designed solely as an economic philosophy, to a series of competing philosophies like the psychological theories of Freud, the emerging range of literary theories just then spreading, and a variety of multi-disciplinary schools, none of which shared any common ground except that their totality could be used as a club to bash western style capitalism.When the book was published in 1944, it called into question a two thousand year tradition that reason must eventually lead the way to a golden age. Reason, they argued, did quite the opposite by encouraging the growth of a fascist mentality that was then raging in Europe. This mentality that leads to the destruction of true human freedom is based on the pairing of traditional opposites: freedom/tyranny, man/woman, urban/rural and the like. They argue that rationalists of the Enlightenment see a sharp dividing line between the left and the right pair. One must be either one or the other. Not so, say Adorno and Horkheimer. At various points, the one merges into the other to such an extant that it is only a myth that they are truly separate. Critical theorists maintain that neither side of the slash holds the preferred position. Rather the source of frustration seemingly caused by identifying with one side or the other is in actuality a result of underlying tension which emanates from an overpowering sense of dislocation and alienation, both of which are the deliberate goals of the Inner Party of the industrial/military/consumer cabal. Using Orwell's terms again, it is the Outer Party and the Proles who suffer the most while paradoxically are misled into thinking that they are not suffering at all. Adorno and Horkheimer suggest that the de-evolution of society into fascist conformity and thus into inexplicable alienation has its roots in the ability of the economic Powers That Be into seducing an entire generation of consumers into producing a false sense of individuality while at the same time masking a stifling sense of conformity.In the book's most well-known chapter, \\"Enlightenment as Mass Deception,\\" the authors take the classic Marxist view that all consumers are essentially interchangeable cogs in a multi-national machine that brags of individuality even as it ruthlessly stamps it out. The key to this stamping out of individualism is the insidious role of culture, which classifies, organizes, and labels consumers to the point that their reactions can be pinpointed as accurately as science fiction author Isaac Asimov described in his FOUNDATION series. To accomplish this Cassandra-like level of accuracy, Adorno and Horkheimer assume the legitimacy of several questionable basics. First, they see broadcast programs as \\"exactly the same.\\" This must come as a surprise to ratings companies which identify quantifiable differences among them. Second, they envision a movie audience whose reactions can be precisely identified in advance. This too must come as a surprise to producers of costly films that tank at the box office. Third, they make statements about the relation of consumers to products that simply make no sense. What, for example, do they mean when they write \\"Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work\\"? Finally, they write of consumers as sheep with no power to resist blatant advertising. The advertising industry is replete with failed policies that did not foresee a fluctuating consumer response to advertising. The authors mask their leaky ideology behind some heavy paradoxes that promise much meaning but emerge as devoid of such. Such paradoxes are usually pithy fortune cookie utterances: \\"The perfect similarity is the absolute difference:\\" \\"Chance and planning become one and the same thing;\\" and \\"Everybody becomes an employee.\\" Those who read this book and intone that it \\"made them think twice at the apparently simplistic world in which we live\\" are probably unaware that the complexity of this world need not be limited to the bashing of capitalism to which both Adorno and Horkheimer had long been committed."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"One of the most famous pieces of Finnish prose is 'Seitsem&auml;n veljest&auml;' by our national iconic author Aleksis Kivi. Some people even describe it as the first real novel in our literature history due to its self-reflexiness. Within 'Seitsem&auml;n veljest&auml;' one can find a scene depicting the agrarian village-school where adult men are learning how to read and write in order to get a licence to marry. The authoritarian teacher shouts out letters one by one and the stupid lot reluctantly repeat it with loud voice. \\"A,\\" says the schoolmaster. \\"A,\\" bellow the tortured fellers. \\"B\\" spoken leads to a roomful of \\"B\\"'s and so forth. Eventually one of the pupils can't take it anymore and escapes through a window, breaking the glass.Reading Adorno & Horkheimer is bit like this. Despite their brilliancy one feels sometimes that he is reduced to go trough the same irritating formula time after time - too many times. \\"Thesis,\\" shouts Adorno. One replies obediently. \\"Antithesis\\", shouts Horkheimer. A reply follows. \\"Synthesis,\\" bellows the schoolmasters. Again, an answer imitates the curriculum. It works for a while. But after a couple of hundred pages illustrating the philosophical alphabets of the Frankfurt school one does feel like breaking & exiting. Maybe the reader in questin is slow-witted. But then again, the frustratingly repetive teaching method in question might not be so effective, either. Tools should be used to achieve an end or another, not to be the end in themselves."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This book is of course rubbish of the first order.As a single, simple example, I quote from another review, which accurately summarizes chapter 4.\\"The fourth chapter is called \\"Limits of Enlightenment\\", and addresses directly the subject of anti-semitism and fascism more generally. Fascism is posited as Enlightenment turned against itself (it must be noted Adorno & Horkheimer were among the first to state this, even if it is somewhat of a cliche now). Enlightenment's general instrumental reason knows only power as a measure of behavior. Therefore, it cannot tolerate the existence of groups that thrive, yet never have power, such as Jews and women. Whenever Enlightened society fails to satisfy the needs of its members, their anger is turned against such groups.\\"In summary: Fascist anti-semitism was the result of the Enlightenment's \\"instrumental reason\\".But this is of course absurd. German Christianity has a long history of anti-semitism extending much farther back than the 18th century, at least to Martin Luther's well-known violent anti-semitism. Hitler attacked the Jews in the name of Christianity, not in the name (say) of Enlightenment deism. His world-view and rationale were drawn from the theories of distinct national or cultural \\"races\\", theories that sprouted and flourished as part of Romanticism's rejection of the rationality and trans-nationalism of the Enlightenment.So Germany's (and in fact, Christianity's) long history of anti-semitism, along with the tendency of *any* society in distress to vent its anxiety by attacking a vulnerable minority, is a sufficient and historically adequate explanation for Nazi anti-semitism.But Adorno and Horkheimer invite us to attribute Fascist anti-semitism to \\"Enlightenment's\\" inability to tolerate groups that are (paradoxically) both powerless and (despite being powerless) thriving. \\"Enlightenment\\" doesn't like powerless people because it supposedly \\"knows only power as a measure of behavior\\". Basically, \\"Enlightenment\\" wants to kill you because it doesn't like the way you part your hair.The book is full of this kind of false, nasty nonsense, wrapped up in sweeping generalizations couched in vague terms such as \\"reason\\", \\"power\\", etc. So, as a work of philosophy or history or social analysis, it is, well, rubbish. In terms of philosophical merit, as well as authorial rage and despair, its most recent contemporary equivalent is the Unibomb Manifesto.But it is also historically important rubbish. This book is the seminal work of (philosophical) post-modernism. If, for whatever reason, you are looking for the place where \\"Critical Theory\\" and post-modern epistemic relativism first emerged into the light of day, then this is the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Wow. A must read by any student of critial thought"},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"This is a book that should change the way the average American thinks. Yes, it is not the easiest book to read and the authors' main ideas are not always readily apparent and schematically laid out. It will take you time to pry them out of the long and densely worded paragraphs that make up the sections of this work, but if you do take the time and expend the mental effort to make sense of what Adorno and Horkheimer are saying, then you will be in for a REAL intellectual adventure because the critical method on display here and the conclusions offered are nothing short of subversive in the positive sense of the word and are therefore truly thought-provoking. Their quasi-Marxist critical approach does an impressive job of standing our analytical habits on their head. It reconfigures the customary Anglo-American way of dealing with subjects and their related controversies, which is to say, when you are reading this book you can say bye-bye to our usual dichotomizing, either/or modes of analysis as you are ushered into the quickly shifting world of dialectical thinking. Make no mistake about it--these are some extremely busy pages, and when you read them you will alternate between being confused and astonished at how much is going on and how many ideas are simultaneously in play in any given paragraph or its constituent sentences.This is apt to make us suspicious at first precisely because it is so foreign to what we as Americans regard as analysis. Our habit is to reduce problems to sets of antithetical principles and then we quietly assume each set to be real and concrete--conservative vs. liberal, traditional vs. progressive, science vs. magic, mythological vs. enlightened, intellectual vs. anti-intellectual, autocratic vs. democratic, autonomous vs. heteronomous, etc.--but our reification of these principles and their standing connections with prevailing modes of production and exchange are what these Frankfurt School authors expose in their treatments of (so-called) enlightenment thinking and how these factors are intertwined in the areas of myth, morality, mass culture, and anti-Semitism.The basic thesis of the book is that the traditional categories of bourgeois intellectual history are ideological constructs that tell us only half the story. We think of Western thought as progressing from mythological modes of thinking to an outlook that is more rational, scientific, and thus enlightened, but what their analyses seek to demonstrate is that instead of a steady linear progression from myth to enlightenment rationality what we have is a situation in which the two opposing categories are closer to each other than one might suppose. The modern bourgeois thinker assumes that all is rationality and light in his camp, but Adorno and Horkheimer argue that (a) enlightenment thinking is as inescapably 'mythological' as any of the pre-scientific worldviews to which it feels superior and (b) how that conceit has played an instrumental role in the increasing violence, domination, and deception that characterize the 'civilized barbarism' of modern industrial societies. Their analytical results, even if they are not wholly convincing to some readers, are astonishing in their subtlety and implications, and if you read these essays attentively you will never think about these subjects again in the same way as you did before.As an example of the way in which this critical method is employed, take our lazy American habit of dividing people up into either conformists or non-conformists. We take such a seemingly neat and definite division for granted, and we assume that it is just a matter of pointing out which is the more coherent, honest, and therefore justifiable attitude to adopt. But Adorno and Horkheimer show that these two labels do not correspond to two separate and distinct realities/truths, but rather each is but an aspect or manifestation of a more fundamental human problem, i.e. that of Hegelian/Marxist alienation, an inescapable condition of separation and incompleteness that continues to twist and turn in our society at any given time. Critically speaking, it is not the case that it is better to be one or the other because the problem of alienation is not solvable either by a robust conformism or by an equally calculated non-conformist spirit. On the contrary, each is but a symptom of something wrong and unaddressed in the life of any society, namely, those deeper issues of perennial import, the traditional stuff of philosophic and religious concern that have to do with us as whole beings and not just as disembodied, rationalizing minds, totalitarian and/or fascist vitalists, bourgeois capitalists, ideological contrarians, bohemian radicals, philistine reactionaries, etc. The latter are examples of the attitudes that reflect our more fundamental human state of alienation, the social masks of ideology that we unthinkingly don and then in turn mistake for the face of reality.Critical theory is devoted to leaving no stone unturned in the criticism of thought and culture, and it professes the ideal of never ceasing in that endeavor. In the case of a problem like social alienation it is the critical theorist's task to probe ever deeper into the social realities of our culture and to subject these to ruthless examinations which, while the efforts in themselves are never entirely free of ideological determinations, they still have as one of their own critical goals to become conscious of any underlying ideological factors in what is supposed to be a process of analytical self-emancipation. Yet it is arguable as to whether the critical theorists and their disciples have remained true to these ideals because since the 1930s we have seen the work (if not the individual life) of each of its practitioners decompose into various radical left-wing viewpoints that have remained highly influential (if not inflexible) in some academic and/or artistic circles, but conversion to its particular point of view is certainly not the point of this book. Think of these essays as a collection of 'thought experiments' in the Frankfurt school critical method, and the results as dialectical stepping stones on the way to a critical work that by its very nature can never be final.It is a widespread but shallow opinion to write off the Frankfurt School thinkers as MERE Marxists or even as neo-Marxist revisionists, and Adorno's writings in particular, though complex and multifaceted, reveal him to be rooted firmly in the German tradition of idealist philosophy. Marxist ideas are important to him, but over and above the critical concepts they furnish for his books and essays and the role they played in the formation of his method of 'negative dialectics', the guiding figure for him is always Kant with whom he shares an inextinguishable concern for what in today's rarefying intellectual parlance might be labeled as 'metaphilosophical' issues: how human freedom and personal autonomy are inextricably bound together in a seeking that must go beyond the categories of any rationalist epistemology and the bare material facts of common history in order to illuminate and safeguard those things that make us human and which come from the directions we might least suspect."},{"Title":"Dialectic of Enlightenment (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"The dialectic of Enlightenment is a history of false appearances. For Adorno & Horkheimer, trying to explain the world in its totality is equal to try to dominate it. Totality becomes totalitarianism. The authors present history as a tool of domination. Myth and reason both hide the deception of trying to make all things equal. By this logic -of identity/identification- everything is not, but must be the same. Knowledge is mythical because it promises a happiness that can never be achieved in knowledge's terms. The central argument of this wonderful book is that myth is already enlightenment because it tries to explain the world and gain utility from it; and enlightenment is already myth for it tries to exclude anything that is different or contradicts Enlightened Reason. As Adorno & Horkheimer put it: \\"Enlightenment has a mythical horror to myth.\\" Enlightenment obsessively tries to free itself from myth, but in doing so it becomes also mythical. This obsession takes the form of a saturating, technical rationality that ends in the horror of ethnic genocide.

It is a handy volume , rich in content and weaved with lenghthy sentences. It was an outcome of shock given by the Nazi forces. Nevertheless a thought about direct results of extreme reasoning, radical socialization and discovery of motives behind humanity's retrogression instead of progressive civilization.The urge to reach the technological zenith started in that crucial period. Demonstration of destruction of masses with atom bomb was yet to kick off. But the terror started shaking the two intellectuals. Again and again they questioned themselves. Conclusion was insight - social freedom is inseparable from the enlightened thought.The need for enlightenement was to create a civil society with rationalised idea grows in individuals and institutions. Not just the rational consciousness. What was needed that time is to deparate fear from fate. But with modern science , commerece and politics, it endd in a fear of social deviation.Enlightenement is as equally destructive as that of romanticism. The self of enlightened being itself comes in to life only when it surrender to its enemy. It refuses to transcend the false absoulte in reality. The book is clearly classified in to five simple segmental chapters which deal with the metamorphosis of modernity. It is a critical study with myth is already an enlightenment and enlightenment reverts to mythology as the basic premises. For the authours, Homerian odyssey is the main target to show the dialecic of myth and enlightenment. Odyssey was accused as the earliest representative testimonies of western bourgeois civiliztion. Kant, Sade and Nietzsche were not spared. Adorno and Horkheimer show how the submission of everthing natural to the autocratic subject finally culminates in the mastery of the blindly objective and natural. Kant and Sade's idea were branded 'bourgeois thought' and accused of morality mixd with amorality.First chapter deals with how myth is already an enlightenment. Second one shows the reverse of enlightenment to mythology. Third, projects the submission of subject which makes the object a master. Fourth, &quot;culture industry&quot; brings out the process where enlightenment is ideaogized. Fifth chapter traces the movement of humanity to barbarism.It is a thorough thrasing of enlightenment. They understand that extreme enlightened self is as dangerous as that of fully radiant earth which radiates disaster triumphant.One have to undergo an intellectual torture to read this book.
