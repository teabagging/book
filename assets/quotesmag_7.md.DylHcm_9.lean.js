That said I thoroughly enjoyed all the Harry Potter books and Philip Pullmans 'Dark Materials' trilogy. I think maybe I just prefer a little human intervention to make things realistic now I'm an adult and parallel worlds are more interesting than gnomes, goblins and elves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hobbits are small little men-like beings that are known for their calm, non-adventuresome nature. This all changes when an unsuspecting hobbit named Bilbo, when Gandalf comes back to The Shire. He tells Bilbo of a far off land in peril. He tells of a dragon that is wreaking havoc to the people of the nation. But most of all he tells of an adventure, an adventure that Bilbo is not to keen to be a part of. With a band of dwarves, a wizard (Gandalf), and a Hobbit, the team sets off on their quest. Along the way, the group is met with many challenges including a bunch of trolls, some mischievous elves, and a creature named Gollum. It is in the cave of Gollum that Bilbo has to use his skill of riddles, to outsmart the creature and escape. On the way out of the cave, Bilbo finds a ring that will come to lead to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their quest leads them to the mountain of the dragon Smaug (Mt. Doom), where it is again up to the smart and cunning of the little Hobbit to save a town. Here, at the lake, and epic battle occurs. With the dragon slain, it is time for the return trip and for life to resume as normal. Bilbo has a hard time trying to readjust to his former life of a hobbit. He is constantly seeking adventure again, and so is looked down upon by the inhabitants of the Shire. This book is filled with action, adventure, and friendship. It is a great read, and starts the epic tale of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A bunch of hobbits and a wizard go a long adventure together. They face dangerous things on their adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book after watching the first part of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie at the year 2000. I loved the movie and you could tell, I guess; but this book struck as directed toward the younger readers.I do not mind the juvenile material, but the conversation was more that I can stand. And other than that it was a fine story.If you had watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, you'd know that it started with a hobbit (one of the Hobbits which is a tribe of halflings) named Bilbo, who was trying to have a big party for his elleventeen birthday (111 in the hobbit tongue, don't you think it is very childish for me, sigh). This story, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is the sole account of Bilbo's adventures, and is the predecessor of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"Gandalf, who appears in the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" appears here too, and is one of the integral components of the story. He introduces Bilbo to 12 dwarfs (or dwarves as he insanely like to write it). The 12 dwarfs take Bilbo, who reluctantly agree to accompany them, on a trip to kill a dragon (what can be more childish). These dwarfs have some strange (childish) names, like dori, ori, nori, oin, and gloin.They encounter some trolls, goblins (or orcs), and Bilbo meets a strange creature called Gollum. He gets his ring from there. They meet some more odd creatures and then reach the place where the dragon is.They actually kill the dragon and then have a big fight with some other armies. Bilbo forsakes the dwarfs, for some reason or another. Things must be fixed, so Bilbo becomes a friend of the dwarfs one more time. He gets his share from the treasure of the dragon (all dragons must have treasures, you did not know that? oh my!) and then goes back to his hobbit hole, where he lives.You are welcome to read, you might not get bored, but I am not all that enthusiastic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's the best book I ever read!!!!!It's full of action,adventure,and exciting suspense.My favorite part is when Bilbo fights giant spiders.I recommend this book to anybody.It's great!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who can't love a story about little people with furry feet going off to fight a dragon!? This story is a masterpiece in itself. Second best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Like many people, I list \\"The Hobbit\\" as one of my childhood classics. Now those favorites from my younger days are curious things. As a child, they never seemed to grow old or stale. I read this book and several others until my copies were ready to fall apart. But upon rereading them as an adult, some of them have proven to be disappointing. Which isn't to say that books like The Chronicles of Narnia or \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" are bad, but they don't carry as much emotional punch as they could and seem a little tedious in retrospect.Not so with \\"The Hobbit\\". Having recently read it for the first time in more than ten years, I can say that this book is every bit as exciting and imaginative from an adult perspective as from a child's. It is amazing. It approaches perfection in so many areas that it daunts the imagination. For instance, consider how much Tolkien is able to accomplish in just the first chapters. He introduces all the important characters and gives them distinctive personalities, builds sympathy for the hero, provides all the necessary backstory, injects a little humor, and prepares you for the epic adventure ahead.And what an adventure it is! I marveled at Tolkien's amazing skill in so many areas. His action sequences are fast, short, and easy to visualize. His songs and poetry add a wonderfully quaint touch to the story. His simple descriptive writing paints perfect portraits of landscapes in just a few sentences. There is literally nothing done wrong in this story. The current crop of fantasy authors would do well to pause from their latest eight-hundred page extravaganza and remind themselves that Tolkien never repeated himself or included anything unnecessary. His goal was to write small and speedy, to always be providing something new for the reader.A note about the illustrations: some of the editions that they're hawking now include copies of the pen and ink drawings that Tolkien did for the first edition. Like many people, I was raised with the 1966 paperback that didn't include the illustrations. It's an unfortunate fact that Tolkien's skill as an artist didn't come close to matching his skill as a writer. Some of the drawings are decent, but others are almost laughably bad. I would recommend trying to find a copy without the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the name of the Hobbit living in the Shire when one day a wizard appears and changes his life. He is invited to share with them a journey as a burglar. At first Bilbo turns him down but soon 13 dwarves are in his house and convince him to reconsider. He decides to go with them and hurries to meet up with them. The party's goal is to journey to the Lonely Mountains to retain a treasure stolen from their ancestor from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they are attacked by various fairy tale creatures and meet a creature named Gollum. Scared by Gollum's odd ways and trickery, Bilbo uses the ring that he has stumbled upon in the tunnels. Gollum goes crazy and tries to get him but Bilbo narrowly escapes. The journey goes on and things change for Bilbo and he returns to his hobbit-hole a totally different person. This is a great book that I recommend to older kids probably at least in 7th grade."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read the hobbit in 6th grade, so that i could have a head start on the Lord of the Rings series. I didnt really expect to like the book, but once i picked it up i could't put it down. The detailed writing of J.R.R Tolkien had me hooked. All of the magic, dragons, and other fantasy creatures were perfect for the type of book i liked to read. I would reccomened this book to anyone who loves fantasy or is just looking for a good read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It bothers some people that so many of the characters in the Hobbit are undeveloped. Only Bilbo, Gandalf, and Gollum shine. This, however, is still workable. With Thorin as a distinct personality among the Dwarves, the others function all right as a group with whom Bilbo doesn't really interact on a personal level.A much more serious problem exists in the Hobbit - the mid-book action is too good! \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" makes such a memorable literary impression that following adventures, even if good, would pale. Worse, after Mirkwood, the book just peters out. The interview with Smaug stands out in an island of otherwise mediocre action. The Battle of Five Armies is almost skipped, definitely lacking the emotion of meeting the Goblins in the Misty Mountains. Bilbo's stealthy dealing with the Arkenstone adds some interest, but the end of this otherwise marvelous book just falls down.But don't mistake criticism for dislike. Even recognizing this, the Hobbit stands as an adventure akin to Treasure Island or the Wind in the Willows. The stay-at-home off to a grand quest makes for a wonderful beginning, the Trolls are fine, the eagles soar, Beorn is intriguing, and Mirkwood is haunting. The child who misses the experience of the Hobbit must face the only remedy - he or she must read it as an adult!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are truly fans of fantasy books. Tolkein does a very well at describing the adventure of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, first published in the mid-1930's, is a wonderfully inventive story. If you're expecting it to be the same style and intensity as Lord of the Rings you may be disappointed. This story, while having it's dramatic moments, is more mellow and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR. In reading this you get the impression that Tolkein was enjoying himself as much as we have enjoyed reading it. I must have read this book at least 15 times between 1975 and 1990. It has been years though, and with the new release of the movie I decided to re-introduce myself to an old friend.The Hobbit is a tale about Bilbo Baggins (a relatively minor character in LOTR) and his adventures with 13 dwarfs to reclaim their treasure. Initially led by the wizard Gandalf the troop encounter trolls, goblins, elves, giant spiders, and of course THE DRAGON. What I liked the most about the story is that Tolkien really uses his sense of humor throughout, something missing in LOTR. Of course we get to meet two characters who play important roles in LOTR: Elrond, the Elf Lord, and Gollum. The story follow the group from the beginning of their journey in the Shire, their trek across the wilderness where they are waylaid by trolls, and over (and under) the misty mountains where they are captured by goblins. It is here that Bilbo finds 'The Ring' and his life changes forever. After their escape they make their way through mirkwood, where they are first ensnared by spiders and then imprisoned by elves. In both cases Bilbo is able to rescue them. And of course to the journey's end at the Lonely Mountain and their confrontation with Smaug the dragon. The tale ends on a sad yet uplifing note of redemption.Although you can read Lord of the Rings, or even watch the movie, without reading The Hobbit first why would you want to?It's just much more fun to read this beforehand. I would also recommend &quot;The Simarillon&quot;, Tolkien's mythology of middle earth. This book gives you the complete history of the elves and the first two ages, leading up to the events told here."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After having recently re-read the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in anticipation of the movie, I bought the Hobbit again since I'd lost my copy. To read it after the trilogy was an eye opener. It was obvious that Tolkien's skills in writing about the Middle Earth were much more developed in the later books. Still enjoyable, but not as visual and gripping as the trilogy to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was a kid, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a perceived boy book. Girls, instead, read \\"Little Women\\", \\"Betsy-Tacy\\", and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\". Ask a boy to read any of those series, and they'd gag. Those girl books, however, are still great contributions to the literary and imaginative worlds.*** So even though Tolkien hasn't reached me until now (and well past my childhood years), \\"The Hobbit\\" is a rewarding pleasure. It's the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\") and considered gentler and more suitable for reading to young children than the subsequent installments.*** The Hobbitt is Bilbo Baggins who leaves his comfortable abode (his hobbitt hole) to go adventuring with the wizard Gandalf and a party of dwarves who have a penchant for breaking into boisterous singing during mealtimes.*** They're off in search of treasure with little more than an old map and a lot of gumption to guide them. Bravery emerges in a disarming way. Tolkien understands the homeliness of his hobbitt and the dwarves -- the sort of quality we, the readers, have as humans but spend a lot of time concealing as uncool. So when adventure prods the timid and the inexperienced into derring-do, we are swept along like participants ourselves. Tolkien shows that even the littlest, unlikely ones have a place with the heroes..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was inspired to reread Tolkien's &#34;the Hobbit&#34; after seeing the 2012 movie that covered the first 100 pages of the book.

It's small size and old-school pocket bible style makes it even more amazing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a middle-schooler I loved this book and The Lord of the Rings, and read them all multiple times. I remember that once I began reading the trilogy I no longer had that much desire to revisit The Hobbit, thinking of it as child's fare. That was a loooong time ago, and I have wanted to re-read the book that started me into the fantasy genre. I have now satisfied that desire with the kindle version, and have to say that the story reads almost like a summary of itself in too many places. It's also written in a voice entirely unlike the serious tone of the trilogy to which it is a prequel---it is truly a book written to appeal to children, not adults. So, the adult in me wants to give the book three stars, but the child I used to be remembers this book quite fondly and had it on a pedestal at the time, and would give it five stars. So I have settled in the middle---pardon the unintended pun reference to middle-earth---at four stars. If you have a child in elementary school or early middle school, or even better a child that you are reading stories too every night, that child would probably really enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins the hobbit was just about to have his tea one Wednesday when suddenly his doorbell rang. He instantly remembered that Gandalf the wizard was going to have tea with him. To his great surprize, thirteen dwarves in addition to Gandalf ended up at his table that afternoon. Thorin and Co., as the dwarves called themselves, were in need of a fourteenth member of their group to assist them on their quest to get back gold and other riches the dragon Smaug had stolen from them. Bilbo obliged and accompanied the band of dwarves on their rescue mission. On many occasions during his journey, Bilbo wished that he were back home, but once his duty was complete, Bilbo never regretted going with the dwarves.With an unexpected ending and great descriptions, I would undoubtedly recommend this book. Despite a slow and boring beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Hobbit. I really liked how this plot was so unpredictable. Thorin and Co.'s journey took so many enexpected turnes that it kept me on my toes and really into the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"We checked this book from our library and we're not finished so we are going to buy a copy.

I never heard the thing without skipping first parts of the chapters that weren't as important. Last year, in fourth grade, I read the book for a report and loved it even more than before. I am on chapter seven again. The book is about a hobbit who is asked by a wizard and thirteen dwarves to go on an adventure with them to reclaim a lost treasure stolen by the evil dragon Smaug. It takes a lot of courage and adventure to go on the journey to get to the mountain that Smaug lives in and the crew of thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and a wizard have to brave. They eventually get there, though. You should definetly read this wonderful, exiting book if your are a person who loves adventure, excitment, and just plain great writing. If you liked this, I suggest you read the Lord of the Rings--what the Hobbit is leading up to. Those, I am just starting to read. I am loving it on chapter seven. Read that too. GREAT BOOKS!!

Tolkien has the imagination of a 3rd grader, and puts his skills to the paper in one of the best books ever written. Although written decades ago, the fantasy novel still intrigues readers of all kinds. The Hobbit could very well be read by the average middle school student, but also enjoyed by the grown-up that whishes to be once again like a middle school student. Tolkien takes you through the world of Middle-Earth on a journey where no hobbit would normally venture. It is a trek that you will not forget.

There were many parts of the book which I had forgotten about, and there were also many parts of the book which helped explain the movie. It is a quick read (I finished in about 3 days), very exciting, and an action packed book. I would recommend that anyone interested in reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" start with this book first. If you like it you will surely like the remaining books.

They have no need for shoes, because lots of hair grow on their little feet and leathery soles, and they can creep around very quietly without a noise. One particular hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is an ordinary hobbit that lives in a large hobbit-hole in The Hill, and never thought he would have an adventure or wanted one until one beautifully sunny day in April. On this day, while sitting outside, there stood the great wizard, Gandalf! They planned tea for the next day, and before poor Bilbo knew it, there were thirteen dwarfs (not including Gandalf and Bilbo)! Bilbo was so surprised and busy (preparing more tea and food for the dwarfs) that he did not remember that it was his fiftieth birthday the next day. On the day of his birthday, Gandalf and the dwarfs, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bomber, and Thorin, took him on a quest to retrieve the treasure that the evil dragon, Smaug had stolen. It was a very hard trip there, with little and sometimes no food, lots of horrible situations and enemies including some giant spiders, goblins, wolves, and trolls. In one occurrence, Bilbo finds a golden rings and figures out that it can make him invisible and he uses it to try to escape from many bad situations.This magical fantasy masterpiece is sure to capture your heart and live in your imagination forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a delightful story with much adventure and drama.

Tolkien's 1937 novel, \\"The Hobbit: or There and Back Again\\" is the starting point for what became \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is a whimsical adventure, introducing us to hobbits, dwarves, elves, dragons, and a host of other fantastic creatures. However, this is not just a tale of quest-adventure, or a simple morality play. Tolkien's own introduction to the first edition notes the \\"glimpses into the history and politics\\" of Bilbo's world that the novel provides. Indeed, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a journey from innocence to experience, but the lessons learned are fraught with contradictions and complicated political messages.\\"The Hobbit\\" begins abruptly, as Bilbo Baggins, a 50 year old hobbit, living a comfortable, sedate life, is intruded upon by the wizard Gandalf and a company of 13 dwarves. Against his better judgement, Bilbo is swept into accompanying this band in a quest to recover the treasure and birthright of Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarf leader. For countless years, the Lonely Mountain, ancestral home of Thorin's people, has been inhabited by the powerful usurping dragon, Smaug. At Gandalf's insistence, the dwarves, believing Bilbo to be an accomplished burglar, recruit the hobbit to assist their quest. The quest, which takes the adventurers halfway across their world, is beset by trials and tribulations, as they must face dangerous goblins, spiders, the dragon, and the commercial civilization of Men. These are trials of mental and physical strength, and they test the dwarves, but more importantly, Bilbo. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum and the adventure of the Ring is the centerpiece of the novel. Bilbo's characterization as a burglar by Gandalf and the dwarves at the novel's beginning casts a shadow over the ethical decisions Bilbo is faced with throughout the rest of the tale.There are many points of interest in a novel like this, which could be seen as a fairly straightforward Marxist fable. Tolkien's distrust of money as a locus of desire is most apparent in the development of Thorin's character, but also in his anxiety over the Master of Lake-Town, and in the fat and complacent Smaug, whose flesh has become embedded with jewels from ages of sitting atop his treasure hoard. Contrasting this with Bilbo, whose primary interest is in food and good cheer, is problematic. His experiences with Gollum and the Ring and his later relationship with Thorin call into serious question Bilbo's own priorities. In fact, one of the things that is so amazing about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that there seems to be no one character that represents the center of morality in a novel so concerned with honorable action and fair dealing.The action of \\"The Hobbit\\" is fast-paced, and Tolkien for the most part is content to sacrifice character development to plot. That said, the most interesting characters in the novel for me were Gandalf, Bilbo, the \\"skin-changer\\" Beorn, and Thorin. They provide a complicated variety of perspectives on inter-cultural relations and politics, value systems, and justice. Tolkien's achievement in \\"The Hobbit\\" is the way that he disguises what is problematic in the society he presents in what appears to be, and is at heart, a fun and enjoyable adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A hobbit is a little person that lives in the land of Shire. It all starts with Bilbo Baggins, not found of adventures at all! He just likes to live in the comfort of his little hobbit hole. Then along comes thirteen dwarfs accompanied by a wizard named Gandalf. They come to him with a quest. A quest to get their town and treasure back from a dragon named Smaug. They just need one more person for their journey. That person is to be a burglar, and you guessed it, that burglar is Bilbo Baggins! The hobbit goes through many fasinating adventures in this book that are mind-popping and so enjoyable to read. Read the hobbit to find out about the adventures of Bilbo Baggins!Boy, I sure loved this prelude to the Lord of the Rings! It is so fascinating to read about the adventures Bilbo gets into as the book gets nearer and nearer to the end! If you read this and love it like I do, then I suggest you start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, read The Hobbit first! In this book, Bilbo finds a ring that somehow makes him invisible. But that's not all the ring does or creates! there is an evil master to that ring and put the two together, well Houston we got a problem! Frodo, Bilbo's cousin by blood, but now his adopted son because Frodo's parents died in a boating accident has a quest to distroy that awful ring in the fires of Mordor.Read the Lord of the Rings trilogy for more fantasy adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently read the &quot;Hobbit&quot; so that I could then move onto &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and then go see &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movies.I have never read Fantasy books before so this was my first one, and I have to say that Fantasy takes some getting used to.While I enjoyed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, I did find some parts of it slow and uninteresting. I decided that Fantasy is probably not my favorite genre, however, the the book was still good and I would recommend it.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, along with Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves taking a journey to try and reclaim treasure taken from the dwarves ancestors by an evil dragon.For someone used to reading books grounded closer to reality, the plot of this book may sound kind of funny. But after you read about the experiances of this group of adventurers, you will have to agree it is quite a fun story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is by far the best of the Middle Earth books. The pages of mind-numbing verse are all-but absent in this book, replaced by actual narration and dialogue. The few(er) occasions during which we are subjected to Tolkien's less-then-stellar grasp of rhymed verse are at the very least more bearable. The story is as rich in detail and plot as the LOTR pseudo-trilogy, if not more so, with the added bonus of actual characterization for many of the characters. I found this to be the most fulfilling book of the Middle Earth series, despite (or because of?) it being the shortest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Movie Proposal-The HobbitDate: 12/01/00To: Mr. Steven SpielbergFrom: Mr. Alan WilcoxSubject: Pertaining to the proposal that the story The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Kill goblins,fly on giant eagles,and battle a fire breathing dragon!

One day, alot of little dwarves come to his door, one by one, these little dwarves keep showing up. Then, his good friend, Gandalf shows up. Gandalf is a very powerful wizard whom Bilbo looks up to. Gandalf had come to Bilbo's door with all the dwarves because he had an adventure, or rather a quest for little bilbo baggins. One of the dwarves was related to a king that ruled a moutain. He had many riches and he treasured them so much that he filled the tunnels in the mountain with the treasure. One day a huge dragon invaded the mountain and horded all the gold and had been guarding it to the present day that Gandalf went to Bag End to Bilbo's little hobbit home. So Bilbo and Gandalf and the 14 Dwarves set out to the mountain. The mountain was set in the North Mountain chain. They went through the Dark Woods and the hills and through various mountain chains. They finally got to the mountain and they hid in a cave. Finally, Bilbo found a way to defeat the dragon and he was a hero. He had all the gold and riches he could ever want.The theme of \\"The Hobbit\\", I think is that size does not matter.

It follows Bilbo Baggins, and a band of crazy dwarfs and the Magician Gandalf to the Lonely Mountain, where the dragon Smaug guards a notorious Dwarven treasure. I do not want to spoil any plot details so I will stop here.

Boy, was I sure wrong! The characters were round, possessed both good qualities and flaws (for example, the dwarfs were excessively greedy, and there were serious problems because of that) and the group changed by each new experience acquired.

Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've lost count of the number of times I've read The Hobbit over the years, it was the book that started my love of all things fantasy and it was always a go to book that I could read again and again as I was growing up. It must have been at least 5 years since I last read it though so I wanted to pick it up again before going to see the movie. It doesn't matter how many times I pick it up I still love it as much as the first and it always surprises me how many little details I forget between readings.I know that most people have already read the story but if you're one of the few who haven't then I'd highly recommend it. It's a great story for adults but I also think it makes fantastic bed time reading with children because it's such a fun adventure story. There is a reason it's considered a classic! The last thing Bilbo Baggins is looking for is an adventure, he is quite happy living in his hobbit hole enjoying plenty of food and good company when he wants it (which is not too often thank you very much). When Gandalf arrives with a party of thirteen dwarves Bilbo is convinced they have come to the wrong person for help but the more he learns about their quest to re-claim their lands from the dragon who stole them the more curious he becomes and in the end he can't resist joining them.Bilbo is the least likely of heroes, he doesn't consider himself particularly brave or smart and he has practically no experience of travelling or fighting, but when it comes down to it the dwarves wouldn't have got very far without him. I always enjoy seeing Bilbo reach is full potential, he goes on a journey of personal discovery and proves to everyone just what a strong character he is. The story isn't as dark or scary as the Lord of the Rings books are and is suitable for a younger audience but it is still quite scary in places and the scenes with Gollum are particularly creepy. I love the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum but have to admit that I'd be hopeless at figuring out the answers myself if I was in Bilbo's place!

As I understand it, Peter Jackson's sourced ancillary material to stretch this one book into a film trilogy, so I wanted to be certain of the legitimate origin first. It doesn't disappoint on this visit. That's the best word to describe it. Coming back to this warm, familiar tale is like visiting a friend. Who lives in a hole in the side of a hill. And it also makes me want ale.Definite recommend for those making another pass through the Shire and beyond, and for those setting foot in Middle Earth for the first time.

I can usually read a book in a couple of days but this one took me over a week; and it's not that long of a book. I thought the characters were a lot of fun and Bilbo is wonderful little hobbit. However, some of the descriptions of the journey were a bit tedious.Overall, I'm glad I finally read The Hobbit.

Do you like action? Do you like short, fat, little burglars? Then The Hobbit is the book for you. This is a hilarious book filled to the brim with magic and action, and the main character is a miniature burglar who always has his tea at four. Or will he?The reason that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this novel was to entertain teenagers and adults. He has accomplished his goal as a writer at least fourteen times over.This book takes place in Middle Earth, a medieval-type world with creatures and people of all sorts. Just to name a few: Dragons, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, Wargs, and Wizards. This is how you can tell that this book is fantasy. Here is a quote from page 145 \\"'Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is Drowning!' he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge,\\" I think that this book has great plot, good characterization and an awesome theme.I think that Tolkien accomplished his goal in The Hobbit. One thing that I left out was his characters, they are Gandalf the Wizard; Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin, and Thorin Oakenshield the Dwarves; Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit burglar. They have been over hill and dale, through an ominous wood, forded several rivers and fought a great battle. My opinion of this book was that it is 100% totally absotively posilutely AWESOME! My personal connection to this book is the fact that I had a grandfather just like gandalf (except for the fact that Gandalf was a wizard) he was cool, calm, and collected. He had a great sense of humor, and he knew the way out of any tough situation.Bringing this review to a close, I think that you should read this book. I rate it 11 out of 10. I think that this will be the only book with this rating.Your reviewer,Ben Jammer"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great graphic novel adaption with beautiful illustrations for the younger crowd, or those just wanting a new view of Middle-earth. I got a bunch for the 10 and under crowd in the family."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was the book that introduced me to the incredible and expansive world of Middle-Earth...or should I say the cartoon?...i first saw this in the old cartoon version, catching it ocassionally on TV, but never from the beginning (closest I saw to the beginning was the scene where the eagles rescue the company from the top of the trees) and I enjoyed watching it each time. A few years after seeing it the first time, I happened to pick up The Hobbit at my school library (this was in the 6th grade), and started reading it. I did not recognize it till I reached the same event in the book, and I realized I was reading the source of the cartoon. That discovery, that there was a book form of the story, eventually led me to find the LOTR Trilogy and the other books of the Middle-Earth universe...that being said, I love this book. The narrative style does seem a bit more geared toward younger readers, which was wonderful given the age at which I first picked it up, and that might turn away older readers who are getting their first taste of the Middle-Earth. However, having read the Trilogy numerous times through, as well as having read the Indexes and Silmarillion, going back to the Hobbit opened a whole new world. Things like realizing that the same Elven King that held the dwarves prisoner was the father of Legolas, or that Gandalf meeting Thorin was possibly by chance yet the events he set had a much greater purpose than getting rid of a Dragon and reclaiming a treasure (Sauron's attack in the ROTK might have gone differently had the dragon still lived...and an alliance between the Dwarves and the Men stood in his way). It was like finding invisible ink on many of the pages that gave bits of information here or there. Since I am a diehard fan, I found rereading the Hobbit was even better the second and third times through...and there is still so much know and find out, and that is what I find so wonderful about the LOTR and Middle-Earth.This book certainly might not be everyone's cup of tea, just as there are differences in tastes of music. The very descriptive style of Tolkien does turn some people off to his works, and others, like myself, find ourselves embracing every word.It is certainly a great read for the Tolkien fan and for younger children, and can be, if you let it, the first step into a much larger world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book in fourth grade and I loved it to the last sentence. The adventure doesn't stop, which meant that both times that I was reading it, I didn't want to stop reading. I'm an avid lover of fantasy and J.R.R. Tolkien has written a really good novel. The detail was great, and made it so you could imagine the surroundings and actions almost perfectly.Some think it's a book for teens and kids, but I think I'll love rereading it through my life. It's a great novel and journey.The riddles and poetry in the book was also very good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have been a mad keen J.R.R.

I have enjoyed re-reading The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings many times over during the past thirty year but many hours of travelling to and from work prompted me to purchase the audio versions of my two favourite books. This rendition of The Hobbit is excellent. The narration of Rob Inglis is perfectly suited to this genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My family and I have immensely enjoyed this CD set as well as the entire Lord of the Rings stories narrated by Rob Inglis.

I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" then and, upon rereading it recently, I enjoyed just as much again. Seeing Bilbo reluctantly dragged from his comfortable hobbit hole into the adventure of a lifetime and seeing him rise to the occasion time and again was pure delight.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a magical book which resonates with overtones of mythology and folklore. Tolkien was a specialist in Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse materials--Beowulf, the sagas, and Eddic poetry were part of his professional stock in trade. Much of the atmosphere of his books comes from his use of these materials. Having studied a bit of Old Norse mythology since my first reading of \\"The Hobbit,\\" this time around I had a deeper appreciation of Tolkien's accomplishment.Unlike the LOTR trilogy, Tolkien originally wrote \\"The Hobbit\\" for children. This makes the book a little simpler thematically than the other books. However, Tolkien does deal with some very adult themes in spots and adds a touch of ambiguity to some of the characters as well. The aftereffects of the death of Smaug and the battles at the end of the book are cases in point. But whether you choose to read deeper meanings into the book or not, it remains a wonderful, enchanting read.One final word-this time around I listened to an audio version of the book. Not only did this make time spent driving much more enjoyable, but the narrator's singing made the songs come alive in ways that they hadn't before."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book for anybody who likes adventure stories.

Tolkien may be just the type of book you are looking for. In better detail, if you didn't know, a hobbit is a little person. They are about half our size and have furry feet. They live in small hobbit holes and like to be left alone by people not of their own kind. The Hobbit is the exciting prelude to the award-winning triolgy The Lord of the Rings. The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's journey is quite different than that of a normal hobbit. He sets off on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a great wizard named Gandalf. They would travel all across the land, which was called Middle Earth, and fight trolls, dragons, and something called Gollum. The purpose of the journey is to regain the dwarves' stolen treasure. In some parts of this otherwise flawless book, Tolkien over desribes things. When there is no excitment in the story at a certain time, I found myself wanting to move on and skip pages. I do not think you should look this book over and not read it because it looks like something a geek would read. This however is not the case, because The Hobbit should be looked upon as a great work of art, not something that is simply tossed aside. The book will keep you wanting to read more the further you get into it. As you continue to find out about Bilbo's exciting adventure, you will find that you have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am currently reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; against my will.

The Hobbit has lots of suspense that makes you want to hit yourself if you have to go to sleep and not read the next chapter, it scares you so much you're so scared you don't want to read tha next chapter and finally, it brings you to fight with yourself. A little bit like this, is the character making the right decision, what will the consequences be, and how will the problem be solved. So through the whole you're racking your brain while you're reading.

Children might like it but it isn't 'for' children any more then the fantasy genre is in general.I think this books stands above the LOTR triology quite easily because it's primarily a book about good vs evil as opposed to the two blended and mixed on so many levels as to leave you feeling depressed. This is a straight out story. Beautifully written, no axe to grind or weird theology to push (or confused theology) it just is.I like it.I gave it five stars for the quality of the writing and the storytelling magic it conveys. The characters are very memorable and leave you feeling inspired.I think it was on my top ten books list for over a decade or so.(a fantasy novel doesn't have to have depression and horror stories to make it 'adult'.)PS. I don't generally like the fantasy genre because it often glorifies all kinds of things that arn't healthy (harry potter for example). But that being said, I think that the hobbit would fall less into that category then the narnia series (personally) and those are marketed as 'christian books'. It's the heart of a book that strikes you the most - not necessarily the vehicle that carrys it. I think the hobbit is pretty harmless compared to the majority of stuff that's out there.I'd read it to my children if they were old enough and wise enough to understand the implications of what they were hearing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm ashamed to say I have never read the Lord of the Ring series before (I may have started one once but didn't like it and put it back down) and even after seeing the movies, which I did enjoy, I still didn't dive into Tolkien's world. Well I decided to remedy that and picked up the Hobbit, the prequel of sorts to the Lord of the Rings series. I have to say I wasn't all that impressed. It was an inventive story for sure, and Tolkien had a lot of imagination, but there were a lot of flaws in this book in my opinion.We are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit that likes to make sure meals are regular and a comfy chair exists in his hole in the ground. He is surprised one day by the wizard Gandalf who brings thirteen dwarves to meet his acquaintance. They tell him he is to come on a journey and help the dwarves so that they may regain their homeland and treasure from a dragon who has stolen it all. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems though and they encounter many hardships and perils on the road. Not a lot of people seem to like this merry band of travelers and they are constantly fighting for their lives and freedom. But some other things do happen, and a lot changes when Bilbo finds a very mysterious ring.The characters in this novel are well developed. I was glad to see Gollum as he is my favorite character in the movies and he was well written in these pages. Bilbo was also done splendidly and you were able to get a good sense of what Hobbits are like from him. Even the dwarves, as many as there were, had distinct personalities.The writing is where I found some faults. This book is extremely rushed! It seems like they were no sooner getting into trouble than they were out of it and into some different sort of trouble. Because of this, there didn't seem to be any suspense to the novel and it would have been nice if Tolkien had settled on a few instances and described them well, then had many that hardly got any description at all. He seemed to repeat himself too with our heroes getting captured at least four times, although I stopped counting after awhile. That being said, even the violence in this novel was tame and nothing was offensive that I could find so it is appropriate for all readers.I wish I would have enjoyed the book more. I do hear that this is the weakest out of the series so I will continue on. I just hope they get a little better as right now I'm not sure what all the hype is about.The HobbitCopyright 1937306 pagesReview by M.

The numerous illustrations included from the different versions and translations of The Hobbit were an added pleasure in this special edition.The Hobbit is a classic well worth reading again and again. It is time to take the journey again and look for more landmarks along the way. Bilbo Baggins is an everyman character very easy to identify with. Perhaps you feel ordinary, don't let that stop you from having an adventure. Go with Bilbo on his journey and cheer him on. Treat everyone you meet with caution and courtesy--you don't always know if they will be friend or foe. For more travel adventures in Middle-Earth read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--the reading level is somewhat harder than the Hobbit.

Please dont take any offense to my opinion, for they are not directed to offend anyone else. Tolkien had an extremley strong beginning.Learning about Bilbo and all the dwarves really drew me into the story. I absolutely loved the detail the author put in all the characters. It really helped paint a picture for me to capture the essence of the story. As the story continued on, my excitement started to linger off. I wasn't as excited about the dwarves and Bilbo. I think those challenges they faced definitely could had a stronger build up to that point where the problem comes into effect.The one thing that upset me the most was the ending. Throughout the entire story the author talks about Bilbo facing the dragon alone. You can assume that something will happen to the dwarves that caused Bilbo to defeat Smaug single handed. The truth of the matter is, the dwarves sent Bilbo in alone because they were cowards and didn't want to do the dirty work. Then some random guy named Bard from the lake town ends up defeating Smaug and throws the whole story out of whack. The dwarves are clueless for a long time about the death of Smaug, and the switch of tenses can definitely end up confusing the reader.All in the entire of the story as a whole fits the fantasy genre. There are high and low points but the journey the characters face, and the overall moral of the story will leave a lasting impression on me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Despite the many 5-star reviews of this book, I believe &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is overrated and boring.

It's just too much of a &quot;My First Fantasy Novel&quot; to really interest me, even when I first read it at age 10 or so. Of course, by then, I was already into Mercedes Lackey and other fantasy, so the almost-nonexistant character personalities and and uninteresting creatures (Orcs and one smelly dragon.Wow.) showed their true blandness in contrast.And where are the female characters? E-mail me if there are some and I've just forgotton, but from what I remember, there are no women at all that are more than just mentioned. Was Tolkien really that much of a chauvenist?If you thought that this book was okay, but not fantastic, and that some parts were a bit too boring, whatever you do, DO NOT READ THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING!!!!

They also don't fit the spirit of dwarves, but then again after time they evolved into the grumpy alchoholics fantasy tends to portray them as. All the characters were corny and annoying. Anyway, don't get me wrong about it. I understood it. I loved the Dragonlance chronicles and Wheel of Time which made this book look so childish.

And I really recommend reading it before you see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Get it. Just get it. I picked this book up for an English literature project in Middle School, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Tolkien superbly writes this novel, weaving a fantasy universe that have wasted countless hours of my time on wikipedia. Although it was written in a more lighthearted manner than the Lord of the Ring Series, also by Tolkien, it does not lessen at all the fantastic storytelling of the book.In short, a hobbit (an imaginary creature that resembles people, just half their size), named Bilbo Baggins, is whisked away on an adventure, along with a band of courageous dwarves, and a wizard, in order to reclaim the dwarves lost treasure that was stolen by a dragon named Smaug. It sounds like a story to start your typical Dungeons and Dragons encounter, but trust me that it will be much more than that. I couldn't put the book down after I picked it up, I think that I had finished it in about two days. If you've already seen the movie, don't worry, there is much storyline that the movie didn't recount. Besides, you can boast to your friends after reading this that you know how the Hobbit movies will end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although not as bad as any video game or movie, this audio version still can't live up to the high standards set by tolkien fanatics, but on the other hand, every Tolkien Fanatic has allready read The Hobbit so there is no problem there.

Just a thought!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was an amazing book. This is a tale about a small fat person who is of the hobbit kind. His name is Bilbo Baggins. The Hobbit is an epic tale of adventure, riddles, and mystifying tales. I enjoyed this book so much that I have read it 4 times! In this story you will find the presence of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls, Dragon, and many other fantasy like creatures. I recomend this to any person who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do you like action packed novels bursting with surprises? If you do, you'll love The Hobbit, written by J.J. R. Tolkien. This novel is full of suspense, peril, and adventure. You don't know what will happen next. Mr. Baggins (Bilbo), a hobbit, has a variety of adventures from being assaulted by trolls to being trapped in a cave. The adventure starts when a magical wizard meets Bilbo offering him adventure that he politely refuses, only to find himself tagging along the next day. Bilbo finds that the adventure he has been assigned to is full of peril, and he desires more than once that he could be back in his comfortable hobbit hole. Accompanying him on his adventure are thirteen dwarfs. The dwarfs get into more trouble than Bilbo himself, and he saves their lives more than once. Gandalf (the wizard) helps them on their way, but only for a short while because he also has business that must be taken care of. I would give this book five stars, because it's very well thought out and was written well. If you like books with many twists and turns,not knowing what will happen next, then you will like this book. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a hobbit and his adventure to find an old dwarf kingdom.

Tolkien himselfs said that he despises allegory. Neither is this a book a simple children's book. It fits nicely in between these two..not so complicated that you'd need to go over it again and again to discover some reflection of humanity...and not so simple that you feel you are reading a childrens book.

It is quick paced and very entertaining, a pleasurable respite from the often bogged down with hidden meanings of what too frequently passes for literature. I'm not trying to denegrate some high-class piece of thought-provoking insight, some Don DeLillo, some Thomas Pynchon, some William Gaddis, et. al. But how often have you picked up a book and become absorbed with a story, with what's going to actually happen next without the instrusion of some pretentious, philosophical meandering? It is a break for the serious-minded high art fan, a great read to the lowly John Grisham afficinado. All in all, a wonderful passage of time, transported to a magical place almost too real for the span of time you are being a voyuer, watching and waiting some never was characters fight never was creatures in a fundamentally never was land in this imaginative terrain that you have to believe in for such a short period of time. Going on to the massive sequal, The Lord of the Rings, you are even further left in awe of the thought and sheer imaginative brilliance Mr. Tolkien put into his life's work to create, with such immaculate detail, a new mythology for all the world to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's just a classic adventure.

I suppose there is some justice in retrieving the dwarf treasure from the clutches of the dragon, but it seemed so rooted in greed than in justice that just didn't seem a story-worthy plot or one worth risking life and limb for. And the first 50% of the book was just so whiny - I'm hungry! I'm thirsty! I'm sleepy! I'm cold! I'm wet! I want to go back! - that it reminded me of many a hike and camping trip in Scouts when I was a patrol leader with kids on their first time out.And yet, Bilbo does emerge as a leader of the quest, and learns a lor about himself in doing so. In that, I think a child would find inspiration in what is, at heart, a children's story.It is must reading to backfill the lore in Lord of the Rings, but the sense of good vs. evil is *so* much better in LotR than in the Hobbit.And speaking of greed: 3 movies for a 300-page book? Really? I just don;t know how they are going to do it and it seems so much against the moral of the story in terms of what Bilbo happily took in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have loved this since I was young, and it still stands up.

He doesn't do it all alone, however. He uses a special ring that gives him a certain power. Once you have taken the journey with Bilbo from the Shire to the unknown territories of enchantment, you will just be forced to check out the Lord of the Rings series for further adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit Book ReviewBy PeterThe Hobbit is a story about Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit from Bag-end, a place in the Middle Ages. Hobbits are smaller that you and I. They don't wear shoes because they have hairy feet. Their houses are called hobbit holes. They are holes in the ground (hill). One nice day in May Bilbo gets an unusual visitor. The guest is unusual because it just so happens that he is a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit knew the wizard because when he was young the wizard came to Bag-end to meet old friends and make fireworks. Gandalf was an old friend of the Took family and Bilbo's mother. He and the Took family used to go on all sorts of adventures. Obviously the Took's weren't hobbits because generally most hobbits enjoy peace and tranquility. Little did Bilbo know he was about to embark on an amazing quest along with thirteen dwarves and of course Gandolf. Soon he will be battling with goblins, Gullem, orcs, giant spiders, and Smaug the dragon. All he has to help him along are his friends, Spike the sword, and his very unusual ring.The Hobbit is a great book to me because it is full of magic, battle, legends, and many unusual creatures. I would absolutely recommend this tale to anybody that wants adventure and fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character in The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who lives in a hobbit hole. He wants to be left alone in the piece and quiet. There are a gang of homeless dwarves who talk him into going on a journey to find a ring.This is my favorite book. The book is my favorite because it is so long and entertaining. The writer knew what they were trying to say in this book. The book entertained me the whole time.The title The Hobbit means there was a little Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He was lost in his own little world and just wanted to have some piece and quiet. He is on an adventure for a gang of dwarves.I first picked this book because my teacher made me. Then after the first chapter I started reading it non stop. The book was so adventuress.The theme of this book was that Bilbo Baggins was supposed to slay a dragon so the hobbits could be free. This was an intriguing book filled with adventure. This book relates to me because I like to go on adventures and he is on one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you travel alot, like I do, you spend a lot of time looking for good quality audio books. This reading of The Hobbit is unabridged so it doesn't miss a thing. Although this audio book is not dramatized, the reading is so skillful that you almost hear the action not just the words being spoken. If you have seen the Lord of the Rings Movies or read the books, then you will love listening to this most excellent audio performance of the Hobbit, which is the prequel to the LOTR trilogy. A must have for anyone's audio book library."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of those novels that I'd put off reading for a long time. I often had difficulty getting past the first few pages. This isn't my sort of read, for I've never been into this sort of fantasy-and-magic-realism-for-children genre. But then I couldn't put it down the second I decided to give it a whirl. The Hobbit is a well written, engaging, and oftentimes humorous work of fantasy. It is aimed at a youthful audience and I think it would be a marvelous next step for Harry Potter fanatics. That is if said fanatics hadn't read this classic gem beforehand. In any event, this novel is far better written than the aforementioned popular series. This book is a wonderful revelation and I recommend it. You won't be able to put it down once you get into it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book tells of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and of his companions, a group of thirteen dwarves (Tolkien's preferred spelling) and the wizard Gandalf, as they set out to rescue a hoard of stolen gold from a fierce dragon. (A hobbit, for those not familiar with Tolkien's world, is a small, hairy-footed person who lives in a hole in the ground). Along the way, they have various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves, animals and even humans.If the above brief synopsis makes the book seem like a twee Enid Blyton tale for infants, all I can say is that it is not. Unlike the more adult The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit probably was written primarily with children in mind, but it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults. Indeed, it can in many ways be read as an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.The Hobbit can be divided into two parts, corresponding to the time before and the time after the finding of the gold. The earlier part is lighter in tone. Although Bilbo and the dwarves face dangers in the course of their journey, they are able, by courage, ingenuity and luck, to overcome them; they are always the heroes, and the reader's sympathy is with them as they battle with the malevolent trolls, goblins and wolves they meet along their way. Bilbo is a particularly well-drawn character. He starts out as hesitant and nervous about the enterprise (hobbits tend to be conservative and unadventurous), but as it progresses finds within himself reserves of courage and resourcefulness, which enable him to rescue his companions from danger. (The dwarves, on the other hand, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, apart from their determined, headstrong leader Thorin Oakenshield and the fat, lazy Bombur).After the gold is found, the tone of the book becomes darker. The dwarves become less heroic and more morally ambivalent as disputes over the true ownership of the recovered treasure threaten to lead to war. The issue is not finally resolved until a bloody and destructive battle has taken place. What started as a light-hearted children's adventure story becomes a parable about the corrupting nature of greed and the destructive power of violence. The links between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are thematic as well as narrative"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was amazing, it is a must read. I would would recommend the book for any skill level of reading. The adventures are imaginitive and in detail. The author Tolkien takes your mind to another place. The book is a great start to a series. The journey of Bilbo is fast moving and keeps you on the edge of your seat.I don't know why Hollywood didn't start the movvies off with this. The characters are mysterious and funny. The history, set, characters, and background fit and work great together."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review discusses the graphic novel of Tolkien's The Hobbit, with illustrations by David Wenzel and adapted by Dixon and Deming. The cover art is by Giancola and is different than the cover shown above.I have been enamored of Tolkien's universe for over three decades now, and interested in associated works as well, though some work better than others. This one-volume illustrated adaptation of the novel works very well indeed. What I'm probably most grateful for is that, while not a verbatim transcript, it is a fairly complete adapatation -- even Beorn is here! As for artwork, I always measure Tolkien art by the depiction of the hobbits, and Gandalf, and Wenzel does a fine job IMO. (His pictures are quite different from the cover art.) The hobbits aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're not freakish either, and the dwarves and Gandalf and the elves and the settings are all quite nice.This would be of interest to a Tolkien collector, a fun read for graphic novel fans, and a nice introduction to the Tolkien canon for wee folk.Note: I believe there is also a three-volume graphic novel though I haven't seen it. This edition is complete in one volume."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book that can be re-read multiple times, like any good classic. That's why it's worth the investment to get the CD and enjoy the story again and again while traveling in your car. I find driving long distances boring, but listening to a good book makes the time pass quickly. This edition is the entire book, unabridged. You already like the story, so you just want to know if it is well-read. The answer is that Rob Inglis does a superb job of reading the story, just as you might read it to your kids. He is easy to understand and varies his voice to represent the characters.

While it may not live up to that epic trilogy, \\"Hobbit\\" is rather remarkable in its own way: Tolkien's ability to turn what essentially was a children's bedtime story into an engrossing novel filled with adventure.For a basic plot summary, \\"The Hobbit\\" sees Bilbo Baggins, of Hobbiton, set off on a grand adventure in the company of Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves bent on reclaiming their rightful treasure from a greedy dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the company meets up with some eclectic creatures ranging from trolls and giant spiders to great flying Eagles and even a pathetic little creature called Gollum who is hiding a \\"precious\\" whose significance cannot yet even be fathomed.Whereas \\"LOTR\\" reads like an epic, \\"Hobbit\\" reads as if Tolkien is telling you a story (with both the language and tone of the book reflecting this). It is full of strange creatures and sometimes rather terrifying events, but at the same time it is rather light-hearted, with the merry gang progressing rapid-fire from one adventure to another. There is none of the doom-and-gloom or Middle Earth politics that is often the focus of LOTR.Easily the \\"crown jewel\\" of this novel, though, is the portion involving Gollum and his \\"precious\\". Whether read before or after LOTR, these scenes will stick in your mind long after anything else in this book. Much more reminiscent of the darkness of LOTR.Thus, \\"The Hobbit\\" is basically the \\"first steps\\" of the greatest fantasy story ever created. I can't rate it as better than any of the LOTR books, but if you like a lighter tone and less \\"weight\\" in a book, then this one might just appeal to you even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Why 5 stars?

It is a fun fantasy adventure story which can be enjoyed by younger adults and older adults equally. Current Amazon Product Page recommendation is for \\"ages 12 and up\\" and \\"grades 7 *and up*\\" and this seems appropriate. Please do not be intimidated by the aura of JRR Tolkien and the stature of his 2 main works (The Hobbit andThe Lord of the Rings: One Volume). The Hobbit has not stood the test of time due to praise from critics or from analysis by scholars. It has stood the test of time because it is loved by fantasy readers of all ages. Please do not let the upcoming movie delay your enjoyment of the book. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job creating cinematic versions of the Lord of the Rings and I fully expect him to do so with the Hobbit as well; However, I strongly recommend to READ THE HOBBIT NOW which will allow for greater enjoyment and understanding of the movie later.The Hobbit has long been a favorite story of mine; an old friend who might not always be at hand but is never forgotten. Fortunately, it is now available as an e-book so it is easier to keep track of. This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is living a comfortable and predictable life in the Shire until Gandalf, a wizard, decides that Bilbo is needed to assist 13 dwarves on their quest. Bilbo will join the quest as a burglar based solely on Gandalf's recommendation and no prior experience. Bilbo is dumbfounded to find that he is expected to travel through goblin and troll infested lands to confront a dragon that has stolen the dwarves' rightful treasure. It is great fun to follow Bilbo's transformation from a homebody to a dauntless adventurer while never losing track of his roots. The enhanced version contains additional drawings which are interesting but probably mainly of interest to longtime fans. The enhanced version also contains some audio content (Tolkien reading passages or reciting poetry or songs) which I could not access through my Kindle (only compatible with Ipad and Iphone).This is a must read story for those who are fans of the YA Fantasy Genre. The Hobbit (Enhanced Edition) is 4,956 Kindle locations long excluding sample of The Lord of The Rings. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range. Longer novels, such as those in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.Update December 2012: I was not able to access the bonus audio content with my Kindle Fire HD. This content is only compatible with IPad and IPhone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and it's sequel The Lord of the Rings are widely excepted as not only being some of the best novels written in the 20th century, but the best Fantasy novels ever written. Many people have exhaustively reviewed and analyzed these stories, as well as the differences that resulted from the printing of each edition of these books over the years. I am going to do neither. Not only am I not knowledgeable enough, I'm not interesting in becoming knowledgeable enough to do so.This review is for people like me - people who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings films and are looking forward to the new Hobbit films and are perhaps interested in reading the books, as they have never done so previously. So is the book as great as people say it is? Well, yes. However, personally I didn't think it was perfect. Make no doubts about it, this book was written for a young audience. By no means does that mean adults won't enjoy it, but it's something to note. I tried reading The Hobbit as a child and gave up on it quickly. Tolkien narrates the book as if he is sitting at a campfire telling you a story. The narrator converses with the reader outside of the story - a style I've never really been fond of.Additionally, certain elements of the story can be odd at times. In a book with characters named Bilbo and Gandalf, the Trolls who try to eat the main characters at the beginning of the book are named Bert, Tom, and Bill. Also, there are a lot of talking birds here - which I find a bit ridiculous even for a fantasy book. Tolkien trys to justify why the main character Bilbo, a non adventureous type, would go on a adventure and it never seems believable. That aside, the story is amazingly entertaining. There is a ton of content here. From encounters with Trolls and Goblins, magic rings and Elves, Dragons and stolen treasure, to a battle of Five Armies (which is actually Six Armies if you count the talking birds). I can see why the filmmakers have decided to split this book into two Hobbit movies.Anyone who is considering reading The Hobbit - you should. It's a classic and everyone should see for theirselves what they think of it. Personally, I am always disappointed when a Kindle version of a book is more expensive than a physical copy. This Kindle copy was $10.99 at the time of purchase. You can order paperback copies of the book for a few dollars less. However, there are many different editions of this book, each with slight differences and this Kindle version is the 50th anniversary - supposedly the most up to date. I can't say for sure, but for a novel as amazing as this, I feel as if I definitely got my money's worth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I realize that are a thousand reviews for this book already, but since The Hobbit is one of my all-time favorite novels, I simply have to throw in my two cents worth. This is a great prelude to The Lord of the Rings, for many reasons. First of all, it's compact and fast paced, somewhat unlike LOTR, but it gives a fine glimpse of the magic of Tolkien's world. To me, this is really the first book of LOTR and an essential part of the series. If you've read LOTR but not The Hobbit, then you simply have not read the complete LOTR. Simple as that.This is a delightful book of high fantasy, aimed at young adults but still plenty satisfying to grownups. The characters are solid and interesting, and the setting is pure magic. The book draws you in from the opening lines and keeps you immersed in Tolkien's fantasy world until the very satisfying conclusion. Yes, it's a book featuring dwarves, elves, a staff carrying wizard, some common fantasy monsters, and so on and so forth. But Tolkien was the one who spawned the \\"usual\\" fantasy elements, and so for its time the book was quite original. And regardess, the book is just flat-out entertaining and maintains a unique feel. Even if you've read many modern fantasy books, The Hobbit will stand out from the crowd.Setting: 10 of 10. A magical experience throughout. Characters: 9 of 10. The characters work well for the book, though a few of the dwarves are underdeveloped. Plot: 9 of 10. Simple, yet effective. Just good fantasy fun. Pacing: 10 of 10. If you like fast pacing, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Good quality recording. Only difficulty is that the file names are not correlated to a chapter. Files are based on size, and end at any point within a chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a little concerned about getting this book, since there are a couple of reviews that nitpick about the binding, the black & white illustration, etc, and argue that this edition is inferior. (I have worked in a printing studio, and can be pretty picky about my editions.) But I am happy I went ahead and ordered it, because going back and rereading the Hobbit in this edition has been a great experience. The dust jacket is printed on nice matte paper, and it feels like a new version of one of the old editions. The black and white illustrations are crisp, and are incorporated into the text at the right spots, and the color plates are bright and very clearly printed.I have not looked at the annotated version, and I am sure it is a great book if you are reading the Hobbit with a mind toward understanding the minutia of Tolkien's work. But if you want to read The Hobbit the way it was intended to be read, you can't go wrong with this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story of , \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, grown greatly as time passed. A pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s morphed into the basis of the blockbuster films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, The Hobbit, myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many others already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of The Hobbit ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford. This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something. The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke. This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :)All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

Nothing increases our appreciation of history more than having a history of our own. So if you plan on returning to The Hobbit at various stages of your life, this is the edition to own. It will endure for generations to come with its handsome gold-stamped, deep green leatherette binding and sturdy slip case that allows the volume to vertically free-stand when outside a bookcase.The crisp, clear print allows your eyes to flow effortlessly over the text with occasional pauses to delight in Tolkien's original illustrations rendered with elegant simplicity.

The Hobbits have perfectly boring and perfectly happy existances in their cozy homes. That was what Bilbo Baggins had, at least, until the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. Now Bilbo (without, of course, having ever been asked for his consent) is going on an adventure to retrieve the dwarves' gold from the dragon Smaug.J.R.R Tolkein's writing is literally beautiful. Every little song and ditty he includes in his books is well-thought-out and fantastic. The plot moves along at a good pace and it is the right combination of peril, adventure and magic, and, in the Hobbit, there's a bit of the whimsical factor too.I advice every fantasy lover to read the Lord of the Rings series if you haven't already, and I especially suggest to read the Hobbit. It's a great show of Tolkien's talents and deserves just as much fame as its successors."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" does it's writer proud. Anyone looking for a well-made edition should have no hesitation in buying this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in high school and the Lord of the Rings movies began to hit theaters, I had no idea what Middle Earth was or what was so important about a ring that Peter Jackson thought deserved three movies. I did have a few friends that had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and said that I needed to read them before the movies came out. I'm not sure if it was my age or the fact that the books had been sitting in my parent's basement for years and were yellowed, but I had trouble getting into them.As soon as rumors started going around that Peter Jackson was going to be doing The Hobbit as a movie, I decided that I wanted to try and read it before it hit theaters. A couple weeks back, I downloaded it on the Kindle and started this unexpected journey, only remembering bits and pieces of it from the cartoon that I watched as a kid.Needless to say, I loved this book and recommend that you read it as well. The style that Tolkien chooses to write his books in is amazing, because you can almost imagine sitting in a room with him, while he smokes his pipe and rocks in chair, telling you this epic tale of bravery, dragons, dwarves, goblins, wizards, and rings.It was also very cool to see how Bilbo actually got the ring and how it was used to complete his journey. Once again, I would recommend reading this book and it might lead you to some other Tolkien books, like it has for myself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I grew up with this book.

We have read parts of it together - me reading aloud and him reading along on his Kindle, because of the sometime wordiness of Tolkien. I think the experience has built our son's confidence in his reading skills and has raised the enjoyment he gains from reading, and he's looking forward to his next Kindle book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story.

R. Tolkien that follows the journey of hobbit Bilbo Baggins from his carefree and cheery residence at the Shire to more mysterious and often sinister lands beyond, in the hopes of sharing a treasure guarded by the fearsome Smaug, an ancient and legendary dragon that draws chills from almost everyone who hears his name.It is believed that Tolkien's own personal involvement in World War I had significantly influenced the formation of his novel, and his incorporation of adventure, wits, romance, personal growth, and self-discovery blends itself to deliver a captivating journey that explains the wide critical acclaim it received when first published in 1937. In addition to winning a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction, the novel was nominated for the Carnegie Medal."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book.

A hobbit is creature who likes peace, and quiet. Their most favorite hobby is of course eating. But one Hobbit changed how the world would see them forever.Bilbo Baggins was an ordinary Baggins as some Hobbits say. He lived in one of the biggest houses in the Shire. One day sitting on his porch smoking pipe weed. Gandalf the Grey shows up on his doorstep. Bilbo didn't know how much Gandalf would change his life. In the very beginning of the adventure Gandalf introduces the dwarves to Bilbo. At first the hobbit was shy and didn't like them, but towards the middle he thinks of them as best friends.The dwarves are very cool in this book. They all have different personalities but they all love two things, riches and most important FOOD. They are all funny and are really cool to learn about but the most serious is Thorin. Thorin was the leader of the dwarves and is the heir to the throne of his people. The reason he went on this adventure is because he wants to avenge his people by killing Smaug.Smaug is a dragon that terrorizes a country side to kill, and steal riches. The reason Thorin wants to kill Smaug is because he destroyed he home. Smaug lives in mountain and comes in and out as he pleases.One of my favorite books got to be The Hobbit because of one thing, it was unexpected."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's been decades since I read The Hobbit last and, with the movie coming out soon, I thought it would be a great idea to pick it up and read it again. Additionally my five year old son had been begging me to read it with him and wanted to know all about Smaug.Do I seriously need to do a recap here? I will just for the sake of completeness. Bilbo is visited by Gandalf and a number of dwarfs who want him to be their burglar on a journey to steal the dwarves' gold back from Smaug. Bilbo very reluctantly agrees to go on a journey that has him confronting trolls, elves, goblins, and eventually the dragon itself.Is there anyone out there who hasn't read this? If not please go read it. This is where fantasy got its roots from and is a must read for any fantasy fan. This book has it all; humor, adventure, friendship, magic, danger. You name it. This is how I first met elves and goblins and other fantastical creatures.I was amazed rereading this at how much humor is in this story and just at how well the story is put together. The imagery is excellent and the story completely engaging. My five year old begged to read this book every night until we were through; the picture books were never picked up until we had finished this book. My son was desperate to meet Smaug and find out what happened to him. When we finished he wanted to start reading it again.I am also amazed at how well this story withstands the test of time. Yeah, it gets a bit wordy at parts and yes, there are some turns of phrase that are pretty outdated. But that is part of its charm. It was so much fun to see my five year old enraptured by the same story my dad read to me when I was young. Seriously this book shaped my taste in reading forever.This edition of the book is lovely, I got it as a gift from my parents, and there are many lovely and exquisitely detailed drawings throughout. They are every few pages and were really something to look forward to as we read the story.Overall still an absolutely wonderful read. This is a book that stands the test of time and is enchanting for all ages. This is where fantasy starts and it was wonderful to see my son enjoy it as much as I did when my dad read it to me. Hopefully one day my son will read it to his kids too! Highly recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wonderful book.

Tolkien's Hobbit is the greatest book of all time. His originality and ingenuity created a timeless classic that quickly became my favorite book. Not only has it been my favorite book but fantasy writers since have used this book as a reference point for their own. I suggest this book to everyone who is breathing. Read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What else can be said about the greatness of this book? I first discovered it 20 years ago by mistake, and it has never left me. It sparked my love of reading and led to my choice of college degree. (In fact, I might never have gone to college if it weren't for my research of Tolkien and his time at Oxford as both student and professor. To be close to saints, one must walk in their footsteps!) But all of this is purely consequence. What about the story? Why does it affect people so strongly? To be honest, some don't get it. But most others do for the reason that The Hobbit answers a very deeply held longing in most of us to be part of a simpler time and to be part of a Quest, which is both a physical and spiritual journey, a testing of the soul, and a chance for heroism and the overthrow of Evil. The ethics of The Hobbit are those we would have operate in our own world. Through the main character, Bilbo Baggins, we are allowed to experience this romantic world where the underdog overcomes great difficulty to smite down the bad, raise up the good, and make life better place for all. Tolkien's use of language is also superb, relying heavily on Anglo-Saxon derived words which provides and emotional link between the book and reader. This is the language we first heard in the cradle and we still respond to it. The setting is also hidden deep in our sub-conscious, reflecting a simler time in our own world before electricity, gasoline, smog, television, skyscapers, overpopulation, crime, etc. -- all the suffocating and demoralizing debris of modern living. This reverence for the past played a large role in Tolkien's life. Out of that longing came his choice of schooling and profession and this book. We cannot escape it ourselves. Middle-earth is our world made perfect. There is no one who loves The Hobbit who wouldn't trade places with Bilbo Baggins or even, for just one day, take a long walk through the sunlit fields of the Shire. What a beautiful place to live. Through this book, we can."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"READ THIS BOOK. It is one of the best books ive ever read. Its a mix of Fantasy and Adventure.

I still cannot read one book without reading all of them, from start to finish. The beautiful, in-depth descriptions are so clear-cut it is almost like seeing a movie unfold in your mind. Tolkien obviously loved his Middle-earth and wrote of it with a piercing sweetness, a sweetness much like that of the High-elves of Lothlorien. Shelley describes it best: &quot;Our sweetest songs often tell of saddest thought.&quot; Perhaps this book is not for everyone, but for those who want to read a classic, filled with chivalry, wizards, romance, and sheer fun, I hope you will give The Hobbit and The Lord of the Ring a try."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one the classics, it was aimed at children but not to many today would have the patience or understanding to persist with it.

But things change when Gandalf the Wizard drops by--along with thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield. Suddenly, Bilbo finds himself on a pony heading away from the Shire and into the great unknown, to defeat a dragon and score treasure.I Liked:WOW! This was such a beautiful, enjoyable book!The Hobbit has never been my favorite Tolkien novel, mostly because it seems so childish (of course, it was written for kids). But the audiobook (and listening to Eldest prior to this) gave me a new appreciation for this joy.Firstly, there are the characters, primarily Bilbo. Bilbo really strikes me as a relatable guy. He's comfortable, content to live at home, and uninterested in adventures. He has to be pushed out of his home by Gandalf in order to get in on the fun. It reminds me so much of how I can be: content to go along, not trying new things until my sister forces me on a new path.My favorite character, though, is Gandalf. I like how quirky he is, how smart and even caring he is to Bilbo. Gandalf knew that Bilbo was perfect for the job and wouldn't let Bilbo back out no matter what. Plus, it's awesome to see recurring characters from the Lord of the Rings.The story itself is so wonderful! Tolkien writes in a third person omniscient, which allows him to employ a great sense of humor. I love how he often directs comments to the audience (explaining hobbits, trolls, and the like) and how light-hearted the tone is. As for the story proper: a pleasure! There is so much adventure, excitement, intrigue...I've read this before, but I still learned new things or was wowed all over again. I loved the tale of how Bilbo and the dwarves evaded the trolls (so simple, yet showcases how brilliant Gandalf was), how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, and the trek through the Forest (so scary!).And I love how this story fits into Tolkien's vision for Middle Earth. Elrond, Wood Elves, Mirkwood (Thranduil!), Gollum, the White Council...all these and more make appearances.And lastly, the narrator...ah, he was such a pleasure to listen to! I loved his voice, and I adored how he sung the songs and poems in the book! Not many could pull it off so convincingly!I Didn't Like:I don't have a lot of complaints, but there are a few. Firstly, there are thirteen dwarves, and most of them have little to no character. Fili and Kili were young, Bombur fat, Balin I believe had the best eyesight. Only Thorin had any development.One thing I've never liked about the Lord of the Rings or much of Tolkien's works was all the poetry. The Hobbit was no different; a few poems were great, but after a while, I grew tired of the lapsing into a poem.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.None.While not graphic, there are some intense battles between goblins and the troop in the Misty Mountains and in the final battle.Overall:I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never been a Hobbit fan, but this time around, I might be converted. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's a piece of your childhood in novel form. Highly recommended for those who want to be kids again.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story for all ages.

This is a great book for young and old and I encourage you to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hobbit is one of the most invaluable and indispensable classics given to the world of literature by Tolkien.Content: Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, comfortably residing in his comfortably furnished &quot;hole in the ground&quot;. His relaxed life-style, however, is interrupted by the magician Gandalf who enlists Bilbo as a thief. Reluctantly Bilbo sets out on a pilgrimage with 12 elves to recover a stolen treasure from a dragon. While trying to accomplish their mission, the unlucky crew encounters countless adventures imbued with life-threatening dangers. Exceeding the elves' expectations, Bilbo becomes of great use in these predicaments. The final bloody battle is the climax of the book.The alluring story line is something that will be parted with reluctance. However lighthearted the novel is, there is some profound symbolism and allusions to real facts. e.g. The final battle in the book is a blatant reference to the events of World War One, through which Tolkien has lived. He was obviously against it, as he demonstrates that myriads of decent, innocent people were obliterated. Also, basically the whole book reverberates the theme of maturing, demonstrated in Bilbo as he transforms from a timid creature to a more heroic persona.Overall:This is a beautifully written book. The writing style used by Tolkien is commendable. The word choice is charming and amiable. The overall style is simple and lucid, but very enthralling and captivating. Definitely something that can be read for leisure. The same can be said of the story-line. It is very solid and well-knit together, there probably isnt a single loophole to taint its value. Filled with wonderful tales of magic and adventure it is second to none in the fantasy class. One of those childhood books that will be fondly remembered later in life. It is only a shame that the sequels to this wonderful fantasy novel have plummeted in the content aspect and the delightful simplicity of Hobbit.In addition to Hobbit, I would recommend The Chronicles of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After waiting for seven months and not finding &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the library, though they had a copy, I read the Harry Potter series seventy-two times. When I had finally memorized every sentence of every book including book four, I got sick and went out and bought &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy set. After reading the splendid and spectacular &quot;Hobbit,&quot; Harry Potter was forgotten for a while. The book is the one of the most breath taking books I have ever read in my entire life. It is about a creature called a hobbit. The hobbits are a little people, smaller than dwarves, and were a peaceful and lovable people. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; concerns a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins who embarks on many adventures when a band of homeless dwarves turn up at his hobbit-hole with the famous wizard Gandalf. The dwarves are in search of the east where the dragon Smaug took their gold and ruined their city. They go on so many adventures, it is hard to count. This is one of the most amzing books ver written. And if you liked the Hobbit, you will most certainly love The Golden Compass. J.R.R.

Generally speaking the edition is spot on but some pagination issues arise when you come across artwork.

Tolkien fans by adapting the epic novel to a graphic version, illustrated by David Wenzel. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" many times and I worried that the adaptation would leave out too much of the original. The adaptation does leave out some things. However, I was impressed that Dixon and Deming captured the essence of \\"The Hobbit.\\"\\"The Hobbit\\" is the tale of one Bilbo Baggins of Hobbiton. Gandalf the wizard enlists Bilbo to go on a journey to Lonely Mountain. Gandalf the wizard lists Bilbo's profession as burglar, which seems humorous until a reader realizes the full scope of Bilbo's role.The journey to Lonely Mountain is fraught with adventure and danger, and some members of the party encounter great peril. Indeed, not everyone in the party who began the adventure was able to see the end of the adventure.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a subtle story in some ways in that Tolkien wrote the novel without explaining much about the world of \\"The Hobbit.\\" We learn much about Bilbo's world through interaction with the world, which is more typical of contemporary novels than fantasy novels, and is part of the reason \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are such great stories. However, Tolkien spent incredible effort in creating the history and mythology of both novels and drew on his created history and mythology to provide great depth to both novels (note that I am treating \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as a single novel rather than a trilogy). The graphic novel does a nice job of adapting Tolkien's approach to \\"The Hobbit.\\"We have an animated version of \\"The Hobbit\\" and a live action version of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for comparison to this novel. In general, Wenzel's illustrations are reasonably good. My only complaint is that some of the perspective views of the Bilbo made him appear too thin. I also note that Bilbo appears just a little cartoonish as compared to the other characters, which compare very favorably to director Peter Jackson's film characters. Perhaps species is a better term, since only a few characters from \\"The Hobbit\\" appear in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"While I am happy to have this graphic novel, I have already read \\"The Hobbit\\" several times and plan to read it again in the coming year. This graphic novel is not a substitute for Tolkien's prose. I recommend reading that book before purchasing this graphic novel because there is much more detail and much to enjoy in the Tolkien original. Though this graphic novel stands on its own, it is much like reading an abridged version of the original.In the realm of versions of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the original remains the best. However, I think this graphic novel is superior to the 1977 Rankin-Bass animated version. Regardless of which format you have, they are all worth enjoying if you are a fan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is just good clean fun, delightful for children and adults. If you've read LOTR and wondered how Bilbo got the ring, here's the story. I enjoyed Tolkien's omnicient narrator style in this book --somewhat like Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and more recently Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell-- which I suppose he adopted because he was writing for children. I think it's charming.I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Rob Inglis. He's a Royal Shakespeare company actor and the best audiobook reader I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot of them). He has a different voice for each dwarf, and he does a great Gollum, too. He actually sings the songs (nice voice!) and he even belches up ponies. The scene with the trolls is especially well-done. Mr. Ingliss could probably make one of Terry Goodkind's later books sound exciting, but The Hobbit actually is exciting and I highly recommend it for adults and kids.--FanLit.net"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this for the first time as an adult and will forever lament that I did not grow up with this story. I had seen the animated movie but thought I should start reading Tolkien at the beginning, so I picked up my dad's copy of The Silmarillion. Not a great choice for me at ~10 years old, as I was used to reading Judy Blume and Beverly Cleary at that time.I didn't try Tolkien again until I was an adult and looked over my husband's illustrated copy of The Hobbit, gifted by his school-teacher aunt and uncle when he was a child.I have devoured JRRT's works since then. That's how good The Hobbit is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's difficult to decide where J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit ranks among the all-time greatest works of fantasy literature. In a manner of speaking, guilt by association is to blame (or thank). A major factor in the success of The Hobbit is its connection with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The tale of the burglar Bilbo and his Dwarven compatriots' journey to find and slay the dragon Smaug acts as a prelude to Rings, and as such has developed a very unique stigma - it can almost be labeled the black sheep of Tolkien's fantasy universe, relying on The Lord of the Rings for its fame. The original edition of The Hobbit, released in 1937, was even altered to better match the storylines developed in the more recognized Rings series. However, despite these changes (which may or may not have been necessary), The Hobbit is a top-notch fantasy epic through and through. From Gandalf's battle with the mighty cave trolls for Elvish treasure, to Bilbo's battle of wits with the creature Golum, all the way to the Battle of Five Armies, the story is consistently energetic and the characters remain warm and welcoming throughout. What makes The Hobbit truly unique to this day is Tolkien's ability to use the setting of Middle Earth as a tool to weave a story that is unique in its intentions, but parallel to the fantasy epics it sets up.Many aspects of The Hobbit evolved out of the beliefs and knowledge of its author. J.R.R. Tolkien was an extremely educated man. He was the professor of Anglo-Saxon language and English language and literature at Oxford University for thirty-four years. All of his works of literature reflect his love of language - modern and historical, real and invented (including the beloved Elvish tongue). Tolkien's works were influenced by English and Celtic lore, and Norse and Finnish mythology, but above all he was influenced by a devout belief in Roman Catholicism, as evident by the Christian theology sprinkled throughout his works. This is evident at the close of The Hobbit when Bilbo renounces the treasure offered him at the end of his quest because he has no practical use for too much gold. In other words, he already had everything he needs at The Shire in his warm hobbit hole.One of the many timeless aspects of The Hobbit is its approachability. People of all ages have read and fallen in love with Tolkien's prelude. This speaks volumes as to the narrative voice with which Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit, a wizard, and thirteen grumbling dwarves. The language used to convey the story is very simple and yet paints a perfect picture in the reader's mind. For example, the riddles Bilbo uses to trick Golem out of his \`precious' ring are complex enough to dupe the readers (along with Golem), and yet simple enough to warrant thoughts of \\"oh man, I should have known that!\\" In a genre as imagination-driven as fantasy, being able to clearly visualize a world as vivid and complex as Middle Earth is essential to both the plot and the characters, and it is one of the strongest aspects of The Hobbit.Tolkien's method of storytelling is very similar to the way he employs simple language. Like an inverted funnel, everything starts off simple enough in Bilbo's hobbit hole in The Shire, but it doesn't take long for the characters to find their way into situations that compound upon one another as the story moves along. Without the reader even noticing it, Tolkien takes Bilbo and the dwarves from smoking tobacco in the large region of Eriador to the horrific events at the Battle of Five Armies - that is, from a nothing to an epic. This pacing is best represented towards the book's conclusion when all manners of Goblins and Wargs are closing in on the dwarves, humans, and elves that have taken refuge in the halls of the Misty Mountain. Just as all the energy of the war seems primed to take the book beyond its typical \`micro-epic' feel, Bilbo is knocked unconscious, and wakes only after the battle has been concluded. This type of transition is so smooth that, like the book itself, the scope of the War might not be comprehensible to readers until they have completely finished reading the aftermath.It's a very hard task to find fault in one of the greatest works of fantasy fiction ever written. In fact, the only way to find shortcomings of any kind is by comparing it to the few books in the genre that may have had better reception from the public - including The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter just to name a couple. In this way, once again, it's guilt by association for Tolkien's The Hobbit. The three volume Rings series is the quintessential fantasy epic - well-written characters from all different backgrounds and races traverse alien lands and face unimaginable foes so that they can save the world and their way of life. While some of those elements are present in The Hobbit, they certainly aren't to the same extent that they are explored in Rings. For example, the reader doesn't find out that any piece of land in Middle Earth is in peril until all but the end of Hobbit, whereas Rings is totally devoted to saving the world by destroying the One Ring. Up until the war in The Hobbit, Bilbo, Thorin and his dwarves want nothing more than to find and reclaim a long lost material wealth.In the end, a reader should never have to choose between any of Tolkien's works - they are all special, all brilliant, and, especially in the case of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, they all complement each other. And while The Hobbit may not have the truly epic feel of Rings, it does achieve a level personal interaction with the reader that the sprawling, conquering epic cannot match."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the Hobbit in elementary school, but it was not the full version.

The plot was facinating, though somewhat conincedental, like when Bilbo slips out of the cave and just happens to find the dwarves and Gandalf. However, there are many interesting word choices. For instance, hobbit originated from the word holbytla, an Old English construct, means hole-builder. So the first sentence can be trnslated to &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hole-builder.&quot; It's a bit of a joke.Most of the names in this book go around in circles like that. To find out more about that, I recommend the Hobbit Companion, by David Day. Anyway, this is a wonderful story with great description, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of the best, unable to put down, books you will ever read! Especially for those who have a leaning toward mythology and fantasy. The characters and adventures that Bilbo meets and gets involved with are truly portrayed by Tolkein in such a way as to become increasingly realistic and personal to you. And Gandalf, the wizard, always arrives just when Bilbo needs him. Golum, am unforgettable character, who 'hisses' the title of &quot;my precious', is the keeper of one of the three rings that turns out to be the key factor in 'The Lord of the Rings' (a must read)! This ring, when worn on the finger, makes you invisible and was very helpful to Bilbo when meeting up with the dragon as well as in other crisis times of his adventure.The Trilogy is an awesome and stimulating fantasy that pulls you into its magical world and makes you feel as if you are there!A classic, unforgetable reading experience!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read the Hobbit, and I must say that I have truly enjoyed it very much.

If you ever read in your life, if only one book ever, read the Hobbit, because it will change your life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who wanted to live alone and not be disturbed. Later, a wizard named Gandalf comes along with a group of dwarves. The dwarves and Gandalf were going to go on a quest, which would be very tough. Bilbo became interested in this very fun adventure and decided to join along. While Bilbo was going on the quest, he and the dwarves and Gandalf encountered huge spiders, evil orcs and killer wolves. It got worse and worse by the minute. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves came to the the Lonely Mountains, and behind those mountains was the evil dragon Smaug. Many of the elves and dwarves feared him because he was of great evil and wanted to conquer the lands of all the creatures that lived in the forests and villages. He had to be stopped. The malovent dragon was very powerful and couldnt be stopped, but he had to. Bilbo didnt know what to do because he felt scared and frightened in many ways, but he did want to do the right thing. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves encountered a group of elves and these elves had a Elvenking, who was their mighty ruler. Bilbo talked with him about the malovent dragon Smaug and needed to be vanquished. The Elvenking agreed with him and decided to take a stand. So Bilbo went to confront the dragon. What will happen, and will Bilbo defeat the evil dragon Smaug?I thought this book was terrific! I thought it was really interesting, and I couldnt put the book down. I just kept reading and reading. The plot of the book was really neat. I think a story about good against evil is a good theme. I thought Bilbo was a good person in the story, obviously because he wanted to stop the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo was brave by showing courage and I really like that. This story is a classic, and you cant put it down. I would get this book. It is worth reading and you cant resist it. I recommend this book for ages 8-30. It is a very descriptive book with great amount of detail. Adventure, fantasy, and imaginination are all in the book. Read The Hobbit , the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, both written by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First of all, let's dispose of a couple of widely-held beliefs about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, this book was written as its own story, stands very well on its own, and is far from being merely a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Second, although children certainly can read \\"The Hobbit\\" and enjoy it, this book can be read on more levels - and possibly with even greater pleasure -- by adults. So, to call \\"The Hobbit\\" a \\"children's book\\" is neither particularly accurate nor helpful. The fact that there's been a great deal of serious literary criticism written on \\"The Hobbit\\" should tell you something right there! Personally, I have read this book nearly a dozen times, starting when I was in college and just about annually for more than 15 years afterwards, and I still feel that I have not fully exhausted this book nor outgrown it. In fact, I very well may read it another dozen times in my life. Who knows?Now, what about the book? On one level, this is a fairly straightforward -- and excellent -- adventure story, with plenty of action, colorful characters (good, bad, and in-between), suspense, treachery, fighting, treasure, etc. On another level, this is also a kind of Freud meets Harry Potter \\"coming of age\\" story, beginning metaphorically in the womb (Bilbo Baggin's tunnel-like, comfortable, safe \\"hole in the ground\\") and ending up with Bilbo progressing via a series of challenges through childhood (burglar), into young adulthood (adventurer, with his new-found sword named \\"Sting\\" - hmmm, Freud thinks...sometimes a sword is just a sword?!?), and finally into full maturity (leader/hero). Contrast the beginning of the book, where Bilbo runs practically naked (\\"to the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a walking-stick, or any money\\" or even his \\"pocket-handkerchiefs\\") out of his womb..er, hobbit hole, and the end of the book, where he returns much changed (\\"not the hobbit that you were,\\" according to Gandalf the wizard) and totally grown up (actually, presumed DEAD, with his possessions in the process of being auctioned off). So, in sum, this is an adventure story/coming of age book, which takes us from the main character's birth to his (symbolic) death, with lots of interesting life in between.But, if that was all there were to \\"The Hobbit,\\" it would not be the classic that it is, but merely an entertaining, well-written book, mainly for children. Instead, \\"The Hobbit\\" rises to a totally different - and much higher -- level on the basis of several factors: 1) the author, JRR Tokien, Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and an expert in linguistics and early English literature, Beowulf for instance, creates a work of tremendous scholarship, great thought and care -- well camouflaged as a \\"children's story\\" -- and, as CS Lewis wrote in 1937, \\"a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology;\\" 2) this is a great work of imagination, which essentially imagines a world - Middle Earth - in many ways similar to our own world, and in other ways quite different; and 3) there is a lot of really interesting stuff bubbling beneath the surface here, some of which Tolkien hints at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" and much of which is developed further in his two other great works, \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" For instance, although great evils (and in fact the origin of evil - and much else) are hinted at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" they are left mainly for further development in other places. However, this does not lessen \\"The Hobbit,\\" per se, just gives it a sort of subconscious depth which is not often found in \\"children's books.\\"Just to provide one further illustration of how this is not merely a \\"simple children's book,\\" let's think about this for a minute in quasi-Marxist socioeconomic terms. Basically, what you have here is a comfortable bourgeois community of Hobbits - fat, lazy, happy, contented, ignorant, and kind of stupid. Then you have a bunch of mercantalist/proto-capitalist Dwarves enter the picture, who draw one of the bored-out-of- his-mind Hobbits (Bilbo) out of his comfortable hole and in search of their plundered (and now unproductive) capital, being closely guarded by the ultimate robber-baron, the Dragon. Other interesting creatures from this perspective are the \\"cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted,\\" machine-making, worker-exploiting Capitalists, er, Goblins (\\"they make many clever [things]...or get...prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light [to make]\\"). And guess what this all leads to, as Marx predicted? War, of course, which in this case is ultimately won (barely) by an unlikely alliance of the Dwarf and Elf proto-capitalists (led by various monarchs), the mercantilists/petty bourgoisie of Lake-town, and mysterious Other Forces (Beorn, the Eagles, Gandalf the Wizard). And, of course, lots of workers/proletariat types die in this war (which does, in the end, result in a long period of peace in Middle Earth). Given all this, is it any wonder that \\"The Hobbit\\" really became popular in the 1960s Vietnam War era?Anyway, this is just a partly serious, partly tongue-in-cheek example of why I think \\"The Hobbit\\" is a great book (like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), worthy of numerous readings, by both children and adults alike. The thing about great literature is that different people can get different things out of it. So, read this book, then read it again (and again), and, to paraphrase Tolkien, \\"see whether [you have] gained anything in the end.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

That Tolkien could write a children's story with such depth and resonance that anyone from 3 to 300 can read and enjoy is beyond nearly any other writer's ability, at least in this genre. The Hobbit stands alone as a beautifully written tale, but that it left so many tiny cracks that Tolkien could create an epic sequel and a complete land (With amazing history!) is beyond me.

I would highly suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent book. Everyone should read it. Even I, a 12 year old has read the book. You just can't put it down. There's is one adventure after the other. J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is a true master piece that will not be forgotten. But the adventures don't just end in this book. This is only the beginning. Next is the Lord of the Rings. Named BOOK OF THE CENTURY. READ ALL OF THEM, including all the Middle Earth Series"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read The Hobbit, I was in 4th grade. I remember being captivated by the excellent imagery and wonderful storytelling. It was so great that I had nightmares about the giant spiders of Murkwood for weeks!So I was delighted to come across the BBC version of this. It is so much more than a guy with a British accent reading Tolkien's words - it is more like a stageplay for your ears! I meant to ration myself to one side of a tape per day, but after listening to the first I gave in and listened to the rest nonstop."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The interesting thing about The Hobbit is how close it came to never seeing the light of day. J.R.R. Tolkien's classic children's fantasy book only exists because he was bored while grading his students' papers and accidentally created the mythical creatures known as Hobbits.But I think The Hobbit in particular came into being because Tolkien loved the old fairy tales and myths and couldn't find any contemporary books like the old ones he enjoyed reading. The Hobbit is such a fun book to read that it's almost sinful to admit it. Treasure-hoarding dragons, greedy song-singing dwarves, a jestful old wizard, and the trickssy Gollum all add up to creating a wonderful classic.The Hobbit is a throw back to a much older tradition of fantasy stories than what we're used to nowadays. I recommend this book in particular to everyone familiar with The Lord of the Rings, since it will help to fill in the gaps on what happened before the events in that story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review does not contain spoilers.If you love the Hobbit, which most do for its enchanting story, and you have the extra few dollars to spend, buy this edition.

It is better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For years, I have somehow avoided reading The Hobbit even though I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and seen all the movies, and loved everything about them. For some reason, I just wasn't that interested in the story of how Bilbo retrieved the ring.As it happens, I was \\"forced\\" to read The Hobbit for my college English course at Ohio State this quarter. So not only did I finallly get to read this book, I also got to discuss it in great detail with a bunch of other people. Discussing a book with other people is a great way to have a greater appreciation for the author and the book itself. With The Hobbit, much was discussed about Tolkien's creation of races, and how they fit with a certain social structure of Middle-Earth. Very interesting stuff.I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Hobbit is an amazing piece of literature. But everyone knows that. I think that the LOTR trilogy are better books. Personally, I prefer the darker take in the trilogy than the more lighthearted, jovial tale that is The Hobbit. Bilbo is a great protagonist, as the reader, you grow to love him, and truly want him to escape danger, as you do for all the other characters that went on the journey with Bilbo, to retrieve the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug.Tolkien is a great writer, and the way he plays with being the narrator of the tale is amazing, and makes the story that much more fun to read. Plus, The Hobbit is a book that could easily be read and understood by fairly young kids. And it's a great way to start someone who has never read fantasy novels before.Thank you, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a review about this edition not about the writing, as doubtless if you are considering this particularl edition you have either read the Hobbit or pretty much know the story.This is a beautiful book. It seems like it is the Prof's very own edition because his own drawings are inside. There are at least 5 beautiful full-color watercolors and many more green block type prints.The cover is a delight. I just received a used copy that has a copyright of 1966 but I think it must be a 1973 copy. In any event the cover is vibrant and goregous as if it was printed yesterday. The type is big and clear. Highly recommended as a beauitful keepsake that is the perfect size for repeated readings. It is also sturdy. Great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit written by JRR Tolkien is an adventure fantasy novel in which contains a profusion of courage, adventure and Imagination. These three qualities unite, and create one of the finest adventure novels of all time. Tolkien keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat begging to turn the page by delivering climax after climax in this famous fantasy novel.Tolkien initially grabs the reader with his in depth descriptive writing. His words describe the adventures of Bilbo Baggins so vividly that the reader becomes overwhelmed and begins to believe that he/she is indeed the protagonist. Although Tolkien intended The Hobbit to be a children's novel, the writing is still relevant for all ages. The Hobbit can take any average overscheduled adult away from his/her everyday stresses and return them back to their untainted childhood imaginations. This getaway is created on behalf of Tolkien's fantastically vivid descriptions of landscapes, feelings and characters. Even though the story is completely unbelievable, Tolkien describes everything in such incredible detail that the reader starts to believe that Hobbiton is a real place and being Bilbo Baggins is not fictional anymore.The Hobbit is also a great read because of the never-ending climaxes throughout the book. Tolkien grabs the reader and keeps them captive for an entire novel. It becomes hard to put down the book because you are dawning on another expedition right after you just finished one. One could argue that Tolkien attempted to create a tie between the reader and the protagonist. Tolkien creates this tie through the comparison of Bilbo's sleeping patterns and that of the readers' patterns. Whenever Bilbo has had a long stretch without sleep the reader has not put down the book, however when Bilbo goes to sleep it is in a recession in the story's peaks. For example after Bilbo had left home he had slept very little until he went to Beorns house. This patterning style gives the reader an opportunity to take a rest. This use of literacy makes The Hobbit a very entertaining read.In this novel we meet many different characters, enemy or friend. All of which seemed to be relevant except for the thirteen dwarves Bilbo travelled with. It would seem as though Tolkien added these characters just to aggravate the reader. During the novel these thirteen dwarves who were supposed to be running the show did nothing accept slow the process down by either passing out, getting lost or being captured; with the exception of Elrond, who is able to translate the moon-runes, and Bard, who is able to understand the language of the bird, Roac. Therefore leaving only two practical dwarves. Throughout the novel the reader continuously ask himself or herself \`why doesn't Bilbo just leave these idiots and do it himself?' This question remains unanswered at the end of the novel, in turn leaving the reader irritated. This is indeed a small blunder created by the author, however if he did indeed make these dwarves relevant it would have enhanced the story.All things considered, The Hobbit is a fantastic adventure novel for all ages. It constantly brings the reader out of the frying pan and into the fire. It is truly unbelievable how imaginative Tolkien was. His literary intelligence gives every reader of The Hobbit a reminiscent taste of what it was like as a child with a wild imagination. The novel truly tickles the minds imagination, leaving us believing that everyone should have a little Bilbo Baggins in them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is such a great book and is well liked because of its story, but I liked it mainly because of how well it is written. There were parts toward the end of the book that seemed to drag a little, but for the most part it was put together rather nice. I loved the fact that it was written as if from another culture and it spoke to the reader as if it was from a familiar culture or one right close to it. It talked to you as if you already knew certain things about something that you might never have heard of, and soon after it explains exactly what it was or hinted in such great detail that no two people could be far apart from what has been drawn in their heads. The Hobbit does such a great job in having the reader come up with his own conclusions of how something will turn out and the book will take some strange twist that proves you right and wrong at the same time. Such as, you know they will escape from something and so you play it out in your mind. When it happens, you had the right idea, but the way it was done wasn't even close to how you saw it happening. This book was written with extreme greatness and is built to always keep you on your toes and to keep you looking forward for what is coming next. This book makes my list of books to recommend, mainly because it was so beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien does a great job at grabbing you and pulling you into the Hobbit. If you like books like the Never Ending Story or Narnia books then you would probably like this one. It sent a good message across, and that you have to stay together even when you don't like your colleagues. It is about a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who goes on an adventure, which hobbits don't often do, with Gandalf (a wizard) and his company. He finds many curious things along the way, and learns some valuable lessons. Overall I liked this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to let their imagination wander."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is well documented that J.R.R. Tolkien despised allegory. Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"1 wizard and 14 dwarves, how much adventure can you get from it?The Answer is alot!

There are encounters with giant spiders, trolls, wolves and goblins as well as a journey up a river in wine barrels!

I was thrilled to see this book on tape, unabridged (which it really is). I don't think it's necessary to review the actual story; you've probably heard all that before. I am very pleased with Rob Inglis as the reader, though. His voice can be either powerful or gentle, or both as the story calls for. I was a bit surprised of his reading Gandalf as, honestly, a pretty cranky guy...but after a while I got to enjoy Gandalf even more because of it. Now, I'm not a musical person, I don't sing, and I don't really enjoy musical productions. However, I thought Rob Inglis did a spectacular job with the songs. When I read them, they were OK, I thought. But hearing them sung with such a wide range of feeling just made the story all the more powerful. The dwarven songs were particularly well done, deep and resonant just as you'd imagine they should be. On a more practical side, I really appreciated the announcememts (very brief) at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. Since I listen to these in the car, it helps to know exactly where you are and when you'll have to grab the next tape. I listen to a lot of books on tape, and I can say that this production is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I won't go into how great this book is in this review -- if you're looking at the collector's edition, chances are you're either already a Tolkien fan, or you're considering this as a gift for someone who is.

I bought this edition as a gift for my husband to replace the beat-up paperback copy he'd had for years.This particular edition of _The Hobbit_ is a very high quality, handsome book.

I asked what it was about, and when she said, &quot;hobbits,&quot; I remembered that I had always wanted to read the book from which that excerpt had been taken. So I obtained the Hobbit, and read it, and the books for which it is a prequel, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I was swept up in the epic nature of the tale, in the characterization, in the heroism. Whether one likes the tale or not, and I've found few who don't, there is nothing here to criticize: no gratuitous violence and no sex at all (amazing). An old fashioned Englishman's tale of a world where manners still count, where education, poetry, music, and values such as loyalty, honesty and courage are still the stuff of heroes. I have read the books dozens of times. It is so easy to pick up one just to read a passage, and be swept up in the story again. I read the whole Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to my son, out loud, twice. Now he is a teenager, and has read them on his own several times. This is great literature, and will be considered classic some day.

Come visit the Hobbit hole at Bag End, where you're always welcome...journey to the lake under the mountain...cross the enchanted river flowing through Mirkwood...and on to the Long Lake and the Dwarven Mountain overtaken by the evil worm Smaug. &quot;There and Back Again&quot; is quite the appropriate alternate title.Tolkien synthesized many mythical creatures and stories into his introduction to the Lord of the Rings. The story was meant for children, and is certainly not a difficult read, but anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventure, and heroism will not be disappointed by Tolkien's marvelous book.Without giving the plot away, the book does have more to it than simply the plot...consider, for example, the obstacles Bilbo and his party face. Water (it's been suggested before) is a recurring theme. Also taking into account where Tolkien is from and the time he wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the Lord of the Rings, some have examined whether the books contain historical allusions.Most, however, leave the academic arguments aside and simply read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as Tolkien, at least foremost, meant it to be: an escape to Middle Earth, an epic adventure with an unassuming, timid, and at the beginning, most unwilling Hobbit. Enjoy! econ"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever been at a particularly challenging point in your life? Ever woken up in the middle of the night and wondered, \\"How did I get into this mess?\\" I'm willing to bet that Bilbo Baggins wondered this many a night as he went through his adventure in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit. One day Bilbo's life was peaceful, orderly, and quiet, shut up in his little hobbit hole. The next he was worrying about trolls creeping up in the night, or spiders swallowing him whole as he led eleven dwarves and a wizard to retrieve stolen treasures from a legendary dragon. Tolkien makes readers feel as thought they are really there. Their hearts pound as the characters race from evil goblins. They can almost feel the bitter cold of the mountains, the cruelty of the dragon, the vulnerability of the dwarves, and the terror of the war between them. As a teenager, I don't read much fantasy. Normally, I enjoy books that are true to life and have things in them that really happen. But Tolkien makes the novel seem so real and honest that I find myself believing in every word he writes. There are always a few questions people ask when I try to tell them about this book. One question I hear a lot is, \\"Aren't I a little old for fantasy?\\" Never! Fantasy is written for anyone who has an imagination--who believes in dreaming and accomplishing his or her dreams. Fantasy is for them, and I believe anyone can dream. Another question is, \\"What is a hobbit?\\" A hobbit is a small creature with large hairy feet, an enormous appetite, and excellent eyes and ears. They love parties and hate adventure. So why did a wizard named Gandalf knock on his door one sleepy morning and push him into the greatest adventure of his life? What did the long, grueling journey have in store for Bilbo? How would he change? Find out when you read The HObbit, and enchanting, captivating book that I most definitely recommend.

Put simply, there has never been and probably never will be a fantasy author as good as J.R.R. Tolkien. I read this book for the first time when I was 6 and I have reread the series at least 20 times since. What makes this book (and the entire series) so compelling is the level to which Tolkien develops his characters and settings; it is very easy to completely lose yourself in his words.

During the dwarves adventure they come into contact with many obstacles such as goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step from the opening of the story onward is a great adventure. Within the woods fo the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy written novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings.

This book made me realize that I could write about anything because the books with the most fantasy make the best page turners, and that is why I give this book four stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I JUST READ THIS BOOK IN SCHOOL FOR MY ENGLISH CLASS AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO READING IT CUZ IVE HEARD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT WHILE I WAS READING I BECAME SO INTERESTED IN IT I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK AND SHOULD BE READ BY EVERYONE.JUST 1 WEEK AFTER READING IT IM ALREADY STARTING TO READING THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY AND IM REAL EXCITED ABOUT THAT. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wanted to read The Hobbit because it was a fantasy, middle-earth book. I have read many other middle-earth books and in comparison, I would say it was pretty good. It kept me interested throughout the book, with few slow spots. It had lots of action which was always fast moving. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes or thinks they might like fantasy, middle-earth books. I would also recommend this book to someone who wants easy reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review comes from someone that is not really into the sci-fi/fantasy genre. However, I heartly recommend the Hobbit. I got interested in this since I know the movies are fast approaching.The story is quite fascinating and the character develoment is very good. Pick this one up and give it a read. I am now on to th LOR trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my &quot;read again&quot; books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book three times, and it has always been one of my favorite book. It is too bad that the fantasy novels of today have to have a fight or battle every ten pages to keep readers interested. Most people forget that this book was written 50+ years ago, when readers didn't have the attention span of a flea..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a good fantasy/adventure, but what I did not enjoy about it was that it lacked character devlopment. The only character that was developed enough was Biblo Baggins. As for Gandalf and the thirteen dwarfs, since they weren't that devloped I found myself not really caring about them as much as I would like. However, despite the negative, there is still much more positive things to be said about this novel. It's a great fantasy/adventure, and it basically pioneered the way for other fantasy/adventure stories to come. It has plenty of action, and it is rarely boring. All in all, I reccomend this novel, and I am eagerly going to read The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am normally not a fan of fantasy novels (although I love RPGs) but I decided to pick up &quot;The Hobbit&quot; because I had heard so much praise about it. I'm not certain what I was expecting but this book proved to be a wonderous endevor into a brilliant land-scape of dragons and elves and goblins and, well, little people doing extrodinary things. This is a stunning work of fiction and a must-read for fans of ANY genre. There is no way you can ignor the majesty and spledor of JRR Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Of course The Hobbit isn't as good as The Lord of the Rings, but still I think it's one of the best books ever written! I strongly suggest you read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; 3 times, and at the moment, I'm reading it again. It is one of the most imaginative books I have ever read. Any person that has one little drop of fantasy in their minds, will love this book dearly, I know I do."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the most exciting and thrilling book I have ever read. This book is about a small Hobbit having adventures with his friends, a wizard called Gandalf and twelve other Dwarfs. They have adventures with large trolls that nearly eat them, they have adventures in rocky mountains, with ugly green Goblins, they pley riddles with Golloum a misterious beast. They travel through a forest with poisonous spiders and in a huge mountain with a fire breating dragon."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book. It is well written, quick and easy to read. So many things happen in it as far as getting in trouble with Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, Smaug, Gollum, ect. The book also tells of other tales that sound intersting. also, the poetry/ballads in the book were awesome."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not yet done reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but so far it is one of the best books I have ever read. To me it is one of the best books I have ever read. If you are looking for a fantasy adventure over the summer, join Bilbo Baggins and read it! This book you will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The greatest book I have ever read(and I have read a lot). Tolkien gets you caught up in a book to the point where it changes the way you feel. If life is good in the book then my day is a little brighter. The only thing i have ever read that compares to the Hobbit is The Lord of the Rings by the same author. I read this entire series in two months time when I was in the Fifth Grade. If you are looking for a good book, this is one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit,in my opinion is one of the greatest books of all time;not to mention the best fantasy.Tolkien's description of virtually everything is phenomenal.His characterization of Bilbo,Gandalf and Smaug are excellent. I started and couldn't put it down. After I finished it, I bought The Fellowship of the Ring, and went on to read the entire series.I have yet to read the Simarilion.All in all,I recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy or just wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this whole series! Love the action and the mystery of them all. I just saw the movie last night and they did a good job following the book. Worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read the Hobbit many times and each time I find something new to enjoy about it. This a classic fantasy told by a master of the genre. This is a story to be loved and remembered."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've always liked The Hobbit, just wanted to read it before the movie came out. Worked well on my kindle, no complaints."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's work takes the reader in an excellent journey through an unknown world, following the path of a delightful character, Bilbo Baggins. As a new reader of Tolkien, I find his style and imagination captivating."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i love this book. my dad read it to us as kids, and re-reading it just makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over. Tolkein is so great. i wish this was required reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this for a grandson as I already have it. It is a wonderful copy of this book. I love the pictures and now my grandson loves it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"u cant beat jrr tolkiens always been my favorite writer great for anyone to read, hobbit is all time classic for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Love all of Tolkien work.He has a way with words and can hold your attention for hours on end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As another reviewer commented, how so you review such a classic??! I was given this book as an I-love-you gift from my fianc&eacute;e. It had never occurred to me that I'd read all the books in the LoTR trilogy and had somehow skipped over The Hobbit; it's unfortunate that I missed out all these years from such a great read. But it's a great time to read it now, with the movie coming out.Since it's been so long since I read the trilogy, I can't really compare writing style/differences between the two. But Tolkien certainly has his way of writing which gives you just the details and describes the environment. He also does a wonderful job of portraying the characters and the personalities and the cultural differences between men/dwarfs/elves/wizards/hobbits. As one reads, they truly feel like they're right there along with Bilbo experiencing this adventure.After reading this book, I am an even bigger fan of JRR Tolkien's writing and I absolutely cannot wait to go see the movie!!**I received this book as a gift**"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can I say about The Hobbit? Here's my review in one word: Awesomeness.J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the greatest authors ever and if we're being honest, I'll stop being your friend if you say anything bad about his stories or him.It's been so long since I've read the Hobbit that it was like reading it for the first time. I forgot so much of it and I love Tolkien's way of telling a story. I laughed at many lines, grew to love each character and was reminded again that Tolkien was a genius. If you've never read the books, put them next on your list!He created a language, incredible story lines, creativity beyond most people and even today's famous books are influenced by his story (I love me some Harry Potter, but you can't help but notice the similarities with Lord of the Rings). I am so excited to see the movie coming out this weekend! Not sure how three movies will pan out, but I figure that's just more Tolkien radness on the big screen.After every read or re-read of Tolkien, I'm left with one single question: Is it too much to ask for Middle Earth to be real and for me to be an elf or rider of Rohan?I didn't think so either."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was such a pleasure reading this book again as an adult after so many years. It is as magical and engaging as I remember."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is for the Kindle version of the 75th Anniversary Edition of The Hobbit. Works fine on the Kindle, but audio and video that is advertised (entire reason I bought this version) does not work on the ipad Kindle app. Disappointed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was the best book I've ever read and it was full of never-ending adventure and thrill. When I first started reading the book, I knew that there was a magical ring involved. I kept reading until that ring showed up. When it finally did, I got up and did my &#34;touchdown dance&#34;. The Hobbit actually is the best book I have ever read and I hope that if you have not read it you will read it and love it as I have. And for those who have already read the book, I hope you've had a great time reading it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It just amazing this is a great book and you just can't stop reading it!!!!! Great for anyone who wants to read chapter books!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a great prequel to lord of the rings. It's great to read how Bilbo got the ring. It's a really good story all on its own"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I never read The Hobbit when growing up and knowing that the movies were going to be released I decided to read the book. I agree that the Dwarves part in the first chapter was a little bit overdone but once you got through this initial part of the book I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I would not discourage anyone from reading the book simply because of the first chapter, after the initial chapter the book goes rather fast."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book has enchanted me for nearly 40 years. It was a pleasure to reread it after I went to see the movie.Bilbo Baggins is a positive and creative fellow who over comes amazing odds.

Wonderful"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Pretty good, it was very suspenseful. A bit dry at first but grew into a good story. Some parts are predictable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the paperback version more than 10 years ago, I love having it in eBook version and it is now my constant companion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"a very good book to listen to while driving or on the bus. the songs really come to life when you can hear them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There is nothing unexpected about the way Tolkien wrote this adventure. I read it after reading LOTR, and it does not disappoint.The dwarves are my favorite species in Middle-Earth and this book is just amazing from start to finish.I really think that this is a good family book, and I'm kind of sad that my father is not an avid reader. I would really have loved to share this adventure with someone who would be able to enjoy it as much as myself.Read this, the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion and you will just hunger for more stories from Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this, for the first time as a teenager.... many moons ago. I've re-read it several times since. Having seen and enjoyed Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, I looked forward to the new movie(s???) based on this book.I think J.R.R. Tolkein, for all his foibles, would most likely not enjoy Mr. Jackson's current offering. I realize that MGM has now taken a stake in Mr. Jackson's films.... and with the current trend of making \\"franchise films\\", I should have known something was amok when I learned that \\"The Hobbit\\" was to be a two-movie offering. The embellishments on the original story, the addition of \\"bad guy\\" goblins and a whole battle scene that doesn't occur in the book had me wondering from the first half hour of the movie, if it would get back to the story as Tolkein wrote it. A character mentioned ONCE in the book (and just in passing) has two whole scenes devoted to him.This is not so much intended as a review of the movie as it is the book. Read. Forget the 3-D.... forget the IMAX.... forget the silver screen altogether! Read the book. Simply put: It's better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved reading this book. I saw IOTR trilogy first, after I see this one at the movies I will watch them all again. It was so worth going back to the beginning.

Highly recommend it for any reader, be you a fast or slow one, the book just never gets old."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R Tolkien does not disappoint in The Hobbit.

It was still wrapped up in clear plastic. My boyfriend loved it for Christmas!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read the hobbit twice and have immediately loved the story both times. The movie was spot on. Hopefully there is a part two that follows the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Alot of people think that the Hobbit is the 'childs' version of the Lord of the Rings, the gentle prequel. I think that it's so much more. The Hobbit really gives you your foundation and footing in Middle Earth that makes the Lord of the Rings, &#34;Worth it&#34;.Great book. If you don't have it, you should get it instantly. I've multiple versions and now the electronic kindle one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I LIKED IT. I ALSO LIKED THE MOVIE.

Awesome!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit: A BBC Full-Cast Radio DramaOver all it's well done - however I have to say that I can't stand the music that is used. Sounds like a dying moose or a cat at times. In my opintion the 1970/1980s when this was made didn't always have the best sounding music.However, I enjoy the voices - though it is hard to tell them apart at times.I intend to give this version of the Hobbit a fair chance, but I will update if need be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book. Illustrations are OK. Map is difficult to use being in the back of the book, but still nice to have."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked this book becauseIt is a very exciting book.

This was a great start to the Lord of the Rings series, and a book that pulled me in from the start. J.R.R.

I suggested this book to anyone who enjoy a good action book with a small comical side.

Remember though, that the hobbit is a book written for young ones and thus lacks the complicated plots, leveled meanings and advanced writing style of the ring series. I enjoyed reading this tale and will happily go on to reread the others."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's stories but it would be nice if the names of the characters weren't so similar!

The first time was when I was about ten, and I loved it as much then as I do now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the enchanting perlude to the Lord of the Rings.

Follow Bilbo deep into the mines of moria, where bilbo findes a ring, but what he doesn't know is that it is the one ring that belongs to the evil sauron. On his way he meets up with trolls,wood elves,and the evil creature gollem. I am a person who loves fantasy, and this is one of the gratest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I did not like this one as much as the rest of the series. It is pointed toward children, not adults so be prepared! It is still a fairly engaging read. I read it first in middle school, but then tried to re-read it now (15 years later) and could not get into it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best fictions I have ever read. If you had seen the movie Lord of the rings you must agree that he book has to be excellent. But the hobbit is a continuation of the lord of the rings but the setting is it actually before the lord of the rings. The hobbit is such a wonderful book, everything thing about it is great not just the plot but the also the setting. Tolkien creates this whole New World for all the readers to explore as they go through the book.The \`hobbit' is about...well hobbits, hobbits are half human size and the most unmagical being and wouldn't do anything unexpected. The story is about Fordo Baggins a well respected hobbit until Gandalf the Grey somehow manages the get Fordo in an adventure that he will never forget. Fordo sets of his adventure with 13 dwarfs who wants to get their treasure back guarded by a dragon. What happens next is for you to find out hope you will enjoy your book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character is Bilbo Baggins, This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. Bilbo was no exception, At first he didn't even think about adventures. By the end Bilbo seemed like it was his personal destiny to be in adventures. He is a very funny and intresting charater with many good qualities. I like this book, this is because it is in a whole different world where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. The only problem I have with the book is the nearly 120 pages it took to develop the story for some action."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"with all of the hype recently regarding the new trio of movies coming about, i figured i should like to see the first of the three. i do however, have an aversion to seeing a movie before reading the book it is taken from. thus, i decided to make my way through the trilogy in prose form first. prior to doing so, i thought it wise to read the book which acts as a prologue, the hobbit.i was quite dissappointed. for the following reason.everyone loves this book. anytime people hype something so much, you are bound to have high expectations.yes, there is a very good reason it is well loved. the book has many interesting charecters, and sets the scene for the lord of the rings trilogy.one big thing to keep in mind though, this was written as a childrens book, where as the trilogy is not.the book meanders on, in an odyssey like form, going from one adventure to the next.there is not a lot of charecter development, (again, think childrens book, and you will be fine with this when you read it)i do not mean to bash this book. the book does what it sets out to do, tell an entertaining story.it is however, oftentimes, quite predictable, and uses what seem like cliche charecters.keep in mind though, that these are the charecters, that the cliches were based on. tolkien's gandalf, was the first wizard, that looks like the the wizards we think of. (robes, large pointy hat, long white beard, magical staff)go into this book with an open mind, rand emember that is was not intended to be a great piece of literature, but rather a good story for younger readers, and you will love it.excellent book to read with your kids. or, if you want to remember what it was like to be one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have been told that i am sad for reading the Hobbit. That it is a childs book. My mum read it to me when i was young and i read it again when i was 13. Having just re read it at the age of 15 i would say read it.Do not shoot staright into the Lord Of The rings. Read this first. Become a child again. Tolkien writes this like a kids book. But i know many adults who love this book and have read it numerous times.Bilbo Baggins is just a normal Hobbit intill one day gandal and some mighty dwarves come along and they are take him onto a quest to kill a dragon. Sounds lame doesnt it? Well dont be stupid, read it with pleasure. Carry it around in the park. Read it before you go to bed.This is a very good read and i reccomend it to all fans of adventure and anybody who is interested in Tolkien. A nice, fluffy, light read"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about an unadventerous hobbit named bilbo baggins who goes on an adventure with a wizzard named gandalf and thirteen dwarves to reclaim a treasure stolen by a dragon named Smaug. It was hard to put this book down when I first read it(when i was 8) and i finished it in about a day or two. I am now 16 and have read it a few times since then and it is still as good as it was the first time. The reading is easy which makes it a good book for children to read and is a good fantasy which adults will enjoy also. If you like this book I recomend The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit as a school literature group assignment. Before reading it I had never read any other books written by J.R.R Tolkien. The Hobbit story is a wonderful story about a hobbit named Bilbo and a great adventure he has. The way Tolkien made the characters was amazing and how each and everyone is different in many ways. I will definitly read the other sequels to the lord of the rings story. If you like a great fantasy adventure book this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first book I read that was by Tolkien. I thought it was fantastic. I got it for my late birthday present from my Dad. He suggested I get this one before The Lord of the Rings. I don't suggest anyone reading this if you are under your teenage years. It is a very difficult book to read if you are young (that is why they have cliff-notes for it) So this is what I say, if you like Fantasy and you like Tolkien, buy it, if you don't like Fantasy and you think Tolkien is a terrible writer (which I do not agree with), then don't buy it. I give this five stars because it is my favorite book of all time, because I think Fantasy is great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbits has to be the greatest prelude ever written.

I think that Tolkien 's work is very well written. He uses great detail and I can always easily get a mental image of what's happening.

Overall it was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who can read and understand it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this for my Kindle to read through again before going to see the movie. Let me just say, this has got to be one of the best prequels to one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Great for all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This timeless story requres nothing else from me, other than to say that the images it invokes in the reader's mind cannot be portrayed on the silver screen, regardless of the talents of Hollywood's finest.

Even though I've read this book a few times, the additions gave it a new flavor."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have lost track of how many times I read this book in the past 30+ years. It cracks open the door to the great Trilogy in particular and Tolkein in general. Whether adult or child, the moment the round green door opens, you will be lost in a marvelous believable world that that never existed but which you will ardently wish was real. These books will have the longevity of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this story; it had all the elements a good story needs. It had great mythical lands, hobbits, a band of hostile dwarves, a mage, goblins, trolls, and many other mythical creatures. The descriptions of the places were in-depth, and colourful. The plot was great; though the original quest was petty, it turned into a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book that you can't put down. It has action, comedy, and lots of adventures. This book is about a hobbit (a little person with big feet and hands) who goes on a quest with six dwarves. Along the way they run into trolls, wizards, giant spiders, gobblins, a very strange creature named Gollum, and a dragon named Smaug. The best part about the Hobbit is that it is only one of four books in a series that are all filled with action and adventure. I would recommend this book and all the ones in the series to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Reading Tolkien's masterpiece is like being drawn into a world so believable, one can reach out and snatch Bilbo Baggins' ring. No wonder this is the benchmark of all fantasy books, it is a true fantasy, with &quot;dwarves&quot;, elves, trolls, dragons, goblins, and whatever anyone can imagine."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read many books, but this book is probally one of my favorites. It's set in the days with elves, dragons and wizards. This book is what I think best describes the term &quot;Adventure&quot;. It's filled with detail and description. One more comment to whoever reads this. Do NOT EVER see the movie they made for this book. It leaves out huge parts of the story and is very lame."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was my first fantasy novel. I really had no interest in reading fantasy before. I heard this was an extraordinary book. I heard right. This is a master piece. Tolkien brings out the child that is within us all. He takes the imagination to new heights, introducing us to an extraordinary land filled with extraordinary people and creatures; some good, some evil. Bilbo Baggins the lead character in the book is goes on an adventure that is beyond his wildest dreams. The way in which Tolkien tells this tale, is worth the read by itself. This is a masterful prelude to the 'Lord Of The Rings', the greatest fantasy epic ever written!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was great! It was able to capture the imaginations of both adults and children with elements of fantasy and have a both complex and easy to understand plot. It is hard to believe how Tolkein managed to create this entire world. Read the Lord of the Rings, too! It's like a Bible! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is beyond it's expectations! It is a wonderfully written, and spectacular in it's intentions. J.R.R. Tolkien is a fabulous writer! He makes sense in every word he writes! I have read only one of his books, and I am fascinated! Read this book you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excuse the melodrama of the title, but after reading some of the reviews on here.... I mean come on, to call Tolkien boring and not important is to not understand that his book pointed out the direction that fantasy literature was to go in this century. Just read any article of an authors influences or some of the dedications on current fantasy novels and Tolkiens name will appear hundreds of times. All I'm saying is read the book from the perspective that there wouldn't be a &quot;WHeel of Time&quot; or &quot;Belgariad&quot; or &quot;Magician series&quot; without the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"fantasy lovers will find this book well worth their time, but don't try to read too much into it...some have said that there are conections to christianity, but even if there aren't the book is very well written and hard to put down...Tolkein catches you with riddles, songs, and tales that will draw your attention like a moth to the flame...so unless you plan to take the time to finish Bilbo's saga by reading the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, don't start with the Hobbit because you won't be able to stop!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was taken by the almost lyrical prose used Tolkien to describe the adventures of Bilbo, the reluctant adventurer.

I love the innocence of the story, It is beautiful and intriguing. However, it is relatively easy to put down.

Savoring each page of his adventures. A nice easy read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read The Hobbit it was such a chore to read it that it took me months. Having now read (and watched) the Lord of the Rings, returning to the Hobbit has gone much more smoothly for me.

One of the big advantages of using the Kindle edition for those of you who like me, are rapidly approaching 60, is that you can readily adjust the font size. This makes for an easy read. Great fantasy book if you happen to be one of the few people not yet introduced to Bilbo Baggins."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I absolutely love this book.

Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a nice, big book with a lot of beautifully painted illustrations inside. One thing I didn't expect was that the cover shown is actually the cover protector (I don't know if it said that in the description I read) and the real cover is very plain, green and with gold writing. All the same, I'm thrilled to have it and would recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's great to finally have an unabridged version of this book. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. I have loaded the Nicol Williamson version of this onto iTunes, but it is heavily abridged, only 4 hours long. This one is 11 plus hours. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The book is 16 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Definitely a great read. One of the best books I have ever read.

I seem to remember a much larger book with smaller print, but it could be me. I looked at all the info inside the book, but it doesn't make clear if this version is unabridged, edited down, or what. It IS the entire Hobbit story (Unlike the current movie, being split into 3 parts), so I can't complain about that, but it would be nice to know if this version is the unrevised, unabridged version or not."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have owned a copy of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; for 37 years.

One of the most feared foes of the Goblins {even though it's a sword}. then retuned Orcristto thorin the leader. While they were escaping Biblo found the ring of power. After they escaped they were attacked by the goblins and wolves then saved by eagles. Then they arrived at the loly mountain and stole one of Smaug's jewl's which broght his anger on them. Then he attacked the island city and was killed by the black arrow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Charming is, I think, the word that describes The Hobbit best. It is a novel intended for children (not children too young, obviously), and so one should not expect too much serious writing in the book; but even so, it has a magic all its own, quite different than its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo Baggins is a character you get to know and love, and even feel sorry for, throughout the book. The Dwarves are amusing, too, and Gandalf is one of Tolkien's most unforgettable characters. If you want to read a book that led to the definitive novel in fantasy writing, a book with endless charm and humour, read The Hobbit. It's short, it's easy to read, and it's fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the Hobit is a great book for kids.I really enjoy the adventure they go on.I like Gandalf.I read it with my dad.If you like adventure books this would be great for you.Each part keeps getting better and beter.I love J.R.R Tolkien.You should tell your friends to read the book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have to admit, I would have never given the Hobbit a chance if I hadn't been assigned a book report in which I'd have to read a fantasy book.

Escaping from goblins, being rescued by giant eagles, killing dragons, and protecting a hoard of treasure may seem like a typical adventure story. This story will tingle the senses and twist your imagination to new heights and leave you wanting more and more! In a lifeless, boring, adventure-less, hobbit town with a shy, dull, adventure-less hobbit came an adventure of all adventures, one that couldn't be turned down. The shy hobbit meets a wise, risky, well-known wizard who talks the hobbit to throw a party and the hobbit accepts. At the party, the hobbit meets thirteen dwarves, who turn out to be his traveling companions and each have different traits and personalities which both aid and the hurt the friends on their journey. The friends start on their journey and they must travel through dangerous mountains filled with deadly goblins. There the hobbit proves his usefulness and saves the dwarves from the goblins from there on the hobbit pulls the dwarves and sticky and dangerous situations. This book is terrific. J.R.R. Tolkien's writing is detailed and flowing that lets the reader feel like he or she is actually in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good sense of imagination and adventure. This is not just for kids it can be just as exciting for adults too. I encourage anybody who has read this book to read the other books in the series.Reviewed by Jimmy Byars"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read The Hobbit 20-25yrs. ago and, to this day, I still have not only The Hobbit,but also the trilogy, The Silmarillian and The Tolkien Companion prominently and proudly displayed on my bookshelf.

Absolutely beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien wrote a very well known novel titled the Hobbit. The book starts out introducing a calling the a very unlikely hero. The hero being Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a small dwarf-like humanoid species called a hobbit, a short, fat, uncoordinated, inexperienced, peace loving creature. He is taken on an adventure by an old friend that is leader of the quest and happens to be a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. This quest travels all throughout his world, and experiences many things that no one from his race has ever seen before. He is taken to battle Goblins, meet Elves, fly on the backs of Giant Eagles, and was almost a dinner for three very stupid trolls. Bilbo's reason, or place for being on quest was the title of \\"Burglar\\". He was assigned to steal treasure from the last Dragon alive named Smaug. Bilbo steals the treasure he was supposed to and an enraged Smaug reeks havoc on the city of men below him. After he is slain there is a huge epic battle at the end for ownership of the stolen treasure. I really enjoyed this book, I believe it is meant for a younger audience, the story behind was very captive and I was able to visualized everything. I highly suggest this book for recreation reading because it is a fun book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think it started kind of krumy, but the ending was awsom.the begeningwas nothing but talk but you have to raeadit or you dont no wuts going onn.My favor it part was the end wen the dwarphs fight with the lack men."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this is greate book , not only becouse it was the knock off of the classic lord of the rings trilogy and all other story and legends regarding middle earth. but the story to this book was terrific. i must admit it starts off a little slow when it first intoduces mr baggins, but the story will pick up i promis you.its hard for me to detail to you how greate it is without giving away the story but its just a never ending journy even for those do not have intrest in midth or legend books. this is a easy to read story about an adventure that all will find entertaining.not that its at a flat pase or anything but its easy to read due to that its told from third person point of veiw so well, its almost like being told the story in person.id recommend it to all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book because Tolkien creates a world with a mixed, diverse enviroment of characters. Tolkien also creats such sophisticated beings like dwarves, and my favorite, hobbits. This book was also cool because Gandalf was in it, and Gandalf is my favorite character in this book. My favorite part was when Gandalf and the dwarves hide up in the trees from the evil wolves. I also liked the end f this book, but I'm not going to spoil it. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This version is for collectors, or a nice snowy gift for under the christmas tree. Reading this book reminds me of the magical times of the year. The snowy chrismas' of the past. Wonderful in its comfy leatherett binding. Although, it is rather odd to wrap it in leatherett. The book, has a strong following of nature lovers. People who fight for the protection of nature and its leather sagging creatures. Really it does. Remember in the seventies when on campus' everywhere you could read \\"bilbo\\" Inscribed on the steps before a class, or in pastel on a mirror. I knew one girl who read the book, and threw out all of her cruely animal tested cosmetics the next day. I don't know, maybe the book is made of synthetic leather or something.I hear teasings that the movie will be made by Peter Jackson. Hurray! Anyway, For a more adult look on this old childrens tale, Here you go. Enjoy, There's Dragons, and Dwarfes, and Giant Spiders, and an evil mention of the \\"Necromancer\\".

This makes it a great fairy tale."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, By J.R.R. Tolkien, is a book for everyone. It has comedy, jokes and riddles along with suspense and adventure for those who seek a good page turner. Tolkien tells you how the hobbit, Bilbo, came of the ring and had thirteen other companions to help find what the ring could do. It tells of their adventures against the giant spiders, evil wolves, orcs and much, much more. Even though he first wishes that he was home by his warm fire and on his soft bed, this adventure changes his life and the lives of his companions. I myself have never read a book like THE HOBBIT, and hope to have the pleasure of talking to more of the fans of this book because in my opinion it is one of the worlds' finest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Hobbit.

This is my second time reading it, and the themes in the book are very strong and enjoyable. However, the language and style of writing used in Tolkien's day can feel clumsy to the modern reader (or at least to me). Sometimes the sheer length of his sentences impedes the fluency you would like to see in a book geared towards children. However, as a coming of age story, it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is amazing. Why did I wait so long to buy this book?!

Rings is probably the greatest epic novel ever written, but The Hobbit touches me more closely. One should never read LOTR without having read the Hobbit first, afterall it is the first book and sets up a lot of the action that will follow. It's a great quick read, running only around 320 pages compared to Rings' 1500 or so. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel lacks much of the complexity and subtlety of LoTR, but it is still a great novel in its own respect."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because that was as many as I could give. If I could give more I would! This is an entertaining, captivating and imaginative book. Tolkein creates a magical world where you feel that anything can happen (which in all truth could)and the characters he makes are both lovable (Bilbo)and despisable (e.g.Smaug). For people who love fantasy, this is the best in that context that I have ever read, save a few other well known books by the same author. I don't believe that anyone has not heard of Tolkien by now, either because of the movie Lord of the Rings or because of his reputable books. In either case, those who have not read this book (and also The Lord of The Rings series, which is a sequel of sorts to The Hobbit)READ IT NOW!!!Don't be among the minority. You won't regret it, I promise."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought it was a really good book. It had action in it most of the time. I didnt want to stop reading it.

Its mainily about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, he likes to be alone and smoke his pipe. Then one day unexspectedly a wizard by the name of Gandalf, comes along with 12 little dwarves asking to help them with a trouble that they have. but I wont tell you because you will have you read it and find out.

Thorin and Co., as the dwarves called themselves, were in need of a fourteenth member of their group to assist them on their quest to get back gold and other riches the dragon Smaug had stolen from them. Bilbo obliged and accompanied the band of dwarves on their rescue mission. On many occasions during his journey, Bilbo wished that he were back home, but once his duty was complete, Bilbo never regretted going with the dwarves.With an unexpected ending and great descriptions, I would undoubtedly recommend this book. Despite a slow and boring beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Hobbit. I really liked how this plot was so unpredictable.

Movie fans need to be aware that the film takes considerable leway from the book. The role of Thorin is larger in the film than in the book and he is much more the hero in the film. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the future films.Tolkien writes the Hobbit as if he is writing for a young audience, he also uses humor to advantage in this novel.

Movie left too much out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Descriptions are fabulous. Tension is felt. Magic is present on the trails, having tea with the hobbit, and in the many escapes from the bad things."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he likely had no idea that it would become the first book in a lengthy series which today serves as the archetypal example of high fantasy. Still further from his mind would have been the idea that his story could find its way into the theaters of the the next century as a blockbuster production.Taken solely on its own merits, however, The Hobbit is still an exceptional book. Tolkien weaves together bits of European mythology, stringing it into a tapestry with threads of his own prodigious creativity, to write a book with appeal to all ages. The poetry can be a bit corny by modern standards, but the overall style of writing and the narrator's tone make the story come alive for the reader.The Kindle edition of The Hobbit has an issue with images in text, causing many of them to appear \\"sideways\\" regardless of the angle of the Kindle. While this won't be an issue for the majority of readers, for some (particularly younger children), it could be frustrating. Still, this is too minor a concern to justify a lower star rating."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved reading it. Can't wait for part 2. I think the best part is the ending.

The illustrations are nicely done and the print is sufficiently large, adding to the look of the volume and the value of the purchase."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can barely believe there are those that think this book too boring &amp; pointless. First off, the book is barely 300 pages long, if that. Secondly, it has a point, and that's to tell a engaging story. I guess some people just don't get it or go in for this kind of thing. Pointless and boring? You haven't seen such till you read certain volumes of Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. For me, this book is like a doorway into another world. A wizard, a hobbit and a group of dwarves go on a quest to oust a dragon from their mountain and run into orcs, wolves and spiders on the way? Jeez, what could be cooler? I found it engrossing every step of the way. The only criticism I would have for the book might be that the latter part of the book takes an abruptly more serious tone than the first half of the book, but that's only fitting since it prepares for the more serious tone of Lord of the Rings. This book is Classic Fantasy. For the number of reviews that wanted to give this book 0 stars, even if they are only a handful, I give this book 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I believe the Hobbit was not a fabulouse book the way most people rave about it. The action in the book was hiddem by the words the author used and the characters could haver been described better. I reccomend the book to young readers who enjoy fantasy and adventure. I was hoping to read something more like the works of Mr. Pullman. I also didn't like the adittudes of the characters. Overall the book was mediocre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book in which the great JRR Tolkien introduced to the world at large the epic saga of that great hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.For those readers who are unfamiliar with hobbits, permit me to quote the Professor in his (accurate) description of our people.&quot;They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).&quot;Also, it must be said, hobbits do not tend toward adventure! A loving family, a comfortable home, a good meal, a pipe of tobacco, and a pint of beer are generally all that is required to make us happy.HOWEVER, in recent times, hobbits HAVE begun to have adventures and to participate more fully in the deeds of the Wide World. This story is the beginning. . ."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I ordered this edition because it is advertised as a movie tie-in edition, thinking it would have pictures from the movie in it.

It goes through the variations in the several editions of the book, but really does not have much in the way of aditional information."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, the book was written a very very long time ago by a professor. And that is exactly how it reads. The language just isn't what we are used to. For today's readers it can be a challenge to get past that and really become immersed in the story.But it is truly a wonderful story, and a gentle introduction to the much richer follow on works, The Lord of the Rings. I've always thought of the Hobbit more for younger readers, and the Lord of the Rings more for adults."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Kids loved listening to this.

Lots of action, adventure, and weird creatures (both good, bad, and...in between). I wish I had this read this book when I was younger. Reading it for the first time in my mid-twenties...somehow I think some of the magic of this world was diminished than if I had read the story at 12 or 13 years old. The story keeps moving rather well so on the whole, it was a decent enough story to read and I would highly recommend the story to someone in junior-high...or someone who enjoys classic fantasy...but that's about it.

Tolkien's The Hobbit, Tolkien captivates the human imagination with the fantastical tale of a Hobbit, who wanted nothing more than to stay in his hole sipping tea, when a wizard and thirteen dwarves recruit them for their journey and steal back their stolen treasure. Bilbo, the hobbit, represents what the majority of western population is like, fat, lazy, and unwilling for adventures, yet somehow the wizard, Gandalf, stirs his longings for adventures that are buried deep inside of Bilbo, the side which he calls \\"the Tookish part of him.\\" Tolkien is much like Gandalf, he finds us sitting in our homes, eating cake, drinking beer, and smoking our pipes, and even though we might not think we want to go on a journey, Tolkien rouses us up to come on a journey, go places you've never been, and meet people you never knew. Bilbo's journey is a page turning classic that is the prelude to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.Tolkien uses incredible characterization in his vast list of characters. The dwarves each have there own unique characteristics and hilarious names such as Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, and Ori. The dwarves mainly have one thing on their mind, and that is to steal back the treasure that was taken from them long ago. In fact they don't even like Bilbo, but only bring him along, so as to not have an unlucky number in the party. Gandalf is a favorite character in the story, he is wise beyond years, and yet so much of him is a mystery.On Bilbo's journey he runs into trolls, a host of goblins, warves(wolves), and slinks away from them all, with the help of Gandalf and the dwarves, and a certain ring that makes the wearer invisible, which he just happened to win, by pure luck, in a riddle-competition, with a strange creature. The Hobbit is a page-turning classic that takes us in to the world of Middle-Earth and onto an unforgettable journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a good one.Bilbo don't want to get to adventure but Gandalf let him join.He went on the journey to the misty mountains and met many difficulties.Grab one book now and read about this fantastic book!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book back in middle school and had to read this again! My renewed interest due to the new movie coming out is one of the reasons for enjoying this book now and back then. Its such a great story that keeps you going just like a computer adventure game, which is one of the reasons I play adventure games now too. Its a great book for all ages which I would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An unlikely hero, impossible odds, good company, and a wierd magical item. These are the traditional ingredients in this fantasy that make it...well, fantasy. What stands out in this work, though, is the incredible depth of his world, and the incredible story behind each and every little thing, hinted at here and there, though never completely expounded upon. It leaves enough to the imagination to make you think, yet tells you enough to avoid being confusing; a fine line that many fantasy authors fail to walk successfully these days. In short, this is a WONDERFUL book, and I think it should be required reading in school (and, I'm glad that it IS required in many schools)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937. The Hobbit is a fantasy that takes place in Middle Earth. Middle Earth is filled with dragons, knights, castles and grand battles. Grassy valleys, dark forests, grey mountains and blue rivers is what Middle Earth looks like.The story starts off in Bilbo Baggins hobbit hole. Bilbo, like any other hobbit never leaves his hobbit hole and eats five meals a day. A hobbit is a furry fellow who is slightly smaller than a dwarf. They don&#8217;t wear shoes because they have leather feet.Hobbits never go on adventures. That is, until one morning when Bilbo&#8217;s house is filled with thirteen dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit is asked by the wizard to join them on their journey. After a debate, Bilbo decides to go help the dwarves recover their gold from the Dragon, Smaug.Bilbo didn&#8217;t know how to take care of himself without being in his hobbit hole. Sometimes they didn&#8217;t eat at all and Bilbo was used to eating five meals a day. During his adventure Bilbo fell into goblin caves, was caught by wood elves, attacked by killer spiders and was in the Great War with the Goblins. (spoiler)The main characters are Bilbo the hobbit, Gandalf the wizard, Thorin the dwarf king and Smaug the dragon. My favorite character was Gandalf because he used magic. He used magic for fun to entertain by making fireworks and also as a weapon of mass destruction to kill his enemies. I liked the use of imagery in the book. The words used to describe the mountains, forests and dungeons made you feel as if you were there. The plot was exciting, action packed and suspenseful.I really enjoyed The Hobbit and would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or books with medieval settings. Will Bilbo and the dwarves kill the Dragon Smaug and recover the lost gold, or will Smaug kill them ? Will good triumph over evil? Read it and find out!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As everyone's gearing up for The Lord of the Rings to come out, I also picked up my copy of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien and read it. Its one of those books that you spend a nice rainy day with near a window. Or, a book you read when you're feeling creative and imaginative. It would even be a most wonderful book to read aloud and/or with your children. It has goblins, trolls, dragons, serpents, monsters, shape-shifters.The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is a delightful and lovable character. You'll instantly fall in love with his adorable antics and ways.If you like poetry, this book is also a wonderful choice.All in all, this book is for you and everyone. No matter what tastes they have in literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In the book, The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a rich, comfortable hobbit, seeks a warm fire and his armchair at home, but gets a big adventure.He then goes with Thorin and Company to the southern lands were Smaug, the worm, lies. On the way he and his companions encouter Trolls, Goblins, and spiders.When he finally reaches the Lonely Mountain, he feels like he wants to be in his hobbit hole at home, but he must confront Smaug. Bilbo then robbes Smaug of some of his treasure which results in battles and war.The adventuresome book The Hobbit, talks of Bilbo Baggins's exciting days and of how he overcomes his fear and stands up to his enemies that he must confront to survive.You can share Bilbo's experiences by reading The Hobbit, and maybe some of his courage and luck will rub off on you too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book when I was in middle school, and recently, I decided to reread it. I had forgotten how amazing this book is!! I was utterly fascinated by little Bilbo's adventures and his journey through the mountains and forests, AGAIN.

I am definitley looking forward to reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; If a movie is ever made about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; I don't think it will be able to live up to the book.Other books I recommend are the Harry Potter series, which are great fantasy novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In The Hobbit, Tolkien creates a world not so different from our own, but the characters in it make this a phenomenal work. Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, is the main character here who, despite his unwillingness to join a mass of dwarves and Gandalf, a wizard,on a quest for treasure, finds himself taking on the many of their battles. Encountering goblins, spiders, and wolves, Bilbo is savior to his dwarf friends. After encountering the groups' nemesis Smaug, he feels he is a better person having left the comforts of his hobbit hole. Ultimately Tolkien writes a fine tale about taking risk and confronting fears to achieve a greater vision of oneself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Let you know first off that I'm not a heavy reader. I could name all the books I've read in my lifetime and that really means I've not read too many, probably about 12 total. However, seeing the trailer to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, I was too convinced to start reading the books. So, I bought the Hobbit (which is the prelude to the Trilogy) and I started reading it. Low and behold, I was amazed and just taken away at just how page-turning this book is. Every moment I got, I read the Hobbit and I enjoyed every moment of it. Tolkien's writing is not terribly old-fashion so it's not too hard to comprehend though it does take some time to get used to his style of writing. Once you do get used to it, your in for a huge adventure filled with odd creatures and even some minor humor. But Gollum's riddles and the Ring's power make this adventure all the more interesting.READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Captures the magical aspect of fantasy from times before vampires and werewolfs.

Tolkien was a writer that could never be beaten...i have read it twice before but still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The biggest theme present in The Hobbit is the quest; when Bilbo goes with Gandalf and the dwarves to Lonely Mountain. The quest has been in literature for hundreds of years, it is seen in Beowulf when he goes off to kill Grendel and it is also very much so present in the Arthurian Legends. The biggest quest in Arthurian Legend would have to be the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights think that if they bring home the grail then a time of peace and prosperity will fall over their lands. Bilbo sort thinks the same way when he takes the cup from the dragon; he thinks that by having proof of his exploits that will make him an even more recognizable figure among the other hobbits.Another interesting parallel in The Hobbit to Arthurian Legend is use of named swords. It is with his sword Excalibur that Arthur was able to derive a lot of his power. The same goes for Bilbo after acquiring his short sword from the trolls, he does not name at first knowing that he has to prove himself with it but after that he names it Sting. It is with this sword that Bilbo was able to feel his own powerAlthough Tolkien publicly denied any connections between The Hobbit and Arthurian Legend it is defiantly easy to see where people are able to see parallels and connect the two stories together. Overall The Hobbit is a great read it does not take long to finish and interesting to see the differences between the movie and book. Everyone should read The Hobbit at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's book The hobbit. It is a well written and fun read. Read this before you see the movies!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While reading the hobbit, I encountered not only excitement and became very anxious to see what would happen next. This book is definitely a page turner. The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are. And then the annotations-useful engaging and very well done. You will WANT to read these. we discover how the book was written and what was changed between editions. There are fascinating tidbits about tolkens life and the experiences that made their way into the story.To further describe The Hobbit, Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, smaug. they have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climatic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but alos an new adventure for his friends in \\"The Lord Of the Rings\\".\\"Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron\\" - C.S. Lewis, in the first review of the hobbi."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved the exciting adventure. I would recommend the book you if you love mystery books. it's a great thrilling book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I started reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" I was so bored. I never thought I could finish reading it and actually enjoy it. Around the sixth chapter, \\"The Hobbit\\" picked up the pace and became interesting. It surprised me that I was actually entertained by reading the book. At the conclusion, I was pleased with the action and the adventure. I was content with the ending also.One of the best parts of \\"The Hobbit\\" was not the quest to Lonely Mountain, but watching Bilbo Baggins' transformation. Throughout the book, he developed from a timid hobbit to a smart, stealthy, and more confident hobbit. I liked seeing how his adventures, especially the encounter with the spiders in Mirkwood, positively changed his character. I also enjoyed when Bilbo cleverly came up with a way to escape from Thranduil's imprisonment. The idea of riding down the river in old boxes and barrels was resourceful. He benefited from the quest in ways more profound than leaving with a chest of silver.One of my favorite adventures in the story was when Bilbo met Gollum. I loved when Gollum and Bilbo were engaged in the riddle game. The terms of the game made it more intense to me. If Bilbo happened to get a riddle wrong, Gollum was going to eat him. Personally, I believe it was one of the most important points in the novel. Here, Bilbo finds the amazing invisibility ring that helps him greatly throughout the rest of the quest to Lonely Mountain.J.R.R Tolkien used foreshadowing throughout the novel. The use of foreshadowing made the story more engrossing. When he used foreshadowing, I became more entrenched in reading. Tolkien knew exactly what words and phrases to use to paint a vivid image in my head. Throughout \\"The Hobbit,\\" I felt like I was actually on the adventure with Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs. Without the frequent foreshadowing and the dynamic imagery, I personally would not have been as interested throughout \\"The Hobbit.\\"I would most definitely recommend this book to everyone. While it is challenging to read the first few chapters, once the real adventures begin, you will not be able to put the book down. As someone who does not usually read and enjoy adventure or fantasy novels, I am surprised that I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" so much."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is a very good read. It appeals to all age groups except for small children and just about anyone could read it and experience a different form of bliss or joy. The story follows Bilbo the Hobbit throughout his journey in Middle Earth. Bilbo and his friend Gandalf meet many people along the way from elves to a dragon named Smaug. During their entire campaign and travels they encounter much fighting and peril that ends up in an all out war with a surprise ending. Bilbo emerges alive and continues on the same life he lived before. Some individuals would say parts of the story are boring, but in the end they all come together to create a beautiful ending. This is a book that has been cherished for decades. Make sure your kids read it someday because it speaks to everyone. It is featured in much high school curriculum for a reason. It has been translated into many different languages so people all over the world can experience it. Keep two copies so you always have one to share with someone else.

Then, a thunderstorm came upon them and they found a dry cave and slept there for the night. Bilbo was awakened by a scraping sound, then he saw the stone wall open. The group was captured by Goblins.They found themselves in a large cavern in the mountain. The Goblin scowled at them. Then Thorin stepped forward and explained to him that they did not mean to trespass. Gandolf appeared at the door and freed the group from the goblins. The group ran ahead and Bilbo was lost behind them.Bilbo found an underwater lake and a ring on an island in the lake. He found out that the ring made him invisible. In the lake also lived a creature named Gollum. Gollum was a creature that ate other people. Gollum approached Bilbo and Bilbo told him he desired to find a way out. They then played a riddle game and if Bilbo won, he lived and if he lost, he would die. Bilbo won the riddle game but Gollum still wanted to eat him, But then Bilbo accidentally slipped the ring on his finger and became invisible, so he escaped.He met with the group again and walked with them for a few days.

But Bilbo's life is unexpectedly turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf, with thirteen dwarves in tow. They eat Bilbo's food, take over his cozy hobbit-hole (a subterranean dwelling -- \\"Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort\\"), and generally make life difficult for him.But Bilbo soon finds out why: these dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, who slaughtered its inhabitants and stole their treasure. Now, led by Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves intend to take back what is theirs -- and Gandalf wants Bilbo to come along. Bilbo doesn't particularly want to go, but the adventure appeals to a quirky, adventurous side of him. Before he knows what has happened, he is on a rollicking adventure filled with malevolent goblins, a degenerated creature with a magical Ring, Elves both friendly and unfriendly, enormous eagles, savage wolves (also called wargs), and giant carnivorous spiders. But even if Bilbo can get past these dangers, he must still deal with the malevolent Smaug in his mountain fortress.Many people have fond memories of reading \\"The Hobbit\\" as children (including part of the LOTR movie cast). This is definitely a children's book in some ways, but most children can't pick up on the subtle character developments and the nuanced foreshadowing. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not merely an entertaining story or a delightful prequel, but also a masterful piece of fiction.If nephew Frodo Baggins is the ultimate \\"little guy\\" hero, then Bilbo is the ultimate reluctant hero. Bilbo is almost perfectly happy in his respectably dull life, but his very small yearning for adventure is evident from the very beginning. Though he is not the sort of person that you would classify as being a hero, Bilbo grows gradually and subtlely in courage and ingenuity. Only on the very last pages does the reader realize just how much Bilbo has changed.Gandalf is a more nebulous figure in this book than he is in LOTR, and displays much of the \\"crotchety gray wizard\\" archetype that he formed in fantasy literature. Thorin Oakenshield displays the endearing and annoying traits of dwarves, dating back to the Prose Edda: He's proud and sometimes a little obnoxious, but also fiercely loyal, honorable and extremely brave. The other dwarves are not featured as much individually (after all, there are twelve) but retain individual characteristics that never become jumbled or confused.Tolkien's writing style is somewhat in keeping with a bedtime story (which this once was) and a children's story. He had apparently mastered a very rare gift, that of being able to address the reader without sounding cutesy or smug. The descriptions are very evocative, especially when he describes action scenes. The dialogue is enchantingly written, managing to be fairly realistic while never being boringly so.Like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\" is influenced by mythology and a previous work of fiction. The goblins (later orcs) are somewhat reminicent of George MacDonald's goblins; as Tolkien read and enjoyed some of MacDonald's works, this is unsurprising. Additionally, the names of Gandalf and almost all the dwarves can be found in Norse legends. The impact is subtler than that in LOTR, presumably since Tolkien's children were too young to appreciate any influences.\\"The Hobbit\\" remains a classic that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike, possibly even more enjoyable now than when it was first written. Before you read \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" be sure to check out its enchanting prequel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok; for those kids who need an introduction to the Lord of the Rings, enjoy reading, hate reading, love fantasy, or simply like to have stories read to them, this is the book. It is superbly voiced by Rob Inglis, who seems to make each character distinctly stand out in your head by mere intonation. He makes the reading fun. And it's great for long car trips, because there are quite a few tapes. My kids listen to it while they are doing their chores- it keeps them from getting distracted. Now be warned: there are a few scary elements, such as wolves, nasty goblins, a slimy cannibal cave creature called Gollum, a dragon, and a large war at the end which is not described too much, but in which many people including a few main characters die. Thus, it is lot for the little kiddies as much as the 9-11 age or older.But don't get me wrong; this book is a lot of fun for older folks, too. It is a great treatment of the hobbit for fans of Tolkien of all ages, but it isn't at all a bore for those who know nothing about the books. If you're thinking about getting the trilogy, this is a nice introduction (it differs a bit in tone and style, but it's the same world).

On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do.

I asked them what the main plot to the story was - their descriptions peaking my interest. They proceeded to tell me that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was the first book so I was quite excited about getting a copy to read. At the bookstore, I was pleased to find this illustrative edition, which has some fantastic pictures. When I showed it to my friend he was very envious and wanted to borrow my copy...even though he just recently finished reading the story again.

The story telling is fantastic and detailed. Tolkien talks through third person, but uses the character Bilbo Baggins as a conveyor for the story line. The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is a story I would recommend to anyone, whether fantasy fiction is their gig or not.Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. He belongs to a quiet folk who enjoy a good meal to eat and a pipe to smoke. As Bilbo is doing just this one morning, an old acquaintance who happens to be a wizard named Gandalf comes calling. Gandalf brings with him a band of dwarves who seem to have no where else to stay, and Bilbo can only be hospitable. The dwarves, led by an &quot;enormously important dwarf&quot; named Thorin Oakenshield, impose upon Bilbo, invading his home and eating his food, but in turn offering jovial company, great stories and song singing. Soon, however, the dwarves reveal their purpose for their unexpected visit. They wish for Bilbo to accompany them on their treasure hunt . . .I charish this novel for several reasons. One reason I enjoy this story so much is because there is no beating around the bush; everything is &quot;one-two-three go&quot;. There is no long introduction in the story's beginning that will take sense away from the story if you do not read it, like in many fantasy novels. I also enjoy the way Tolkien writes verse and poetry and riddles into his story. When the dwarves come to Bilbo's home, they sing songs about treasure. While on the road, elves are overheard singing as they travel through the forest, as well as goblins. Later, when Bilbo encounters the infamous Gollum, they exchange several riddles. Tolkien is a talented poet as well as a story teller. Most of all, however, I enjoy the quaint humor and almost over-abundant common sense of Mr. Baggins. He is a delightful character to read, and he makes Tolkien's novel a gem to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read The Hobbit, and I think that it was an exellent book.

It is quite apparent that either my memory is lacking or I read this book much to young to appreciate it fully.This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I particularly appreciate and identify with a hero who is not macho. He is not strong. He is not selfless and morally superior. He is made of real things, and is enjoyable with his flaws. You root for him when he comes through in a pinch; he has an ability to come up with clever ideas under pressure. But he, good old Bilbo Baggins, would rather prefer being at home taking tea and eating cakes.There is great wealth here - in imagery, action, character, conflict, and, yes, humor. This classic fantasy is so entirely engaging that you are constantly eager for what happens next. How on earth can they escape the goblins? Surely the party will all die at the legs of giant spiders!Often you hear of books that are \\"must reads\\", and there are so many of those that you just brush off as fluff an nonsense.

You need to understand that Tolkien pretended, as he was writing them, that they were written by hobbits, and came to Tolkien as the \\"Red Book of Westmarch.\\" Tolkien then translated the Red Book and wrote up the translations as the three works above. That is the literary conceit, and if you fail to recognize that, then you won't understand how the three works can be so different.The part of the Red Book which Tolkien pretends to have turned into The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, was supposed to have been written by Bilbo himself, for other hobbits, as a tale of his adventure. Thus, descriptions and characterizations of dwarves and elves (and everything else) in The Hobbit are from the viewpoint of a very unsophisticated hobbit who had one (epic) adventure in his entire sedate and settled hobbit life. One of the overarching themes of The Hobbit is that the adventure radically changed Bilbo in some ways while leaving him amazingly unchanged in many other ways. Bilbo remains a hobbit, through and through (albeit a strange and unreliable one, in the opinion of most other hobbits). The description of a typical hobbit in the early pages of chapter 1 is the description of the writer, and the reader must keep that in mind.The LOTR, in contrast, was (supposedly) based on parts of the Red Book written mostly by Frodo, who lived through the events of LOTR and who was very much changed by them. Frodo as a writer was much more sophisticated, more well-traveled, more learned, and more connected to the outside world than Bilbo. Frodo drew on many sources for his story, and was not an eye-witness to much of it. Also, Frodo loses much of his \\"hobbitness,\\" partly due to the burden of the Ring and partly because of his extensive exposure to the Wide World. LOTR is therefore the most \\"human\\" (in the Middle Earth sense) of Tolkien's three works.Lastly, The Silmarillion was (supposedly) based on parts of the Red Book which were translations by Bilbo and Frodo from ancient elvish histories (both oral and written). So again, the character of The Silmarillion is quite different from LOTR or The Hobbit.However, the three works constitute one whole. Reading all three gives the reader much more appreciation of Tolkien's world of Middle Earth. I hope this helps some confused readers.If you want to hear some great lectures on The Hobbit, check out [...](Note that I have no association whatsoever with that web site / professor / school.)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THE ENDING ENRAGED ME I MEAN TALK ANTICLIMACTIC SO GUY SHOOTS SMAUG IN THE HEAD AND IM LIFE ERRRRRRRRRRG SORRYDONT HATE INSPIRATEFOLLOW on twitter @JaredPendleton"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was brand new and it had the original art work on the cover and inside.

I don't know what made me choose it, I don't remember much of it...I don't even remember if I liked it or not, really, so maybe I should stop saying that I've read this book twice. Re-visiting it was really more like picking it up for the first time except for a couple of scenes that felt vaguely familiar.For the most part, I can see why this book is a classic. An author's creation of an entire world, with new creatures and politics and history, is one of my favorite things to discover (if it's done well, and this one was). I loved the gentle, familiar narrative voice and its occasional side commentaries. I greatly enjoyed watching Bilbo learn that there is more to him than he thought (this, I suspect, is the real appeal of this book for so many readers: if plain old Bilbo Baggins can embark upon such a dangerous journey and live to tell the tale, what may life have in store for us?). I liked that the characters aren't perfect, that they make mistakes but also experience successes. After all, minus the elves and faeries and goblins and dragons, isn't that what life is all about?There wasn't much that I didn't like about this one, to be honest. I probably won't read it again anytime soon, but that's only because I've got so many other books on my to-read list. However, once my son is old enough (he's only seven months old right now, and I'm already thinking about which books to introduce him to), I'd love to read this to him as a bedtime story.

It started out with a Hobbit (or a small creature) by the name of Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard by the name of Gandalf. The dwarves were in pursuit to avenge their \\"treasure,\\" and needed a \\"burglar\\" (Bilbo Baggins referred by the wise Gandalf). In order to get their treasure, they ran into trolls, elves, wood elves, received some resources for their long journey, and came upon lake people who also aided them in their adventure. At the end, in order to avenge their treasure, that rightfully belonged to them so long ago, they had to fight a dragon named Smaug that doesn't so easily forget when danger is upon him, and he has a very good smell for dwarves. Although they ran into troubles along the way, and they appeared to have gotten their treasure, read more to see whether it was worth it in the end. And see what happens when greed is your number one focus on the prize at hand. Also see how Bilbo Baggins' \\"burgar expertise\\" may save more trouble than is worth in his reward to be received at the end of this journey.

Sadly, that approbation did not last long. Granted, the reading of this story, with its many and varied characters, and many songs and poems, is a daunting task. Unfortunately, I found the narrator's soft, somnolent drone more suited to a bedtime story than an adventure tale, and I even dozed while driving! In addition, I found the pronunciation of the dwarves' names to be odd, and some of the voices to be not as I would have expected, most notably Beorn.Worst of all were the attempts at singing the various songs. It started with the warbling rendition of the delightful \\"That's what Bilbo Baggins hates/So carefully, carefully with the plates!\\", and concluded with a ghastly interpretation of one of my favorite song/poems \\"The Road Goes Ever On\\", the latter which was so awful I actually had to turn off the audiobook a couple of times to seethe before being able to listen to the entire thing.The best thing I can say for this is that it is unabridged narration, and it is better than the BBC dramatization (reviewed below since some quirk in Amazon can't distinguish between these audiobooks for review purposes). Perhaps with the movie spurring a renewed interest in this classic story a better audio interpretation will become available.** Two stars for the BBC DRAMATIZATION of the Hobbit: A dismal rendering from start to finish.For those of you who own and enjoy the stellar Lord of the Rings dramatization with Ian Holm, Bill Nighy, etc., you will unquestionably be, as I was, astonishingly disappointed at this dramatization of The Hobbit. From the cheezy, tinny opening horns, to the horrible voice of Gandalf (sounds more like an effeminate villian in a 1920's melodrama), to the absence of some of the charming passages that made the book colorful (only adventuristic aspects seem to have been included), to the jumble of narrator vs. Bilbo vs. some other character speaking all at once or on top of one another, to the mispronunciation of character names (Thorin sounds like \\"tureen\\", and Gollum is \\"gol-oom\\"...huh?!), this adaptation is, as they say, \\"one hot mess\\" and best avoided, especially for those of you who expect it to be on par with the LOTR radio drama aforementioned."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" many years ago, as preparation to read \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Being of a linear bent, I prefer reading series books in the proper order. I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" then and, upon rereading it recently, I enjoyed just as much again. Seeing Bilbo reluctantly dragged from his comfortable hobbit hole into the adventure of a lifetime and seeing him rise to the occasion time and again was pure delight.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a magical book which resonates with overtones of mythology and folklore. Tolkien was a specialist in Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse materials--Beowulf, the sagas, and Eddic poetry were part of his professional stock in trade. Much of the atmosphere of his books comes from his use of these materials. Having studied a bit of Old Norse mythology since my first reading of \\"The Hobbit,\\" this time around I had a deeper appreciation of Tolkien's accomplishment.Unlike the LOTR trilogy, Tolkien originally wrote \\"The Hobbit\\" for children. This makes the book a little simpler thematically than the other books. However, Tolkien does deal with some very adult themes in spots and adds a touch of ambiguity to some of the characters as well. The aftereffects of the death of Smaug and the battles at the end of the book are cases in point. But whether you choose to read deeper meanings into the book or not, it remains a wonderful, enchanting read.One final word-this time around I listened to an audio version of the book. Not only did this make time spent driving much more enjoyable, but the narrator's singing made the songs come alive in ways that they hadn't before."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book for anybody who likes adventure stories. It tells how a hobbit who inharited his dads house. When some unexpected house guest arive ,and ask the hobbit to come on a journey.ecp"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are into wizards, goblins, trolls, dwarves, dragons, hobbits and adventure, then The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien may be just the type of book you are looking for. In better detail, if you didn't know, a hobbit is a little person. They are about half our size and have furry feet. They live in small hobbit holes and like to be left alone by people not of their own kind. The Hobbit is the exciting prelude to the award-winning triolgy The Lord of the Rings. The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's journey is quite different than that of a normal hobbit. He sets off on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a great wizard named Gandalf. They would travel all across the land, which was called Middle Earth, and fight trolls, dragons, and something called Gollum. The purpose of the journey is to regain the dwarves' stolen treasure. In some parts of this otherwise flawless book, Tolkien over desribes things. When there is no excitment in the story at a certain time, I found myself wanting to move on and skip pages. I do not think you should look this book over and not read it because it looks like something a geek would read. This however is not the case, because The Hobbit should be looked upon as a great work of art, not something that is simply tossed aside. The book will keep you wanting to read more the further you get into it. As you continue to find out about Bilbo's exciting adventure, you will find that you have a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first book to delve into the world popularized in The Lord of the Rings, in which the reader's focus is on hobbits, a race comprised of homebodies with large furry feet and a decided lack of ambition.Bilbo Baggins is one of the least adventurous of hobbits, and is less than pleased when Gandalf the Wizard appears and twists his arm into embarking on a quest with a gaggle of rambunctious dwarves. But embark he reluctantly does, and what follows is an adventure that is far more charming, if less epic, than the pomp-laden Rings trilogy.Tolkien presents his own twist on existing mythologies and fairy tales, giving us a game of riddling and presenting, for the first time, in-depth cultures that defined orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves and humans under a unifying concept that has lasted for well over a half-century (and counting).Okay, okay, so this book is important in the annals of fantasy. But is it a good read?Yes.Tolkien has taken all of this in-depth detail and hung it on a time-honored plot that will never get old. Bilbo is the unlikely, reluctant adventurer who finds within himself the capacity to be a hero, overcoming various obstacles to a climax involving a firebreathing dragon (the evil Smaug). Stories don't get any more exciting than this, and the details that are Tolkien's trademark add a layer of depth and texture that help to bring this world to life.If you are considering reading the Lord of the Rings because the movies made such a big splash, or have already started that trilogy but been turned off by the weightiness, I urge you to start with the Hobbit. It is clean, easy reading that really inspired everything that came after it. The trilogy is everything that a Tolkien fan could want, but The Hobbit is what makes Tolkien fans happen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitI read the Hobbit bt J.R.R. Tolkien.

Long ago in a mystical time of goblins and dragons.Some of the most impoutant ebents in the story were when the dwarves and the wizard came in to Bilbo's house and asked him to go on a adventure with them. also when the characters were going through the Misty Mountains they goy into some trouble with goblins, that is also when Bilbo got the ring from Gollum that saved his life so many times afterwards. Then they go to Beorn's cabin in the woods and stay there for a while he gives them supplies and they go on. They make it to the edge of Mirkwoodwere the wizard leaves them there to go on there own. They have troubles with spiders and elves while going through Mirkwood. Then they fimally get to Smaug and can't figure out how to kill him and get their treasure.

The amazing journey of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire who sets out on a quest to the Lonely Mountain.

A must for every home library!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I approached The Hobbit at the age of 25. Never having read anything by Tolkien and being recently uninspired by the overrated trilogy, I decided to read for myself--what's the big deal here?The Hobbit is not a comfort book for me. Since I didn't read it as a child, I don't have fond memories to draw me back. I can, however, somewhat empathize with those who do read and re-read this charming tale.The Hobbit takes the reader on a trip over wide landscapes, mostly from the perspective of a gentle nobody, Bilbo Baggins. Tolkien works hard to reveal characters as different types of people. Hobbits, Dwarves, Wizards, Dragons, Trolls, Goblins, Eagles, Wolves, Elves, Spiders, and Humans all represent some type of human condition. The young reader of The Hobbit will not realize that he or she is quite possibly being exposed to every type of person he or she will ever meet. Let us thank Tolkien.Tolkien gives the same breadth to the landscapes of adjacent but strange lands and the inhabitants therein. The land fits into Tolkien's environmentalist sensibility very pointedly. That is, this isn't a purely fantastical story--neither is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy--and that's what makes Tolkien's work so wonderful. Like C.S. Lewis--they were friends, in fact--Tolkien is able to pour morality, politics, philosophy, and spirituality into his works without mocking or tricking the reader.If you have not read The Hobbit, please do. You'll enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Garrett HansonMr. Fiske'sHonors EnglishThe Hobbit ReviewThe Hobbit was J.R.R. Tolkien's first claim to fame, but it is better known as the precursor to the famed Lord of the Rings series. It is a story of struggles, adventures, and unlikely heroes in a land called \\"Middle Earth\\".Hobbits do not like adventures, as the famed Bilbo Baggins once said of adventures, \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\" With the help of the far more important, but less noted wizard Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) does in fact set out upon an adventure with thirteen Dwarves to return to Lonely Mountain and regain their treasure, in so defeating the cruel dragon, Smaug.They out wit orcs and goblins, battle spiders and evade elves, Bilbo finds the Ring, yes the Ring, and out riddles the morose Gollum to keep it. They achieve many things, making many friends and even more enemies before reaching old Smaug and the Lonely Mountain, and still they know not what to do about it's treachery.The Hobbit was definitely not a stroke of genius, but a work of genius after years and years of writing lore on goblins, elves, dragons, dwarves, and such, such is all the great things you may have or may yet come to love in Tolkien's writing. The Hobbit however, is a first in Tolkiens lore, and The Hobbit was the first taste of Tolkien much of the world got. Although over shadowed my the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is important in understanding Middle Earth, and it does it in a fun way. It is something you could teach you kids to read with, while still enjoying it yourself.The Hobbit was originally intended to be a before bedtime kids book, and it sends a very potent message to it's intended victim...it doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, or how big you are, even the smallest can change the world. To more extent, hopefully we are, in the end, better off, but that is a matter of opinion, for greed is the bleeder of wealth, and happiness can be found in small things, even after big adventures. I did find Tolkien's style rather youthful and informative allowing me to see far in advance the come of events...nonetheless he did an excellent job in portraying the turn of events that was and is The Hobbit. His imagery and imagination are unrivalled, yes, even to those of us who saw the movie first. For those of you who don't like Old English, don't worry, it's hardly used in The Hobbit. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord of the Rings, or simple wants a good book to read to the young ones before the lights are turned out. Further more I expect you'll get hooked on Middle Earth, so I suggest finding a copy of the Lord of the Rings, because lets face it, for those of us with an imagination, the books are way better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a gorgeous book.

It was amazing&#8230;I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s a choice for the tween population mostly because at times it seemed a little childish for an adult, but at others I wouldn&#8217;t allow my six year old cousin to read it. If you are going to read this with your child you should know there are pitch-black scenes with goblins and trolls in scary caves, the dwarves and Bilbo get captured a couple times which included being whipped once, strung upside-down and almost cooked at one point, and even Gollum has a conversation with himself and decides whether or not he should eat Bilbo! Along with that there is a war that happens which can get gory at times, and a fight with some huge spiders and evil wolves.The ring in this book has such wild powers and to see a hobbit, a simple and small creature, show as much courage and bravery, along with all the action-packed scenes, fascinating imagery, magic and a bit of underlying comedy makes this a classic that anyone will enjoy.

The story does not end with the reclamation of Erebor, but I will avoid mentioning anything after to try not to spoil it too much!It is an epic tale written with younger readers in mind than The Lord of the Rings, but still full of the adventure and the true neither-completely-good-nor-completely-evil good vs. evil battles Tolkien is so great at writing.

Please dont take any offense to my opinion, for they are not directed to offend anyone else. Tolkien had an extremley strong beginning.Learning about Bilbo and all the dwarves really drew me into the story. I absolutely loved the detail the author put in all the characters. It really helped paint a picture for me to capture the essence of the story. As the story continued on, my excitement started to linger off. I wasn't as excited about the dwarves and Bilbo. I think those challenges they faced definitely could had a stronger build up to that point where the problem comes into effect.The one thing that upset me the most was the ending. Throughout the entire story the author talks about Bilbo facing the dragon alone. You can assume that something will happen to the dwarves that caused Bilbo to defeat Smaug single handed. The truth of the matter is, the dwarves sent Bilbo in alone because they were cowards and didn't want to do the dirty work. Then some random guy named Bard from the lake town ends up defeating Smaug and throws the whole story out of whack. The dwarves are clueless for a long time about the death of Smaug, and the switch of tenses can definitely end up confusing the reader.All in the entire of the story as a whole fits the fantasy genre. There are high and low points but the journey the characters face, and the overall moral of the story will leave a lasting impression on me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Being among the last people in America to read this book, as I well may be, makes this a rather difficult book to judge, particularly since it is already recognized as a classic and has been published in many, including collector, editions. Add to that the fact that, with such a long and exalted history and with so many previous reviews, it is readily apparent that nobody really cares, nor should they care, what I may think of this book. Nevertheless: I read it. So, like Bilbo Baggins, I must persist.Let me begin by saying that I have never read, nor do I ever expect to read, another tome by an author with such a fertile and expansive imagination. The depth and detail of his prose is truly astonishing. Using his imagination, he has woven an intricate mythical tale of trials, tribulations, despair, fear, struggle, and ultimate success such that one would almost believe that the author, himself, must surely have been there and experienced the scenes which he portrays.What struck me most about the book, however, was that the author's creativity allowed him to take so many well known characters from mythology -- trolls, elves, dwarves, goblins, etc. -- and weave them into a cohesive story with no loose ends sticking out, but he always did it with an unexpected twist. The golden ring which allowed Bilbo Baggins to disappear at will is a good example. Strangely enough, Baggins could not be seen at night, but, while still invisible during daylight, he had to be careful because his shadow could still be seen. The trolls are another: fearsome at night or in the dark but turned to stone if touched by sunlight. The author's ability to empathize with his characters also seems uncanny. The dreaded Gollum, for example, who lived for so long in absolute blackness and solitude that he became two distinct personalities and spoke to and answer himself in riddles. The final twists came at the end when quite unexpectedly, after all their struggles, Baggins and his companions didn't even get to do battle with the fearsome dragon they had come so far to slay. And the coup de grace came with the unexpected events at Baggins homecoming, which also seemed quite fitting and brought a chuckle or two.Needless to say: I was well impressed with this book and would recommend it, especially to younger readers. (My daughter says that she was tasked to read it in the fifth or sixth grade.) To me this is the ultimate in creative writing and always with an added twist."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Doug Anderson does a wonderful job fleshing out background information,explaining Tolkien's mythology, presenting a wide range of art works and much more in a format that is easy to read and easy to use. Reading all in this book will make anyone a minor Tolkien scholar. And the story of The Hobbit is a wonderful tale that should be read and shared not only with children but with all adults. This book is a must for any household."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was so pleased with this book. It was a gift for my husband and he was thrilled with it. The quality is excellent and the cover is beautiful. Fantastic price for this product. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ah. I finally received the chance to read Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit. I was thoroughly delighted by this tale. Mr Tolkien is masterful at placing you within the story. At some points you can feel the dread as they walk through the forest. And the delight when Bilbo and Gandalf are reunited.The collectors edition was put together nicely. Albeit, it would have been better if a ribbon was attached to mark the pages in the book as you read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased this book as a gift, and while it is nice, the pictures of it are slightly deceiving. The marbled pages are more like blue dots, and the illustrations in the book are comic-like.However, the recepient was still pleased with it and for the price, it's a pretty good deal."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Completely unabridged, the narrator is the same as for the lord of the rings unabridged audio. Alas, he does not narrate the Silmmarillion, whose narrator leaves a lot to be desired for. Get this adaptation today!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, a novel by J.R.R.Tolkien, is based upon, surprisingly enough, a hobbit, named Mr.Baggins. Throughout this book, Mr.Baggins undergoes many adventures, accompanied by thirteen dwarves and, for some of the way, a wizard. His companions and himself are heading towards a mountain of gold, with a dragon waiting at the end. When finally reaching their destination, they do not know exactly what they will find. Mr. Baggins uses his magical ring, which makes him invisible, to investigate on what they are up against. Well, things are easier said than done. Actually killing the dragon was completely out of their league, so they hid and waited for the right moment. When they couldn't stand hiding any longer, they came out, expecting to be burned by the dragon's flames. To their pleasant surprise, they found that the dragon had been killed by townspeople the night before. Thinking that left the gold to them, they celebrated. Around a week later though, they went into war to claim the riches all to themselves. Winning the war didn't do too much, since they had to spare part of the gold to their alliances. When the adventure of his lifetime was drawn to an end, Mr.Baggin headed back to the center of his motivation, home sweet home. A year had passed since he had left his hobbit hole, and he could have wished for nothing more than to be back in his cozy little home."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this was one of the most boring books i have ever read. i finished reading the book because i had to ( i was going to have a test on it). i still failed the test b/c i hated the book so much. i could not get into the novel and the characters just bored me to death. there was no point and i dont see what is so great about the novel"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This has to be the absolute WORST piece of &quot;literature&quot; I have ever read. I really like to read, but this is awful! The paragraphs are too long with no main sentence with a few detail sentences. They are 20-30 sentences long that are so boring it reminded me of the sweet relief that death would bring! So I repeat: If you can, don't read this novel!:-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo!:-(&quot;BOO FOR YOU HOBBIT!&quot;&quot;DIE HOBBITS, DIE!&quot;&quot;DEATH TO HOBBITS!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit, a creature unlike anything in our world. He is small and furry but acts quite human. He lives in a little house in the side of a hill and he treasures his home, his quiet, his regular meals, and his boring life. Then one day an ancient magician, Gandalf, appears at his door. He starts Bilbo on a fantastic adventure.This adventure mainly has to do with a group of dwarves who used to live in a fantastic kingdom underneath a huge mountain far away, where they would mine for gold and precious gems and turn them into lovely works of art. At the height of their power, a dragon swooped in, killed the dwarves inside of the mountain, scattered the rest, and took up residence inside the mountain, hoarding all of the gold and gems for itself.One of the dwarves who shows up on Bilbo's doorstep after Gandalf's visit is the grandson of the king under the mountain. He is determined to get his rightful kingdom back, by journeying to the mountain and getting rid of the dragon.Gandalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is a brilliant burglar and will make an excellent addition to their traveling company, and the dwarves bring the timid creature along with some reluctance. Over the course of their long journey, though, as the mountain gets closer and the dangers get worse, the company learns to respect Bilbo more, and he learns what he is truly capable of achieving.This story contains lots of plot twists and dangerous situations. I can also appreciate that much of today's fantasy has built off of what Tolkien wrote. However, I hated the story. I found it mind-numbingly dull. There was little character development, especially in the dwarves. They had no individual personalities, which made me unconcerned for their well-being. I thought Bilbo was one of the most irritatingly weak and whiny characters in all of literature, which made me even less concerned about this story having a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I borrowed this book from the library as an audiobook, read by Rob Inglis, 10 CD disks. Unabridged by \\"Recorded Books Presents\\".I have seen (and liked) the Lord of the Rings Movies, but I have never read any of the books. I heard that the Hobbit movie was coming out soon, so I thought it would be a good idea to read the book now, before the movie comes out. Apart from the movies, I didn't know anything about this story. It was definitely all-new to me.When I first started listening to it I said \\"Oh GAWD, is he really going to sing and recite poetry for 5 minutes straight\\"? Really, I wasn't sure why there was this need for singing and poetry, and it was boring, and felt endless, and it didn't really progress the story along. The story itself was a bit slow. The narrator was talking about how EVERY character was feeling and I remember asking myself \\"is that really necessary?\\" Why go into so much detail? Really. It started out quite dull.Then as it went along it started getting better. Once I realized that every creature and animal in the story could talk, including spiders and eagles. I also realized that this was a children's story. A really sophisticated, long, serious children's story, but it's definitely easy enough for 10 and 11 year old kids to understand. Plus, there is a certain amount of silliness, and strange word use (I kept asking \\"is this a REAL word?\\" even though I never looked them up), so I think kids will like it.There is also a lot of talk about FOOD - whether they are hungry, and want to be home with the hot teapot or a creature is planning to eat them - it seems like any animal can eat you and you can eat it. I thought that was strange, because ,I wouldn't want a spider to eat me, (not that it could, but still). It was strange that anyone could be PREY to anyone else, but oh well, that was part of the imagination of the story.Once their quest really got going, it wasn't so bad. They go through many lands and much turmoil to get to the end of their quest. It seems like they're always ALMOST killed (and/or eaten), but thankfully, luck helps them escape. Plus, it's in this story that Bilbo the hobbit finds the magic ring of invisibility, even though Sauron doesn't come looking for it.I think it helped to have watched the movies first because it really helped me see the characters of the dwarfs, the elves, the men, and of course the hobbits.I do like that the story doesn't end at the mountain (if you read it you'll know what I mean), but that the authors tells you what happens 5 days after, a few weeks after, and almost a year (or many years) after. It's nice to see that after all that hard work and danger and struggle, there is peace after all. It gives a good ending to the story.One of the things Tolkein does that I don't remember seeing in other children's books, is he talks directly to the audience, almost through the voice of the reader. For example, \\"And then, well, I'll tell you what will happen next, but right now we have to go back to _______ 's story.\\" So if a parent was reading this story to their child, it sounds like the PARENT is saying that they'll have to stop.Inglis did a good job reading the story. He did many of the accents, and they were quite different, and I think he did them well. He also actually SANG all the songs in the story, and for a narrator to do that, I think he should get bonus points!Would I recommend this book? Sure, just to a younger audience, one that has patience to get through it. It's not a short book. It took me a week and a half to listen to it, so I think it will take at least 2 or 3 weeks to read through on your own. But I think they'll like it.For adults, it's okay, not quite there, but not terrible.Am I glad I read this before the movie came out? Sure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have never actually read the book but I will be reading it later this year. My sister told me that it is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is confusing and pointless.

I thought I would be able to at least get to The Fellowship of the Ring so I could try to go see the movie this Christmas break (I'm a pretty fast reader for a fourteen year old girl). However I'm just reaching page 250 in this book and though everyone promised me it would get interesting I'm still waiting.I find Bilbo an interesting character but quite frankly he didn't pull at me like characters such as Harry Potter and Novalee Nation. And Gandalf annoyed me more than I can express. Though I'm not finished with the book, I must say I hope that The Fellowship of the Ring is plenty better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is definently the absolute worst book I have ever read!

Tolkien himselfs said that he despises allegory. Neither is this a book a simple children's book. It fits nicely in between these two..not so complicated that you'd need to go over it again and again to discover some reflection of humanity...and not so simple that you feel you are reading a childrens book. The Hobbit is a fantastic read...for entertainment only...for the more in depth reading try the long but great Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of the best fantasy book ever written in earth. The book pulled on me for several times. I read this book in less than 12 hours. Mr. Tolkien was probably in a mystical mood when he wrote this exciting book. Kids will definitely enjoy this book more than anything else."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a lovely, charming little book. It is quick paced and very entertaining, a pleasurable respite from the often bogged down with hidden meanings of what too frequently passes for literature. I'm not trying to denegrate some high-class piece of thought-provoking insight, some Don DeLillo, some Thomas Pynchon, some William Gaddis, et. al. But how often have you picked up a book and become absorbed with a story, with what's going to actually happen next without the instrusion of some pretentious, philosophical meandering? It is a break for the serious-minded high art fan, a great read to the lowly John Grisham afficinado. All in all, a wonderful passage of time, transported to a magical place almost too real for the span of time you are being a voyuer, watching and waiting some never was characters fight never was creatures in a fundamentally never was land in this imaginative terrain that you have to believe in for such a short period of time. Going on to the massive sequal, The Lord of the Rings, you are even further left in awe of the thought and sheer imaginative brilliance Mr. Tolkien put into his life's work to create, with such immaculate detail, a new mythology for all the world to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For those of you reading comments on this book I can assure that it is one of the greatest fiction works of all time and that anybody who says anything different is truly a moronic idiot and merely a waste of precious DNA."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'd like to get this straight right off the bat.....this 'Annotated' version of the Hobbit is for readers who are already hooked on Tolkein. First time readers would be better served to get one of the non-annotated ones and familiarze themselves with Tolkeins world. Oh! And read 'The Lord of the Rings' as well before you attempt reading 'The annotated Hobbit'.I have read a lot of annotated books over the years and I have to say that this one is one of the most seamlessly done. Understandably, as you try to read the comments you lose some of the continuity of the text, but they are usually so informative that you gain more than you lose by reading them. Some of the notes are written for the more scholarly inclined, some are just plain amusing.A great bonus is the collection of illustrations from all over the world....giving an insight as to how different cultures see the same objects. That was the beauty of the old books...you had to imagine the scenes. That beauty is forever sullied now as everyone is going to see Tolkein's characters as they appear in the (very bad) movie adaptations of the 'Lord of the Rings'.All in all, if you already have a version of the 'Hobbit', buy this book. It is one of those books that will reward repeated readings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins, one of the small, fat persons called hobbits, is just minding his buisness one day when 14 dwarves arrive for breakfast! Little did Bilbo know what was in store for him. Soon Bilbo was away on a weird adventure, the story in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.I liked this book because it had great characters which were described with great detail. You can see the great detail in this excerpt: &quot; They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves... They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colors (chiefly green and yellow)&quot;. I liked the fact that the author described his characters with great detail. It makes the story able to come alive in your head, which helps me to understand it and be &quot;drawn in&quot; to the book.I also liked that there was an incredible amount of adventure. You can see adventure in this excerpt: &quot; It is almost dark so that its vastness can be only dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of Smaug!&quot;. The adventure also makes you become &quot;drawn into&quot; the book. It makes this book a real page-turner. It also explains the characters a little bit more by how they react to situations that have high-pressure.Although this book has excellent description, I was sometimes frustrated by the lack of suspense, especially in the beginning. You can see a little bit of dullness in this excerpt: &quot;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous,&quot;. The beginning makes you want to throw the book down and never pick it up again. I almost did that myself. But I suggest trying to read on. It gets very much better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I always think of The Hobbit as the forgotton classic, as it very much lives in the shadow of Lord of the Rings. Yet The Hobbit deserves almost as much praise as that most incredible of adventures. Not only that but it is vital that The Hobbit is read prior to tackling Lord of the Rings, as it is really the first book of four not the pre-cursor to the trilogy.Having said that though, it is also improtant to note that The Hobbit does have a very different feel to it when compared to Lord of the Rings. This tale is far more light-hearted and filled more with boyhood dreams of adventure. Lord of the Rings on the other hand is a story of war that centres around the ring of power owned now by the Baggins'.The Hobbit is a must read for any Fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition.

I absolutely loved this book and kept flying through the pages eager to be swept up in the little Hobbit's next adventure.

Humor is very visible in this book, so if you like humor, and if you like fantasy, read The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you haven't already, READ THIS BOOK! Tolkien is the all time master of all fantasy--he basically created the whole genre! If you read the hobbit, you'll know why. The storyline is fantastic, the details are descriptive and imaginitive, and on whole, it's a fabulous book, even if you're not a fantasy fan. The only thing that I can suggest is that you read the Hobbit before picking up Tolkien's other works (namely, LoR or the Silmarillion). If you'd like to get a bit more background on the world of Middle Earth, though, I suggest that you read the Silmarillion. Fair warning, the Silmarillion is MUCH harder to read than LoR or the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot;&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a book of adventure.

There are 13 dwarves, and a Wizard. They are trying to kill a dragon and get the stolen money from the dragon and give it to the owners. Bilbo has to fight goblin's, troll's, and on the way he finds a magic ring that makes him invisible when he puts it on.I like the Hobbit because the ring is so cool, and the book is so exciting when he's talking to a slimy character named Gollum while he risks his life in a riddle competition. The book is so exciting!You should read this book!Warning: The first two chapters are boring but at chapter three the adventure begins!

Afterward, our son wrote the following essay:Since The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was offered as an option for our family book club, I've been asking for it each month. In August, my pleas were granted, and we started the book well before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrives in theaters.A quick summary of \\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings\\": The comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins smokes his pipe, relaxes in his easy chair, watches the stars. He leads a peaceful life until Gandalf, an old white wizard, comes along and changes it forever. In spite of his Tookish ancestors, Mr. Baggins is a \\"lazy\\" hobbit who doesn't want adventures: \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.\\" (p. 4) Of course, then, he is quite suprised when he is called to serve as a professional burglar for a band of thirteen dwarves. Later, he's even called upon to kill Smaug, a dragon with a diabolical appearance and a mammoth appetite. Of the thirteen dwarves, Thorin is the most eager to see Smaug die, for a few of the villages Smaug has destroyed were part of the kingdom of Thorin's fathers and forefathers, making Thorin the King Under the Mountain - not Smuag! With no choice but to join them, the hobbit has no idea of the dangers he must face to reach his goal, no idea how to kill a dragon (let alone a dragon who has been the glorious victor of who knows how many battles).My favorite part of their adventure takes place in the Elvenking's palace, when Bilbo is devising a plan to save the dwarves. He decides to put them all in barrels to be rafted off with the other empty barrels sent to \\"the Long Lake... a town of Men still throve there.\\" This plan gets them out of the castle without being seen. But, as Tolkien points out, \\"It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well as him yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there any one to pack him in, even if there had been a chance!\\" (p.182)The mastermind of this journey, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) were friends, colleagues, and masters of fantasy. We can see the influence of the Chronicles on the many series written for younger readers today. Tolkien's influence can be seen in series that appeal to more advanced readers; The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are the \\"granddaddy\\" of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.In The Hobbit, Tolkien relies on the power of the mythological \\"hero's journey.\\" Bilbo has a lot in common with Odysseus of Homer's Odyssey (perhaps the original hero) and Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars epic, a hero whose story was told four decades after Bilbo's. Hero stories teach us about our own potential. Heroes are called to journey and adventure for their heart's desire (Bilbo and Odysseus both want to return home, for example), but they must fight evil and learn about themselves before they can achieve their goals. Each of the heroes I mentioned are guided by mentors or wise guides: Odysseus by Athene, Luke by Obi-Won, and Bilbo by Gandalf. They each benefit from a magical talisman or sacred object: Odysseus has his magical bow and quiver of arrows and assorted amulets Athene and others provide during his twenty-year journey home; Luke Skywalker wields his father's lightsaber; and Bilbo has Sting, a short sword made by Elves, and the invisibility ring. In each of their stories, the hero must enter the \\"underworld,\\" a classic mythological detail. They are also encounter ugly, horrible beasts on land and in water, adding chilling action and, in some cases, humor to the stories. The heroes also, I might add, eventually achieve their goals.The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection. I look forward to more of the same exciting and enchanting elements that made The Hobbit so memorable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"On of the greatest books I have ever read was The Hobbit by J.R.R. Talkie. It takes you on an amazing journey through a fantasy world of mythical creatures and such. It is the prequel to the more famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. It has been around for more than 30 years and is still considered a work of greatness.In this book you go on an adventure with the main character Bilbo Baggins. He is a hobbit who lives in a hole by himself. He goes on a journey with a wizard named Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. He travels many miles to find gold to steal from a dragon named Smaug. Along his way he finds a ring with magical powers that is very powerful. This ring chances his life for ever and helps him steal the gold from the dragon. The Dwarves want to get there home land back from the dragon. He later returns to his hobbit hole very wealthy and a different person from when he left. The Ring in which he holds is very important for the survival of the hobbits. I felt that this book really held your interest with the amazing things it had. The most amazing thing is that Bilbo Baggins is only a hobbit who is able to steal the gold from the Dragon. This book sets up the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is very important. It is a book in which anyone from any age group can enjoy.Basically this book is suitable for anybody who enjoys fantasy and also enjoyed Lord of the Rings. If you were confused reading Lord of the Rings, you should try reading The Hobbit which explains the main story of what happened before. Many professional book reviews except this piece of literature as one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever heard of a hobbit? A hobbit is a small wooly footed creature. They don't wear shoes because they have thick soles that form on the bottom of their feet. They have curly brown hair like the stuff on their feet. Some people call them hole dwellers because they live in holes.Now that you have learned what a hobbit is, I shall tell you about one particular hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. This hobbit lives in a place called Hobbiton or the Shire if you like. Anyway, this hobbit is about to go on an adventure with thirteen dwarves and one wizard named Gandalf. The dwarves are trying to get their gold back from an evil dragon named Smaug. Will they succeed? I'll tell you one thing, this is one adventure that will change this hobbits life forever.I love this book. I have read it over and over again and I still can't get enough. It has so much action, adventure, and it's hilarious. You will adore this book and want to read it over and over again. I would think that older kids might enjoy this book more than younger kids. For instance five year olds; or two year olds would not understand it very well. But older kids like nine or older would most definitely love this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is amazing. I love the depth of the details it offers, plus all the photos and illustrations... It gives a very interesting and deep perspective of the Hobbit's/Tolkien's world.However, all that extra info kinda gets in the way if you are reading the story and want to get lost in it.Really something you do not want when reading it for the first time.Highly recommended if you want to go deeper though :)For the rest of you, I would recommend the 70th Anniversary Edition [Hardcover]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Did you have to read the Hobbit when you were in school? There is so much to this story that is missed when you first read it for plot, which is typically what is done when you read something for your High School English class. This time, enjoy a slower pace and drink in the awesome details and background to one of the jewls of the English language literature. The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories. This particular edition contains illustrations and passages, which are later linked to the Lord of the Rings. The illustrations are Tolkien's own and I was delighted when I watched the movie and found them come to life in the big screen. Have fun rediscovering the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose this rating because of the thrilling adventure and the endingWith Bilbo sitting in his living room and Gandolf smoking tobacco"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's world. The vibrancy, the realistic character portrayal, the in depth descriptions and the sheer imagination and fortitude it took to concoct these imaginary lands is astounding. Whether you appreciate the fantasy genre or not, this classic book series is in a class by itself. This is one of those rare books - like the Harry Potter novels - that one can read over and over and never get bored of. It can take a bit of time to get used to the &#34;Middle English&#34; language (read: much like old English) however, once you get used to it is becomes smooth sailing. The plot is engaging and you find yourself caring about the characters very easily. Tolkien was a true master of the story telling art. The Audible reading (by Inglis) is really a treat as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was disappointing to me what the movie producers did to this book! The movie would have been great without all the extra fighting and computer imagery they added. Granted, The Hobbit would NEED computer imagery, however they went over the top to make it exciting.

Immediately upon finishing The Hobbit, I re-read The Fellowship of the Ring, again, and it suddenly opened up for me. I found myself laughing at events, phrases, etc. that I missed entirely before.The Hobbit is well worth reading, even if have already read the series (though I would recommend first-timers to read this first), because you'll just get so much more out of the series.Moreover, for those who have only seen the films, READ THE BOOKS! I'm serious. The films are great fun, but the books are real, intense, go deeper, and just carry you away from your daily life into Middle Earth. Don't you just love escapism? I do! Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Gandolf, a wizard, and thirteen dwarves ask him to accompany them on their journey to regain their mountain and treasure. A dragon named Smaug had stolen thier mouintain home and their glorions treasure.They traveled to the misty mountains and were captured by goblins and three days later they escaped. Then they journeyed to Mirkwood forest and made their way through after many adventures. From there they traveled to their last stop, Smaug's mountain.Bilbo finds the dragon sleeping and steals a cup to prove that he was there. Smaug finds the missing cup and was furious. He assumed that the town nearby, Lake Town, was guilty and flew off to take revenge. The dwarves and Bilbo take advantage of the empty mountain and go inside and explore. At Lake town the dragon is killed and the treasure is free to take. There is a war because everyone wants some. The dwarves win and Bilbo takes a share of the treasure home.I would reccomend this book for all ages. It has a beautiful and exciting plot that keeps you on your toes. It is full of suprises and the characters variety of personality keeps you interested interested."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is so capturing and pulls you in. I think it should be required for students to read before they enter high school. So many times our schools don't enforce the importance of reading. Your brain soaks up literature and it also helps to improve your vocabulary. That would make this book the perfect example. And it not's a complicating book. It's full of adventure and excitement but also provokes thought. I think that everyone should have a acquaintance with J.R.R. Tolkien's work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is truely a work of art. I have only had such fun in reading a book in a select few other occasions. It is my favorite of Tolkien's works and that is saying a lot. It is an adventure beyond the magical as it shows the power of wit and inner strength. Being called the precurser to the Lord of the Rings does not do it justice. It is simply the most universally enjoyable story that I have ever read. I do not remember ever laughing so hard from a book. It brought a boundless smile to my face. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a magical tale of hobbits, elves, dwarves, magicians, and many other amazing characters. This book is wonderfully well written by one of the best writers of all time. JRR Tolkien makes you feel as if you are in the story watching the characters' journey and experiencing it with them. It is a fabulous book of tales of wonder and courage. Tolkien really makes you understand the characters and their feelings. It is a fantastic tale for anyone who enjoys a well written and inspiring story.The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock rate up there with Tolkein and George R. R.

It has great humor and an incredible theme: anyone can make a difference if they put their mind to it. A lovely book for all ages and all readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a very exciting book. It had wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copycats. The story brings the characters to life with very descriptive words. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters.Gandalf, the wizard, is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and clever and can solve just about any problem with his magic or his wits. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with a lot of the different characters you meet throughout the novel. He has many friends of all races (which is unusal for the story) such as dwarves, hobbits, elves and even special magic friends that can be more than one species of animalsThis is very interesting book. It is fun and exciting and paints wonderful adventures in my head. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books. If J.R.R Tolkien's other books are as exciting and interesting as this one I think he should be considered one of the best authors of our time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is my favorite book so far. I read so many and this is my favorite. This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo and his friends. You must read this. I seriously could not put this book down.

NO LIE!If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, and home again, and can take an interble hero(blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck) here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler...In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way(as he did)-if you do not already know all about these things-much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves get some glimpes into the history and politics of a neglected but impotant period!When i was reading this book it was like a movie and if i stopped reading i missed the whole movie. A++++++++++++++ Book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently re-read THE HOBBIT for the first time in many, many years. I liked it much more as an adult, and especially after reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a saga, while THE HOBBIT is a fairy tale. As such, it is lighter, funnier, and faster-paced than the trilogy. These qualities make it more entertaining and enjoyable.Unlike THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which plods along and contains many chapters where essentially nothing happens, THE HOBBIT contains action in every chapter. A new monster is introduced in each chapter, and something is always happening. The book holds together remarkably well, and contains an arc that ties everything together.The only drawback with THE HOBBIT is shared with all Tolkien that I've read. I think of it as the \\"Eagles Fly Out of the Sky\\" problem. Whenever Tolkien gets his heroes in a particularly tough fix, rather than having them use their wits to escape, he has eagles fly out of the sky and save them, or some other happenstance that is beyond the protagonists' control. The eagles swoop to the rescue twice. This is more than compensated by Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, but even that encounter ends by Bilbo inadvertently asking an unanswerable riddle. While I enjoyed THE HOBBIT enough to think that someday I'll read it a third time, I struggle with the message here and with the rest of the Middle Earth saga - do wits matter? Do things just happen? Should wen go with the flow? Or should wen just marvel at the fantasy?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an account of the amazing adventure of Bilbo Baggins. He leaves his lovely hole in the shire, under the guidance of Gandalf the wizard, and a dozen rough and tough dwarves. Although Bilbo is a bit out of place amongst the group, he turns out to be a both an important ally and wonderful friend. This tale will pull you and never let go of you. And it sets the stage for the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings serious. It gives the backround tale of how the ring came into the hands of our little hobbit heroes and introduces the characters that follow you through the Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone with a heart for adventure and a taste for fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an exciting book of magical lands with the theme of good vs. evil.

I also liked the originality. Other books just copy some clay mold for a \\"good\\" book. Finally, I liked the characters. Did Tolkien invent the \\"hobbits\\"?The best part of this book is where the main charcter meets a creature named \\"gollum\\" and steals his magic ring. It was very suprising and very original. The description of the area just puts a picture in my head.One element I like best about this story is the characters. Even though there were about 15 characters, Tolkien gave each of them a personality. I also liked the resolution. It was close to real life because there were happy parts and tragic parts."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think this is the best book Tolkien has ever written.

This would seem like a typical fantasy-adventure storyline, if it weren't for the fact that this \\"hero\\" were no more than three feet tall and had no experience in the ways of battle whatsoever. This is the story of The Hobbit by JRR Tolkein, and is the prelude to the famous Lord of the Rings novels. In this novel, Tolkein proves that anyone can accomplish a goal, regardless of his or her physical abilities.The story starts out very peaceful as the reader is introduced to the main character: Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a \\"Hobbit\\", which is a creature like a human but much shorter and with twice the appetite. He goes on with his life normally, until one day a wizard named Gandalf shows up at his door, and Bilbo embarks on the adventure of his lifetime (which is longer than a man's). Bilbo must travel with Gandalf and a group of dwarves to a mountain far away where a dragon called Smaug lies with an unimaginable fortune of treasure. The treasure originally belonged to the dwarves, but the dragon drove them away and claimed it for itself. Bilbo himself cannot see why he was chosen for this journey since he has never seen a battle in his life. However, he will soon learn that they chose him for a different reason. It would take an awfully small and clever creature to sneak past a dragon!One of the many exciting incidences in the novel is when giant trolls capture Bilbo and the dwarves. They are all tied up in sacks and desperately trying to find a way of getting out while the trolls decide how they should kill them. It seems hopeless for the courageous company before Gandalf shows up and rescues them. As the trolls are deciding how they will kill their catch, Gandalf hides in a bush behind them and starts to talk in on the trolls's conversation and causes them to quarrel. The trolls lose track of time arguing with each other, the sun rises, and they turn to stone. That is what happens when they come in contact with sunlight.Tolkein magnificently blends exciting adventure and action along with a climatic ending that will take you by surprise, and immerses you into a world that will not be able to come out of until you have read the very last word! This story is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien you know few things compare. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's writing.

No modern writers even come close (perhaps Robert Stanek but that's different). Read this, you are going to love it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I only recently (Today in fact) recieved this book, and I had no doubts in my mind as to whether it was worth the expense to have it shipped here (I am located in the republic Ireland). I could have simply gone to my local Easons (pretty much *the* only bookstore, of note, in Ireland) and picked up one of the many (and I'm talking millions here) paperback editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" (or The Lord of the Rings, as I bought both leatherette editions), but instead I chose the leatherette edition, and I'm not sorry, not in the least!I'll start by describing the 'externals' (or asthestics) of the book: Let me first say, dont be fooled into believing this is some 'form' of leather that the book is bound in, it is, in fact (or at least appears to be), a form of plastic. Saying this, however, it does not cheapen the book, I'm saying merely to clarify. This 'plastic' is actually made to look 100% like real leather, if only for the feel, you would be fooled into thinking it was leather (leather is less resitant, scratches more easily and is softer under-hand). I personally dont mind, the book is most beautifully crafted with 'simulation' gold gild (more than likely its a gold ink or paint).The pages themselves are of good, rather great -quality, not cheap 'bright-white' 'mass market' pages, but rather a subtle shade of mild yellow, not to mention the pages being almost twice as thick as paperback editions (if not, in fact thicker), which makes for a much more comfortable read. I have only one 'gripe' or 'probleme' with this book, and that is that the text that is printed on the pages seems to be at an angle (rather than being 90deg to the pages edge, the text seems to be off by about 3-5 degrees). This is only a slight annoyance, and I am not totally convinced that it is either an error while printing nor that all copies have the same 'condition'; I personally dont mind too much, but for the 'perfectionistic reader' it can be quite distracting, but to be honest that is the fault of the reader rather than the book's.Finally (and perhaps most importantly?),The book comes with a 'container' wich is, also, bound with 'leatherette', they both complement each other and the cover is a perfect protector against the day to day 'wear n tear' of life.Personally, I cant put the book down. I'm three chapters through and cant find fault in the book. All of this goes for the \\"Lord of the rings - Leatherette edition\\" just as much as for \\"The Hobbit - Leatherette edition\\".This book is a must for all!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My introduction to the world of Middle-Earth happened last year. I was never very enthusiastic about the world created by Tolkien, but when I finally read Lord of The Rings (which I'm actually still reading: I'm in the beginning of RotK) and The Hobbit last year, in 8th grade, I could''t be more impressed, and I'm an official Fantasy geek (and I mean this in a friendly way).The Hobbit is a fairy-tale like adventure, easy to read and told in a much less accurate and serious way than LoTR, one of the greatest Fantasy tales ever published. But don't take this book as a work of less importance, because though it is not as epic as LoTR, The Hobbit is a excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of Middle Earth, or as a separate tale. The book shows Tolkien doing what he seems to do best: it's an aventure full of carachter development, with both sad and lighter, even comic moments. Though this book isn't a epic war tale, it's a great and easy read, reccomended for everibody."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are reading this you probably already know that a hobbit is a really fascinating epic story and the prequel of the lord of the rings.

But the comic/graphic novel version is different enough to warrant it's own review pool.I bought this expecting to love reliving the Hobbit in a visual format. But that didn't happen. This adaption is just flat and missing so much of the magic Tolkien created. I suppose that's a given when you replace so much of his expertly crafted words with pictures.If nothing else, read the standard version of the Hobbit first before trying this. Reading this first will just spoil what a great book the Hobbit is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in sixth grade, my teacher told me of a book called The Hobbit. At once, I knew I'd hate that book! Who'd want to read about a midget who lives in a dirty hole? When I was in ninth grade, I decided to read it anyway. I discovered how wrong I was about hobbits! Hobbits are people just like you and me, only they're plumper and about two to four feet tall. Most have curly brown hair on their heads, and on the leathery soles of their feet to match! They live in the Shire, which is in Middle Earth, in little tunnels (which DON'T slope down, merely just go right into the heart of their hill) all panneled and decorated to look cozy and inviting. Their town is a very pretty place full of flowers and rolling green hills. Bilbo Baggins, a fairly young hobbit, is strangely greeted by Gandalf, an old wizard clad in blue-ish grey and a whole bunch of dwarves! Unexpectedly, Bilbo joins them on a journey to steal the gold back from the dragon who sits on the Lonely Mountain far, far away rich with all the dwarve's gold and jewels. But it is a long, perilous road they must take. They meet elves, trolls, goblins, and many other unlikely creatures along the way. You feel like you're one among them. Just imagine: You're captured by a tall, gruff troll in the middle of the night and stuffed into a dirty, smelly sack with twelve others and listen to the trolls quarrels of whether they should roast or mince you after they squash you . . ."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am usually an avid reader, and I love most books.

It is a great book and reading it on my kindle was very convenient. I just needed to remember to add the bookmark when I was finished reading for the day..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, but also acts as a great predecessor to the acclaimed trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The story begins with the introduction of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys his quiet life in Bag-End, but has his routine disturbed when his friend Gandalf decides that he needs a change. The poor hobbit soon finds his home filled with a party of dwarves and himself the thief of an expedition to reclaim stolen treasure from the terrible dragon, Smaug.The quest is very exciting, with several satisfying detours that foreshadow larger troubles brewing in Middle Earth. The environments and battles are all vividly described, making it easy for the reader to imagine that they are actually part of the fantastic band of adventurers. Because each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, there is lots of motivation to keep turning the pages, but even if a reader does take an extended break, they are never at a loss for what is happening.*MINOR SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH*The only shortcoming of the novel is that although the theme that even little people can end up doing important things, Bilbo does nothing in the final, climactic battle of the book (The Battle of Five Armies) other than run and hide, despite having strong allies, a powerful weapon, and some new tricks up his sleeve. While this is understandable, considering how small he is, it goes against the stronger, more clever character that he became over the duration of the book.*END OF SPOILERS*In conclusion, you should definitely pick up this book if you haven't already, especially to read the foundation of the upcoming movie. Despite the minor shortcoming mentioned earlier, the adventure is very absorbing and the situations the characters manage to get themselves into and out of are unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved The Hobbit with all of Bilbos adventures!!!!

There are appendixes with A Chronology of the First Age, Genealogical Tables, and Conversion of page references to Houghton Mifflin Editions.Some may think this guide is geared towards those that already have a basic knowledge of Middle earth. But upon exam one finds it is like any other dictionary those with a large vocabulary may need an occasional glance; while others may have to look up the words that explain the words.I find it indispensable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Let's face it -- there is nothing that can be written about the actual story of \\"The Hobbit\\" that has not been written about a bazillion times before. Much more accessible than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien's delightful tale of Bilbo Baggins' adventures will delight you, dear reader, no matter what your age. Enough said about that.What I will opine about is this edition. I had this when I was a youngster but over the years the book disappeared. I always swore that some day I would get another copy and now that I have, I remember why I loved it so much. This hardbound copy comes handsomely detailed on the cover with elvish runes (you can even find out in the book what they mean!) The illustrations and maps inside are lively and add to the reader's enjoyment. The paper quality and the binding are decent, but nothing to write home about. Still, my 8-year old has started reading the book and it hasn't fallen apart yet, so it seems pretty well made.The bottom line is that I have read other editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- several -- and I prefer this one over all others. Some stories just deserve a substantial feel that paperbacks cannot convey. It's a matter of permanency, and certain works like \\"The Hobbit\\" will remain after many others have faded. This edition just feels good in your hands and really does justice to the story and its author."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The character voices performed by Rob Inglis were spectacular and helped to keep my interest. Be prepared for several sometimes-lengthy, mildly-operatic songs. These discs have made my work commute enjoyable and seemingly short."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's \\"Hobbit\\" is a classic fantasy tale that everyone should read at some point. Bilbo Baggin's adventures take the reader through enchanted forests and moutntains, meeting dwarves, elves, wargs, and other strange creatures along the way. I read this as a kid and just finished rereading it, and it's as much fun the second time around. Now where can I buy one of those magic rings?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, like The Chronicles of Narnia, defines the standard for children's fantasy literature. Bilbo is one of the endearing hobbit-folk who populate Tolkien's imaginative world of Middle Earth. One day he is compelled by the wizard Gandalf to leave his comfortable home and set out with thirteen dwarves on quest whose ramifications he does not fully understand but in which he will play a crucial role as the group faces monstrous orcs, giant spiders, wolves, and worse, until finally Bilbo comes face to face with the dread dragon Smaug. Throughout his adventures, Bilbo's true character emerges and the reader comes to understand that underneath his soft exterior there is a steely center of courage and the will to do what is right.Tolkien's works have attained classic status through their excellent story quality, deeply coherent story world, and a perceptive eye toward human nature. Christian thinkers especially appreciate that Tolkien's stories, while not allegorical, are firmly rooted in a Christian view of the world.The Hobbit forms an important prelude to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but is written for a younger audience and is a better choice for reading aloud, since its prose is simpler and includes enjoyable repetitive elements in its storytelling style."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his quiet life of many meals a day to join a treasure-seeking company of dwarves. He encounters trolls, elves, giant spiders and magic of every kind. He returns home in the end to find his comfortable life waiting for him. Though he now has riches and a magic ring of invisibility, Bilbo will never again rest comfortably.Tolkien wrote this book for his own children, and it has the chapter-by-chapter pacing of a tale to be told at bedtime to eager young ears. It is not mere childishness, however. While the magic is exciting, there is also an underlying system, a consistency to what magic will work and who it will work for and against. This encourages thoughtful questions and recognition of order in even a make-believe world.Tolkien's hero grows as he journeys through Middle-Earth and through the book's chapters. Early in his adventures, Bilbo is rescued by either Gandalf the Wizard or by the more experienced dwarves. As the story develops, Bilbo takes a trembling hand in defending his companions and solving their problems. By book's end, he acts independently and makes his own decisions about what is right. In this entertaining and light-seeming tale, Tolkien shows his young readers what it means to grow up, to become capable and confident.Having enjoyed the Hobbit's happy lessons of childhood, adult readers ofThe Lord of the Ringsface maturity's darker challenges. Bilbo's simple adventure is retold, with secrets laid bare and threatening implications revealed. Bilbo's magic ring is a consuming burden that cannot be easily destroyed. His homeland is safe only because others struggle to keep evil at bay. The most frightening monsters Bilbo has encountered, the goblins, are merely tortured offspring of a world-threatening evil that must be fought. This change of perspective is more than the shift from a children's book to one written for adults. It captures the jarring difference between what children know, and what adults must know to protect them.This book has the reviewer's highest recommendation. Read it to enjoy a delightful children's story, and to see a childlike hero grow toward adulthood. Also read it to appreciate more deeply the adult themes in Tolkien's books that follow it. Analytical readers may also enjoy the psychological insights offered by Timothy O'Neill inThe Individuated Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Funny, colorful, exciting story of someone who has an adventure and becomes all sorts of things he never expected to be--most of all a true leader."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story has non stop action in every chapter. It is a great adventure book, one of the best I've read. I recommend it to all those who seek the thrill of an adventure among the pages of a book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, of Bag End, Under Hill, Hobbiton. The story tells of how Bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to The Lonely Mountain, defeat Smaug (the dragon) and retrieve their treasures and their homeland. It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was first introduced to this book when I was ten years old. It wasn't easy for our form teacher, Mr. Martin, to control 35 kids but when he started to read this book, from the very first words, all of us were captivated. We became so enthralled by the story that we used to paint pictures and make giant posters of the leading characters. Everyone had their own idea on how a Hobbit looked, or how a troll smelt! I would strongly recommend that this book be read to any child over the age of seven but make sure you read it with the light on."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is just amazing.

Well i'm from Iceland an in case you don't know it, many of the characters names come frome old Icelandic stories and folktales."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was what started the whole thing. The entire fantasy genre owes its roots to Tolkein. Without him, we wouldn't have silly but brave Hobbits, beautiful and wondrous Elves, stalwart dwarves or daughty and prideful Dunedain. Tolkein was the first (and probably the best) writer to fully create a fantasy world that draws you in with its detail, astounds you with the vividness of its characters, and surprise you with the fulness of its history. If you love fantasy, but haven't read this book, then you are definitely missing a classic. Tolkein is one of a very few fantasy authors whose work can be honestly called &quot;literature&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am 12 now and first read the book in second grade. It captivated me and I was further hooked on reading. I even read Micheal Crighton's Jurassic Park that year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the Hobbit during the 4th grade summer. Now I'm in seventh grade and I still love it. Its a true captavating experience which will cause both insomnia and tiredness. Tolkien takes you to a place where you have never gone before. The creativity is endless and you feel yourself being pulled into the heat of the battles. You start shouting as battles are taking place and rooting for Mr. Bilbo Baggins to come on top. You can't miss this once in a life time experience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The imagination of the writer would be less admired if this tale did not have deeper meaning or did not suggest natural social, moral, and motivational problems with humanity. Please be sure to read 'The Hobbit', any one of the many on the shelf, and please be sure to consider what the author means to say about personal or spiritual journeys, mental excitement, moral enthusiasm, and general happiness (versus the evil of the mundane and predictable.) Too often in the process of reading the great stories, allusions are missed and metaphors are disregarded. Please soak in the book, and look beyond the swords, wizards and dragons. We all know very well that what Tolkien did best was create stimulating fantasy, but he stumbled upon greatness with 'The Hobbit'. He orchestrated a masterpiece through the kind of characters, language and setting he enjoyed best. (That is in my opinion a sure sign of a genius, confident in his ability to create literature in a nontraditional method.) It is the kind of book that causes epiphanies!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A truly amazing story with unparalleled use of imagination and outstanding of depth of story. With characters which are perfectly real and complex matched with the indepth world of Middle Earth which has languages, peoples, geography, and a true *feel* of its own, this story is amazing, and stands as my favorite novel, of course, next to The Lord of the Rings, which continues the plight of Bilbo's magical ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was an incredble book. It made me feel as if I was Bilbo and I must say it is a really good book to read. In fact, I'm going to read the whole series, starting with &quot;The Lord Of The Rings.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about fantasy magic and adventures."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's masterpeice is the standard by which all other fantasies are judged. Grammar and sentence structure (who cares!) are sometimes criticized, but the book was written by a Professor of Philology. The flow of the book and and the feelings it raises are what make it a classic. Tolkien set out to make a mythology, and was a brilliant success."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this magical treasure when I was 12 and I cried when I turned the last page because I simply did not want the magic to end.

The story itself is wonderful, full of magic and love, culture and history, language and food. Well, it is about hobbits. Tea, seed cakes, ale. But is also a must to understand the series that follows, The Lord of the Rings. While there may be a movie made for it one day I doubt it will ever do this book justice. Get it used, new, how ever you can.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of the most enjoyable, enduring fantasy tales. Since the first copy came into our home 2 generations ago, it has been replaced several times and read by adults and children alike, and is now being enjoyed by a 4th generation - our grandchildren. We purchased the 1966 edition shown in this listing with the beautiful dust jacket repro of Tolkien's painting of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien's unique art always piques the imagination. The image on the dust jacket of this edition was reproduced by one teenage son on his bedroom wall, and remains there to this day, some 25 years later, and in much better condition than the dust jacket of his parents' old book...Unlike Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit is not moralistic, i.e. there is no battle of good and evil. It is simply a straighforward adventure story. Little did we know when first reading The Hobbit that Bilbo's finding of a magic ring would trigger armageddon. Finding this out in our later readings of the LR trilogy did not reduce the continued pleasure and interest in Bilbo's adventures. Our first joyous discovery of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is renewed with each re-reading to a grandchild.The Hobbit carries on galantly alongside Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, The Wind In the Willows, and the Just So Stories. There is plenty of intellectual value for children in terms of broadening vocabulary, because it stirs intense curiosity through following a complex story line. Such books offer a look into other worlds where life and people are quite different, where rivers don't flow to familiar ends, and where simple objects can have properties and uses other than the obvious. No one absorbs this kind of material better than children, but over the years we saw the family's teens and collegiates sometimes re-read The Hobbit. The story keeps its hold even on minds that are jaded by age and hard knocks."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Let me just start by saying that I love, and have always since the first time I read it, loved this book. No one should go through life without at least giving this book a shot.In this novel J.R.R. Tolkien pens the archetypal adventure for the modern world, complete with memorable characters, a rich world, and a good amount of danger. The story, although sometimes touted as a book for young people, is perfectly acceptable for adults as well. Regardless of age, this is one of the few reads which will truly engross you from the first page to the last.Do yourself a favor: buy your kid a copy. Buy yourself a copy. This is a book every amateur adventurer should read at least once."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A fantastic rendering of this tale. Rob Inglis is a treasure -- the voices are amazing and engaging. A must-have for anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This particular copy of the hobbit was just amazing. I felt like I was holding more than just a plain old book. I felt like I was being dragged more in depth with the story. It's definitely worth the money if you're a J.R.R. Tolkien fan and if you keep your books nice. I recommend this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am very satisfied with the purchase, the book was new, very new, like nobody had read it. The delivery was on the date the seller said, I repeat very satisfied, I will continue purchasing in this library, they are serious people to trust."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read \\"The Hobbit\\" because I had already read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy and adored it. Therefore, it's hard for me to think of The Hobbit without comparing and contrasting it to the trilogy. First off, The Hobbit bears all of Tolkien's genius: descriptive passages that are more like a painting than a paragraph, clever poetry and songs, and an imaginary world that has come to life with Tolkien's inventive language and culture of the characters. When one reads Tolkien, it's like reading about a real place. However, the one thing that I really did not like about \\"The Hobbit,\\" especially in comparison to LOTR, is that there is very little character development. I often had trouble keeping track of names because the characters just don't do much besides have adventures. On the whole, I give this book 4 stars for its creativity, originality, adventurous plot, and beautiful language."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The title says it all. Great read by the narrator amazing story for young and old but the company that printed the discs did a terrible job I tried to play the discs on my Bose CD player and I can't get 20 minutes without the audio freezing. I got around this by putting all the CDs on my computer in iTunes and listening to it there. There is some minor audio skipping but it's barely noticeable when I play it on my IPod. BUT I REPEAT THESE DISCS WILL NOT PLAY ON CD PLAYER!!! Do not purchase unless you intend to put it on your computer. I'm giving it only 3 stars for the disc quality if this wasn't an issue it would be a solid 5 STARS!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbits - J.R.R.R. TolkienI would strongly suggest that anyone considering reading Tolkien for the first time choose the \\"The Hobbits\\" as their initial book. There is a good reason for this since many of the events that propel the three volume \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" originate in \\"The Hobbits\\". The reader is introduced to a full gamut of characters and beings that play critically important roles in subsequent books.I have no interest in summarizing the plot since any discussion along these lines would spoil the revelations to be discovered by new readers.This exceptional fantasy tale that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. This would make a fine book to read to a child. Be sure to set aside a couple of free hours because once you begin this book you will not want to put it down until the last page."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a really exciting tale of a little hobbit and the huge adventure he goes through. I read that one of the reasons J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the book was for his own children to enjoy, but the intended audience of this book could be anywhere from 13 up to adults, as I know a 30 year old who claims to have read it 5 times and as recently as last year. Because of how well the book was written and the great characters, this is a great book for someone of any age to read.The only background information you need to know about this book is that it is a prequel to the Lord of The Rings series. I do not have many criterions to judge this book as it is the first one I have ever read from cover to cover. To summarize the book, Bilbo is convinced to go with a large pack of Dwarves as a thief to help them get their mountain back from an evil dragon called Smaug. Along the way they run into trolls, elves, spiders, goblins, eagles, and participate in a huge battle.I really enjoyed all of the books key elements. The plot really worked well for someone my age, it had a great reward at the end of all their hard work, and it had some amazing characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. It had sad parts too at the end where a main character learned a good life lesson. Knowing that this book was wrote before the Lord of The Rings I think it sets up that book really well. It already lets you meet a few of the main characters and makes you interested to see what happens to Bilbo and his ring. I haven't read any other books like this so it makes it hard to compare to books like it, but I know that I would be interested in reading more books like it if there any.The great characters and the adventure in this book really have made it an enjoyment to read. From the very beginning of being introduced to Bilbo and all his adventures with trying to escape being eaten by trolls, trying to get out of a goblin cave, being chased by wolves and spiders, and helping the dwarves escape from an Elvish prison along with trying to defeat a dragon and survive a war I really had a great time reading it. While I expected this project to be no fun at all, the book was so great it has made this little project turn into its own huge adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've got six years worth of seventh grade students in Stafford, Virginia, who could tell you as well as I could why no one should go through life without reading this timeless tale. But, as they are not sitting here at the computer with me just now, you'll have to take my word for that.By now, most of the civilized western world knows that The Hobbit is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings (which is even better, yet more accessible by older teens and adults than by children). I've always told the kids that I teach who read Harry Potter (and I'm a Potter fan, too), that when they're ready to \\"graduate their reading\\", The Hobbit is the next step. It has all the appeal of the best in \\"young\\" fiction, but it is absolutely \\"literary\\", too, in the most classic sense of that word. And well it should be. J.R.R. Tolkien was a student and teacher of linguistics himself, and his love of history (over allegory) is omnipresent in all of his works, not least in The Hobbit.It's the story of an unlikely and reluctant hero, Bilbo Baggins, who is unceremoniously roped into an adventure with thirteen dwarves. Their goal: traverse the whole of the Wilderlands in Northern Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, defeat a dragon who stole the dwarves' treasure, and reclaim the kingdom under the mountain as their own.What follows is largely episodic in nature, as the first half of the book chronicles the various dangers and respites along the way (one per chapter until they reach the mountain itself). By chapter 8, not only have you met hobbits, dwarves, and wizards, you've outwitted trolls, dined with elves, evaded goblins, avoided being eaten alive by a nasty little subterranean fiend named Gollum, been rescued from the tops of burning trees by flying eagles, befriended a were-bear, and hacked down an army of giant spiders. And then, just when you've taken a breath, you realize the book is only half done ...To give any more away would be simply gratuitous. If you're a kid, read The Hobbit. If you're an adult, read The Hobbit. If you're a highly intelligent family pet, read The Hobbit.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, the author of a horror novel called \\"Teeth\\".)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a real shame that the movie version of this book didn't come out before The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. People would have had a better idea of who Bilbo was. The worst part about the movies was they made him look like a silly little old man. But this is a classic story of a rather ordinary little creature reaching out to be extraordinary when the situation required it. It is a mistake to think of this as a story about a small group of thirteen dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit out to fight a dragon merely to win back a treasure. This group is out to win back a lost kingdom. And it must be pointed that an elf kingdom and a kingdom of humans suffered from the fall of the dwarf kingdom as well. So it shouldn't be a surprise when a war breaks out because other people want a share of the treasure. This a bit lighter in tone than The Lord of the Rings, but it came twenty years earlier, and a lot happened to Tolkien in that time, including World War II. But this is a most excellent story about a most excellent Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I listen to a lot of audiobooks, usually stephen king although i have listened to others and having read this book several times i thought i would listen to the audio version. I was pleasantly suprised by how much it changed the experience, it was like re-discovering the book all over again and Rob Inglis's voice really matches the narrative, although his singing isn't brilliant, but then again i always skipped the songs while reading anyhow. I would recommend this audiobook to fans of the book looking for a different way of experiencing it and for people who have never read it. Bring on the lord of the rings!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" by J.R.R.Tolkin is a classic fantasy, full of adventure for people of any age This book set the bar for fantasy.I first read this novel way back in the late 70's early 80's.But this is a review about the book \\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" (Collector's Edition) NOT the story. I found this novel to be well presented in the hardcover format which came in a sturdy green box. It is pleasant to look at, and the texture feels great. The print is a good size for the younger readers or people who have difficulty reading small print.This is a beautiful book. There are 5 beautiful full-color watercolors and many more illustrated prints which look like a cutline / woodcut effect by the author.The cover is a delight, with a gold image, red & gold writing around the edge and on the spine. Vibrant and gorgeous it's a beautiful keepsake.It's a great edition to anybody's book case.It is truly a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchashed the Hobbit on audio for use in my classroom. Most of my students find it easier to follow along with a person reading aloud than when reading on their own; the problem is that if I am the one reading my attentions are on the book, and the classes can sometimes take that as a cue to misbehave!Enter the Hobbit on audio. This is an unabridged reading by classically trained actor Rob Inglis, who specializes in Shakespearean and Tolkien readings. His reading is consistent: his voice work stays the same for each character throughout the reading. A nice touch is the actual singing of the poetry Tolkien included. Music, songs, and poetry are an integral part of Tolkien's travel narratives, and the use of actual singing makes this reading a delight to listen to. Inglis's smooth voice is easy on the ears, and he performs this recording beautifully.My only complaint, and that of my students, was that sometimes the pace of the reading was too slow, which made tedious parts of the book even more so. Other than that it was a huge asset to my classroom, and truly served its purpose. While I don't really use audio books for personal use, I would still recommend this item to people who do. If you want an introduction to Tokien's world but don't have the time or interest to sit down with the text, this may be for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is of the green, leather bound, hardcover, Collectors Edition of \\"The Hobbit\\".First of all, this book is a classic tale of swords and sorcery by the godfather of modern fantasy himself. He wrote it for his children before writing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". The language is a bit simpler and the story isn't as dark, but it still conveys a gripping tale full of Dragons and Wizards, Trolls and Goblins.The book itself is a beautiful hardcover edition, bound in foil embossed leather. It's very durable, with strong binding, and a sturdy cover. The illustrations in the book are fantastic. They are full color, full page prints of the author's own paintings. I can't speak for everyone, but I have personally found them to be startlingly similar to my own mental images of the people and places in the book.The price of this book is WELL worth it, and if you're looking for a hardcover version this is the one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first book by Tolkien with Middle-Earth, and one of his best . This book is the prequel to the best-selling novel series The Lord of The Rings. It takes place in Hobbiton (which is in the Shire).Fans of LOTR will certainly love this book. Unanswered questions from LOTR will probabbly be answered in tis book. It follows Bilbo on his adventure of finding the ring and tells of his first encounter with Golum."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Besides my Bible, there has never been a book that I have read more often than \\"The Hobbit.\\" Since I was ten years old I have read it at least once every single year. It is great! Am I biased, of course; but does that change the beauty of this book, no!This is a great book for many reasons. I will give you three:1) Great English usage. Tolkien was a master of the English language and it shows in this book (maybe even more so than in the LoTR cycle). He is creative and concise. At times he is gives you lots of information and description, while at other times he is sparse; but either way he gives you just exactly what you need to know. When you read this book, note how Tolkien uses adverbs. For some odd reason the adverb is out of fashion to most fiction authors these days, thus, reading Tolkien is a breath of fresh air.2) The richness of the story is undeniable. This book set the bar for a modern fantasy staple: the quest story. Without \\"The Hobbit\\" there would be no Dark Tower, Drizzt, Demon Wars, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, etc. \\"The Hobbit\\" is and always will be the defining novel of the fantasy genre.3) It is fun! Hobbits are intriguing, the quest is exciting, and the interactions between the characters are authentic (even though they aren't human!). Tolkien captured the human spirit in this book in a way that I have never read before or since. Every page will make you smile, cry, or laugh out loud!So, am I biased? Yes! But \\"The Hobbit\\" is still the best!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book for people of all ages. The Hobbit is exciting with cool action and a little comedy. In the book you join Bilbo Baggins on a journy of a life time. You get too travel with Gandalf and Dwarfs. Theyer are gigantic spiders,goblins,Dragons,Crows,Bats and Trolls. You will love the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So much has been written about J.R.R. Tolkien's works recently, in the wake of Peter Jackson's magnificent films, that it was refreshing to simply re-read Tolkien's original tale of Bilbo Baggins. This marvelous new edition provided the perfect excuse.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic tale of adventure. Bilbo Baggins, Esquire, of the Shire, has never done anything outlandish, and is a most esteemable hobbit as a result. But lo and behold, the wizard Gandalf arrives on his doorstep with thirteen dwarves on a quest for revenge. Although never made quite clear why or how, Gandalf knows that Bilbo is going on this quest, too, like it or not. And after a night of dwarvish tales to chill a hobbit's bones, Bilbo finds himself running out his front door on a quest without so much as a pocket-handerchief.Just what is the quest? The dwarves are refugees from the Lonely Mountain in the East, a mighty dwarf kingdom, that has been ransacked by the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Bilbo is the troop's Burglar, although one imagines that the only thing Bilbo has ever stolen is a nap, or perhaps an extra piece of pie.If you're going to do archetypal stuff, you must do it well. In \\"The Hobbit,\\" Tolkien sets the gold standard. His Middle-Earth is a fully realized land full of terrors and wonders, from trolls, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders (not to mention Smaug or the ultimate nemesis, Gollum) to the shapeshifter Beorn, the Arkenstone, Bard the Archer, Sting, and Gandalf's wizardry on the other (not to mention a certain magic ring). Tolkien spends as much time on the landscape as he does the action or the dialogue, and his descriptions are so vivid one finds yourself walking alongside Bilbo through his amazing adventures.In contrast to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which can generally be characterized as a heavy load, \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter. Tolkien tells this tale using a narrator who cleverly jumps ahead and back in the story to offer hints, clues, and humor . . . just as if your favorite uncle were telling you a tall tale on the couch when you were a wee lad.The story builds, and builds, and builds, but never loses steam. A tale that must be read, \\"The Hobbit\\" will surely earn a place of honor on your bookshelf.For devotees of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, you will find throughout \\"The Hobbit\\" somewhat veiled references to later events. A few references are made to \\"the Necromancer,\\" who never really figures in the story but plays, shall we say, a slightly larger role in the trilogy. A certain magic ring, used by Bilbo to great effect, does not seem to carry all the negative baggage that Bilbo's nephew will associate with it. And Gollum, well, you know all about Gollum. (Apparently Tolkein revised \\"The Hobbit\\" after working extensively on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because Gollum unexpectedly became a major player in the trilogy.)And this edition is wonderful, too. Handsome green leatherette binding with heavy paper makes for a pleasant reading experience, and the artwork and maps (drawn by Tolkien himself!) just adds to the magic.You cannot go wrong giving this book to any Tolkien fan, or keeping it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was one of the best purchases that I have made in a long time. The Hobbit is a very difficult book to read, but with these audio tapes, it made reading the book so much easier. The announcer was so amazing and I would buy another audio book from him.

But at least there are treats like this, meant to be shared aloud to fully savor Tolkien's delicious alliteration, his pleasure in story-telling enriched by his knowledge of the deeper meanings of language. His gifts as a writer can be overlooking by the glitz of a contemporary lens, but these treasures lay in wait to constantly be rediscovered.\\"Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightening lit its peak. And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings\\" (pg 302).And the journey just gets better withThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, also best appreciated whist read aloud to fully savor Tolkien's poetic use of language. To further understand the creative spirit of Tolkien, I highly recommend Humphrey Carpenter's excellent works, such asJ.R.R.

Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In his book, The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien does a masterful job of telling the story of the Bilbo Baggins and his adventures with the dwarves. Though The Hobbit is an outstanding piece of writing by itself, it has far more depth behind it than just a fanciful tale. The Hobbit is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings saga--though it was written last--and is written from a unique standpoint that is not familiar to the other books.The Hobbit, though written by Tolkien, is portrayed as being written from the perspective of Bilbo and is titled There and Back Again by the hobbit. This is an extremely interesting vantage point given to the reader as they receive first-hand account from Bilbo on all of the situations as well as have the chance to experience his thoughts on the adventures. This gives readers the feeling that they are actually being told an account of actual occurrences and they get to feel everything that Bilbo does during each exciting encounter, as well as his evolution from a simple hobbit into a \\"burglar\\". Tolkien authenticates that Bilbo is the author by adding in personal commentary on the side such as \\"You can believe me when I say that,\\" and \\"That I can assure you\\". Through Bilbo, Tolkien describes the melancholy, comfortable life led by most all hobbits and how they shunned any sort of adventure. He then proceeds to show throughout the story how Bilbo gains confidence as well as a love for adventure that turns him into an almost unrecognizable character by the end of the book.Another aspect of the book that added to its effectiveness as a whole was its actual content. Since the book was written last in the series, fans would have had questions as to how the ring of power came into the picture before the release of The Hobbit. This book not only entertains readers with constant action and suspense but introduces the origin of the ring and how Bilbo attained it in Golum's lair. It also goes further into depth and shows how Bilbo received his sword, Sting, and gave it its name as well as his mithril armor, both of which he passes down to Frodo--his nephew--in The Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien also does an excellent job at describing the times in which the book is set in. To someone who just picked up the book without foreknowledge of the Lord of the Rings would find it extremely bizarre that animals can talk and how the dragons and goblins and dwarves and hobbits come into the story. However, the manner in which Tolkien casually describes and introduces these characters gives the reader the perception that it is totally normal for such things to be in Middle Earth. To one who has read all of the books related to the Lord of the Rings as well as prequels to them, such as The Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin, one can identify the time in which the story is set and how things changed between the time of The Hobbit and that of the start of the Lord of the Rings.The Hobbit is a work of literature that is entertaining enough in itself to cause anyone reading Tolkien's series for the first time to become absorbed in it, yet at the same time the book has enough detail and depth that one who has read all of the related books will find themselves enthralled and deeply satisfied at the book's conclusion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must have bought my paperback edition (Ballantine Books) back in 1966 when this particular edition came out. The pages are yellowed and dog earred and yet, I can read the pages of this edition. I still love the maps of the Wilderland and Desolation of Smaug. I still have the cover, although it's long since detached itself from the book binding. But now that I know there's an annotated Hobbit--well, perhaps it's time for a new edition.I always knew there was something different about the Hobbit from The Lord of the Rings.After reading some of the reviews, my mind has been set at ease. It's simply, Hobbit was written for children, The Lord of the Rings for adults. (although in my opinion older chldren could love both of them. If they can plough through 900 pages of Harry Potter books, they certainly can read LOTR.The Hobbit is simply delightful. What's a hobbit? A small creature around waist high (maybe) who adores pipes, good food and comfort. He has furry toes and goes barefoot.One day, when Bilbo Baggins (hobbit) was ejoying the things hobbits enjoy, Gandolph the Gray (wizard) comes calling to invite Bilbo on an adventure. Bilbo is reluctant. No adventures for him. Hobbits simply do not like adventures. But, to get rid of the pest and enjoy his creature comforts once again, he agrees. Hoping that Gandolph and his friends that would be coming would NOT come.Not so. The next day, one by one, twelve dwarves and finally Gandolph spill into Bilbo'shouse. And, so begins the adventure, which lead them to a dragon called Smaug, the dwarves stolen treasure and a ring, which Bilbo wins in a contest from a cave dwelling creature named Gollum. The ring sets off the trilogy LOTR.The book was written in 1937 by J.R.R. Tolkien who taught at Pembrooke College, Oxford, from 1925 unti 1945. His specialty was Anglo-Saxon and then as Merton Professor of English Language and Literature. Other works include: Farmer Giles of Ham, The Adventures of 'Tom Bombadil and LOTR. He has a marvelous sense of humor, even when things seem the blackest.Bilbo's role as a \\"burgler\\" is hilarious. And even though Bilbo is no burgler, he seems to fall into the role every time the dwarves end up in trouble.I give this five stars because I love it and it really is a classic.Patricia A.

This is purely an adventure book so none of the characters except Bilbo's get any development worth mentioning, but then again this is a book for children and Tolkien himself said so. I found the story to be great, it had great great turns and even a couple of (almost) surprising twists; it definitely kept my attention. Tolkien's writing is really good too, I found it fairly easy to read as an ESL person. The only problem I found, and I don't know if it's just me, but - does Tolkien not know how to use his commas very well?Regardless, I think this book is worthy of five stars. I would recommend it to children and any adult with interest in fantasy (though I know a few that didn't like it)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It takes a remarkable author to write a book that satisifies both children and adults on this level.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

The details are plentiful enough to make it entertaining, but not overloaded as to make it boring. They do just enough to set the scene, and stop there instead of taking up pages and pages. It's the kind of book that no matter how hard you try, you can't set it down. If you've never read The Lord of the Rings books, then this would be the ideal starting point, for it explains a few things in that series.

Admirably, you are critiquing the book from a perspective that the Hobbit wasn't written from. It wasn't meant for the masses or even meant to be an adult book.

I think that one should read this before they read the Lord of the Rings. This book centers around the adventures of B9ilbo Baggins, who is Frodo's uncle. Frodo refers to his uncle a lot in the lord of the rings so it would be good to know what he is referring to. This version of the book is definitely the best version for the price. It is wonderful to read and looks very good on a bookshelf. The best part is their is no outer jacket that you would be afraid of tearing. You also must realize that Tolkien had this book published in the early 1930s and the story stll lasts to today.

In the beggining i never would have expected for him to be so brave in certain situations, like the part with the dragon.

One day a wizard named Gandalf comes to his door and asks him if he'd like to go on an adventure. When he says no, Gandalf scratches a mark into his door that means aster burglar. The next day thirteen dwarves show up at his door, and Bilbo is basically forced to go on the adventure. They explain that they are on a quest to regain their leader: Thorin's gold from the dragon Smaug who stole it years ago, and wish that Bilbo be their burglar( or professional treasure hunter). Their journey starts off well enough, until one night they see a fire and send Bilbo to investigate. He is caught, and the dwarves are also caught, and later Bilbo manages to be thrown into a bush. While in the bush he see's the wizard Gandalf cause the dwarves to argue until dawn, when they turn to stone. The party then travel to Rivendell (where the elves live) with some new swords, and find out that their swords were made during the great goblin wars. They also discovered that the map that Thorin gained had rune letters that told him how to find the secret door. They then head into the misty mountains. When they are taking shelter in a cave, they are captured by goblins, who take them to their king. Once again, Gandalf saves them by killing the goblin king, and allowing them to escape. While they are escaping Bilbo (who could not keep up and had to ride piggy back) falls down into a hole. He found a ring while he was feeling around, but travels further down with the help of his sword (which glows when goblins are near). At the bottom, he finds there is a lake, on the lake lives a creature called Gollum. He has a riddle contest with Gollum and wins, but Gollum plans to slip on his ring (which Bilbo found) and kill Bilbo. Gollum gets mad because he finds out Bilbo has the ring, and starts to chase him. He eventually leads Bilbo to the exit and Bilbo escapes. Soon Bilbo catches up with the rest of them, but soon the party is surrounded by giant wolves. Gandalf tell everyone to get in the trees. Eventually they are rescued by eagles and taken to their nests where they rest for a while. Later on they go to Beorn (a friend of Gandalf's) house. He gives them supplies, and they go into Mirkwood forest. In the forest the company is captured by giant spiders. Bilbo slips on the ring and is able to cut the dwarves free from the webbing and kill the spiders. Later on, they are captured by elves (except for Bilbo) and after a long time Bilbo finally arranges so that they can float downstream in the empty wine barrels that the town makes for the elves. After stopping in the lake town, the company reaches lonely mountain. They finally find the secret door, and when they open it, they find a tunnel into the mountain. Bilbo goes down and steals a cup from Smaug, and later they do riddles. Smaug flies off and attacks the lake town. While Smaug is away they explore the palace, and Bilbo finds the Arkenstone (an important dwarf artifact) and is given Mithril that is very resistant. A man in laketown kills Smaug by shooting an arrow into a weak spot on his chest. After this an army of elves and men go to the mountain to get the treasure, but Thorin refuses. The army lays siege on the dwarves. While this is going on an army of Wargs and an army of Goblins attack the Dwarves, Humans, and Elves. They are saved by the eagles and Beorn. When Bilbo returns home he is rich. The Hobbit by: J.R.R. Tolkein is a very exciting book.This book was very exciting. There were many times when you thought it was over for Thorin and Company and that the story would end there. When they were captured by the Spiders it was very suspenseful, you didn't know if someone would die. It was exciting to watch the battles play out. Many times when you thought they were safe, like when Bilbo almost got stuck in the door when he was escaping the goblins.This book had many details. I almost felt like I was standing in Beorn's house, or searching through the goblin's tunnels. He described Mirkwood very well and it was like you were there. Also a lot of the description was through actions, like when the dwarves chose Bilbo to investigate the trolls fire instead of going themselves.I liked this book because it seemed like it had a history. You could tell that the author put a lot of effort into the history. In one part of the book it tells about Thr Great Goblin wars many years ago. There was a really good story about how the treasure was stolen by Smaug the dragon, and it felt like it had really happened.The Hobbit is a really good book. I enjoyed this book very much, because it kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a really good fantasy novel, and a lot less serious than the Lord of the Rings series. The Hobbit as a exciting, well thought through, detailed, and overall great book.G.Bennett"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is targetted at LOTR fans who already know the story and are looking for a collectors' edition.

Many a time have I shut the round door of study (always latched and locked, you know: never can tell when a nasty Sackville-Baggins will pop in), and settled down with a dog-eared edition of this book. I first read it years ago when my uncle Bob (a bit like old Bilbo himself) told me of the bourgeois burglar and the quandary he fell into when an acerbic wizard (Isatari) barged into his home in the cozy Shire. Inside a hole in the ground, Mr. Baggins signed a contract that bound us all to a delightful treat. Let us be thankful that he did, fellow reader! The adventures of Thorin and Co. enriched us who tagged along. You should buy this book for your child and yourself. Read it to him aloud. Tolkien revels in the narrator's interjections.

The art work is surreal and absorbing. Alan Lee did a wonderful job and the art vividly portrays a magical world. It comes to life and the pages jump out at the reader in wonderful splender.An absolute must collecters item."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book. Although it may be slow between action-packed spots, it is beatifuly written. The Hobbit is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit (you are probably wondering what a hobbit is. A hobbit is a little person about half our size, and no beard. They grow leathery thick soles on the bottom of there feet, and grow curly hair on top. Being fat in the stomach, they dress in bright colors, have deep laughs, and enjoy meals very much)who wanted nothing more than to sit at home and enjoy his pipe. When, Gandalf comes by and chooses him for a dangerous adventure. 13 dwarves come by his house for tea, and the next thing poor Bilbo knows, he is being swept out of his comfotable hobbit-hole! He encounters Goblins, Trolls, Giant Spiders, a dangerous dragon, and too much more for a hobbit to handle!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I heard that the trilogy that follows this novel, The Lord of the Rings, was being made into a movie and that Tolkien's books are some of the greatest literary works of all time, I bought LOTR and The Hobbit.Let me say this: The Hobbit (and Lord of the Rings for that matter) is not for everyone. One of The Hobbit's greatest aspects (or worst, depending on how you see it) are the vivid details of the scenery Tolkien provides the reader. This makes the reader feel as if he/she is in Middle-Earth as part of the party of 13 dwarves, one hobbit and a wizard. You experience everything the group does, and they do go through a lot. The downfall of this style is it may seem slow and boring to some, but not to me.Some say that there is not enough charcter development or that the plot is too thin. I beg to disagree. While there are many pages of wandering around Middle-Earth and descriptions of its locales, the plot moves at a fair pace with a main event present in every chapter. As for those who say that character development is non-existant in the novel must have skipped quite a few chapters. Do they not realise that the main character, Bilbo Baggins, goes through a tremendous change? At the very beginning of the book he has very little desire for adventure. He does not think of himself as brave or bold or resourceful. By the final pages of The Hobbit, he has become all the things he didn't believe he was.After reading this tale of travel and adventure, I now agree with those who say that this is the greatest literary works of the century. If you are open-minded and like fantasy in general or like the Star Wars saga, you should look into this book. And if you enjoyed reading this book you will also enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Finally, this is a great novel that is well worth your money, every cent of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read this book was when I was nine years old. I hated it.The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen. The first thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story. However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there quivering&quot;. The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can someone say about &quot;the hobbit&quot; that has not already been said. I remember first reading this book when I was twelve and not being able to put it down. I read it three times in a row, each time being more thrilled with the book. I wanted to change my cats name to Bilbo (my mom said no). This is the best fantasy story, ever written in my opinion. About two weeks ago I found my 15-year-old son reading the Hobbit. I went and dug up my old copy and fell in love with the book all over again. This book is a must have for anyone's home library. One of my favorite parts is the riddle game between Gollum and Bilbo (what's its got in its pocket?). There is so much to explore and discover in this book. You'll figure something else out each time you read it. So do yourself a favor pick up a copy and escape into a world of lovable characters and high adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"'The Hobbit' never gets boring.

I still wonder how J.R.R. Tolkiens thought of so many marvelous creatures, characters, and adventures, and weaved it in with wonderful writing and words. In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is a very lovable Hobbit who goes on a very perilous adventure with a party of dwarves. It involves goblins, giant spiders, a dragon named Smaug, and many other spectacular things. If you love adventure you must read this book, or else you're missing out on a journey you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Every fantasy story you ever read will sound like a knockoff ofThe Hobbit--so read The Hobbit and don't bother with the rest. (Okay,then read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But that's it.)

The woods seem never-ending. Will they ever get out to defeat the the dragon? Find out by reading The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkein was such a masterful writer. His outlandish characters, colorful imaging, original settings, and mesmerizing plotlines are among some of my favorite readings.The basic plot revolves around a young hobbit's journey with a company of thirteen dwarves and a wizard on a quest to regain the dwarven homeland. Amongst the many enemies they must face along the way are the Wargs, a vicious group of wolves; the orcs; and a fearsome and monstrous dragon named Smaug.If you like fantasy literature in the least, you should love this book.

I loved the illustrations and color."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book now i can read it whenever i want, fast speedy delivery, great shape."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would have to say this and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the best fantasy out there.

Though it may seem a little slow-moving at first, it is actually an excellent adventure story, though perhaps a bit much for younger children to attempt to read for themselves. (However, reading it aloud to them is strongly recommended!) Bilbo is a likable character, easy to relate to, because all of us want to go out and have adventures and slay dragons, and yet we also enjoy the comforts of home a bit too much. Gandalf is appropriately mysterious and yet somehow feels like a loving grandfather, and the Dwarves are endearing and bring a smile to your face.

A somewhat self-centered but likable fellow with aspirations that rarely extends beyond a good pipe or his next meal, thrust without warning nor apology into a quest on par with those he would spin tales of over the course of an evening after dinner. There is no prolonged set-up inThe Hobbit. The author starts us off with a brief introduction and immediately proceeds to completely foul up his protagonist's current life and foreseeable future by commandeering him on the afore-mentioned quest. Thus the fun begins.Along the way Bilbo (a very small man, in both stature and mindset, and one with no desire to change either - thank you very much!) meets trolls and orcs and goblins and a even a huge, very old, and verrrry greedy red dragon who has no taste for thieves, but a taste for hobbits. Bilbo is so far out of his league, and caught up in world events of a world he had rather wished NOT to know of that it is a wonder he stays sane at all through his perilous journey \\"there and back again.\\"Everyone should read this book. Tolkien scoots us along (much faster than his drawlingThe Lord of the Ringspace) in a delightful fantasy filled with magic and wizards and creatures great and small, dangling us precariously sometimes over the edge of a few intersecting plot points (like snapping alligators in a pit) only to not-so-politely dump us off safe and snug at home once again with a few extra coins in our pockets and a lifetime of fresh stories to tell to everyone who was too timid to take the journey with us (and our strange new friends).This book is a classic because it is easy to read, enchanting, and fun. It started the whole of 'Middle Earth' which in-turn begat the whole of fantasy role playing (an annually multi-billion dollar industry now). This is the Bible of modern fantasy, and one that will make your children laugh and cry and remember the tales contained herein long into their adulthood. I simply cannot recommend a better book to read to your children when they are old enough to understand the concepts this book describes so vividly."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like action and adventure then get ready to jump into the world of middle earth, (but middle earth is infested with evil things) like,orcs,dragons,goblins,and Belroc a demon from the anchint world.

But there are good things to who defend the people of evil like the elves of elrond the dwarves of morlia and the men of middle earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Every Tolkien fan/collector should add this book to their list of must haves. Even though delayed in publishing, it is well worth the wait. The quality of the work and time, research that went into it, is wonderful. Great illustrations and artwork. Included is the full text of THE QUEST OF EREBOR,which was omitted from the appendix to The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think all of the Tolkien books are great!After I finished reading them all, I was Stupified.I never knew how amazing a few writings of literature could be so influencing to the yong youths of the world.The LOTR books contain all of the caracteristics that an excellent book should have;adventure,suspens,fighting,love,and the greatness of good beating evil.To simply say it, I believe that the LOTR books and movies are the best ideas of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Originally written in 1937 by J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first of a series of books that constitute Tolkien's legacy, one which, like many other literary masterpieces, has stood the test of time. The hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, is forced to face his destiny by the wizard Gandalf; one that gradually gains him the respect of his companions (thirteen dwarves, along with the wizard) and many other characters in a year-long adventure through the dangers of facing the meanest creatures and walking through the most adverse places.Ultimately, the tapestry of events which Tolkien brilliantly weaves around Bilbo and his friends confront him with Smaug, the terrible dragon who has long seized the dwarves' treasure. Only the combination of luck, intelligence and a courage which he never thought he had, help Bilbo to sort through all he's faced with to come out as a better being, one that can see beyond the blindness that greed brings into smaller spirits (not necessarily because it affects dwarves more than it affects others in the story). It is there where the true greatness and universal character of the story lies.The best thing about Tolkien's fantasy books is that you can relate to them in so many ways that they no longer seem so distant from what could actually occur to you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the perfect fantasy book for readers! It has just about all you need to look for: A strong plot with smatterings of suspense, adventure, and mystery, wonderful characters described so well you can almost hear them talking, and a map at the beginning so you can track the journeys of the characters. The plot is this: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is visited one day by Gandalf, a roving wizard. Although Bilbo insists he does NOT want the adventure Gandalf offers, Gandalf decides that Bilbo is perfect for the job, and brings along thirteen dwarves when next he comes to call. The dwarves are going to go off and reclaim their stolen home(and treasure) from a dragon named Smaug. They set off the very day after their visit at Bilbo's, with Bilbo a nervous and reluctant member of their party. Although Bilbo often wishes to be at home with the kettle singing for tea, he gets none of it as he witnesses Gandalf outsmarting trolls, gets taken down to Goblin Town in the bowels of the Misty Mountains, finds a powerful Ring that makes the wearer invisible, and has to fight giant spiders to save the dwarves. Eventually, all the dwarves are captives of the Mirkwood elves, and Bilbo is trapped inside their castle, always wearing the Ring to avoid discovery. He eventually rescues the dwarves in an ingenious plan: floating them down to the Dragon's mountain in empty barrels discarded by the Mirkwood elves. Bilbo and the dwarves are received ecstatically by the residents of a lake town near the mountain, but soon after Bilbo's birthday they are off to the mountain. Bilbo gets them all inside with a vital clue provided earlier, and drives the dragon nearly mad with frustration. The dragon is eventually slain by a lake townman, who convinces his townsfolk that the treasure is now rightfully theirs. This leads up to a climactic battle of five armies. This is a marvelous book for anyone who needs an escape from life's dreariness. I would recommend it to anyone who is old enough to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Surely, it's been scientifically verified that anyone who gives The Hobbit (and the rest of the series) ONE measly star is, simply, wrong. Tolkien's Middle Earth is rich and perfectly self-contained. He never violates the parameters he establishes for this fantasy world, which he fills with memorable characters and intriquing plot turns. What great escapist literature! I only hope you students who've expressed disdain for this book will later reconsider, and give it another reading. I suspect the circumstances (required reading, homework assignments) may have had more to do with your negative regard for the book than any shortcoming in the storytelling. Consider the (almost) universal positive regard for Tolkien's work. Sometimes the hype is warranted."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm looking for reviews of the audiobook. AMAZON, Whazzup? These are all reviews for the book, actually for several different versions of the book. Not very helpful!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a Dad who just finished reading this book aloud to my 10-year-old daughter. We took our time and read a little bit each night so it took a couple of months to get through it, because we didn't read every night because of homework and other stuff. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I had lots of time to think about what the book is about. My strongest feeling about this book is that it taught me about how every common person could be a hero. Bilbo is just a common hobbit, but he did some amazing heroic things. Stop and think of his bravery: with the trolls; the Wargs; the spiders in Mirkwood; the dragon. I mean, he is best buds with a wizard for goodness sake! The other important thing to notice is how Bilbo \\"stepped out of the way\\" during the great war that ended the book. Events of the day got too large for Bilbo, so Tolkein gave him a back seat while all the troubles of Middle Earth were solved by Bard, Dain, the Elvenking, the Great Eagle, and the other big boys. This does not diminish Bilbo's accomplishments, he is still a fantastic hero. A true hero does not have to solve all the world's problems. A true hero steps up to the plate when he is called upon, and gets the job done. And that is just what Bilbo did."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book centered on Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who is briefly seen in 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Return of the King'. Here is the main storyline:Bilbo is living quietly in his hobbithole when Gandalf and thirteen dwarves whisk him away and engage him to travel with them on a journey to the Lonely Mountain to recover the lost treasure of Thorin Oakenshield, the son of Thrain, King Under the Mountain, which has been stolen by a dangerous dragon named Smaug. The fifteen of them hike all the way to the Misty Mountains when they are waylaid by the goblins. While trying to escape from them Bibo gets lost and manages to escape Gollum with a ring that makes whoever wears it invisible(the Ruling Ring in the Lord of the Rings). Then the dwarves and Bilbo journey into the forest of Mirkwood(Gandalf is away, saying that he has some other buisiness to attend to) and there they escape capture by some gigantic, talking spiders and the Elvenking, all by the help of Bilbo's brain and his Ring. Then they finally get to the Lonely Mountain, Mr. Baggins has a few talks with Smaug, then the dragon gets killed(I am not going to say why, for people who dont enjoy spoilers), a few arguments start, and the Battle of Five Armies(Elves, Men and Dwarves vs Goblins and Wargs) takes place. Then Bibo travells with Gandalf back to his hobbithole, and there he lives Happily Ever After(cough, cough).There were more punch lines and funny bits in the Hobbit than in LOTR, which makes sense, because the Hobbit was written by Tolkien as a \\"children's book\\". Still, I really enjoyed the book, and I also liked the personality of Bilbo turning from comfort-loving, adventure-shunning Shire Hobbit to a brave, (some extremely smart)plan-brewing, and rich Hobbit. Also, the book sort of explains how Bilbo got the Ring in a fun way.Which all explains how The Hobbit got five stars, in my opinion:)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is the beginning of the stories of that race of halflings which is continued in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It begins when Galdalf the Grey visits Bilbo Baggins' home, Bag End, followed within minutes by a company of dwarves. Surprised to find that they have come to include him in their trek to the lair of Smaug, a dangerous dragon, Bilbo at first declines the honor. After all, Hobbits never go on adventures.However, Gandalf has chosen well. Bilbo at last agrees to accompany the dwarves, in itself a most unusual circumstance. But it is not an easy trek they have chosen to undertake. Thirst, starvation, capture, and death await them at every turn. The most dangerous item encountered, however, is a simple gold ring which has not seen the light of day for many years. What will be the price if Bilbo liberates the ring?With The Lord of the Rings movies now being released, this is a wonderful time to revisit the beginning of the Baggins family adventures. For those who have never read Tolkien, his style may be difficult at first. The difficulty of the names may seem daunting. But once readers begin, these will not seem to be barriers. And, like most of those who have read and loved the Hobbits, they will return again and again.All fantasy readers should enjoy both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, as they were the stories on which much modern fantasy is based. There are also numerous books, such as bestiaries and encyclopedias, which add to the experience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A very good book. Really gets you hooked on to it.

Otherwise it's simply a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently re-read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit for the first time in probably ten years. Once I got past the older and awkward narrative viewpoint (in Tolkien's defense, the omniscient point-of-view was in vogue back in 1937, especially for what was considered a children's book), I was reminded of how rich and wonderful the story is. I also realized how classic the tale is on so many levels. Not only is it a prototypical journey tale, but it incorporates all the classic archetypes of fantasy fiction. I'll look forward to reading the novel again in a few years time. It is part of the bedrock of the genre, and every time I read it, I discover something special."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased these for gifts for some wonderful young artists who performed outstandingly in a children's theatre production of The Hobbit.

It was almost addictive how he sets the mood for the next chapter. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bilbo is detailed so well it is just like a movie and his description of the characters is astounding. The story just hooks you from the time of the party at Bilbo's home. I loved it and would recommend it for anyone with a sense of magination and adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I also just read The Hobbit for schools. On the surface, it's a very simple, lighthearted, uncomplicated fairy tale, which is a large part of its charm. I guess when you look deeper (as many have failed to do) you will realize that it's more complex and imaginitive than it seems. A couple of lulls, but otherwise very engrossing and exciting in many places. I would like to read The Lord of the Rings trilogy now and I really hope they're just as good.To the people who saw similarities to C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, here's something you might want to know: Lewis and Tolkien were freinds. They met often to read and discus their stories. Everyone says that their stories have deeper, Christian meanings. Just thought you'd like to know."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After browsing the other comments on this book, I'd like to point out three things. Firstly, do not read this book if you're a jaded individual with an inability or unwillingness to appreciate an innocent and charming tale. Secondly, stay away from it if you're a hardcore fantasy reader who began with more modern writers. You'll likely be disapointed (conversely, if you don't generally care for fantasy, you may just love this book, as I did). Finally, don't even attempt to read it if you consider the TV Guide listings to be a challenging read with a complex plot and too many characters. On a final note, I first read this book as an adult and did not find it to be &quot;too childish&quot; as some suggest and yes, I've read a few other books, thank you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit Daaaaaa......Bes"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Lord of the Rings is the best.

I can only shrug and reply, &quot;You get what you put in.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have something to say to all of you junior high school students out there who think this book is bad because the sentences are to complex or the paragraphs are to long, etc. etc. THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR YOUNG ADULTS. If you are having a hard time understanding this book, the reason is not that it is poorly written. The reason you are having a hard time understanding it is that you haven't been hitting the books hard enough at school. I first read this book in the 5th grade. I completed reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy by the beginning of the 7th grade. I had no problem at all understanding them. When I didn't know a word, I looked it up in my dictionary. If you are having a hard time now, I feel sorry for you. Do you realize how difficult it will be to get a college education if you are years behind in your reading ability?

I was utterly enrapt from the first page. Enthralled by the sheer genious and subtley of the novel I was compelled to salvage any vacant time by filling it with the adventures of what at first seemed and inapt hero. The sublimity and profound metaphorical meaning are woven with perilous happenings to create a tapesty comperable to such literary feats as a Tale of Two Cities and Siddhartha. I thought it impossible for a writer to render me so unable to set a book down as much as Dumas until I read Tolkien. I never would have believed this novel to be so meaningful before. This book truly astounded me and I, who was so reluctant to even try fantasy, was close to tears when I finished the book and will treat fantasy with alacrity where it was once met with scorn. If you have not read this book I adamently reccomend it to you even if this not your preffered genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the best, it's even better than The Lord of the Ring (I know alot of people will hate me for saying that, but it's true). My favorite thing about this book is the way that Bilbo Baggins changes from a boring, respectable hobbit who frets about not having enough hankercheifs to a clever and brave adventurer. The only thing that Tolkein could have done better was the Battle of the Five Armies, which started and ended way to hastily.That aside, this is a fantastic and whimsical adventure yarn to be enjoyed by everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Can anyone who reviews books here spell?

Probably because my dad wanted me to. But now I'm reading it, in anticipation of my daughter reading it (as soon as she finishes her current book) and I love it. Dad would certainly say \\"I told you so.\\" LOL"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For those who have seen the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (or indeed have read the books), and want to find out more about the \\"back story\\", J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit may both please and disappoint - the latter, because it is so much lighter, more comedic, less sophisticated, less on the epic scale than LOTR. It is very much a children's book, and one that really should be read aloud in the night to children before bedtime. It is much more lighthearted, and has far fewer truly scary moments. However, it will please those who would like to know more about Hobbits, The Shire, Elves, Dwarves and sundry monstrous creatures that inhabit Middle Earth. The origin of Frodo's orc-detecting sword, Sting, is given; the ancestors (perhaps?) of Shelob are revealed; Bilbo himself, seen only in his great age and not for long in LOTR, is here in the prime of his life and revealing some of the characteristics of practicality and courage that reappear in Frodo. Aside from Ursula K. Le Guin's dragons, which are without parallel, the great Dragon Smaug is among the best I have encountered in fiction, and the description of his loot-filled cave is superb. The lust for gold and jewels experienced by the Dwarves is clearly the precursor of the lethal lust for the One Ring felt by so many in LOTR. Be warned: there is some horror. There is dread and anxiety. The evil creatures of The Hobbit are equally as evil as those in LOTR, but as readers we are less exposed to them, and the mood is soon lightened by the antics of either Bilbo or the Dwarves or both. There is the classic, familiar journey, or Quest; Gandalf fills the role of the wise guide and father-figure (though with less gravitas); there are terrible set-backs, unexpected hurdles, ghastly encounters and a fabulous battle scene, prefiguring the great battles of LOTR. Basically, The Hobbit is LOTR writ small, funnier, lighter and a lot shorter, but no less satisfying as a story for all that."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this book from another seller after Readinggirl never sent my book.

Sometimes I can't put them down. Sometimes it takes me forever to finish them. In regards to The Hobbit, I can say that I have read and reread this wonderful book many times. While I have read The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and most would curse me in some form of literary blasphemy, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book more than the trilogy. If I remember correctly I've read it about five or six times. (Coming from a very inconsistent reader, it has to be a pretty good recommendation.) While I loved the trilogy, I did find that the pacing of The Hobbit to be much better, and aside from the fact that this book was geared more towards children, I found the story to be exciting and very entertaining to read. (I suppose I am a bit biased since I watched the cartoon movie from when I was a child and this film greatly fascinated me, enough to end up reading the novel.) Regardless of the fact that this novel was geared towards a younger audience, one can't deny that it holds its own as a great tale of adventure and personal growth. Bilbo Baggins' transformation is one that all readers can relate to. One can't deny the impact Tolkien's work has had on the world of literature, and this piece is no exception.

In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, renowned Oxford professor of ancient languages, created a world so authentic I find it difficult to think of as fantasy. Tolkien used epic language and style when he wrote The Hobbit and the incomparable trilogy that follows it, The Lord of the Rings, as though he was retelling history. Sagacious wizard Gandalf ensnares home-loving hobbit Bilbo on an adventure with thirteen dwarves who venture forth \\"to seek the pale enchanted gold.\\" The dwarves' treasure was stolen by sinister dragon Smaug and now they want vengeance.I think Tolkien's theme of sticking together and helping each other out is timeless. I love the camaraderie between the companions such as when they are feasting at Lake-town. The book is third person limited point of view as told by an anonymous narrator but primarily reflects Bilbo's perspective. The Hobbit is an extremely fast-paced book. I highly recommend this book to anyone old enough not to be terrified of temporarily frightening dilemmas, and believe this lighter prequel should be required reading for anyone attempting Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"How would you like to be cooking breakfast and in a matter of hours be thrust into a world of adventure?

It is an excellent fantasy especially if you like resourceful protagonists, overwhelming antagonists and a hero who constantly wishes he had let the door be.This story is a real page turner because sometimes you don't have to turn the page to see that the tables have been turned. One of the best things about this story is that it is the classic \`slay the dragon' story with more than one twist.A lacking part was defiantly the denouement because at on part the author say \`Bilbo had never stopped to think how the treasure was to be removed' and I just thought that was never dealt with, he just got back to his house \`magically'.So overall I think you should read this book but prepare to be imaginative because this book has suspense in every active and more than one plot twist!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For over fifty years, THE HOBBIT has been a wonderful introduction to the world of literature. The humorous tone and fantastic imagery of dragons, lost treasure, magic rings and swords adds up to much more than mere entertainment for children: they work to present the timeless themes of heroism and identity.By now, the comfortable life of Mr. Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole at the Shire is quite famously well known. Born into a respectable family and inheriting both his home and country gentleman status, Bilbo sees little need for new experiences. So when the wizard Gandalf brings the thirteen dwarves to Bilbo's home inviting him on a quest to recover a treasure from a fierce dragon, they find Bilbo unwilling to take risk. Moreover he lacks the self confidence to test his way of thinking against the wider world.The small hobbit is surprised to find himself running out the door, without any worldly processions, and leaving his home to set out into the unknown. Thus begins one of the motifs running through out the story; in facing the unexpected an individual discovers new strength. Soon he is confronting dangerous trolls and cruel goblins. When the dwarves prove unable to make good decisions or act effectively, Bilbo must go deep into his inner reserve of courage and common-sense to lead his friends to safety. To the surprise of Bilbo and constant delight of readers; with greater danger comes greater resolve and wisdom to do what must be done.Finally Bilbo enters the heart of the Lonely Mountain and pauses to consider this crucial moment; will he go forward with his plan to confront the dragon Smaug, or turn back out of fear. The decision alone in the tunnel is the defining moment in his ability to shape his identity and assert power over his own fate. What is more Bilbo knows it, and going on in that moment reassures his strength of character for the rest of his life.In presenting his classic story of a small, common person finding identity through heroism and grand adventure, J.R.R. Tolkien gave us a powerful way to learn about ourselves. The book was a favorite of mine growing up and has been a major influence in my writing. I hope you will give this book to a young person and share the magic of literature through this extraordinary adventure.[...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an increadible tale about a quiet hobbit of the shire who is swept away on a adventure through mountains and forests who meets elves and other friends and other less freindly creatures like goblins and wolves and spiders.

A knock on the door signals about 13 dwarves, Oin, Gloin, Bombur Bofur, Nori, Ori, Dori, but most importantly, Thorin the king under the Lonely mountains. The dwarves wish for Bilbo to go on a quest to get back the dwarves sacred gold from Smaug, the Dragon. On the way the group encounters goblins, and is trapped by a hungry group of spiders. Bilbo cuts the group free by putting on the ring he found when faced with Gollum, the bad. The ring allows Bilbo to become invisible. Also escaping three very dimwitted trolls by lighting the ends of ripped out trees and shoving the fire at the hungry trolls. On the way the group must pass through the Mirkwood forest, which holds halloucinations, and horrible creatures. The forest is pitch black, and the water can make you instantly fall asleep is drank. Held hostage by Elves, bilbo retrives the keys to the groups cell house, then stuffs them in seprate barrels, allowing them to escape. One night Bilbo talks to Smaug, realizing the only weak spot of the dragon is his left chest. At the end of this incredible story, there is a great war, including eagles, dwarves, elves, and goblins. How the story ends, you must find out but i will tell you Bilbo can now tell great storys, far and wide."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son saw the \\"Lord of the rings\\" movies and hadn't known the first story of \\"the hobbitt\\".

In the book a hobbit (very small people who live in hills underground) named Bilbo Baggins is set to go on an adventure with company of dwarfs that is lead by Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf the Mage. They must go deep into the mountains take back their treasure that has been guarded by and Evil dragon named Smog. On their journey they run into a lot of trouble with odd creatures such as goblins and wolves. To find out more you're going to have to read this book.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It was an absolute triumph. There was never a boring moment in this book. It kept clinging to the book because of all the situations going on in the book. This book can suit any reader. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins was a home body who liked to stay in the Shire and mind his own business, but after Gandalf showed up on his doorstep with a group of twelve dwarves, he soon became an adventurous and courageous little hobbit. Bilbo was forced into Thorin's, the king of the dwarves, quest for his treasure that was wrongfully taken from him by the evil dragon, Smaug. On their quest for Lone Mountain, Bilbo and his companions were forced to adventure through mountains and valleys, in which they come across giant trolls, nasty goblins, and enormous spiders. With the help of Bilbo and his magical ring he found while being trapped in the darkness of the mountain, the dwarves defeat these evils and continue on their quest for home and riches. These challenges that Bilbo is faced with help build his character in order to prepare him for the battle with the wicked dragon, Smaug. In the end of the story, it is Bilbo alone who must face Smaug and recapture the mountain, while at the same time keeping peace with the armies of men, goblins, and dwarves.In my opinion, The Hobbit is a well written book that is enjoyable and interesting for all who read it. Though it is a children's fantasy, anyone who begins to read it will find themselves spending endless nights reading until morning due to the enjoyment and anticipation for the next scene. I would have to rate this book a ten out of ten for its creativity and quality of the writing. This story is a classic and a must read for all those fantasy lovers out there. Even if you're not into fantasy, I would have to suggest to you that you pick this book up right now and begin the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and his magical ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hey fans of John Ronald Ruel Tolkien!I would have given this book a six, but alas, there was no rating.

I am 13 years old and I first read the book in grade 5. Please don't put all teens and preteens in the same category, although most of the people who hated the book did seem to be around that age. Or maybe they just sounded like it. I know everyone is intitled to an opinion, but I just can't help feeling overwhelming dislike for these such people. They seem to be just as childish as they claim the book is. THE BLOODY POINT OF THE BOOK IS TO GET THE GOLD FROM THE DRAGON! I MEAN, HOW DUMB DO YA HAFTA BE?! But I guess there are just some people who'll get it, and some who won't. For those that can't, why don't you go and find a nice Atlas or something that won't stretch your beleagured brain too much.

I am rereading this book for the 4th time in anticipation of the movie. This edition of the book is great. It's sturdy, has great binding and is actually a lot more light weight than it looks. I have the same edition of The Lord Of The Rings in red leather with a red leather slipcase and that book is like a dumbbell. Granted, that book is a lot bigger in content and page count, but it's noticeably heavier than its predecessor. I like that the Hobbit is a shorter book and more light hearted in content than Lord Of The Rings. I loved the Rankin/Bass cartoon Hobbit movie, I just love the characters and the story. Traveling through Middle Earth to reclaim treasure from a Dragon is just a great idea for a book. It's so well written, the songs, the poems, the riddles in the dark. This isn't just a children's book as it was once originally thought of, this is a benchmark for modern literature and fantasy. So many pieces of fantasy that I have grown up with and been a fan of have borrowed from this book, and Tolkien's ideas and creations. And for good reason. This and The Lord of the Rings I think are two of the best books of the 20th century, and two of the best books ever written. The Hobbit is my all-time favorite book. If you haven't read it yet, you need to. This edition comes with great illustrations and a decent map to follow the protagonists on their journey to the Lonely Mountain to steal back the dwarven treasure from the great worm Smaug, the Dragon. This is my most highly recommended book to anyone who likes literature or fantasy writing. And this is definitely the best edition you can get, especially for the price."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the book it si still a great read. The download is so fast.

Absolutely love this book. Bilbo Baggins has always been and will forever remain one my favorite characters of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Myth throughout the ages has been a powerful tool for mankind, providing wonderful stories, presenting beautiful archetypes, and teaching lessons. Tolkien was a lover of the Norse myths, the Germanic, and his work shows it. The man, far from being just a professor, was a genius, creating his own mythology from myths that already came before hand. The Hobbit is a wonderful way to get started on his work. The Hobbit is very much a myth for our time, with the wise old counselor who helps the reluctant hero to realize his full potential.The story starts out with Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, living a quiet life, only to have his life interrupted by a the wizard Gandalf and a group of dwarves. It appears a rather nasty dragon has stolen the dwarves' treasures and is now making his home in their lair. It's up to poor, little Bilbo to muster the strength that he never knew he had, so that he can help reclaim what is rightfully the dwarves, all the while dealing with goblins, trolls, and other uncomfortable situations.This is the perfect book for those new to Tolkien to start with. It's not as dark, dreary, and violent as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series or \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" (all of which are wonderful must read books: \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" being my favorite) or as complex as \\"The Similarion\\" (also a must read), but an excellent starting place for most ages. This is one of the most incredible books ever written, one of the most amazing stories ever told, and I've read it numerous times. This version, with illustrations by Alan Lee, helps accentuate the mythical world Tolkien created even more, breathing life and magic into the story. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is a book I look forward to having the joy of reading to my future children, sparking their imagination, awaking the magic within them, in the process. To those that like Norse/Germanic myths, there are plenty of things you'll recognize in names and tales. In fact, there is a little nod to \\"Beowulf,\\" in it. To those that just want their imaginations to soar, to be taken to another world, then this is the right book, as it has helped inspire today's fantasy books and video games. Read this treasure and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a very beautiful book, an even more beautiful story.First of all, Houghton & Mifflin have other Tolkien's books Collector's editions:The Lord of the Rings (Collector's Edition),The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)andThe Children of Hurin: Deluxe Edition, which are, all of them, flawless. Besides these, there is several hardcover editions and paperbacks, though not the same finish of the collector's.My point is, there is little you could complain about the collector's editions.About THIS edition: I already had theThe Hobbit (Illustrated/Collector Edition)[There and Back Again], and they are practically the same but for some extra pages telling some of the always interesting story of the editions and the gold for the green color. Nonetheless, I think the green is more close to what the book is made of and I think it looks better, too. Though, they both are very beautiful works.If you want the best edition and don't mind about anniversary ones, I'd say you get the green; it's easier to find and more hobbit like.But, before you decide, take a look at the pretty little 70 anniversary editionThe Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition; it's made just like the 1937 one.The road goes ever on and on..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"That the Hobbit is a great story goes without saying. You are probably wondering if it is worth the extra money to buy this particular printing of the book. Yes it is. This is a very nice copy of the book, the larger size makes it like a coffee table book, but it's not that big. It is still small enough to sit and hold and has high quality, glossy pages. The illustrations are well done and with at least one illustration per chapter it makes it great for reading with kids."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a teacher and frequent Amazon reviewer, I'm often in the position of encouraging others to read books I've enjoyed. However, I came to \\"The Hobbit\\" in reverse fashion: at the recommendation of a ten year old boy. He had to do some convincing, too, as I'm not a fan of fantasy; I'm sure I began \\"Lord of the Rings\\" long ago and put it down.That's how I came to be curled up in a chair on a winter's afternoon, avidly following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. What drew me in? Well, events in this well-plotted novel move swiftly, of course, and the human foibles of the not-quite-human denizens of Middle Earth are surprisingly compelling. I liked the knowing voice of the omniscient narrator, with its winks and nudges, and I laughed at the middle-aged persona of Bilbo as he longs for toast and a warm fire even as he leaves his hobbit-hole further and further behind. What moved me the most, however, was the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. It is a battle that features goblins and Wargs, dwarves and elves, a shape-shifting warrior and eagle platoons, but it is full of human sorrow in the kind of devastated landscape that only human wars produce.Thus, to put it succinctly, unlike my young friend, I read the book as allegory. (I'm a grown-up; I can't help it.) I'm rather glad that I waited so long to enjoy a book that everyone else discovered a long time ago.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wasn't sure if my seven-year old son would enjoy the story of the Hobbit. I certainly *hoped* he would. His reading level isn't where it would need to be to read this book, so I decided to read this to him. I am not disappointed. This is now my fourth or fifth time reading The Hobbit, which I've had four 24 years. With no doubt, reading this to a seven-year old boy has made this absolutely the most thrilling time I've read this. We are barely more than 1/2 way through, so I'm reviewing the experience mainly. My boy asks when we can sit down and read more. He looks like he's ready to fall asleep on the couch but wants me to press on. He pictures himself as the hobbit (being the same size and all), carrying Sting at his side. I try to make as many expressions as I can to read and he reacts to the book. And the mind of a seven-year old catches details that his poor father has missed along the way. I will be sad when we finish this book. This is proving to be a great bonding experience and so I'm paying more attention to every detail in the book and that only increases my enjoyment value of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I finished reading The Hobbit with my 4-year-old today, and I'm honestly sad that we're already through the book. What with the epic scope and the formal writing of The Lord of the Rings, it's easy to forget just how accessible, charming, and even funny The Hobbit really is. At its core, The Hobbit is a simple adventure story - a reluctant hero who accompanies some dwarves on a quest to recapture a dragon's gold - but as with all of Tolkien's work, it's the richness of the world that truly captures the imagination. From arrogant dragons to irritable Elven kings, from greedy relatives to goblin warriors, Tolkien creates a world that you could easily get lost in. But first and foremost, he weaves a great adventure yarn. Here's a story with underground mazes, riddle contests, capable (if a little arrogant) wizards, bizarre creatures, and so much more, and Tolkien ties it all into a compulsively enjoyable read. And, yes, as serious and epic as Rings is, The Hobbit is funnier and more enjoyable. Gandalf gets some wonderfully dry lines, the narrator is a little sarcastic, Bilbo genuinely likeable...I could go on and on. Here's all you need to know: both this 30-year-old and my 4-year-old often read more than we planned on every night, and we were both a little sad to get to the end of it today. And doesn't that really say everything about the lasting appeal and richness of this classic?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book. I'm going to read Lord of the Rings next.

That's my opinion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Everyone has read The Hobbit, and with Peter Jackson's movie under production at this writing, many will be reading it for a tenth or twentieth time.Is The Hobbit a children's book? Yes and no. Keep in mind the man, and the times. Tolkien was a survivor of trench warfare in the World War, the most brutal and dehumanizing form of hate and ugliness mankind had yet devised. He would not have been eager to glorify combat, and indeed the focus is on the adventure rather than the hack and slash.I'll not compare the morals and mores of 1930s Britain to the world of today, except to note that children then were more mature, and adults were less jaded. The Hobbit struck the right balance for the time. In a world without television, Middle Earth was good entertainment.In my re-reading, I found one particular passage very interesting. Recall the scene of confrontation between Thorin Oakenshield's dwarves and the men of the devastated Lake-town. Bard makes an appeal to Thorin for a share of the treasure, citing the damage and death done to innocents and the fact that a good portion of the gold had come from their ancestors. A very stirring case, and the reader finds himself nodding along. \\"Yeah! We gave the dwarves food and shelter, and sang songs about them, and they went up there and got Old Smaug all fired up, and now they're going to keep all the cookies? All we got out of the deal was burnt stumps where our town used to be!\\"*But then Thorin makes his reply, reminding the Lake-men that he himself is the rightful heir to the Kingdom Under The Mountain. \\"You people come marching up here to my house, armed with bows and spears, demanding a share of what is mine? You can leave you weapons at home, and ask nicely, and we might talk. But as it is, you look like thieves and robbers, and we don't negotiate with terrorists!\\"*Both are good arguments, so who is right? It may not be the exact point Tolkien is trying make, but I took from this the thought that forced charity isn't charity at all - that a grudging charity only leads to hatred and bloodshed. The author doesn't answer the question; the standoff is resolved when goblins swarm down the mountain and all sides must unite for survival.Or maybe that is his answer.Read The Hobbit again. It's still as good as it was the first time. And if you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?*I'm paraphrasing, of course."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

When I first read 'The Hobbit', I was a fourteen year old High School student who had, at that time, not yet learned the true enjoyment of reading. Considered by many to be a book for children, which indeed it is written to be appealing to children, it is also much more than that, in being a wonderfully enjoyable tale for all ages.Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit approaching middle age, living a respectable, and comfortable life in is little Hobbit hole. Then Gandalf the Wizard, along with thirteen Dwarves, appeared on his door step for tea one afternoon, and after that meeting, Bilbo's life was changed for ever, as was the fate of Middle Earth. Bilbo endured many adventures during his travels with Thorin Oakenshield and his band of Dwarves, as they quested for the enchanted gold of the Dragon Smaug.All in all, a wonderful read, a wonderfully written story filled with magical beings that set the imagination to sparkle. I would suggest this book for any child or adult.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a really nice unabridged reading of the Hobbit.

His different voices for each character adds a little extra to this timeless story. I consider myself a veteran reader of The Hobbit, The Silmarillion along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I cannot count the times I have read all the books. I started reading them back in the 70s long before the resent popularity push. The story is a great escape from my stressful life style. This rendition is no different. The only drawback I have to listening to an audiobook is my concentration level. If I play the CDs while roaming the web or doing other work, I loose a lot of the story. There is nothing better than settling down with a good book, but I guess someone else reading it to you comes in a close second. This audiobook is one that should be used as a bedtime story for the young'ns. That is why Mr. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, and here is your chance to be a hero for once."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat.

GREAT JOB"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'll be honest. It's pretty much impossible for me to really review J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Tolkien's 1937 prelude to The Lord of the Rings is my favorite book, ever, and has been ever since I first read it upon my father's recommendation when I was twelve. Since then, I've re-read it more times than I can count. However, with this read, I've done something new - I listened to the fantastic audiobook rendition read by Rob Inglis. So, I'll be focusing on that.Many readers, especially fantasy fans, are already familiar with The Hobbit, and even those who don't fit those categories are likely to know the basic premise with the recent first film in Peter Jackson's three part adaptation of the novel. So, I'll only briefly discuss the novel itself.The hobbit of the title is Bilbo Baggins, a well-to-do and - on the surface - boring hobbit of the Shire. To Bilbo's surprise, the wizard Gandalf recruits Bilbo to join exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield and his company of twelve dwarves in reclaiming their home and treasure at the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, the terrible dragon who conquered the Mountain many years ago. Of course, even getting to the Mountain is no small task, and Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and company have many exciting adventures.In Recorded Books 1991 production, narrator Rob Inglis delivers a masterful reading of The Hobbit. It's a rather challenging book, when one reflects that it contains dwarves (thirteen of them!), elves, men, goblins, trolls, spiders, wargs, Gollum, and a dragon, all with major speaking roles. Inglis does a fantastic job of giving each character a unique voice while also making them recognizable as one of their kind. No small task, that, but on top of it, Tolkien includes a great deal of singing and poetry in The Hobbit, and Inglis even sings like dwarves, elves, or goblins.This production was recorded a decade before Jackson's Lord of the Rings films and two decades before The Hobbit films, so Inglis never imitates the well-known actors when creating his voices but uses his own excellent interpretations of the characters. Inglis also recorded The Lord of the Rings for Recorded Books. I'm sure that will be excellent as well, and it's next on my listening list.This unabridged recorded of The Hobbit runs approximately 11 hours, and is a full telling the book as written, and not one of the various dramatizations produced over the years. As such a fan of the original book, I'm happy to have found this unabridged and well-narrated but not dramatized edition.I highly recommend The Hobbit as a novel to anyone, and am currently reading it to my children. Fans of The Hobbit or audiobooks will be very pleased with Rob Inglis' performance of the novel. The Hobbit is a classic well worthy of the name."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Love the lord of the rings books. I wanted to reread before seeing the movies.

If anyone is sick and tired of the endless jargon and imagery of Tolkien's LOTR series, this will provide the backround that make those book's language not completely pointless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was OK. I wasn't interested in the Lord of the Rings until the hobbit movie came out and it created such a buzz I just had to find out for myself. I really think that the whole make believe world really isn't for me. Great book for someone who is into that type of thing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Quite a number of five-star ratings have been heaped on this book, and I don't think it's terribly shocking to add mine to the pile. However, those familiar with my somewhat critical reviews of the Lord of the Rings series may ask why, exactly, I rate the Hobbit higher. After all, most people in the modern age tend to almost ignore the Hobbit in favor of Tolkien's later trilogy on the war of the ring. Part of this, of course, can be attributed to the movie version, but what is it about the Hobbit that makes it so special?I honestly think that the way people ignore the Hobbit may have something to do with its difference in tone from the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit contains stronger fantasy elements, such as being attacked by a horde of giant spiders, burned almost to death by a dragon, or having boulders thrown at you by the giants in the mountains, and yet, it treats them all perfectly casually, whereas later books would have felt the need to explain these strange happenings. The Hobbit only explains things like this when they're unique, even for Middle Earth. It doesn't take itself as seriously as LOTR did, which actually added to my appreciation of it.It's a story about a small, peace-loving fellow named Bilbo Baggins, and how he goes on an exciting adventure with the old wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves; refugees from the Lonely Mountain, which is now inhabited by the ferocious dragon Smaug. They have many adventures before, after and during their incursion into the mountain, and Bilbo gets to show his mettle as a burglar, a fighter and a treasure-hunter. There are tragedies and battles over the course of the book, and eventually, Bilbo becomes more of a man, and receives honor, riches and the suspicion of his friends and neighbors for doing something so \\"unexpected.\\"The goblins, the spiders, the elves, the dragon, giants, Beorn, the dwarves and so on and so forth. It was good, clean fun, and I loved it all. Men factor into this book, but not nearly as much as in the Lord of the Rings, so by and large, this book is about fantasy in its purest form; fantasy people going on an exciting adventure, learning lessons about themselves and their world, doing incredible things, meeting interesting people, and finding themselves well-rewarded for all their hard work. It's the essence of the fantasy story.Even Bilbo's job as a burglar rarely leads him into doing anything questionable. Yes, he sort of stole the Ring, but Gollum wanted to kill him, so it was his only means of survival. Defending one's survival is enough of a reason to justify this. The same can be said of the meals he stole in the elf prison. The treasure they took from Smaug was really theirs anyway, so it wasn't stealing, as much as taking what was rightfully theirs, and as for the Arkenstone...The Arkenstone. That's an aspect of the story I found puzzling. Bilbo does eventually justify this by ransoming his share of the treasure in exchange for it, so I guess it's just fine morally. Still, I did find it something of an interesting moral dilemma when I first read this book, which, I guess, just makes the story even better, when you think about it.I also found the battles exceptionally-good and well-written. They were described about as well as in later works, but I found them more interesting, on the whole, because of the way the movements and actions of the enemy forces were described. They're the sort of battles that one can actually picture in their mind. Not myth-making battles, like the Shelob fight from the Two Towers, perhaps, but certainly very believable ones once the fantasy elements are taken for granted.It's really hard to write a story about a hired thief who never really does anything morally wrong, and yet, under analysis, the Hobbit seems to be just such a book. A rare and special type of book indeed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Having The Hobbit on my Kindle is a great way to enjoy this classic. Even the maps at the beginning of the book appear pretty clear."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I ordered the Unabridged CD Audiobook of the Hobbit read by Rob Inglis, and I've got to say it's just perfect.

And it is exactly what I was expecting; High quality, with stellar narration by Rob Inglis, and an excellent book besides. In fact it's my favorite book, and you won't regret getting this if you like Tolkein or Audiobooks, because it's the best of both."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is, of course, an incredible book for children and adults.

I remember falling in love with it when I first read it, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I like to reread the wonderful book now and again as an adult, particularly around Holiday season."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book,I have wanted to read this for years. I highly recommend this book.

I like to say that Tolkien wrote the former for someone of similar education as him, a professor of English or some such at Oxford, an expert of the English language and history, whereas The Hobbit was written for children - for well-educated smart and savvy children but still for children and who knows? Maybe I am a kid at heart. I Loved The Hobbit!The story is beyond engaging. The descriptions are brilliant. The humor is well-placed and just delicious. The dialogues that Bilbo Baggins carries on in his head and the conclusive remarks that Tolkien makes here and there, makes you think he is just sitting in a park, surrounded with kids, doing a reading... and making observations. Oh I just loved it.I do wish there was more of Smaug, and I had hoped that he would be the ultimate climax to the end. I felt a similar way in The Lord of the Rings. The ending happened and then Tolkien was going on and on in an anticlimactic sorta way. The story really should've ended but who am I to complain? There was more of Bilbo to read and love.Fantastic read even if you are not a fantasy fiction junkie.

Though it was not my introduction to fantasy, it was one of the first books of fantasy that I had read. Now, a couple decades later, I returned to the Hobbit in preparation for the movie coming out in December 2012.The story is straight forward. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable Hobbit living a respectable life, somehow finds himself part of an adventure. An adventure of all things! Adventures are not respectable. And yet somehow Bilbo is bamboozled into it. On the adventure Bilbo finds himself in the company of a wizard and 13 dwarves. Definitely not respectable company. This particular adventure involves trolls, endless roads, no chances for second breakfast, elves, men who turn into bears, goblins, more elves, and even a dragon. And of course, Gollum and a rather famous ring. Trying to write a review of this particular book without giving away spoilers is hard, but necessary. But you may be wondering what is the point of the adventure. Well now . . . the point of the quest is to reclaim the stolen dwarf treasure from the dragon, Smaug.

For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship [on the ship] \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character ([for [all his]] though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life expereince to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past [When - give examples of this]Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others). [the whole affair of ] This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising [ever renewing] battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent [work] heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicility prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This 75th anniversary edition is full of great original illustrations, maps and some full color illustrations which delight my children as I read this story.

I first picked them up my freshman year in highschool and I haven't been able to put them down since. I have read all of them 5 times at least, and each time they seem to get more magical. Tolkien, like no other writer, is able to take the reader and actually put them into his book. His writing is full of detail, and the vividness of the scenes he paints grabs the readers attention and doesn't let go. It is by far the greatest literary work of the 20th century, and in my opinion the greatest ever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is quite simply, wonderful. It can stand on its own as a self contained story, but when read in conjunction with the Lord of the Rings, it's deceptive simplicity suddenly falls away. Many people have said you don't need to read this in order to enjoy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and this is true. However, you are cheating yourself if you don't. Many major and key players from LOTR are introduced here, not to mention the extremely important moment when Bilbo Baggins finds a lost ring in the caves under the mountain. This story is less than 100 years old, yet it resonates and feels like Tolkien was basically rewriting old myths. The argument for this can indeed come from some of the source materials that Tolkien used, but as far as I can see, the story is wholly original. It's wonderful that in the age when everything was modern and sleek, Tolkien gifted the world with this age old story. This book may have been written for kids, but I have noticed that many more adults seem to enjoy it than children. It may be Tolkien's overly descriptive language can turn kids off, but this book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book full of adventure and fantasy.

My friend was the one who reccomended it to me. And i was reluctant at first but now I'm glad I did. I would recomend it to anyone who likes fantasy books that have lots of magic, magical creatures(and none magical),and anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien has been one of the better books I have read in quite a while. The detail and language Tolkien uses is unique in that authors don't go the distance as he does to describe something. The Hobbit takes place in a world filled with elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other mythical creatures. The hero of the story is a hobbit, which are small men, named Bilbo Baggins. He receives a call for adventure when a well-known wizard, Gandalf, and a troop of dwarves show up on his porch, asking for his assistance. Hobbits generally never like adventuring and would rather stay home, but Bilbo reluctantly accepts their offer. The dwarves main quest is to retrieve their lost treasure that is currently guarded by an evil dragon. I gave this book a 4 out of 5 because it's one of those books that you have to read in your life. Whether you hear people talking about it, or just find it in a library, Tolkien was one of those rare authors that everyone could enjoy. The book did a great job on detail, settings, characters, and development. Reading this book reminded me a lot of Brian Jacques, Redwall series. They share a similar style of writing that gives me a sense of de-ja vu while I'm reading. In every sentence there is a detailed description of even the smallest thing. The characters in the book were also one of the reasons I gave it a high rating. Each one was unique, and had his or her own personality. The only thing it lacked was that it needed a little more action. There was a lot of excitement throughout the whole book, but it only seemed to get action packed at the end of the book. Even with its flaws it's still one of the best books I have read and will probably continue reading the series. It is worth reading whether you're new to Tolkien books, or enjoy just reading fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein is a great novel. The magical setting of the story creates a world like none other. It is a novel comparable to that of a fairy tale, but it still retains a sense of reality. The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, the main character, keep the reader interested and wanting to read more. This novel does a great job of keeping the reader interested. The plot has many small climaxes and resolutions that create a very exciting plot. This novel is also extremely easy to read. It reads quickly also, it can easily be read in a weekend. This novel is also very easy to comprehend. The plot is very straightforward which adds to the quick reading. This novel allows the reader to escape into a mystical realm which is not found to often in modern books.

They all enjoyed it, but only one,the daughter, has accompanied me on this trek through Middle Earth. This mastery of fantasy has brought me and mine, hours of literary pleasure. No other author of fantasy has been able to touch JRR Tolkien, in respect to depth and intricacies of storyline. Bilbo Baggins will always be my favorite character because of the way JRR Tolkien presented him to us. If you haven't read it, do so, and if you have, give it as a gift to someone you feel is a kindred spirit and you 'll enjoy with them a new realm.

JRR Tolkien created an entire world, several languages and most importantly a story that will stand the test of time. Especially with the Lord of the Rings triology that followed Tolkien made Fantasy books what they are: an anology of our own history, both good and bad. The marshalling of the good powers against Mordor was nothing but WWII written in a fantasy style; superbley done. Most fantasy novels today are old reruns of Tolkiens work; I read some and give the books away; I still have The Hobbit, The Triology and The Simmerelian.

KhauP. 5This book takes place before the Fellowship of the ring which is part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, who is a hobbit that lives his peaceful life at the Shire. Hobbits are little people that live in comfortable holes. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf visits Bilbo and invites him to go out on an adventure with some dwarves. Bilbo agrees and his adventure starts. Little does he know of what challenges with he run across...One thing I like about this book is the way the author describes something.&quot;Hobbits are little people, smaller than dwarfs. They love peace and quiet and good tilled earth. They dislike machines, but they are handy with tools. They are nimble but don't like to hurry. They have sharp ears and eyes. They are inclined to be fat. They wear bright colors but seldom wear shoes. They like to laugh and eat(six meals a day)and drink. They like parties and they like to give and recieve presents. They inhabit a land they call The Shire, a place between the River Brandywine and the Far Downs.&quot;This is an excellent quote that is discriptive and simple at the same time. It caught my attention and provided me with lots of background information that I would stumble and be confused without.One thing that I dislike about this book is the way it lengthens things that are boring or get boring. Most of these things are not important in the story and easily get forgotten.They can also confuse you.&quot;You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.&quot;This is an example of somethings I dislike. If you are not really concentrated, this could confuse you. I had to read over that paragraph a couple times before I acually understood much of it. Later on in the book this paragraph seems irrelevant. You should also only try to read this book if you have a lot of time to spare. It is pretty long and there are lots of parts in the book that will take some time to understand.My favortie part of the book is the beginning. It caught my attention with good descriptions. They were not too long and acually told you how something looked or felt. There was no junk about descriptions that you can't even visualize and remember enough to care. The beginning was solid and it didn't leave you confused and wondering what the author meant. My least favorite part was Chapter 18. It didn't lead to an ending well. There were a couple boring parts that I wish were taken out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's main character in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is evidently a hobbit, who is unknowingly volunteered to go on a dangerous adventure with 13 other dwarves. A wizard by the name of Gandalf is the one responsible for volunteering Bilbo. As the 14 journey towards the Lonely Mountains to retrieve their long lost fortune, they are faced with many fantastical obstacles.The wild adventure leads the 14 dwarves to many creatures and goblins, including one named Gollum. Bilbo wins a gold ring from Gollum, which later on becomes the basis for the series, \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" What does this ring mean for Bilbo? How does it change his unwanted adventure?I am not usually a big fan of fantasy type literature, however I enjoyed, \\"The Hobbit,\\" very much. I waited to see the cartoon version of, \\"The Hobbit,\\" until after I had finished the book. My sister and friends had always loved Tolkien, and I had never given him the chance. Tolkein did an excellent job of making a very unreal setting, real to the reader. The setting and characters were extremely well described. Tolkien describes every tiny thing, right from the beginning. Even the hobbit's hole, which is not an important part of the story, is described in great detail. An author's ability to suspend disbelief is very important to the pleasure the reader obtains from the book, especially if the reader is already skeptical. There was really not a transition from realistic world into the fantasy world. The Hobbit instead slowly leads the reader into a more fantastical world through the chapters. The adventure and plot of the story really keep the reader interested and not wanting to put the book down. I can now understand why so many people have gone crazy over Tolkien's writing. I plan on reading Tolkien's, \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" series very soon. I just cannot get over the great detail he puts in his setting and characters as he writes.I think that the Hobbit would be a difficult read for elementary students. However I think it would be perfect for middle school or high school students. It could be used as an excellent choice to read aloud to students in elementary. I am not sure about parents reaction to Tolkien's writing, but I would love to use some of his work in my own classroom."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is perhaps one of the best-written books about the advantages of having parties. Written relatively early in his days as an Oxford don, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a strongly autobiographical novel about Tolkien and his status as a party man. His reputation as a party enthusiast was so secure, in fact, that Tolkien regularly was the host to impromptu parties as other Oxford and even Cambridge professors would appear uninvited at his home with the expectation of a good meal, some beer or wine, and rousing party games.It is such experiences that form the basis for \\"The Hobbit.\\" A sedentary fellow, much like Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins finds himself the unassuming host of a party of dwarves (more established professors) and the wizard Gandalf (the president of the university).Wooed by promises of great wealth, and strongly encouraged by Gandalf, Bilbo joins the dwarves on a quest to regain their lost ancestral gold, an action that represents Tolkien's own quest for tenure, a position that, once secured, would guarantee him employment, a place to live, social status, and ultimately a healthy retirement package.The story follows Tolkien-as-Bilbo's journey to the heart of the Lonely Mountain, where he must confront the dragon Smaug (the experience of teaching undergraduate and graduate students) and be swept up in the dramatic Battle of Five Armies, a situation not unlike peer review.And in the course of the story, Bilbo acquires a magical Ring that secures his reputation with the dwarves, much as Tolkien's literary and liguistic prowess, developed through education, secured his position in academia.A thoroughly fascinating and enchanting book, \\"The Hobbit\\" will have you wishing again and again for the opportunity to attend more parties and, even more, to host them yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit&#65533; is a lightly-written fairy-tale of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins&#65533; journey to the Dwarven home. It includes elves, a wizard, and wonderfully odd characters such as Tom Bombadil and the River&#65533;s Daughter. Bilbo is caught up in a strange adventure with a troupe of dwarves and a wizard. The tone of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; is very different from the rest of the series; it is an adult story written as a children&#65533;s story. Bilbo awakens one morning to an old man blowing smoke rings outside of his &#65533;hole in the ground&#65533;. This old man rested on a staff and wore a pointed blue hat, and his beard hung nearly to his waist. It seems the old wizard, Gandalf, has chosen Bilbo as the fourteenth man to accompany a troup of thirteen dwarves. Thirteen is an unlucky number, and in any case they needed a good burglar. That Bilbo never considered himself a burglar, and in fact had never burgled, bothered the wizard not in the slightest.I think that part of the success of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; can be attributed to its &#65533;moral&#65533; about war (which I can&#65533;t explain further until you&#65533;ve read the book, and then you won&#65533;t need me to). But it is also an engaging story of a middle-aged nobody&#65533;s coming-of-age. Bilbo passes through fire, literally, and emerges, if not a hero, than at least a story-teller.Overall I think this is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good read. Other good books are Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusion and L ARon Hubbard's Battleship Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's great galaxy of hobbits, wizards, dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons that he so deftly invented all by himself is quite vastly celebrated throughout the 20th century. In fact, his unique vision is so immensely popular that anything tasting of mystic whimsicality is at once labelled &quot;Tolkienesque&quot;. And over the years, his very first story, &quot;Hobbit&quot; had been getting its share of artwork from many different artists. Some are brilliantly colorful and others are just plain drab. Here in this 60th-anniversary book with the title in gold, Alan Lee created very gray watercolor paintings for its illustrations. Unfortunately, I find them quite dry and lifeless though he does have a good hand at drawing characters, trees, and mountainous passes. Instead, I would have preferred brilliant, deeply detailed fantasy art dramatically showing every emotion, every conflict, and every magic-working either in full colors or in very dark, gloomy tones. But with a very deep depth rather than those rather transparent watercolors."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This edition is supposed to be enhanced with media clips on iOS kindle apps.

A definite must read for any and all readers"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As described. Old, used copy of the Hobbit with just a few pencil underline marks. The thing was about a dollar, though, so I can't complain."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After all, that's what the author did. The first time I read this, I was in First Grade. I loved it. The author brings you into a world all his own, brilliantly detailed and filled with marvelous characters. The hero of the story, Bilbo, does good and wonderful things in the service of his companions, even when he knows they may not appreciate it.If you are a parent who is concerned about what to read to your children out of moral or religious concerns, you have nothing to fear from this book. The author, a Christian and friend of C.S. Lewis, did not let any muddled theology into his book. It is simply an unforgetable adventure with magic, (no explicable source)Goblins, Trolls, dragons, an enchanted river, and giant spiders. You and your children will enjoy this book for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, and it's more involved sequel (TLOTR), is without question the first and strongest source of my desire to read and to write. As a child, my camp counsellor read segments of The Hobbit as a bedtime activity. I often fell asleep to the tales of Bilbo and his dwarven companions, only to wake up saddened that I didn't make it to the climax of the scene before nodding off. At 10 years of age I came home from camp demanding that my mother buy me this most remarkable book so that I might learn what exactly happened to my new friends (the counsellor wisely wouldn't tell me what I had missed!). I read the book (the first adult book I actually chose to read without a teacher making me) and then read it again! The detailed painting of Middle Earth, and the characters thereof, ignited my imagination.I became an avid reader, always in search of that magic that would transport me to another place, another time. Though I have found many, many books that I have enjoyed reading, there has never been a book that has so utterly captured my imagination and my heart as Tolkien's The Hobbit.The Lord of the Rings is truly a masterpiece of modern literature, and I would recommend it to any that are in search of a wondrous adventure, but I have never mentioned the trilogy without insisting-demanding-that the person first get lost in its prequel. Though TLOTR stands alone, The Hobbit, with its easy style, scaled-down history, lesser characters, and fewer scene changes, is completely indispensible for a deep understanding of what comes next.Tolkien's biography may scare off the casual reader if they hear of his scholarly background, but do not be fooled: His works are more accessible to the reader than anything by Ann Rice, Stephen King, or Frank Herbert. Though no less intelligent or involving Tolkien manages to give the reader a much more &quot;immersive&quot; experience, transporting them into his world, rather than projecting the world onto and around them as most other authors do.I took a cue from that long-ago camp counsellor and began to read The Hobbit to my little son, the moment he was past Green Eggs And Ham. Often now(he's seven), he asks me to read specific passages to him, usually the Bilbo/Smaug confrontations or, sometimes, the adventures with the trolls or the spiders.Yes, this book is a vehicle in which I share &quot;quality time&quot; with my young son. It is also my literary inspiration. I enjoy writing. Whenever I run into a block I pick up my copy and open it randomly. By the end of the page, I'm back at my typewriter, filled with renewed enthusiasm, if not new ideas.I cannot recommend this novel more heartily, and cannot recommend more desperately that you read it before some teacher tells you to do it as a book report. Do it as an assignment, and you will go into the story filled with a bitterness that will ruin the glory of Middle Earth.Remember: when my son, Matthew, is in one of his moods during the day, or depressed about one thing or another right before bedtime, I lean over and whisper something in his ear that brings a smile to his face and a twinkle to his eyes...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The movie will be out soon. However, there is still time to do the right thing and read the book first! From what I hear, the movie is going to be outstanding. But even if our collective hair stands on end, the earth shakes beneath our feet, and a magnificent rapture proclaims us saved for all time...well, I digress. Anyway, my point is, it would be nice for audience members to acknowledge one of the greatest works of fantasy ever put to paper before they see the movie. So if you are debating whether to read the book or wait for the film, let me promptly put an end to that discussion: READ THE BOOK!!!Why is The Hobbit so great? For me, it has always been the character of Bilbo Baggins. He is lovable yet flawed, brave yet frightened. He is, for lack of a better description, very human!Like so many that toil through work days, constantly fighting through the challenges and sorrows of life, Bilbo finds himself thrown into the cross-hairs of evil and injustice. While we face the daily barrage of family problems and feuds, enemies, disease and the general unfairness of life, Bilbo also finds himself on a similar battlefield. Instead of a sinister real-life boss, Bilbo matches wit with the manipulative Gollum. Instead of a gang of criminals, Bilbo battles spiders. No matter what the fictional representation may be, the same code of honor all righteous men hold dear is manifested in Bilbo's duty to do the right thing.After all this time, Tolkien remains the ultimate master of placing the reader front and center in this remarkable fantasy. Tolkien makes us relate to the main character because Bilbo is just like you and me. Bilbo is every man. He is the reluctant hero kicking and screaming his way through the avalanche of predicaments that sooner or later pay us all a visit. His triumph is our own. In my opinion, The Hobbit is a testament to this truth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\`The Hobbit' by J. R. R. Tolkien is often described as the prequel to the much longer \`Lord of the Rings'. I often thought that designation simply does not do justice to the importance of this little \`children's' book.I have an almost reverential respect for the novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. I can appreciate that there are adult readers such as my Hemingway loving uncle who simply \`don't get it'. I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!\`The Hobbit' shares many similarities with \`Alice in Wonderland' in that both authors were distinguished Oxford dons who created the works out of stories they made up for young listeners. The differences are as interesting as the similarities. While Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) was a logician, Tolkien was a philologist. So, while both, in a sense, studied language, the differences in their avocations are evident in their text. Dodgson's works are full of logical curiosities and Tolkien's works are full of linguistic inventions, going so far as to create parts of at least three different languages to put into the mouths of his \`Hobbit' and \`Lord of the Rings' characters. But Tolkien went much further than simply creating languages. Even Carroll dabbled in creating words (see the poem \`Jabberwocky'). Tolkien created whole histories of a huge continent ruled by demiurges very similar to the Olympian gods and populated by at least three races of immortal elves, seven clans of dwarves, dragons, trolls, giant spiders, goblins, shapeshifting men, giant eagles, intelligent wolves, and some horrors too unspeakable to bring up here, as they do not appear in \`The Hobbit'.This history was probably not committed to paper as Tolkien was writing \`The Hobbit', but it was certainly in the back of his mind. And, it is this sense of great depth to Middle Earth's history that gives one great added pleasure in reading this book.For the three adults who don't know the story of \`The Hobbit', it is the tale of a band thirteen homeless dwarves lead by a former king of their clan, Thorin Oakenshield who wishes to reclaim his home and treasure from a rather large and rather cunning dragon named Smaug. Thorin meets up with the wizard, \`Gandalf the Gray' and over a pint of ale, hatch the scheme of hiring a thief and raiding their treasure from right under the dragon's nose. The thief who Gandalf selects is a most unlikely adventurer, a hobbit who is even more set in his comfortable ways than is usual for these very comfortable rural folk. But hobbits happen to have a few attributes that make them especially good at burglary. They are quiet in the extreme when sneaking up on something and they are exceptionally good with slings and hurling projectiles by hand.I will not tell much more of the plot, as the unfolding of the story is by far one of the greatest pleasures. This is in no way a character study; it's all about landing in trouble and getting out of it by the skin of their teeth. Aside from banishing a major league dragon from their cozy mines, the main point of the story is the finding of a magical golden ring, which is the jumping off point of \`Lord of the Rings'.There is another less obvious connection between \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings'. Gandalf's support of Thorin's adventure is not done out of the goodness of his heart, it is done to remove a major calamity from the playing field before Sauron, the ultimate heavy in \`The Lord of the Rings', can make use of Smaug. Even though dragons seem to be a pretty independent lot, there is no questions that Sauron could not bend even Smaug to his will, especially if Sauron recovered the \`One Ring'.One thing which always disappointed me about the great historical back story behind \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is that the origin and history of the wizards in Middle Earth is never fully spelled out. The history of the elves is done in great detail, but little is directly told of Gandalf, Saruman, and the other three wizards. The only thing of which I can be sure is that unlike Beorn, the eagles, and humans, they are not native to Middle Earth. There is but a single reference to a race of magicians in \`The Silmarillion', but neither the name Gandalf or Mithrandir appears anywhere in this last of Tolkien's major works.Since having read \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings', I have searched in vain for tales of equal quality and there are none. Arthurian legends come close and next to Gandalf, Merlin is easily my favorite fictional character, but Tolkien seems to have hit a mother lode of wonder and lore was before and remains hidden to other writers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story is superb, but I will not cover the story.The cover, pages, and binding are of high quality.

I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is beyond description... Gee Whiz, I am surprised that it's not more popular...If you have written any other books, would you please send me their names?John Barrow, 12 yrs., West Town PA.I thought these extracts from a letter I got yesterday would amuse you.

But I suppose one should be grateful for the grace and fortune that have allowed me to provide even the drop. God bless you beloved.

Anyway, it's a great first step into the fantasy genre and will immediately make you aware of the pretenders out there; In fact, annoyingly so. I now spend my time looking for something as great, but still original. This has led me to the likes ofPerdido Street Stationby China Mi&eacute;ville,13 1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebearby Walter Moers and the little known but excellentInto The Treesby J. Alastair Nash.

His illustrations capture the tone and the mystique of Middle Earth better than any others I have seen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out.A brief note about the annotations. There are a lot of them. Most of the annotations note changes from the previous versions, particularly changes made to account for discrepancies between the 1937 Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter underwent particularly dramatic revisions. Other annotations discuss the origins of words or concepts in the story. The book also includes dozens of illustrations from various versions of the Hobbit. Few of these sketches impressed me, except for Tolkien's, whose is surprisingly good. I'd definitely recommend reading the annotated version if this is your second or third read through this story, but for first time readers it might prove more a distraction than a help."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've always loved the Hobbit, so even though I own the hardcover version, it made sense to get a digital copy for my Kindle. I wasn't sure if the Kindle version would do the book justice, but this edition is quite good. Tolkien's images are beautifully reproduced, and the songs are formatted in a way that meets the style treatment Tolkien envisioned. My only complaint revolves around two issues common to many Kindle products:The first is that in a few places there's an unexpected line break in the middle of a sentence. This happens on many Kindle books, and seems to be a symptom of a greater problem, where these books are not as carefully edited as hardcopy books. But this is a minor issue.The second problem is that when you click on a link in the \\"Illustrations\\" list to view the map or illustration, only on the Kindle itself can you quickly get back to where you stopped reading. On the iPhone or iPad there's no convenient \\"back\\" button for this action, forcing you to manually find your way back to the page you were on prior to looking at the map or other illustration. You can create a bookmark, but it's an extra step that's complex and shouldn't be necessary. This is an interface problem related to the Kindle software itself and not really a complaint with this specific book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien at his best!!!!

I am able to enter into the story, suffer along with the characters, feel with them, be sorry for their travails, be saddened by their foolishness, and mourn as Thorin Oakenshield, Kili and Fili die in battle. It is difficult to read this book and not see foreshadowing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; though that is not the best way to read it. It does not tie perfectly with the latter book, there are a couple of points which don't link, quite. But for the most part i see the trilogy in the book, and had to be careful not to push it too much to the girls ~ apart from anything else, it is probably a little above them right now, and it would certainly be a major commitment to read. Standing by itself, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a wonderful story, with a well-wrought plot, characters that are near enough human for us to relate to them, yet far enough from us for the enchantment to work, and enough stylistic ties to legend, myth, and saga that it is familiar to me and will ring echoes in the girls' ears as they read further."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien can only be described as a mideival fantasy. It is the story of how a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with some newly made friends to find the fortune that awaits them. His companions are 13 dwarves variously sized but all about half the size of a human. The wizard Gandalf also greatly helps on their adventure. The reason all of this got started was because when the head dwarf of the group named Thorin Oakenshield, was just a young boy the castle he and his family lived in was destroyed by the dragon Smaug. His family and friends were all killed and he barely escaped with his life. He vowed revenge and to take bake the kingdom that would have once been his. His long time friend Gandalf helps get the motley bunch together and they start on their adventure. On their way they encounter such things as goblins, spiders, elves, ravenous wolves and the horrid golum. In the end it turned out the dwarves started a huge war which they ended up winning and as they vowed, they took back what was rightfully theirs. I would absolutely recomend this book to anyone, anywhere. This is not only one of my favorite books, but listening to other peoples reviews, their favorite too. Tolkien creates his own little world, filled with adventure and fun in this novel.

He began to read some to me every night before I went to sleep. He was frustrated (yet proud) when I couldn't wait for the next night to hear more and began to read it on my own.I have read The Hobbit at least 50 times since then, understanding the story in a different way at each age (I am now 23.) I am just as sucked in by the creatures' adventures as I was when I was young. I have to be in a certain mood to read the rest of the Lord of the Rings series, but I can always read the Hobbit.I am studying to be a teacher and I recently used The Hobbit in a mock lesson demonstrating a teaching strategy to my peers. I would love to use The Hobbit when I have my own class. I think the story is exciting and scary and appeals to elementary and high school students alike. There is much &quot;SAT vocabulary&quot; that I believe ought to be in a person's everyday usage. I was sorely disappointed when my classmates did not understand such words as &quot;repose&quot;, &quot;requisite&quot;, and &quot;defrayed&quot; which appeared in a short note left to the main character Bilbo. The just of the note was that his friends were thanking him for hospitality and accepting his offer of professional assistance; followed by the terms of the business venture. Anyway, my classmates thought that someone in the story had died because one of the terms was that the business partners would pay for Bilbo's funeral expenses if he died and there was no one to pay for them.Complaining about our present educational level aside, I think this book could be used in many ways; discussions of journeys, how spiders spin webs, are there different levels of stealing? what does it take to make a decision that changes your life completely, as well as everyone else's expectations of you, and more.Most importantly, this book is fun for both teachers and students to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hey, this book is awesome!

All the good things that I would have said about The Hobbit have already been voiced many times in the positive reviews before this one, so please read some of them for more information about the book. My observation is that the minority of people that disliked the book seem to be very blatantly aggressive in their criticism without providing any substance to support their claims. Perhaps this is the reason so many people have expressed the fact that the poor reviews were not useful to them. I question no one's opinion for what it is, but I do question the way in which they choose to express it. Negative reviews, I think, would be welcome and considered, as long as they were well written and thoughtful, instead of combative and insubstantial in content. The Hobbit is a delightful story, and deserves all the praise it is given in the hundreds of positive reviews here (and many more).

These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

This book is the perfect initiation for a young reader into the imaginative majesty that is literature and I cannot recommend this book enough.

Bilbo's quest to find the dragon guarded treasure stolen from the lost kingdom of the dwarves in the Misty Mauntain along with a band of dwarves wanting to rebuild this kingdom is very excitting though overall this book is not as dark and dangerous as the LOTR trilogy. It is also written in a slightly different way though this by no means makes it inferior to LOTR. It is simpler and better suited for kids who are not ready for Lord of the Ring but still want to read Tolkien's works.

It was for school. He liked it very much.....I will be reading it soon since it is on my kindle also."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must preface this review by saying that I do not usually like fiction. I am primarily a theologian. But I loved The Hobbit.With the announcement that Tolkien's great prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will soon be made into a movie trilogy of its own right, I thought it was time to delve into this classic adventure myself. I am so glad that I did.Let's start with character development. Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Wizard are two of the best characters Tolkien has ever created. (And he has created hundreds!) In The Hobbit, we learn to trust each of them. Bilbo emerges as a reluctant yet heroic protagonist. He is hesitant, traditional, mannered, quick-witted, and yet shockingly courageous. This despite his diminutive stature! Drawn into an adventure larger than life--to recapture dwarvish treasure held captive by a murderous dragon--Biblo shows himself over and over again to be the most reliable compatriot of the band.Gandalf on the other hand is Biblo's perfect compliment. He is strong, indomitable, larger than life, and yet flighty and preoccupied. He swoops in at just the right moments to rescue the would-be treasure hunters. In chapter five (revised in later editions) we also meet the grotesque Gollum, bent helplessly inward by the ring's debilitating powers. The repartee between Bilbo and Gollum while the ring's fate stands on the line is deeply memorable. We only learn later that all of Middle Earth hangs also in the balance of this test of wits between the deformed Gollum and the sharp-tongued hobbit.In terms of visual drama and setting, Tolkien in unmatched. He is able to create vast worlds that seem both familiar and impossible to the reader. Throughout his works, the Shire, the Misty Mountains, the Mines of Moria, Esgaroth, and Mirwood are described with vivid imagery. Tolkien creates a world that can both enrapture and repulse his readers. Few fictional writers can create and balance such elaborate settings as Tolkien does. (Thankfully, the movies have not let us down in portraying these stunning worlds).Most readers will be not surprised to note that The Hobbit (like The Lord of the Rings series) contains a substantial amount of poetry. In Tolkien, this functions to create a timeless quality, blending Middle Earth's mythic age into current bends in the plot. The poetry often emerges in the form of dwarvish songs, assuring the reader that the characters themselves are captivated by myths and legends of their own. These poetic songs and tales are sometimes warning, and sometimes consoling the heroes along their path of destiny.The plot itself, primarily a dragon-slaying tale, never lags. In each successive chapter, Bilbo finds himself entrapped in another web (once literally!) that seems at first inescapable. Once Biblo and the dwarves--led by the overly confident Thorin Oakenshield--actually meet the dragon Smaug, the reader stands convinced that their gold-snatching feat will at last be impossible. Only the heroic resolve of a certain halfling will prove otherwise! But I won't spoil the tale for you here.The Hobbit ends exactly where the reader hopes it will all along: with a cataclysmic battle scene featuring all the forces of Middle Earth present. Men, elves, dwarves, wargs, gobblins, eagles, and one particularly irrepressible wizard all arm themselves for battle to the death for fame and fortune.No wonder this work is timeless!Matthew Everhard is the Senior Pastor of Faith Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Brooksville, Florida."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I HAVE LOVED THIS BOOK FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE READ IT MANY MANY TIMES.

Then he gets visited by a wizard - Gandalf - who invites some friends of his. Without really asking Bilbo about it first. So, one by one, 13 dwarves show up uninvited on his doorstep and eat all his food, and recruit him for an adventure he doesn't want to go on. An adventure to go see an old dragon called Smaug, kill it, and loot its big cave - because that cave, and indeed the whole mountain, used to belong to the dwarf leader's father back in the pre-dragon days.And the rest of the story is about the party and their journey to said dragon-infested mountain, during which we're introduced to dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins and a creepy creature calling itself Gollum, who has a trinket it's quite attached to. Oh yes, and there is plenty of song lyrics as well. I tend to skip those, because they bore me to tears. I could say the same about Tolkien's prose, but then I'd be lying. It doesn't bore me.It annoys me.My first impression when reading this book is that the tone of it feels incredibly condescending. I'm half-expecting to feel Tolkien pat me on the head at times. Just because you're writing to kids doesn't mean you have to talk down to them. That it was written in the 1930s is not an excuse! We could also argue about the overt racism (\\"goblins must be killed because they are goblins\\"), sexism (where are the girls?), or even weightism (Bombur is a \\"fat person\\" stereotype). There are also 13 dwarves for no reason other than that their names are quaint and funny to say because they rhyme. In truth, the only one with half a personality is Thorin. The rest are just fillers.\\"The Hobbit\\" promises much but is just a lot of dwarves and a hobbit faffing about, roadmovie style, except they're mostly on foot. Perhaps revolutionary at the time and it can't be ignored - or stressed enough - that Tolkien sparked a great genre, but I really prefer other fantasy authors than him.2.5 out of 5 riddles."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A childhood favorite, now in a leatherbound edition. It made a great Christmas gift! It came wrapped in plastic, and the quality of the green leather cover was very nice, very presentable in anyone's bookcase/library..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, and very good for you- and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it,\\" Gandalf said. This is how the great adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakshield, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin and Gloin began. The thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and the wizard Gandalf set off to use \`their' burglar (Bilbo) to steal back the treasure of the dwarves of Dale, stolen in the first place by Smaug the dragon. Gandalf leaves the group after they encountered three trolls, stayed at the home of Elrond, got lost in the goblins' lair, rested at the huge house of the man/bear Beorn, and reached the edge of Mirkwood. From there, the dwarves traveled alone and fought giant spiders, were captured by wood-elves, escaped by hiding in barrels, and were greeted and treated very nicely in Lake-town. Then the group traveled to the Lonely Mountain where the treasure was being watched carefully by Smaug. For a long time the dwarves and Bilbo waited until Smaug left and was killed by a Lake-town man. Then the treasure was fought over by dwarves, men, elves, goblins, eagles, and wolves. Finally the dwarf/elf/man/eagle side won the Battle of Five Armies and peace was restored. Bilbo was at last able to return home safely. I disliked the way this book was written, but I loved the story behind it all and I would recommend it to fantasy-lovers.One reason that I disliked this novel is that often the author would complicate simple things. For example, he would write \\"You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it.\\" Really all he needed, though, was- You will find out about it in a few days. The author definitely over used commas in The Hobbit. Sometimes the amount of detail was good, but a lot of instances the detail and description was confusing. One of the possible explanations for my confusion is the length of the author's sentences. For example, take the sentence, \\"The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky.\\" I had to read this sentence a few times before fully grasping the meaning of it. This is just one of the many paragraph long sentences.One thing I did like about this book, though, was the story line and the characters. Once I finished the book I was able to look at the \\"big picture\\" of the story rather than the specific details. I especially enjoyed the part in the book where Bilbo (with his invisibility ring on) talks to Smaug. I also really liked when Bilbo was playing riddles with Gollum because I could guess them, too. I also liked the character of Bilbo. Even though it seems as though there are many characters, Bilbo is the main character so you come to like his clever, kind, curious, and brave ways.Lastly, I really didn't like the amount of violence in this book, especially in the end. The ways the battles are described are frankly quite gross. For example, during the fight between Bilbo and the dwarves against the spiders, one spider is described, \\"Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks...\\" Also, during The Battle of Five Armies, the valley was described as \\"the goblins were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses.\\" These sentences were very disturbing to read.In conclusion, I didn't really like the way this book was written, but I loved the over all story and characters. The novel was violent and sometimes it was very confusing, but I did enjoy some parts of the book a lot. I recommend this book to fantasy loving readers who have a lot of time to read this novel and who don't mind reading about war.-C.

This is one of the best fantasy novels that I have had the pleasure to read. Tolkien's follow-up trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, is just as captivating, and I would recommend it as well. Even though the plot twists and turns every which way, the basis of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is none other than the age-old battle of all that is good and evil.

I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure.

The movies are a blessing and a curse from a parent perspective: we want our kids to read the books and to enjoy the movies, but easy access to the movies may result in the reading portion being ditched. After reading this version, your kids should be able to tell you which parts of the movie(s)(more are coming out!) were accurate and which were not. The Hobbit, as a story, has a significantly lighter and more playful tone and plot than The Lord of the Rings. Young children will naturally gravitate toward The Hobbit (a quest to recover gold from a dragon is mighty tempting to any youngster) but illustrations give the text tangibility and will solidify retention of the story. Reading The Hobbit, particularly this version, is a great way to get your kids hooked on Tolkien before turning to the Lord of the Rings, which is a much more challenging text.

Thus it becomes easily portable or, if one is as consumed by a love of Middle Earth as I am, it is exactly the right size to become a treasured talisman to be kept close to one's side.Inevitably many will consider this Pocket Edition to be suitable for children, and indeed they will find the story as charming in this version as in any other, nevertheless I would question the wisdom of giving this edition to a child as his or her's very first exposure to Tolkien.

Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. It is a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the dwarves' treasure. Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing them. Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example of his courage and ability to perform under pressure. The Hobbit is a wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages. It can be read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral story by the older reader. Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and adventure stories. Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the underlying themes of the book are ageless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a masterpiece of Fantasy literature. It combines elements of drama, comedy, suspense and adventure to bring your emotions to the surface. The book appeals to fans of the Fantasy genre of almost all ages. The grandfather-telling prose in which The Hobbit is written will appeal to adolescents while the sheer language, storyline and myths that Tolkien has created will surely entice the adult readers.In the opinion of this reviewer, no Fantasy fiction author gives as vivid depictions of all aspects of environments, characters and story as well as Tolkien. So much, in fact, that many popular authors since have tried to parallel Tolkien's writing style. The Hobbit (and The Lord of the Rings) is the echelon of every Fantasy book written since and should belong in every Fantasy liturature reader's library.This reviewer strongly recommends the 1997 edition of The Hobbit which marks the 60th anniversary of the first edition. The book is in beautiful hardcover format filled with lavishly painted illustrations by noted Norse myth artist Alan Lee. The illustrations serve as a wonderful supplement to an already well depicted story. The paper and typeface used in this particular edition is of the highest quality and will last for generations to come. It is wrapped nicely in a glossy paper sleeve, edged with gold foil on the top and bottom in which ancient runes of old are scribed. The sleeve is also adorned with one of the many beautiful paintings of Lee.In conclusion, please be sure to make it a point to read The Hobbit if you have not already done so. If you have had a chance to read it, you will have been rewarded with an incredible journey of the mind and will most likely want to read it again and again during the course of your lifetime, with each reading giving you a greater appreciation for Tolkien's talent."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. I am twelve years old and I love to read. I've read more than half of the books under Newberry Honor and Medal books list.

While the binding is excellent, and rare color illustrations by the author have been included, the book is poorly printed on cheap paper, the black & white illustrations are appalingly reproduced (seemingly on a cheap scanner), and the first chapter of 'Fellowship of the Ring' has been crammed (in small type) into the back of the book, like the sequel to some crummy D&D; novel.Bitter disappointment. The old hardcover edition, while not very well bound, was much nicer, printed on crisp white paper with the original b&w; illustrations very well reproduced.When will publishers learn...?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I already reviewed THE HOBBIT, but I'd thought I'd review THIS version.

I'm still quite content with mine, but had I known about THESE versions I would've gone for them. This is the best edition of THE HOBBIT I've ever seen. I gave it four starts due to the size of the actual book. It's beautiful and all, just a little large. Best read on your lap, or sitting down at a table."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As an avid reader of Fantasy novels, none has had such an impact on me then that of Tolkien's classic The Hobbit. Words alone cannot describe the full force of what this book has done to shape fantasy writing in the 20th Century. It is a book in which everyone can associate themselves to in one way or another. There are many very human issues which arise out of this book, and it does not matter if you have read it once, or a hundred times (like me) that you still grasp something new and exciting about the nature of the book.I truly believe that this is a masterpiece which has and will stand the test of time for now and many generations to come. I would happily give it six stars if I had the opportunity. I hope that people who have yet to experience its wonder do so, for the joys this book has brought to so many people (as seen by these reviews) can be shared to even more people. Any comments appreciated."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Here is one of the letters Tolkien received about the Hobbit that he sent to his son, Christopher. His son was stationed in South Africa during WWII and Tolkien would send him chapters from Lord of the Rings as he wrote them.From a Letter to JRR Tolkien's son Christopher (JRRT, Letters #87):Dear Mr Tolkien,I have just finished reading your book The Hobbit for the 11th time and I want to tell you what I think of it. I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is beyond description... Gee Whiz, I am surprised that it's not more popular...If you have written any other books, would you please send me their names?John Barrow, 12 yrs., West Town PA.I thought these extracts from a letter I got yesterday would amuse you. I find these letters which I still occassionally get (apart from the smell of incense which fallen man can never quite fail to savour) make me rather sad. What thousands of grains of good human corn must fall on barren, stony ground, if such a very small drop of water should be so intoxicating! But I suppose one should be grateful for the grace and fortune that have allowed me to provide even the drop. God bless you beloved. Do you think The Ring will come off, and reach the thirsty?Your own Father.P.S. It's nice to find that little American boys do really say &quot;Gee Whiz&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While I really appreciate all the corrections in the text which makes the book a more enjoyable read and the addition of all Tolkien's illustrations included as he wished, I find the quality of the paper as well as the black & white drawings very poor and not up to the honor of a 70th anniversary edition. HarperCollins would have and should have done it and the quality would match the occasion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, if you've never in your life read an epic fantasy then you might like it. But still, when I read this book I was at a point where I was reading four hundred-page novels per two to three days, but it took me hours to get through the first couple chapters. It doesn't really make sense how the dwarves would want such a bumbling fool to help them. And anyway, dwarves and Hobbits, etc., etc. aren't exactly my favorite fantasy races.

Horrible book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This Book was just too childish. I Heard that it was a timeless classic, so i payed a whopping $12 which could have easily better spent. For an adult to enjoy this novel is just beyond my belief. I am 14 myself and after reading it it was plainly ment for parents to read to their 6 or 7 year olds as they fall asleep. With such childish names almost always ryming with another (example: Dwalin and Balin, and also the very childish name of Bilbo) I would only purchase this book if i had someone i knew about 6-8 years old just to read it to them"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"loved it. much easier to read than the Lord of the Rings series but well worth it. and worth the price."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a good and an interesting book to read.

There are none except for what you see in the preview. The book has some illustrations by Tolkein but that's it.

I have a Hardback copy of the Hobbit, I also own the illustrated version. The illustrated was my favorite as I would read this version to my children & they could enjoy the pictures, too. (my youngest fell in love with Tolkien and elves and Hobbits - the goblins not so much!)With Kindle books, I'm fearful that sometimes, there are hyphens inserted randomly within the text or other strange characters randomly placed within the text. Although I find it occurring less and less as advancements are occurring.Also, this version (the 75th Anniversary Edition) has location numbers as well as page numbers. Excellent! I can follow along with Book Club friends. The drawings are very nice and large and within the story, not at the end of the book.Also I find it easy to \\"go to\\" a specific page or chapter.

A unique style of writing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is for the 5 disc BBC dramatization of The Hobbit, with the white cover, ISBN 1620641135. There is a newer release, with a yellow cover, that packages this version of The Hobbit (1968) and The Lord of the Rings (1981) together with some bonus material. This is a full-cast audio drama originally developed for radio, not an audiobook. There are 8 episodes clocking in at a little under half an hour each.***This is a much-beloved adaptation with some serious flaws. It's easy to forget that it will be half a century old in a few years. It is presented in frequently abrasive mono sound, with dated effects, a few questionable casting choices, and more than a few questionable music choices.So why bother?Bilbo - that's why. Paul Daneman's Bilbo is clever, bumbling, endearing, and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious. In short, he is the perfect gentlehobbit. Much like Bill Nighy's Sam in the later Lord of the Rings radio production, Daneman is the overt inspiration for Martin Freeman's recent take on Bilbo in Peter Jackson's movies. Freeman does a great job, but the similarities are striking. In the end, Daneman's subtlety and sharpness set him apart as the greatest Bilbo interpreter.The rest of the cast for the most part dives in with great relish. There are unfortunately two glaring misfires: Gandalf and Gollum.Heron Carvic's Gandalf (interestingly pronounced \\"Gandalv\\" by most of the cast) is played as a sneering elite with a nasal drone. It is so vastly different from the great interpretations of Hordern and McKellen that it will probably take you out of the story the first few times he opens his mouth. Carvic is at least a perfectly serviceable actor, even if badly miscast, so you eventually get used to it.I can't really say the same for Gollum. Gollum is a tough character to play in an audio format, and even the fantastic later radio production of Lord of the Rings cannot escape the issue. Wolfe Morris hits the notes of manic schizophrenia just fine, but it is a screeching performance that is poorly served by the presentation. The audio is neither mixed nor compressed too carefully, so the dynamics allow Gollum's piercing wail to rise above the normal levels like a blaring commercial in the middle of a sedate TV show. The mastering leans heavily treble for the sake of clarity as well, due to technological issues with both the transmission and reproduction of radio programs at the time. In crisp digital audio on CD, it does Gollum no favors.Thankfully, Gollum is not in the story for long, and Gandalf's visits become more and more believable as the story draws on. Bilbo is there all the while, however, and his charm is a rock solid foundation for the rest of this aged, flawed, but ultimately delightful production."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I FIRST read the hobbits 47 years ago and I'll never tire of it.

I can assure you that if you liked the movie you will love this book. If you have yet to see the movie (which is based off of the first third of the book) here is the main plot.

He agrees to be there burglar for a fourteenth share of the treasure they are goin to reclaim from the evil dragon Smaug who killed Thorin's father and grandfather, making him the dwarf king. As they set out on there adventure they encounter many perils. Most notably and very importantly, while the rest of the group is held captive by goblins, Bilbo has an encounter with Gollum, a creature of unknown origin and is obsessed with his \\"precious\\" or the ring.

With all the attention that the new movie series is bringing to Tolkien's writings, there is a resurgence of interest in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but a great many of the newfound fans are failing to start with \\"The Hobbit\\", and this is a mistake; this book is a great deal easier to get into than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and once you're read this one, you'll likely find it much easier to enjoy that one.Granted, there are people who like \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but aren't fond of this book because they feel patronized by the easy, \\"children's book\\" writing style. If you don't enjoy \\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" or C.S. Lewis's \\"Narnia\\" series (and if what you object to in the \\"Narnia\\" series is the writing style, rather than the blatant Christian symbolism) then you may not care for this book.

It is a tale of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, venturing out into the great big world. He takes risks, makes new life long friendships, and grows more mature and wise on his journey. Just when you things can't get possibily any worse, they do. The book presents a life learning lesson, that life isn't worth living if you don't explore it and get out into the world. In doing so you are setting goals for yourself, you never know what to expect but in the end you are a better person for getting out there. I thought this book was great!

Among the four books, this is probably the most boring of them all, with dozens of characters, many with titles, a lot of side stories in the plot, a lot of text used for descriptions of scenery, and a lot of repetition. For those uninitiated with the lore and legend of Middle Earth, this book comes across as just another story of dragons, elves and dwarves set in a land that was probably medieval England post-Roman Empire. And there are the occasional songs and chants that break up the text. But the most important part of the story is the ring, which sets up the three Lord of the Rings books.

It kept my interest the whole time and I couldn't wait for the next chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is more about this version of The Hobbit than about The Hobbit itself (because everyone knows it's a brilliant book to begin with).This edition is beautiful and very well made.

Picture it in your mind and then seeing it one the screen...very good!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I decided to reread the Hobbit in between viewings of the Hobbit movie, and I'm glad I did. This is definitely a good book, but it might not have held up quite as well as I'd expected. I'm still going to give it 5 stars for the nostalgia, but otherwise I'd probably give it 4. The writing style is just very detached, and it's very hard to get into the characters. I never felt like I was Bilbo Baggis, this was partially from the writting style, but especially because of the comments from the narrator. Instead, the Hobbit feels like a story someone is telling me. Maybe this is why it works so well for children/young adults, but reading it now I just felt detached from everything that happened. There's a lot that happens during the book, but it all goes by so quickly that it's odd. This is most noticeable for the ending, which I found to be poorly done. There's such a buildup to fighting this dragon, but in the end it's fought and killed in about one pages time. Then the battle where multiple main characters are killed is hardly described at all at first, and then it's just summarized by the narrator. Still, The Hobbit is a fun and easy read, that everyone should at least read once."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Fast paced and delightful read, full of both whimsical and terrifying characters whom the reader grows quite fond of.

Great to read now to get a head start on the movies. I recommend to everyone who enjoyed the lotr saga."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not a review specifically of The Hobbit, but more of what this book is compared to Tolkien's other writings. Tolkien's true masterpiece is The Silmarillion, which he wrote in WW1, believe it or not. The Silmarillion is a very deep and complex book, to much so for children. Thus he wrote this book for children taking some bits and pieces from The Silmarillion. You can think of the difference as comparing reading the bible to a bible story for kids. After the success of the Hobbit, Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings which continues from the Hobbit and is somewhat more of a young adult type of work, more complex than the Hobbit but still nothing like the Silmarillion.Does one need to read The Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings? Not necessarily, but I strongly recommend it. There are some parts in the hobbit that some people may find mundane or silly, such as the songs the dwarves sing. But it gives a very good world of what is a Hobbit and if you like that, you'll probably like the Lord of the Rings too. Keep in mind the LOTR is a long series and it seems a character just walking across a field can take 30 pages.On a whole though The Hobbit is certainly one of the best books of all time and can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Obviously now is a great time to read it as the movies are being made of it (finally!). One good thing about reading it is there are some characters not in the movie and of course there are some things in the movie that aren't quite like the book. And you'll have a better idea of what things are going on. But some people may even rather read the book after the movie. I think its more enjoyable to read the book first though, then reread it again later. I also think the book gives you a much better insight into Bilbo than the movie can. And Bilbo isn't the same guy as Frodo in LOTR either."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"classic, with the movie I thought it was time to read it again after 20 years. just takes you away fromtodays day to day duldrums. makes you want to go on an adventure"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So after seeing the movie I had to rush home to read the book. I haven't read it in a while. Upon completion all I have to say is the story is there, but it's really hidden. Me and my dad who are both Tolkien fans discussed it and we both came to the same conclusion. The movie is better. But this isn't a review for the movie. It was harder to feel like I was there in the Hobbit. One can tell that Tolkien has an amazing story going through his mind but he just doesn't quite convey it well on paper, but the reason for the four stars is that you can almost follow his thought process. I'll probably read it again sometime in the future, but it won't be for another ten years or so."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Really what is left to be said????

Tolkein has always been a great writer, but this I believe to be one of his best pieces, with an interesting story, action and adventure, and everything a good sci-fi story needs. All combined to create an excellent story. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf, 2 of the main characters. Frustrated with Gandalf, Bilbo invites Gandalf to breakfast or brunch on a later day, little did he know, Gandalf would accept the next day, bringing with him 13 dwarves. The dwarves plan to retake their family?s home, The Lonely Mountain, stolen by the great dragon Smaug. Early the next day, they depart, on their way to the Misty Mountains, their traveling slow and weary. Needing rest from the elements, and advice for a path through the mountains, they stop at the last homely house of Rivendell. There, Elrond, an Elf of Rivendell, shows them a path through the mountains, and also gives them supplies. On they?re route through the mountains, two storms collide, and they need shelter, only to find themselves taken into a goblin clan?s cave. The party successfully escapes, but without food or supplies. They then make their way to one of Gandalf?s friends. He gives them shelter, and sends them on their way through a forest, the only obstacle left between them and he mountain. The party faces many things in the forest, and is imprisoned by the wood elves. After escape, they make their way to a town, where supplied, they finally make their way through the desolation of Smaug to the mountain. They finally make it there, and inside, when Smaug is killed when attacking the town. The dwarves have found their home, but they aren?t the only ones wishing the get it, and the treasures inside.I enjoyed the book immensely, with a rating of 5/5 stars, Tolkein lives up to his expectations, and delivers a wonderfully great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's Hobbit is not only the best book written by him, but also possibly the best fantasy book ever. Bilbo Baggin's long, enthralling, and extreme adventure with the great wizard, Gandolf, and his thirteen dwarves, will make you want to read more and more. You might even finish the book in a day or two. As Gandolf and the dwarves persuade him to come with him to fight the evil dragon, Smog, and take back the gold that was once all of theirs, they are about to encounter the most exiting part of their lives.Every page of this book is a dose of excitement and action. The great part about the book is that the rising action keeps building and building drastically until the end. The Hobbit is a must read for all fantasy lovers. But even if you aren't a fantasy lover, you will still marvel this amazing book.[...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dwarves, wizards, goblins, and hobbits all in one great book the hobbit the book of the century. I would read it again just to experience the thrill of all of them together at once Bilbo with the magic ring that could turn him invisible with it just to get out of problems with the goblins. This book is a must read for a teen and up. This is a perfect opportunity to get the best book in the world. You must read this book before other people take them all.By Christian"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is by far the most exciting, adventourous, and humorous J.R.R. Tolkien book on the market. Being a huge fan of Tolkien's work, I have read just about every book there is to offer, and have not found one yet that is better than The Hobbit. The book starts by introducing you to a boring, normal hobbit that has no idea he will someday be one of the most famous hobbits ever. While sitting down to his usually noon tea he gets a knock on the door and opens it to find a pair of dwarves standing outside. Being his freindly self he invites them in for a cup of tea. Before long the door has been opened 6 times revealing a total of 12 dwarves that are all seeming to be of some relation. By the time Bilbo (the hobbit) knows what is going on, his tookish side gets the best of him, and he is swept out the door on an adventure of a lifetime. On the way Bilbo discovers their quest is to kill off a dragon that has taken their ancestors mountain along with all the treasures inside. Bilbo is quite pleased when he finds out his reward will be one fourteenth of treasure. Along the way, however, the group faces many hardships, dangerous encounters, and deadly battles. This book keeps you on your toes and guessing what is going to happen next. Unlike other Tolkien books I found it to be quite humouros. There are not as many battles as in the lord of the rings series, but there are just as many near death encounters. Overall this was probably the best book I have read in months, because of Tolkien's ability to make you believe that this could have actually happend. If you have read any other Tolkien book and enjoyed it, you will love this book! My advice to you is to purchase The Hobbit today and discover the mystical world of Middle Earth!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was never in to Lord of the Rings Or J.R.R. Tolkien until I saw the movie. I didn't like the movie very much until my friend brought it over and let me hold it. I instantly fell in love with it. And felt that I was almost forced to Buy Tolkien's Literary works. After much and much hesitition, I knew that I was bound to like the book so I said why not go all out and buy this GREEN LEATHERETTE HOBBIT, AND THE LORD LORD OF THE RINGS RED LEATHERETTE.editions of the book.I read the Hobbit in 6 days. The book starts off very entertaing but later on becomes rather dry. However not dry enough to make it unbearable.The Green Leatherette edition is 317 pages, and about 4 full color glossy drawings, and as well as about 10 or more other drawings. The Drawings are not bad, especailly since they were drawn by Tolkien himself who is known for his writing skills not his drawing skills. The book becomes dry when they leave the wood elf spot, and they have to go through mirkwood, where there are many spiders and other creatures. The book then picks up later when they arrive at Loneley mountain, the end of the book, where they have to steal the treasures from the Dragon Smaug who guards the treasures. Which is about 60 pages of the book, completely on the part with Smaug and before Smaug dies.The book I would reccommend to people between the ages of 5-?? the book is very good, and should be read by all readers of all ages.The book has illustrations but does not need them to help the story progress, I could litterally sit there and draw out the things described with out being bored, as other books do.The book has nearly no violence and is a very light hearted adventure of a \\"hobbit\\" Bilbo Baggins who never went on any adventures or unexpected events, but with his meeting up with the Wizard \\"Gandalf The Grey\\" he tells Bilbo about going on a quest that will make him rich. The next day, Gandalf comes back with the Dwarves who Bilbo will spend his adventure with and tells him everything(or not so much as everything).The quest starts simple enough and seems like a typical fantasy( which J.R.R. Tolkien is the author who spawned the genre as a whole) Bilbo is hired as a burglar to accompany a group of thirteen Dwarves to the Loneley mountain. Once at the Loneley mountain Bilbo will have to pilfer the Dragon Smaug of all his un needed treasures. The book starts simple but ends with many hardships and is very enjoyable, readers 5-12 highly reccomended,but other age groups don't expect much violence."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Geoff MMay 19, 2003I read the book called The Hobbit. I was very interested in reading this book after I watched The Lord of the Rings movies that came out in theatres. I feel that this book had an ideal audience ages 12 and up. The concept of the book is made for a younger audience but there are some things in the book that make it for an older audience. The book references drinking and smoking which to little kids is not a big deal but some may think that younger kids are not suited for that kind of stuff.This book was full of literary techniques; the first example is imagery. Imagery is found throughout the book and in fact is on the first page of the book. The author does a great job of describing the characters traits and it paints a picture in the readers mind. Imagery is also used when the main character Bilbo is walking through the forest, the author paints the pictures of the forest through the use of imagery. Even though imagery is good in a book sometimes the author put to much detail in little things such as spending two pages describing the pony. The other literary technique used by the author was the use of personification. The author seemed to make everything in the book come to life. The best example I can thing of was when Bilbo met the little creature named Gollum. Gollum lived in the cave and when he ran from Bilbo he jumped into the water and the author described the water as running away from the shore. As we all know, water can not run thus the author was using personification to give the water human traits.This book had me so caught up in the rich plot; I couldn't even put it down. My emotions were mixed when I was reading it. At first I thought it was an adventure and then the book took my emotions and changed them because the characters ran into so many different challenges. My reactions to the book were good, but I thought that the whole story line was too quick. What I mean is that the stories plot seemed a little to quick to seem real. My overall impressions of this book were good. I liked the story line and I loved how the book ties in close with The Lord of the Rings movies. Before reading this book I was a little worried because it was a classic book and I thought right away that the book would be boring. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasy world type of stories and people who liked The Lord of the Rings movies. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars and I feel that everyone needs to read this classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It took me a while to actually read this book. I had started it when I was in junior high, but became too swamped with school reading to finish it. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more then. It's not that it's bad... it's just sort of plain.I guess you have to take into account that it was written in 1937, which I didn't realize until I finished it. I had always assumed that &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and its earthy themes was a product of the sixties. Apparently not. So this means that the world was a very different place when this book was written.I also tried to keep in mind that the whole fantasy genre grew out of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy; so these progenitors may seem tired because a lot of what I have already read has drawn quite liberally from these sources. Or maybe I'm biased against the whole adventure story thing. The risk of the adventure story is that the adventure *is* the story and that each part of the adventure is an isolated incident with no bearing on the next. In the case of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, there's the orcs, then the goblins, then Gollum, and so on. And, yes, Bilbo grows with each incident. But the story is so consumed with the incidents that it includes precious little else. The characters are flat and predictable -- and I think I'm supposed to like Bilbo, but I don't. I know he's supposed to be the anti-hero, the everyman rising to the occassion. But I just find him annoying.I have another issue with the narrator. Yes, I know it's the whole bard thing, I get it. It still doesn't stop me from thinking that there is a better way of telling this story. It's a little more aimed at kids than I remember when I attempted it a long time ago. Which may account for the lack of description, which, when included, is very vague in this novel. I want to know more than cusory details. When Bilbo gets lost in the mountain and stumbles upon Gollum, I never got the cloying sensation of twisting, dark tunnels. Instead, we are treated to something that is more akin to directions. Left. Right. Down, down, down. It cuts right to the action, so there's no tension and release. Things just happen and go away.And that, friends, is the whole problem in a nutshell:Things happen and go away.I am told that Tolkien wrote this as a bedtime story. I don't know if that's true, but it does have that sort of quality to it. I feel bad saying this, because I know it's a classic, but I think I like the animated movie better...Good for kids, adults will be disappointed....Unless, of course, you're a fan. In which case, you hate me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is supposed to be an enhanced edition, but audio content is not working on any of my devices including the Kindle.The story is of course worth 5 stars, but selling an enhanced version that does not work is worth \\"no stars\\" or a single star.Just get the regular version is my recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, I know I'm setting myself up for a lot of flack by giving &quot;The Hobbit&quot; only three stars, but I don't think these reviews are worth much unless you're willing to be perfectly honest about your opinions...even if those opinions happen to be different than those of everyone else on the planet, or in the solar system. So here goes.I'm twenty-eight, and I've been a huge fan of horror and sci-fi books and movies since I was about 12. I haven't read much in the way of fantasy fiction, however, even though it's such a closely related sibling to the two genres I love so dearly. As a kid, I loved the Narnia books, and I recently enjoyed the Harry Potter series quite a bit. So with the new movies based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy coming out, I decided it was time to dig into these pillars of the fantasy genre.I decided to start with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; since I'm the kind of person who always reads forewords and afterwards. I had heard so many people talk about it over the years, that I felt like I had already inhaled most of the characters and plot points like second hand smoke.Okay, let me start with some of what I liked: I think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is an original, often charming and fun-to-read story with some great thematic floorboards holding it all up. I like that Bilbo Baggins has some roguish family blood in his veins causing him to crave adventure in a most unhobbit-like manner. It is inspiring that Bilbo is unafraid to follow his own path. His actions and his unbending courage to be himself make him a role model for anyone. In addition to Bilbo, most of the other hobbits, dwarves, and elves that inhabit this book are also quite likable.It's generally a fun quest story that appeals to the imaginations of all ages. There's a dragon guarding some stolen treasure, and a series of fortunes and misfortunes along the way that keep the reader vested in the group's concerns.But there were also a couple of major shortcomings to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; that, in my view, kept it from being a great book. Now here's the part where my opinion will probably veer off from most anyone else's. But like Bilbo, I feel compelled to be my own self.I felt that the style of the narration was overly intrusive; it made me feel less than involved in the story most of the time. I've read the complaints that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reads too much like a kids' book. I didn't feel that exactly, but rather, that the point of view was just too off-putting. There's an omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time, taking you away from characters and events you've invested large chunks of pages following.Also, despite a pretty decent set up and first half, I felt that the book's ending just wasn't very well constructed. The writing isn't actually bad, but the dramatic momentum is often lacking. With less than a hundred pages left to go, a huge inter-race war breaks out, taking you away from the story you've spent most of the book following. When you finally get back to the end of the original quest, the role of hero and dragonslayer is unceremoniously taken from Bilbo by a character that we hardly know.I just felt that there was way too much narrative gear-shifting throughout this book. It felt like I was taking a ride with someone who's just learning to drive a stick.I don't mean to offend anyone with this review. I just felt it was best to be honest. I know lots of people who love this book, people whose opinions I greatly respect. I'll just have to live with a differing opinion on this. In my view, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a pretty good story with some major structural flaws that detract from the pleasure of reading it.If you grew up with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as I did with &quot;Star Wars&quot; or the stories of Ray Bradbury, you probably have the urge at this moment to poke my eye out with a key or to do something equally terrible. So I'd like to extend a peace offering of some kind. I don't think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a bad book, and I think if I had first read it as a young kid, I might have loved it. The same way that if I hadn't seen &quot;Star Wars&quot; until I was an adult, I might have only criticized its bad acting and been blind to the bottomless ocean of magic that swells hypnotically under its surface."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset.

It is one of my all time favorite books. The cover is pretty neat. I didn't have as many problems with binding and poor quality paper as a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviewers apparently had. However, as I finished the wonderful story I was needless to say, quite shocked. Where was the gold that was suppose to come spilling out of the last page? I thought this novel was full of magic and I assumed the 70th Anniversary Edition would really amp it up. I mean at this point in the digital revolution why the hell are there still paper books? Where are the goddamn holograms that illustrate the action on every page? And why didn't this magical 70th addition come with a long wizard pipe? How the hell am I suppose to enjoyed Tolkien's wonderful words without smoke rings in the shape of dragons flying around my head? Way to go whatever publishing house is responsible for the myriad let downs I experienced after reading this particular edition.J.RR Tolkien's corpse is subsequently cursing those philistines for ruining his wonderful work. I bet some jackass producer wants to make a live action movie version of the Hobbit with Bruce Willis as Gandalf and Danny Devito as Thorin. Note to movie executives LEAVE OUR GODDAMN BOOKS ALONE.

Now, there are lots of fantasy novels and still, Tolkien is the best.While The Lord of the Rings may be Tolkien's greatest and most influential work, the Hobbit cannot be lightly dismissed and is no less a classic than his trilogy. Although essentially a children's story, it has an appeal to all ages (it is similar to the more recent Harry Potter stories in this respect). This is because it has a depth that is unusual in a story aimed for kids.This story has humor and great characters and fantastic descriptions...it is simply put, great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When placed neatly beside The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit is usually given the precursor of \\"Introduction\\", as if it served no more purpose then to introduce us to critical characters of the upcoming trilogy as well as Middle-Earth itself. When film versions are made of Tolkein's masterpiece, The Hobbit is usually looked over in lieu of a brief summary during the prologue, feeling the only necessary element involved with The Hobbit is the meeting of Bilbo and Gollum and the eventual acquisition of The Ring of Power. This is a sad reality indeed for one of the single greatest fantasy stories ever written.The Hobbit: Or There And Back Again, takes place in the wonderful land of Middle-Earth, created in the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't just create a world, but a history, a culture, and an entire new society and existence. Behind every rock lays a story one hundred years old, and the summits of every mountain are steeped in histroy and myth.The story itself begins with the meeting of Bilbo Baggins and the great wizard Gandalf Stormcrow (The Grey). Bilbo is a Hobbit, halflings with hairy feet, great appetites, and wonderful natures, completely against adventuring of any kind. Gandalf, one of the most powerful wizards in all of Middle-Earth, knows quite a deal about Hobbits and has an underlying belief that the creatures will play some role in the unraveling story of Middle-Earth, though he doesn't say as much here. He chooses Bilbo, much to the Hobbit's protest, to accompany a group of Dwarves on a mission to steal back some of their gold, which has been gaurded by the dreadful claws of Smaug, a deadly Dragon who slew their kin and destroyed their home years before. Though Bilbo finds himself in quite an amount of trouble early on, he eventually confirms Gandalf's belief in not only him, but the importance that Hobbits will have in the future as is seen in the terrific \\"Riddles In The Dark\\", where Bilbo meets Gollum and acquires The Ring.Though many dismiss The Hobbit as simply an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, don't allow yourself to fall into that trap. The Hobbit is an absolutely magical story of adventure, hope, and dreams which winds from the quiet hills of the shire, through the dark foliage of Mirkwood, all the way to the haunted ruins of Lonely Mountain and an encounter with Smaug and a war to end all wars. It is a must read for anyone who wishes to call themself a fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent prelude to the Lord of the Rings. Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with Gandalf the Grey and a band of homeless Dwarves, to the Lonely Mountains to retake the dwarves' home and confront Smaug (a dragon). Bilbo had to fight evil orcs, salvage wolves, giant spiders, and gollum. He found a ring that could make him invisible. When they got to the lonely Mountains Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves could find the entrance to the Dwarves home. Then after days of camping out they Bilbo saw the little tiny keyhole of the door. Bilbo went in alone and he talked to Smaug. Bilbo ran out because Smaug was trying to chase him. Smaug came out of the shaft and the dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf went in, but the key was outside. They had to get out through the front entrance. After days of walking in the place they came to the front entrance. The people of Laketown saw a small flicker of light. It was Smaug. The people cut the bridges to the town. Bilbo told a bird to tell an archer at Laketown to shoot at Smaug's left breast because it was open. The archer shot his best arrow and it went through Smaug. That was the end of Smaug. The elves and men learned of Smaug's death. They came to the Lonely Mountains to take the treasure, but the Goblins came also. The elves, men, and dwarves allied to fight the Goblins. A stone that hit his head knocked out Bilbo. When Bilbo wakes up he finds out that they have won, but some of the dwarves were wounded. Thorin, the leader of the dwarves was wounded and later died. Bilbo returned to his home and told the other hobbits about his adventure.I recommend this book for others to read because it is an interesting, adventurous, and great book to read. A moral from the story is to never give up and face your enemies. It also teaches you courage. Once you start reading this book you will probably keep reading to the end.My favorite part of this book is when the Laketown people were fighting Smaug. That's my favorite part because it has a lot of action. It tells how fierce a dragon could be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I received my copy of The Hobbit from my ex, Lee. He and I were in the process of running off together when I decided that maybe it wasn't that great of an idea. What I got out of the relationship were some good life lessons and his old copy of his favorite book. I've been asked why I didn't give it back to him. I cannot fathom why he would give me this book. It's The Hobbit! His own, personal, old, favorite, copy of his favorite book! Well, I have no idea where he is now and I'm not giving it back.I read it while we were dating, in 1999, and again when I heard about the movies. I wanted to brush up on my Tolkien so I could be an educated viewer. Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who sat in the theatre and cringed when you could see the Moon-letters on Bilbo's map in the background (Moon-letters should only be seen when held up to moonlight...they were on a mat board. But I digress.)Oh, how I love this book. I carried it with me everywhere. I read it while trying to drive. I sat on the grass and read it when I couldn't stand it anymore and just stopped where I stood. I brought it to restaurants and ignored the person I was with. It's engaging. It's beautiful. It is the quintisential story of good versus evil. It is incredibly satisfying. I fell in love with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Dwarves. (Especially the fat, sleepy one...Bombur?) Any child of mine is getting this book when they are capable of reading it. I made Annie read it. I actually lent her MY copy...the one with Lee's inscription in the front. When I put the book down, I immediately gave it to Annie and picked up The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There is a little hobbit, called Bilbo Beutlin, who lives in a hole, which is very confortable.(It is like a house, but under the earth)So, one day there came twelve gnoms and a the magician, Gandalf to this hole.This group makes a long and dangerous Journey to the lonely mountain. On this trip, they have to fight against orks and trolls, but they also make new friends (elves and a mysterious person). During the adventure Bilbo finds a magic ring, if you put it on, you you are invisible. In the following books:The Lord of the rings, this ring plays a bigger role. I think it is a very good written fantasy-book, because it includes many funny creatures and shows a fantastic and romantic world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My friend recommended &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a perfect read for my 12 year-old daughter. I ended up reading the book first, and I simply loved it! I read the book in 50 page gulps, and my daughter wasn't even allowed near the book until I had finished it.J. R. R. Tolkien's imagination as absolutely no limits, the language is so rich, and all the characters, from the hobbit &quot;Bilbo&quot;, the wizard &quot;Gandalf&quot;, to even the dragon &quot;Smaug&quot; are all very, very well developed.(Get the collectors version of this book, with the absolutely beautiful, beautiful paintings/drawings. I believe they are done by the author himself!) &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is also the foundation for the trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. (That's my next &quot;project&quot;).&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a great read, I promise you will enjoy it.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is amazing and it is very exicting I found no time to stop reading this fantastic 100% book and always start at night as sudden things happen.If you like Harry Potter then strart to read The Hobbit the all of the amazing Lord Of The Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, first published in the mid-1930's, is a wonderfully inventive story. If you're expecting it to be the same style and intensity as Lord of the Rings you may be disappointed. This story, while having it's dramatic moments, is more mellow and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR. In reading this you get the impression that Tolkein was enjoying himself as much as we have enjoyed reading it. I must have read this book at least 15 times between 1975 and 1990. It has been years though, and with the new release of the movie I decided to re-introduce myself to an old friend.The Hobbit is a tale about Bilbo Baggins (a relatively minor character in LOTR) and his adventures with 13 dwarfs to reclaim their treasure. Initially led by the wizard Gandalf the troop encounter trolls, goblins, elves, giant spiders, and of course THE DRAGON. What I liked the most about the story is that Tolkien really uses his sense of humor throughout, something missing in LOTR. Of course we get to meet two characters who play important roles in LOTR: Elrond, the Elf Lord, and Gollum. The story follow the group from the beginning of their journey in the Shire, their trek across the wilderness where they are waylaid by trolls, and over (and under) the misty mountains where they are captured by goblins. It is here that Bilbo finds 'The Ring' and his life changes forever. After their escape they make their way through mirkwood, where they are first ensnared by spiders and then imprisoned by elves. In both cases Bilbo is able to rescue them. And of course to the journey's end at the Lonely Mountain and their confrontation with Smaug the dragon. The tale ends on a sad yet uplifing note of redemption.Although you can read Lord of the Rings, or even watch the movie, without reading The Hobbit first why would you want to?It's just much more fun to read this beforehand. I would also recommend &quot;The Simarillon&quot;, Tolkien's mythology of middle earth. This book gives you the complete history of the elves and the first two ages, leading up to the events told here."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After having recently re-read the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in anticipation of the movie, I bought the Hobbit again since I'd lost my copy. To read it after the trilogy was an eye opener. It was obvious that Tolkien's skills in writing about the Middle Earth were much more developed in the later books. Still enjoyable, but not as visual and gripping as the trilogy to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was a kid, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a perceived boy book. Girls, instead, read \\"Little Women\\", \\"Betsy-Tacy\\", and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\". Ask a boy to read any of those series, and they'd gag. Those girl books, however, are still great contributions to the literary and imaginative worlds.*** So even though Tolkien hasn't reached me until now (and well past my childhood years), \\"The Hobbit\\" is a rewarding pleasure. It's the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\") and considered gentler and more suitable for reading to young children than the subsequent installments.*** The Hobbitt is Bilbo Baggins who leaves his comfortable abode (his hobbitt hole) to go adventuring with the wizard Gandalf and a party of dwarves who have a penchant for breaking into boisterous singing during mealtimes.*** They're off in search of treasure with little more than an old map and a lot of gumption to guide them. Bravery emerges in a disarming way. Tolkien understands the homeliness of his hobbitt and the dwarves -- the sort of quality we, the readers, have as humans but spend a lot of time concealing as uncool. So when adventure prods the timid and the inexperienced into derring-do, we are swept along like participants ourselves. Tolkien shows that even the littlest, unlikely ones have a place with the heroes..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was introduced to the works of JRR Tolkien by the movie. Needless to say I hated it. I thought it was just a rambling mess with too many extreme closeups, too many far shots and shallow characters. It was also 3 hours long and I felt like killing myself to end the madness. I recieved the trilogy for christmas and I figured that the books were better than the movie. Well they were a lot better, but were kind of boring and drawn out. But then I decided to read the Hobbit, and finally I was impressed. This, in my opinion is where anyone who is reading Tolkien should start out.This book is fairly easy reading and fairly lighthearted. It is written with much more excitement than the LOTR and as a result is much more suspensful. I actually felt tense when the wolves were attacking the company.Though the language is not as polished as in the LOTR, Tolkien makes up for in character development and plot.Well anyway, I feel this deserves every bit a five star rating. It was exciting, fast paced and wasn't boged down with page after page of meaningless description. So I guess Tolkien was a good writer after all, it surpised me to find out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the story of how Bilbo Baggins obtained the powerful ring and found sources of bravery and courage within himself through his adventures with the dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. I was spellbound within a few pages and was astounded at how energetic and compelling the story is. And this was published in 1937! I believe the reason for the book's longevity is that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is about a character challenging himself and proving himself (to himself and to others), which is something to which everyone can relate. This is certainly a masterpiece of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The style of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are quite different, though they share the same author and universe. The Hobbit is more childlike with sillier characters. The world is not so large and dark as in the Rings. There is much less background texture in languages, history and poetry.I've read the Hobbit twice over the decades, but the Lord of the Rings about eight times. You pretty much see everything in one reading, while there is new detail each time in the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful work and achievement. It is a splendid escape from our current fast forward high tech world. I must say that I do enjoy the Trilogy to the Hobbit. The Hobbit aims more at a younger mind, where as the Trilogy is broad and universally appealing. I love everything that Tolkien ever did, and for a young reader this is probably the best place to start."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"if you're thinking about diving straight into the lord of the rings trilogy, i'd suggest you take the time out to delve into the hobbit first. this prequel to LOTR is equally fascinating and beautfully creates Tolkien's magical world for you as a start, whetting an appetite for the hefty story that follows. that done, you're now prepared to tackle LOTR.enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've always loved fantasy novels, and my friends have always told me that The Hobbit was a &quot;most read&quot;, ok after several tries now I've read it and, don't get me wrong it's really good, but I don't think it's worth five of four stars. The descriptions of both settings and characters are very good, the story is extremely imaginative, but I think it's a very &quot;light&quot; adventures story because of all the perils Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit) and his dwarves companions encounter, there's not one in which you can really get concerned of what the outcome will be. I enjoyed it and never will regret reading it, but also think there are better fantasy novels, like the ones of Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It would be easy to simply applaud this famous and well written story.However, I do not enjoy the grandfatherly storytelling style and tone of the writing of the Hobbit as much as I enjoy the depth and detail in the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit, if seen as a part (or a prequel) to the main story of the Lord of the Rings, is too simple.There is, of course, nothing wrong with the children's book writing. Personally, though, the themes and characters portrayed are much to deep for the story to be written as a children's book.I got just as much out of reading the intro to the Lord of the Rings (explaining briefly the events which came to pass in the Hobbit, for readers who have not read the Hobbit) as I did reading the entire book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Warning: This review is biased and sappy. Since I first read this book 45 years ago, it has stayed at the very top of &#34;My Favorite Books&#34; list. Every single book I have read since first discovering The Hobbit has been compared to this one. Rather than bore you with all the things I love about this book and it's companions (The Lord of the Rings), I will just note what distinguishes this book for me: the denouement, the &#34;after story.&#34; Every adventure changes us, and Tolkien lets us know exactly how the adventure changes the life and spirit of his characters. Enough said, I have read the book in hardback, and tattered paperback and have listened to it on audiotape, cd and recently MP3 (Rob Ingliss does a fine job bringing Middle Earth alive for me). I ordered this book for Kindle since I was bitten by the eBook bug. I do not know why I resisted switching to eBooks for so long. For a bibliophile, having my favorite volumes with me at all times makes me feel like the richest woman in the world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son is seven and is really into reading and most recently really got into The Lord of the Rings so I thought he'd like this.

Bilbo Baggins then talked to the dragon and made dragon Smaug go to the Lake city and destroy it. But a man who's name was Bard shot down the dragon Smaug and made for the Lonely Mountain to take the gold because they thought Thorin and co. was dead. They found that Thorin and co. we're not dead so they asked for some gold because they were also robbed of their gold because the dragon Smaug took it as well. Thorin refused and that almost started a war between elves,men,and dwarves. But the goblins came to take the gold and that stated The Battle of the Five Armies.

I originally saw all of the Lord of the Rings movies first, along with the new Hobbit movie that came out this winter.

Tolkien shows us the true Bilbo. Bilbo is visited by thewondrous wizardGandalf and thrown into a series of adventures with thirteen Dwarves,who areon their way to reclaim their homeland from a furious dragon. Bilbo is taken on astheir burglar. Gandalf is about the only one who believesin him, until Bilbo is constantlyput in the position of saving the othermembers of his group. Bilbo gains hisconfidence andsome respect when he finds the one item that will help himtremendously throughout therest of the book, the ring. From Golbin bashing to Dragon slaying, thisbook is filled withmany battles and dangerous escapades. For a hobbit to encounter such things isalmostunheard of. At many pointsTolkien has the reader at the edge of their seat, just waitingto see if Bilboand the others will pull through. Theconnection formed between the readerand characters is unbelievable. The Hobbit is a classic tail of goodversus evil, with Bilboplaying the role of the unlikely hero. Bilbo alone could never have accomplishedsuch greatfeats, but with the knowledge given to him by the Dwarves and thechance given to him byGandalf he achieves much of the unthinkable. Throughoutthe story Tolkien lays thegroundwork for his enchanting trilogy, The Lordof the Rings by introducing characters andshowing their relationships. The enduring hatred between the Goblins andthe Dwarves dueto the Goblin War makes for an interesting and compellingcontroversy leaving you longingfor more. If you are looking for a fast paced,action packed, spellbinding epic, The Hobbitwill surely not disappoint.-"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I read the review that mentioned how this audio book was created to give the listener the feeling of an old time radio show, I did not realise the drawbacks of this format. The sound effects come across as low-buget and amature. The music drones on and on, with the vocals being so quiet and hard to hear. I ran tests on portable cassette and home theater. This book is acceptable if you have a powerful amplifier -- but any environment that has background noise (car, walking) this is not a good tape to try and listen to."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am just a reader who happened to see someone else interested in the book they were reading. it happened to be the hobbit and you might say i was inspired to read it. Now, if you are still hooked on harry potter, read this classic and you will be blown away by the magic of it. its better than harry and the rest are too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"About the story:The Hobbit is an excellent story. Its plot is perfectly developed, though the first chapters may seem boring to some. It is much less complex and deep than LOTR, but is able to deliver the same type of emotion and interest. A must read if you are beginning with LOTR, giving you easy to remember background info before you begin the actual masterpiece or the much more advanced Silmarillion -even though it actually isn't ONE story-.About the edition:This paperback edition is well enough for an average reader. It has a nice cover design along with a good size and clear maps. The only problem I found is that there are a couple of spelling mistakes through the story -gonig=going-, but hey, what edition is free of them? Overall, it is a great value for what you get, both an excellent story and a nice new edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is definately worth reading. It captures your imagination and takes you into a whole new world. It takes you into the world of dragons and gold and dwarves. If you read this book then your probably going to love it. This book is really special. Not very many authors can create books as good as this. If you get this book then your in for a real treat. So take the advantage and read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is just great! If you're a fantasy reader you just need to read this book. Its about bilbo( the Hobbit). Bilbo (in this) is not actully how he seems in the Lord of the Rings. Its a very high standerd book, and i think really good. You'll read about a whole new world and there are such lovely characters!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A friend of mine had told me about the coming of the movies for the LOTR series about six months ago. I had always wanted to read the series, but just never found the time to do so. This announcement came as a wonderful way to get me to start it though, and I have to say that once I started reading, I just could not put the book down.I like a decent story just as much as anyone else, but this one had me positively hooked! I read this book, just as I later read &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and was constantly finding myself gritting my teeth, correcting my posture, and feeling my heart beat faster and faster and faster. There is just no way to accurately describe just how gripping this book really is. The only thing that could have brought me any closer to the story was actually being there and witnessing these things happen firsthand, for through much of the book, that is how I felt anyway.Traditionally, I have found my niche within the realm of contemporary fiction, but this may lead me away from that path. If you are not one who likes books about fantasy, magic, or even science fiction, you probably aren't here to read this review anyway. But if for some reason you are here reading this review and you still don't like those things, have no fear. Tolkien's mastery of detail in this truly dramatic and suspensful precursor to the Lord of the Rings trilogy will keep you on the edge of your seat.Further, if you enjoy this book, let me just add that the Lord of the Rings trilogy itself offers ten times as much excitement as is packed into &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; It is without a doubt, a book that should not be missed by anyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"[...]There are enough adjatives already said on the book (maybe I'll write a full review of it later) but for now lets talk about the comic (or as it is refered to the paperback version, click the link below, you'll like what you see.)It's a collection of three part comic book adaption of The Hobbit put out in three issues back in 1989. I considered it the best comic book adaption of anything I ever read and the passing of a decade, and a new cover for the trade paperback has done nothing to change my opinion.It should be said up front that 134 pages are just not enough to give the entire book its due. If you want the actual novel then read it. This is a comic book, it is a GREAT comic book and on my list of best ever, but it is a comic book.That doesn't mean avoid this this is a great adaption. The artwork is supurb, colorful, and \\"takes\\" you into the story quickly. David Wenzel does his job well. When I think of the characters in my mind. The faces I see are these drawings. And I've seen every cartoon adaption and the movie. He also did some very nice prints from this book.Charles Dixon adapts the story well. This was version I read to my children when they were six and eight and it was kept by my youngest son near his bed for easy access over the last two years.This will definately get your brood especially the younger members of it into the story and into reading as a consequence.A great addition to any person's collection of Hobbit or Tolklen stuff. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a book meant for those who have an imagination, or those who whish to enter the world of dragons, magic, treasure, goblins, gloomy figures, but most of all adventure.I thought a big reason that the book is great is that it's so great, is that its so vivid it feels like you are in the book, that you are seeing the characters right there, facing danger. The whole story of going to take back what is theirs even though they must face impossible odds, they themselves spoke that they wouldn't make it, the book is also written in some old English to make the characters seem older and mature. Though the book does a good job in letting one know what the characters are thinking and feeling, one cannot get a good grasp of what the characters are like. I believe the book lacks in this, because the characters are in such extreme emotional and physical conditions. I liked the message of I got from the book which was the underdog taking a stand, and not going out without a fight no matter the odds.This book makes you feel what the characters are because like I said it feels like you are right there in the middle of it all. It also does a good job of guessing you do not know whether something is going to pop out or where the must go next. It left me impressed with the way it was written; the vividness of the book is something one must read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was an excellent book. I really like all imagination and creativity the author put into it. It is a book about a creature called a hobbit. The hobbit is named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo goes on an adventure with some elves to reclaim a stolen treasure. They must retrieve the treasure from the dragon namd Smaug who gaurds it. Along the way there are many adventures and exciting things the travelers encounter.This book is for young teens to young adults. It has a good theme that kids can relate to. Bilbo is different than everyone else and he doesn't think he is much of an adventuror or hero. In the end though he realizes that even though he may be small an different he can use those things to his advantage. All he needs is to believe he can do it and then he can. Kids can relate to that and realize that if they believe in themselves they can achieve anything.This book stirred many self motivating emotions. It made me feel courageous. If there was something I needed to do and I was scared of it, I should just be brave and face it. I'm sure it would make many younger kids feel the same way.I thought this book was a very interesting book. Some parts were less interesting and exciting than others but there were really exciting moments which made up for the dull ones. I would definetly recommend reading this book if you are looking for some action and adventure. I would also recommend it if you are looking for a book with a good plot, lots of fantasy, and a good message in it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as \\"not helpful\\" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While this book is acclaimed as one of the best fantasy novels of all time. I find that the most weighing factor for this is age. Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively. So I would recommend the Hobbit to adolescents, people who are interested in getting into fantasy, and those who have a great deal of patience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Meet Bilbo Baggins just your ordinary little ol hobbit that keeps to himself then one day is asked to go on an adventure with alot of dwarvs and a wizard follow along with bilbo in this amazing journey in the hobbit. this book was alot better than lord of the rings and alot easier to read. don't get me wrong lord of the rings is good but i liked the hobbit better. and now i can't wait untile the movie comes out on 12-14-12. it will be good. this is a awesome book. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book i received was different than the one in the Picture, and in much Worse condition that i expected.I was disappointed with the quality of this product. It's in terrible condition and seems as though it has been through 17 owners and should only be worth 10 cents."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The epic journey of a fat little old hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, set out by the adventurous and supernatural writings of J.R.R. Tolkien is a book that is recommended for students at the middle school level and even the high school level who are interested in reading fiction and action/adventure books on their spare time. This is a book that may be hard to read at times because of the language that Tolkien used, so it may be a good idea to look up some words in a dictionary that are difficult in order to understand some parts of the book better.In my own opinion of the book \\"The Hobbit\\", I did not really like the book at first, but as the book went on and got more exciting after the great wizard known as Gandalf invited thirteen dwarves along with Bilbo Baggins to find the evil dragon named Smaug and reclaim the lost treasures that the evil dragon had taken from the dwarves in the past. At first, the dwarves were skeptical about Gandalf's decision, as well as Bilbo himself because of the grave danger that they could possibly face. Bilbo's character in the story was one of a humble manner; Bilbo did not have the character of an adventurer, or a burglar. To Bilbo's surprise, Gandalf assured all of the Dwarves that Bilbo had the hidden character within himself to be a stealthy burglar and a courageous adventurer. Bilbo not believing the omniscient Gandalf went along on the journey anyway. On the journey that Bilbo, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves endured, they had to face many secondary enemies such as Gollum, the trolls, and the Demon King. They also traveled to many lands such as the Lonely Mountain and the Mirkwood village on their quest to defeat the evil dragon Smaug.The characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien were each uniquely significant to the clarification of the plot. Bilbo, the main character is the central character who is trying to change his destiny of crude comfort. He becomes a hero and an enemy to evil. Yet his nature does not seem to emphasize his central role. He is still a little old hobbit, as he was always wishing to be sleeping at home in his hole, even towards the conclusion of the plot. This story will intrigue the mind of the reader, and this is definitely a book that will not be able to stop reading until the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I guess I am one of the few, very few apparently, who was not blown away by THE HOBBIT. While the story itself is fun and adventurous, I was let down by the telling of the story. While I felt the ending was much better than the begining, the Narrator just got on my nerves. Everytime the story got interesting and exciting, this voice would come out of nowhere and say something like, &quot;This was not the last time that Bilbo would use his sword Sting, but that is something you will hear about later.&quot; I know that exact line was never written, but stuff like it certainly was. I just think you shouldn't have to be told what will happen later so bluntly. Maybe a subteler form of foreshadowing is needed, or maybe I am just overly sensitive. In any case it was a good story, but not great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"CHARACTERS-The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, seems to be a very strange person to write about in a fantasy novel (considering he's plump, lazy, has hair on his toes and hates adventures) but turns out to be a rather enjoyable nostalgic-like outcome. The dwarves (they could of done with less, I suppose) are pretty much the same character with some variations and exceptions such as Thorin, but just their rhyming names and happy demeanor throughout the story makes this book all the more merrier (besides the traditional cliche for fantasy is a large group of heroes setting out to fight evil, right?) Gandalf is like all mysterious mages, sorecerers and wizards in fantasy novels...you just can't do with out them. It seems they always set the foundation for the plot as well.....STORY-Not the best story in the world, and definetly not one set on need. Gandalf the wizard and king Thorin of the dwarves are setting up a group of adventurers to embark on an journey. Gandalf suggests Bilbo (the burglar) would be the the perfect person to be the last member of the dwarven group. King Thorin is setting out with his companions to retake his throne from the evil red dragon, Smaug. Smaug lies in the midst of the dwarven kingdom where dwarven gold lays in heaps along with a valuable item of particular dwarven interest.QUALITY-This will be very short. Tolkien is a great writer with a great mind for imagination. The adventures the rather small group takes on are very fun and mysterious if not terribly entertaining.FANTASY-The good ol' stuff... dwarves, wizards, sorcerers, elves everything that makes up traditonal fantasy. If you don't like traditonal, this book might not be for you. I myself used to be a huge fan, but now am more into the original stuff, like Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time.RATING-From 1 to 10, I give this book a 7. Keeps you very interested! A classic fantasy buy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo was a quiet, calm Hobbit who loved to eat and live in comfort. That's just what he did until a band of dwarves led by a wizard came with an interesting proposition-stay home safe and happy or help kill a dragon and face certain death? What will Bilbo do? Will he accept? Of all the mysterious and adverturous things in this book there is one drawback. There are so many characters that it gets confusing. But do read the book. To help, write down the characters and a few personality traits to help understand them more. This book is enjoyable for all ages, but is suggested for teens and adults. The plot is amazing and keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. The story pulls you into it as if you were helping Bilbo and marching off to fight the dragon. The details are magnificent and the adventure is enough to make your heart throb. The Hobbit is a book to read when you have lots of time and feel the need to read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion the author really messed up when he started dragging out sentences... For instance, in the first chapter when Bilbo had his visitors and it was time to wash the dishes instead of saying the dishes the author chose to name every single solitary dish(the plates,pots, pans, glasses, cups,etc.) I feel that he lost a lot of interest like that. In short this book could have been a very interesting 100 to 200 page book instead of a long drawn out 300 plus book (paperback)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"No doubt The Hobbit is classic work of literature. Unfortunately, this dramatization (as with the related Lord of the Rings Dramatization) suffer from three problems:1. Recording Quality. This is a simple technical issue, but the audio mix is atrocious. Voice levels are unmodulated rendering many passages inaudible even with your volume set to 11. Much of the dialogue is muddy at best. Just hearing what is being said is extremely challenging.2. Dramatization, Not a Reading. This is not a book on tape, it is a re-written interpretation of the original. It relies almost exclusively on dialogue to tell the story. The original story is driven and paced by Tolkien's beautiful description of locations, thoughts, feeling and atmosphere, so cutting all that out is akin to selling a dramatization of the Mona Lisa under the verbal description of \\"a portrait of woman in the country\\" - it just utterly falls short.3. Gaps. Wow. They have simply edited out huge plot-line swaths of the story. Enormous chunks are neither alluded to or explained.To riff on Lucas - This is not the story you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As with Lord Of The RingsI alread had in paperback, hardbound, and leather,Needed a digital copy nice to always have everywhere."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recommend you see movie first then read to when the movie left off then see the movie again people"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a delightful ebook to share with someone.

I thought this was a typical fantasy novel with some adventures, good vs. bad encounters, and a happy ending where the party succeeded in killing the dragon and restored the city to its old glory. Boy, was I sure wrong! The characters were round, possessed both good qualities and flaws (for example, the dwarfs were excessively greedy, and there were serious problems because of that) and the group changed by each new experience acquired. The story was mysterious, suspenseful, funny, and dark, and the adventures were fascinating. The ending (*grin*) was totally different from what I imagined.

This book is my favorite because of the many details put into it. My favorite character was Gandalf. The Lord of the Rings serves as a fitting prequel to this must-read novel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character in the book The Hobbit is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A Hobbit is a short dwarf-like creature that really is not very capable of action. Bilbo was one of these exceptions, since he was born from a very famous family of Hobbit who were always getting into trouble. Bilbo's personality changes throughout the story. It starts like a regular Hobbit who doesn't want a adventure, but he eventually becomes sort of a leader and slays a huge dragon. The story The Hobbit didn't have any real defined point in history, but it did take place around fantasy times around spring. In the beginning of the story, Bilbo was in his little Hobbit hole when a group of travelers stop by to rest. It turns out they were on a voyage with a great wizard named, Gandalf. Through some means, Bilbo comes with them and meets their first challenge with a bunch of giants. The giants desperately needed food, and were happy to see these travelers until they all got away. The travelers faced a few more problems like goblins, until they were separated in a cave. Bilbo went downwards where he found this strange ring and met a strange monster. Bilbo discovered his ring made him invisible, and decided to make a deal with the creature. The creature was hungry, so Bilbo said that if he lost at a competition, the creature could eat him. If Bilbo won though, the creature would show him the way out. They decided to tell riddles, and by slightly cheating, Bilbo won and escaped. After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo.

One shot and the dragon plunged into the ocean, killing it forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character in the book The Hobbit is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A Hobbit is a short dwarf-like creature that really is not very capable of action. Bilbo was one of these exceptions, since he was born from a very famous family of Hobbit who were always getting into trouble. Bilbo's personality changes throughout the story. It starts like a regular Hobbit who doesn't want a adventure, but he eventually becomes sort of a leader and slays a huge dragon. The story The Hobbit didn't have any real defined point in history, but it did take place around fantasy times around spring. In the beginning of the story, Bilbo was in his little Hobbit hole when a group of travelers stop by to rest. It turns out they were on a voyage with a great wizard named, Gandalf. Through some means, Bilbo comes with them and meets their first challenge with a bunch of giants. The giants desperately needed food, and were happy to see these travelers until they all got away. The travelers faced a few more problems like goblins, until they were separated in a cave. Bilbo went downwards where he found this strange ring and met a strange monster. Bilbo discovered his ring made him invisible, and decided to make a deal with the creature. The creature was hungry, so Bilbo said that if he lost at a competition, the creature could eat him. If Bilbo won though, the creature would show him the way out. They decided to tell riddles, and by slightly cheating, Bilbo won and escaped. After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo. When he was in the cave, he saw a small place where the dragon armor didn't cover the flesh. It was conveniently located near the heart. It was a tough shot, but a young archer in the town had a good arrow. One shot and the dragon plunged into the ocean, killing it and disabling it forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think it is a really interesting book about a hobbit that goes on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain with his dwarf friends. They get into lots of weird problems, like when they get strung up by some spiders. My favorite character is Gandalf the Wizard. He helps them sometimes. It was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the best fantasy book of all time. My wife and I have just completed reading this classic to our two children; ages 7 and 9.

Its written so well on the locations and history of middle earth making it a very great fantsy story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, which is the prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is an extremely entertaining book for something written so early in the twentieth century, and always gives the reader the impression of belonging to a larger world that is only hinted at in this first novel. Somewhat naive and innocent compared to the immense dark forces displayed in the rest of the trilogy, but if you plan on reading the other books, you absolutely must read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I originally read The Hobbit in 7th Grade. It was the first full length book I ever read. Up until that point I had no real desire to read. I lost my virginity to The Hobbit and went from reading my first book in 2 days to reading a book a week for the rest of my life.The Hobbit is a great first book for anyone new to Fantasy. Although it is not sophisticated enough for some readers; it sets the stage for the true masterpiece of fantasy: The Lord of the Rings. You cannot read TLOTR without first reading The Hobbit. I would categorize The Hobbit almost as a children's book. Whereas The Lord of the Rings is definately for adults.Please take the time to read The Hobbit and then read TLOTR. You are in for a wonderful treat. Then do your kid's a favor, read The Hobbit to them at an early age. You will see their eyes light up with wonder and fascination. They will thank you many times years down the road."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

My husband is reading it to our children and everyone is enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought the graphic novel version for my kids under 10 years old to introduce them to the Hobbit. It gives a good summarized version of the story with good drawing. The only exception would be Bilbo seems a bit too heavy and round to make a convincing adventurer. The drawings of all other characters: Gollum, Gandolf, the dragon, the dwarfs were more true to what I envisioned from the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book before and enjoyed it even more this time. The characters are different and that makes them more interesting then most! A great story of loyalty, friendship and respect.

I love the simple beginning \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\\" It plays to my curiosity immediately. Bilbo is such a likable character. His initial hesitancy to do anything unexpected is relatable. I think his subconscious sense of adventure lives in a lot of us...in me. While on his journey he realizes what he is capable of. I like how he accidentally saves his traveling companions from perilous situations over and over again coming off as the unlikely hero.The subtle finding of the \\"One Ring\\" was intriguing leading to the introduction of the mysterious creature Gollum. I like his big round pale lamp-like eyes. The game of riddles between Bilbo and Gollum was particularly entertaining while full of angst. His eagerness to eat the juicy \\"scrumptiously crunchable\\" hobbit was creepy.The Battle of Five Armies was swift and exciting. \\"The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them.\\" I love it from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Multiple versions and formats are right now available however The Hard Cover with Alan Lee Illustration is a most to have specially if you want to have a collection with the Lord of the Rings (single book or 3 books) with Allan Lee Illustrations and to complete the collection the Sillmarillion but now with Ted Nazmith great illustrations.Alan Lee pictures inspired the films and portrait several calendars. The Paper is delightfull (kind of the one use for expensive magazines). Still I regret no illustrations index as with the Sillmarillion/Ted Nazmith edition but again this is a most to have if you truly want to have a good experience.

Tolkien's Hobbit has created a 20th Century myth base on the Jungian archetype of modern man' search for a mysticalcenter. The key to the Hobbit is that is the beginning of theatomic essence of the great journey of the Hero. The call toadventure is the beginning of the trilogy of the Lord of the Ring. The universal secret of the Hobbit is that he has achieved the power of riddle of the Egyptian god thoth who hasgiven man the cleverness of speech but not the &quot;gravitas&quot; of speech. This gives him a superficial victory over ring. TheLord of the Ring brings Frido into the second stage of the callto adventure which prepares the hero to enter the underworldwhich is controlled by the powers of darkness and chaos. Thelife and death struggle lead not only to the destruction ofthe ring but the recovery of the great boon or great treasure that reveals the secret of Tolkien: the bliss is the greatcenter of the human quest. The bliss of discovery andknowledge of the real vs. illusion; good vs. evil and thereality of enviroment over the commerical poisioning of Gaia.The trials and tribulation are part of the Two Towers andthe Return of the King represent the struggle to escape fromdrowning in the evil and poison of the soul. Frido must returnto the world or face a Rip Van Winkle sleep into the ages ofevil. The grand epic of the Lord of the Rings captures themythic quality of human existence which transcends race, sex,nationality and re-affirms Jungs universal discovery of theprofound meaning of myth which has been lost and found in thetwentieth century. Jung like Tolkien had been in a T.S. EliotWasteland of World War I and the utter collapse of WesternCivilization into the dustpan of history. The Tolkien mythhas attempted to re-integrate Marcuse's One dimensional Maninto a new world based on new languages and new insight intothe Middle Earth. Jung's great perceptions of the healing powerof myth explains why The Lord of the Rings holds a new paradigm of hope in the background of the Great Terror in New York anddisintegration of human integrity."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a band of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit.

The Hobbit is a true action/fantisy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit,&quot; the prequel to the legendary Lord of the Rings, is an excellent adventure story for readers of all ages. I particularly recommend it to younger readers, as it is not very hard to read and is easy to follow. It is a very wonderful gift to young &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans, because it has the same wonder that captures the imagination. However, seasoned SF/fantasy readers (such as I) will probably see it as merely a stepping-stone for LoTR. While I enjoy this book very much, I feel it is not on the same level as the books that followed. Still, I recommend reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; before you tackle &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of many J.R.R Tolkien's fabulous books but this one is about a man(Bilbo) that hates to be dirty but also dislikes going on adventures and trips.One day people was outside smoking his pipe and a wizard named Gandalf appeared and said &quot;Are you Mr. Bilbo Baggins&quot; ,why yes replied Bilbo, &quot;Oh you are the choosen burglar.&quot;Then it started 12 dwarves showed up to his door step and all said &quot;You are waisting valuable time Mr. Baggins.&quot; Then Bilbo Baggins adventure had begun.

TolkeinA ReviewWell, after reading the whole Lord of the Rings series in the summer of 2001 for the first time, I soon afterwards purchased the Hobbit and read it. Let me start by saying the anything by Tolkein is OVERRATED! Sure, he practically kickstarted the fantasy genre into creation (although not all of his concepts are original; most are based on historical mythology), and therefore is responsible for an unimaginable amount of literature and content in the world today. Without Tolkein's the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, there would be no Dungeons and Dragons, and therefore no true joy in my life, hehe.Anyway, the LOTR series was, admittedly (in which I admit in a somewhat resigned, even grudging, fashion) an excellent work. Tolkien has been heralded by many as quite possibly the best author of all time, but I beg to differ!Okay, just because the Hobbit gave birth to fantasy means NOTHING to me!!! Listen to the following, and you will discover why I did give this book a five out of five rating but why I do not feel it does not entirely deserve such a high rating. Without a doubt it is a classic, respected and adored by many worldwide. Is that reason enough to call it one of the best books of the century? Well, I most certainly do not think so! Why not? Look at it this way: if one could rate one of the very first computers, those Apple/Macs that were so big and expensive that they took up a whole room, would one give such a computer a 5/5 just because, at the time, it was the best in the industry? OF COURSE NOT. One does not term such a computer a &quot;classic&quot; because if it weren't for that exact computer many technological advances in computer technology would have not even existed today? A bit confusing, perhaps, but the TRUTH. The fact is, that the Hobbit really isn't altogether anything remarkable, at least in comparison to the other fantasy books out today.It's still good, though, I'll admit. Why do I feel this way, though, compared to all the other reviews? Most likely because I'm a heavy fantasy reader, and am used to reading much more complex, intricate, and contemporary fantasy than Tolkein. Furthermore, the fiction I read is so much more fast-paced and with hundreds of gallons of adrenaline that the Hobbit seems like something of a ROAD-BLOCK in my mind.Nonetheless, I cannot deny that I DID enjoy the book and Tolkein is an exceptional writer, his imagination so great that he created an entire genre never before considered. I also recognize this book as one of the best books of the 20th century. How could it not be, after all, considering that it created a whole new genre?! I guess these comments and remarks are a bit contrary to my earlier rants in the review, but really I like Tolkien's books. My only problem with them is that I feel they are OVERRATED. Not too overrated, but overrated nonetheless.So, to sum up my review and to give the read of this review an undeniable verdict, I advise them, regardless of their circumstances, to somehow get ahold of this book and read it. It is written in a very archaic fashion, which is another something I have difficulty enjoying, but it is, without a doubt, the most original, imaginative book ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought this to be a truly adventurous book. I have rated this book with 4 stars because at the beginning it was hard to get hooked into the book, but once you were hooked you couldn't put it down. I think that the climax in this book is towards the middle when Bilbo Baggins confronts the horrible red dragon, with the armor of jewels and scales. A description of Bilbo's personality is kind of challenging. I think that he has a fairly diverse personality. Gandalf on the other hand is full of suprises, but can be very serious if need be. There was something different about each dwarf and I would have to say that Bombur is my favorite. He is the lazy, fat one who loves food and of course Bilbo's friendship. I thought that the lowest part of the story would have to be at the very beginning, well the first 50 pages or so. What I love most about the whole story is the folklore and magic that drips from almost every page, and the adventure and mystery that fills up nearly every paragraph. I don't know why, to tell you the truth, I picked this particular book, except that a friend suggested that I read it and so I did. Well this pretty much concludes my opinion of this Hobbiton fantasy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this book is a fun, enjoyable book that i recommend to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For a very long time, I have heard some great things about The Hobbit.
