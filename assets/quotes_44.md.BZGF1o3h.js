Exotic Appetites is the brainiac version. Although this seems to be intended as an academic work, it is sprinkled with personal anecdotes and references from popular culture. This makes it readable for anyone interested in food.Heldke considers food from every angle. What is exotic food? Is food that is exotic to one person or culture exotic to another? When does it stop being exotic? (Pizza used to be considered exotic in America.) How do we change food when we take it out of its \\"native habitat\\"? Do we somehow endanger it?With references to Calvin Trillin, Wayne's World, Sara Paretsky, Pierre Bourdieu, Tony Hillerman, and Jane & Michael Stern, among others, this is a wide-ranging look at food adventuring.

There are a handful of drills for linemen, a handful for running backs, a handful for quarterbacks, etc. It's not a comprehensive training or practice manual by any means. Also, I did not find any continuity to the way the drills were presented; they are dumped here in one big chunk, for the reader to glean what nuggets he or she can find. Most of the drills involve a full squad with equipment; if you're working with a short squad or looking for off-season drills without pads and tackling dummies, there's not a lot in here for you.It's a suitable book on the subject but I sure wish there was more here."},{"Title":"AFCA's Offensive Football Drills","review":"Great book.

It is a fairly routine, but competent and readable, sports mystery."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"With no malice towards the efforts of Mr. Holtz I didn't really think that this book was all that interesting. It's an explanation of some of what goes on in the modern practice of medicine explained with referrences to \\"House M.D.\\" At the end of it all I felt that it made the show less enjoyable and while it was mildly informative about the practice of medicine it was nothing special.Holtz draws the conclusion that in the real world House would quickly be out of a job. Of course he would, but if TV dramas restricted themselves to reality no one would watch. I don't watch House to learn about medicine, I watch it to see an ongoing story about a brilliant man with an unconventional way of looking at things.My recommendations are as follows, if you want a book about modern medicine look for one that is not tied to a work of fiction and if you like \\"House M.D.\\" continue to suspend disbelief and enjoy the show the same as always. My final comment is that I suspect that someone wanted to write a very broad, general book about medicine and used \\"House M.D.\\" as an opportunity to gain attention and market for the book."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"... and entered a book...calling all Dr. Gregory House fans, read The Medical Science of House by Andrew Holtz. Holtz, a medical journalist, clarifies the mysteries and diagnoses in the television show House, which follows an irascible, but brilliant, diagnostician named, you guessed it, House.If you watch the show and it goes so fast that you need a review of medical terms and conditions or a clarification of the lightening fast thinking and and Jersey-esque verbal speed and brusqueness of the doctors, go to the show's website which recaps each episode in detail. For a broader view of the medicine on the show, Holtz's book not only explains several of the TV show's episodes and cases, it serves as an introduction to health care and medicine today. Holtz clearly and methodically explains the process of differential diagnosis for example. He covers the different kinds of vaccinations against diseases, briefly describes epidemics and other public health disasters, summarizes the various medical imaging techniques from x-rays to CAT scans and PET scans and generally covers a lot of ground in an entertaining style. This book was a quick read. I recommend it to any non-medical professional with an interest in the field, teens who like medical thrillers and possibly book clubs looking for a break from novels."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"This book was a good start if you're interested in the science behind the popular TV series, \\"House.\\"My teenage son absolutely loved the book, and read it cover to cover before playing his new X-Box games at Christmas, which gives you an idea how much it appealed to him.As an R.N. myself, I found the medical aspects of this book to be understandable, without talking over the head, or talking down to the casual reader.

The book gives the reader some insight as to why some of the cases were chosen, where they were exaggerated for dramatic effect, and how authentic many of the medical scenes are in the show. Granted, many of the treatments on the show, wouldn't be allowed in real life, but that's what makes for interesting drama, showing what many in the profession might wish they could do were they given complete freedom without fear of litigation.In short, this book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"If you seek insightful information into some of the cases seen on the TV show 'House MD' don't buy this book. This book regurgitates fairly well known facts about the practice of modern medicine. It occasionally refers to minor aspects of the show but not in any useful way, largely using the name 'House MD' to increase sale numbers. For those people actually interested in delving into some of the more interesting issues surrounding modern medicine, there are much, much better texts out there. The author is a journalist, so it figures."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"This book provides solid insight into the medicine behind the drama in House, MD.

This book helps to answer that question, quite well in fact. Nothing complex - it's a pretty simple read and helps to satisfy your curiosity about the show. Keep in mind, it may shatter your hopes if you think a doctor like House could actually exist (and be successful) in our medical field today. However, in contrast he gives good overall review of the terminology and actual medicine used on the show. Recommended read if you have more then a passing interest in House."},{"Title":"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","review":"This book is a must for House, M.D. fans and for anyone interested in medical facts.

That's why reading about the science which lies behind each case is very interesting, as you can tell reality from fiction.Of course, in every series there must be that special flavour that distinguishes it from reality (or you'd have no reason at all to watch it). And this book doesn't diminish the series because of that. That's the reason I bought it, and I don't regret. Not 5 stars only because of the text of some chapters, a bit boring.

Murphy, a professor of the History of Christianity at Garrett-Evangelical/Northwestern, has put together a rich and varied collection of texts that go far beyond the \`traditional' confines of African American religion being an exclusive province of the Protestant realm. The list of contributors is impressive: Albert Raboteau (whose own \`Slave Religion' is a classic in the field), M. Shawn Copeland, Mary R. Sawyer, Charles H. Long and Gayraud Wilmore (just to name a few). The range of topics is also impressive - in addition to the tradition coverage of African American experience in Protestant circles, Murphy's collection includes pieces regarding African American experiences in Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, religions that survived the Middle Passage in variant forms, and humanist/secular ideas.Murphy's introductory essay and Charles Long's first article set the tone for the rest of the volume, which is divided into nine sections. Murphy describes African American religion in North America as a mosaic, and Long challenges the long-standing tradition of seeing Christianity as a normative standard against which all other religious experiences must be judged. Long presents three ideas that are interrelated, which for him \`constitute symbolic images as well as methodological principles.' These are the religious image and historical reality of Africa, the involuntary nature of the presence and existence of an African American community, and the symbol and experience of God in black religious experience. Through stories, songs, poems, and biblical imagery, Long highlights important principles, picked up by further essayists Raboteau (the image of the exodus is primary for him), Wilmore (who adds further clarifications of his own), and Lincoln and Mamiya (who discuss the black sacred cosmos, contending that many researchers and observers are too quick to apply a sacred/secular division inappropriately to black culture).The remaining sections of the book get to the heart of experience of African American religion in important segments - some concentrate on particular groups (Richard Brent Turner looks at Islam as an African inheritance whose practice was continued by slaves brought over, whose influence continues into the present; Merrill Singer looks at the phenomenon of Black Judaism in the United States, which includes efforts by some at immigration to the state of Israel under conditions of the Law of Return), some look at at particular theological movements (James Cone's article on Black Theology as Liberation Theology highlights the beginning for this kind of formal theological school; Toinette M. Eugene looks at Womanist theology, one of the latest branches in this developing tradition; M. Shawn Copeland looks at the Catholic/Black Theology relationship). None of the articles tend to highlight a particular man or woman in isolation (with two exceptions), but the key figures in African American history (which cannot realistically be separated from the attendant religious history) are all represented in the essays and narrative historical strands. The two exceptions to this rule are W.E.B. Du Bois, and the enigmatic Father Major Jealous Divine.Attention is paid to issues of men and women, of geographic differences, and of different religious underpinnings. The experience of those following the Santeria groups is vastly different from those who work in the Christian denominations, be they from within the mainline, white-dominated sects or the African American denominations (CME, AME, etc.). This book is very valuable in this respect - it gives a strong hearing to a diversity of religious experience, relating these to the overall history of the development of the country as well as the African American community generally, while holding on to the important historical differences each group exhibits.The African American Christian experience is nonetheless well represented in all its many forms. These include descriptive/narrative essays as well as analytical essays, such as Lincoln and Mamiya's article on the dialectical model of the Black Church. While this dialectical model is based on the tensions present in the church (the authors identify six key polar pairings showing this dialectical movement), these tensions are ultimately unresolved, and perhaps destined to never be resolved. However, it does provide for the dynamic of change and growth within the Black Church, and could probably be applied beyond this context very easily.The appendices give interesting detail in summary/snapshot form of the timeline of African American religious history, as well as a list of films that might be used for further study. These are lesser known film documentaries (popular Hollywood cinematic releases are not incorporated here). The index is useful if incomplete (the first two references I went to check were not included in the index; for example, despite being a key figure in Black Theology and a contributor to this volume, the name of James Cone does not appear in the index).The final essays by Wilmore and Harding each look at the overall direction of African American religious history and experience. Wilmore sees religion, in all its diversity and complexity, as still remaining \`the essential thread interweaving the fabric of black culture', with three primary traditions (survival, elevation, and liberation) as working in interrelationship. Harding looks at the freedom movement and its relationship with religious experience, ending with a series of open-ended questions meant to provoke further conversation and reflection.This is an important book for anyone interested in the development of religious traditions in America."},{"Title":"Down by the Riverside: Readings in African American Religion (Religion, Race, and Ethnicity)","review":"An introduction to the variety of African American religious thought spanning from the time of slavery up to the present.

For those who, like me, started seriously reading and collecting in those crazy Nineties, a sentimental value is also attached.Those, and the prospect of reading the origin of beloved, and much underrated, Erik Larsen's Savage Dragon, made me buy the book as soon as I could...Which means, as soon as they put it in the bargains bin in my local comics store!Much as I would have loved to buy the book on Image's 10th anniversary (as was the plan), getting it four years later wasn't as historic: The momentum had been lost somehow (the book itself had been delayed four years!) and I had developed more demanding rading tastse as those that might have been satisfied by the Image founding partners' writing skills.Because the big point of the book was to show how the four remaining Image founders (Jim Lee had sold his creations to DC Comics, Rob Liefeld had been kicked out even before that, and Whilce Portacio never accepted full partnership) were still faithfull to the origial spirit of indipendence that fueled Image's birth, by watching them come back to write and draw the books they started at Image in that fateful 1992.Since Erik Larsen had never left the Savage Dragon, though, in his own words he was only left with what he never intended to do: Telling the Dragon's origin!And a damn good job he does at that!Larsen has always been a most unique voice in superhero comics: While being the very last of the old school, he was able to bring modern sensibilities to the field, by having the book proceed in real time, having characters behave and even die as realistically and pointlessly as in real life, by showing bloody violence and strong hints of sex, to the point of sometimes bringing the book into the mature readers territory (i.e.: for sale to 14 years and older in the US).A very rare occurrence in mainstream superheroes.He should also be credited for taking this approach some years before Warren Ellis took it to new extremes in Stormwatch and made it ground-breakingly popular in The Authority alongside Mark Millar.As I said before, Larsen's uniqueness also rests in being true to the classics as well, while Ellis openly rejects them in the above work, and Millar puts them aside (his Marvel work will show he still has a lot of use for them).So the Dragon finally has an origin I won't spoil here, and that will make me enjoy his new adventures once I can get my hands on the collected editions.The art is stunning, it really is Larsen at his considerable best, and it is a dramatic piece very well executed in a mere 22 pages!22 pages of goodness can also be found in Marc Silvestri's comeback to Cyberforce, his X-Men knock-off that kick-started his Image days.It is such a pleasure to see 22 full pages of Marc Silvestri on his first indipedent comic, that you almost forget the lack of originality of the group's origin as given here, and the fact that this is little more than a lead-in to the future and ill-fated Cyberforce relaunch, which, incidentally, Silvestri didn't draw at all...Some of the same goes for Jim Valentino's Shadowhawk, but this one builds more on the past (including the Alan Moore's addition to the mythos of Shadowhawk being an ancient spirit of justice going through different incarnations, sometime at the same time) and it is completely self-contained. The story builds the foundations for the upcoming book that Valentino only edited, but it is not the first part of, or the hint to a larger tale like the Cyberforce yarn: It ends here, so the casual reader is happy enough and those who are hooked have something to look forward and back to.I'm not a big fan of Valentino's work, but I have to say: good job!And that brings me to the low, painfull note of the whole hardcover...McFarlane's illustrated prose story of Spawn.First off... A illustrated prose story? After years away from the drawing board? On the much awaited, much delayed (and Todd McFarlane bears 50% of the responsibility for that) anniversary book?Sigh.The good here is that it clears some ground, after so long for a book I quit reading because it was going at the most crawling pace, walking in circles as it barely updated some of its parts, but never really made sense of them.The ground cleared here- SPOILER ALERT -is the revelation that Al Simmons was never truly Spawn, but that Spawn ever only had a piece of his soul in him, the little bit that enabled Hell to steer his emotions and training. Great news! Now Spawn can finally move on, can't he?I only wish he did it some other way, since McFarlane is quite poor at prose and not a bit less boring and wordy and slow-pacing than as a comic book writer.Boy, how I miss his Spiedr-Man tales... !So like Cyberforce, this is a lead in to the book's n-th relaunch.Sigh.Plus, it has a masked appearance from Miracle Man, back when McFarlan was still fighting for the rights to the character, which lends it some more historical significance (as a footnote in comic books history, at least) and even less sense...Art-wise, the little illos that go with the story are good but really barely an appetizer (Todd still has it, and watching full pages would have been a blast!), while the typography could have been much, much better, so that at least you'd have gotten extra value from that too.Aw, well.This long rant should thus explain the 3 stars: Mixed feelings abound, as I wallow in some sentimentality and regret of what could have been if these great artists had been a bit better (Larsen being the only true exception) at writing too.If you ever thought of buying this, maybe you sould do like me and wait for a bargain if you need it for your collection, or borrow it if you're just curious. The only seriously important bit is Dragon's origin (which you won't find anywhere else!), otherwise..."},{"Title":"Image Comics","review":"I think that the book delivered exactly what I was anticipating.

Buy It!"},{"Title":"Image Comics","review":"This book supposedly has the origin of Savage Dragon which interests me. The rest of the properties don't really do anything for me, but I think mr. Q Public needs to do more research before he speaks about something. There are only 4 founding artists on this book: Larsen, McFarlane, Silvestri,and Valentino. There were only 7 original founders in total. Regardless of which of these you were going for, it's a 10th Anniversary book by founding artists. It is not 10 founding artists on an anniversary book. I would hope that one would work on their own literacy before speaking of literary respectability..."},{"Title":"Image Comics","review":"Since Eric Larsen has stated many times that the Savage Dragon story in this book will not be reprinted in the near future nor would there be a softcover edition I decided to buy this hardcover version. Thankfully, Amazon.com sold it for less than it's $25 cover price.I bought it JUST for the Savage Dragon's Origin Story. I liked that story. It was not expected. Of course Larson really didn't want to tell the story either.The Spawn story is a bore and Todd McFarlane couldn't even be bothered to properly illustrate it. It's a text job with some panels here and there. Spawn is a lost cause anyway.I quit Spawn at issue 50. I had stopped caring around issue 28.Cyberforce? Who cares about them? Because this book is very very late (I think it was due on IMAGE's 10th anniversary and I believe we're at year 14.)The Cyberforce story IS continued in an already published JLA/Cyberforce one-shot (Spring 2005?) Nobody bought that either. Nobody cared.Valentino's Shadowhawk story is next. I never cared for this character and this story is just average. Maybe Shadow Hawk (2 words?) have an interest.There is also an IMAGE comics timeline in the back. It even makes light of the lateness of this book. It's cool.Bottom Line. IF you are an Eric Larsen fan then by all means you will want this book.If you like Spawn a lot (and there are 14 of YOU left!) you will might want this book. But I'm sure Todd will repackaged this tale a few more times just to milk it.You get the idea....Buyer Beware."},{"Title":"The Panther and the Pearl","review":"The overall plot of this story is a man who won't take no for an answer and the so called strong willed woman who falls in love with him anyway. Kalid Shah, a ruler in some mideastern country sees American Sarah and decides he wants her for himself. He kidnaps hers, threatens to beat his servants if she doesn't do what he says and constantly tries to seduce her. This fluffy story is not even a good fantasy. The reader will not understand even after Sarah escapes, why she would have any feelings for the hero. Even up to the last page he is obsessed to the point of madness.The love scenes are so-so and not even the secondary romance had enough power to make this book interesting. Skip this one.Katiebabs"},{"Title":"The Panther and the Pearl","review":"The Panther and the Pearl was a fun book to read, I loved the exotic setting of 1800's Persia. The book starts with the hero, Kalid, buying Sarah, an American woman from the Sultan after he sees her just once in her role as a teacher to the Sultan's daughter. Sarah is of course not happy to have been sold to someone she doesn't know even if he is handsome and rich. Kalid knew that Sarah was the woman for him at first sight, so he did what he needed to do to have her as his own. After she is brought to his palace, she is placed in his harem as the new favorite. Kalid wants Sarah to come to him willingly, so he sets out to seduce her. But alas Kalid underestimates just how stubborn Sarah will be because although she is very attracted to him, she cannot get over his buying her and placing her as a prisoner in the harem.The book goes through the very tempestuous courtship of Kalid and Sarah after their unusual start of him buying her. I really enjoyed this story, the setting was very interesting and I felt Kalid acted as a man in his position would have but he never abuses her in any way or forces her - he wants her to fall in love with him and stay with him of her own accord. Sarah manages to stand up for herself and show Kalid what she needs from him if they are going to make a relationship work, which is great to see because Kalid has such a strong will that he would have run over someone who wasn't as strong as Sarah. If you like exotic settings or sheikh books, I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Panther and the Pearl","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Khalid is a man of the times... it was the late 1800's in Turkey. Sarah is smart and curious and that of course leads to trouble. To our fortune, and Sarah's, Khalid desires more than just a pretty face. This story gives only a little glimpse into harem life, a good thing I think, harem life as I understand it in most romance novels is human slavery after all. But enough of my political opinion, its a great story, one to read, and reread several times."},{"Title":"The Last Disco in Outer Mongolia","review":"I enjoyed this book. Middleton writes about a part of the world about which I knew very little, and one which is not covered by people like Bill Bryson. I liked his style of writing and I did not find him condescending toward a country and people which has been passed by by Western-style development."},{"Title":"The Last Disco in Outer Mongolia","review":"The book swings back and forth between the history of Mongolia (from the Khans to the Communists) and the author's two trips. One was near the end of the Communist regime, and his next trip (3 years later) was when Outer Mongolia was coming to terms with being a 'free country' again (not under rule of China or Russia). The differences between the trips are like night and day.I have made 3 trips to Mongolia from 2001 to 2005, roughly 10 years after the visits by the author. The most fascinating thing to me was to learn (in retrospect through this book) how much the country had changed in its first 10-15 years of freedom. When I compare my own experiences with those of the author, you would expect the time lapse to be several decades instead of just one.One book reviewer called this \\"often hilarious.\\" I wouldn't say that, but it does have some distinctive dry British wit and numerous true-life stories bordering on the bizarre (okay, way over the border in some cases).It's not a gripping travel tale, nor is it light reading. I think it would appeal most to people who have an interest in Mongolia. Just remember that the true story of Mongolia doesn't end with the author's second trip - many more changes have taken place since then. For a westerner's snapshot of Mongolia during the period of his two trips, tied in with history ancient and recent, it's great."},{"Title":"Here and hereafter;","review":"Ruth Montgomery (RM) wrote this book in 1968 after she became efficient in automatic writing which her Guides dictated. The Guides claimed to be from the other side. They helped her with the construction of this book which is written on the basis that we are the sum total of all our experiences including our past lives. The philosophy of reincarnation believes that with each thought, word and deed we are building the person we will be in future lifetimes.The book is filled with skeptics and believers who relieved their past lives like Dr. Stanley Krippner, Dr. Kelsey and Joan Grant, Henry David Thoreau, Louisa May Alcott, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, David Hume, Henry Ford, Harry Houdini and a horde of other famous and not so famous individuals.Hugh Lynn, the son of Edgar Cayce, recalls an experience he had during WWII when he moved through an Austrian village as a soldier. While he was drinking beer, he noticed a bridge and an old structure of a building that reminded him of the times during the crusades. He saw himself desert his wife and young child to follow the crusaders to liberate Jerusalem. Then forward a few hundred years when he was drafted and forced to leave his wife and young son with whom he longed to be. He drew the conclusion this might be a circle come full turn which settled a karmic debt. The reader will get the gist of this episode better when reading the whole book.The Guides assured RM that servicemen who kill the enemy of their country in the name of man-made laws for which they have no lust or liking, are not responsible for their acts as long as they do not go beyond the call of their duty relishing the slaying. The intent breeds the sin not the act itself.Bill & Judy Guggenheim wrote a book \\"Hello from heaven!\\" where the same rules shine through. At least that is the impression I got when reading the book. By the way RM and Bill Guggenheim both have Swiss roots.Edgar Cayce, the famous Kentuckian psychic, has a prominentplace in this book. He gave hundreds of physical readings (diagnostic and healing) and life readings. He tapped two sources while half asleep. One was the subject's subconscious which remembers all acts. The other was the collective unconscious or akashic records on which are written all deeds and thoughts since the beginning of mankind. With some practice, apparently, everyone can tap these two reservoirs and view their past lives.Edgar Cayce's remarks about group karma are also worth mentioning. This is the tendency for certain souls to be drawn closely together like a close-knit family where everyone knew each other in various relationships during several previous reincarnations. He stressed repeatedly unless we are willing to be linked in lifetime after lifetime with person(s) we dislike we should work ar solving the animosity which forges that bond.If nothing else, reading this book might make you a better person. Who knows, maybe the principles explored by RM might have a basis of truth. Your guess is as good as mine."},{"Title":"Here and hereafter;","review":"I was already a high school drama teacher when the 70s began. I thought I knew myself and the world around me. Then I happened to hear about reincarnation and karma. When I asked a friend, he introduced me to Ruth Montgomery. \\"Here and Hereafter\\" was the first book I read on these subjects, but not the last. All these years later, it is a delight to return to this writer and her revelations. It is as meaningful now as it was over 30 years ago.

The book provides compelling evidence to support reincarnation.Ruth Montgomery takes you through actual past life regression hypnosis sessions and what the people said, readings from psychics on people's past lives, and the readings of Edgar Cayce in both medical diagnosis and past life analysis to explain the subject's relationships with others and why certain events happened in their lives.The author also showed patterns, like people who died violently or suffered greatly had hurt people in previous lives.Some interesting occurrences that arose out of the regressions were the extreme level of detail the subjects were able to remember and how intense their emotions were during the recall.All the regressions were interesting, but the children who had total recall of previous lives which was verified beyond any doubt by trips to visit their prior life relations was the best.An excellent, timeless book."},{"Title":"Here and hereafter;","review":"This is a great book that will get you thinking about how you live your life in the present time on earth and how it could affect how things go for you in the here after.

Gutkind chronicled his adventures on a BMW /5 series bike in such a glorious way as to trigger my first mid-life crisis and got me into motorcycling. I dug out my copy the other day and found myself grinning over a passage in which Gutkind captures the joy of riders chasing each other up and down the mountains and valleys of West Virgina.Yes, it's dated material, but it's also guaranteed to make you want to go for a ride.

Where things get interesting is understanding I read the English translation that came out soon after the original French edition. The translation was completed by the late James Cameron, a highly respected British political writer of the period known for his anti-war and anti-imperialism views. The Brombergers wrote the book in the belief the military action was not only justified, but a noble act on the part of France. Conversely, Cameron was of the opinion the attack on Egypt was a disgrace and an affront to common decency. Cameron makes this point quite bluntly in the preface of the English edition. With these opposing views, it's difficult to understand why Cameron was chosen to do the translation.So, how well did the Brombergers/Cameron combination work? First, we must remember the book was written/translated very soon after the event. As often happens with books written like this, we find out years later of omissions and inaccuracies. As a result, \\"Secrets of Suez\\" is hardly the definitive work on the subject. That said, this is a very good account of the Suez Crisis, especially from the French perspective. No other book I've read on the subject, at least fifty by last count, has expressed the frustrations of the French as they dealt with the dithering and insecurities of British PM Anthony Eden and HM Government. Throw in the French unilateral military actions in direct support of the Israelis, despite the British wanting nothing to do with them made the entire enterprise almost comical. The Brombergers capture the near lunacy of such episodes very nicely, a point of view Cameron could agree with, although admittedly for different reasons.While there are more authorities books on the Suez Crisis (I'd start with Neff's \\"Warriors at Suez\\" for those wanting to get the big picture), \\"Secrets of Suez\\" is a fine near real-time account of one of the last century's least understood military conflicts."},{"Title":"The Long Shot","review":"I was drawn to this novel because of my great respect and admiration for the non-fiction writings of Paul Monette: both \\"Becoming A Man\\" and \\"Borrowed Time\\" are beautiful, moving documents of Monette's own life, his sexuality, & his heroic fight against the disease (AIDS) that claimed both his lover's life and, eventually, sadly, his own.I wish I could whole-heartedly recommend Monette's murder mystery, \\"The Long Shot,\\" but except for a very few interesting characters and a well-written, violent, horrifying death scene at the book's beginning, I found the entire thing very tired. Most of the characters could have come off of the Hollywood cutting room floor, taken out of a \\"B\\" movie because they were exceedingly trite. I do not want to tell you too many details since surprise is an element of any mystery, but the main conceit (The hero, Greg Cannon, meets and has sex with a young drifter. This drifter is found soon afterward with a major, closeted Hollywood star...both of them dead in a hot tub. And Greg feels so \\"connected\\" with the drifter, after one sexual experience, that he sets out to prove in a very long 320 pages that the men did not commit suicide) had me shaking my head in disbelief in chapter after chapter. Monette's over-use of hundred dollar words and simplistic metaphors is in direct contrast with his total simplicity and honesty in his autobiographies. (i.e.: \\"Though Artie had only made the mildest pass, the centrifugal motion seemed to push the moment to a pitch\\" or\\"The smell of lilies was so intense that after a while it began to seem not real---as cheap as the dollar toilet water they bottled to sell at the airport\\" or \\"...the screw was turning ever tighter.\\"The only people I'd recommend this limp mystery to are those who love Monette's work already and want to read everything he wrote."},{"Title":"The Long Shot","review":"A very worthwhile read for fans of the magnificent Paul Monette, &quot;The Long Shot&quot; is a different take on detective fiction and a wry examination of Hollywood closets and the corrupting power of wasted money. This novel lacks the white-hot rage and crystal clarity of his later works, but is superbly and objectively written, with a more direct storytelling device than in his first novel, &quot;Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll.&quot; Mr. Monette sometimes wrestles with a convoluted plot while delving effortlessly into well-rounded and believable characters. Newcomers to Paul Monette might try &quot;Halfway Home&quot; or his superb non-fiction works &quot;Becoming a Man&quot; or &quot;Borrowed Time.&quot;"},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"The book itself is already highly enjoyable. Now this audio version by Hugh Dickson is MIGHTY enjoyable master performance if you ask me. I had been listen to it so many times over and love it every time because of the characters, dialogues, and the humors. Georgette Heyer + Hugh Dickson - BEHOLD, this book is a must read must listen and an absolute keeper.p.s. The plot of this book is great in my opinion. I love it."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I read this book shortly after reading Death in the Stocks and I enjoyed encountering some of the same characters--Giles Carrington, Superintendent Hannasyde, Sergeant Hemingway--in both books. But the star of this book, for me, was Randall Matthews, the \\"amiable snake\\" at the center of the mystery. When Randall is first introduced, the reader is not quite sure what to make of him, but as the story unfolds, Ms. Heyer slowly reveals his character as being quite other than what he seems. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Randall and Stella change and develop, and was pretty sure I knew which way it would turn out, and better yet, was pleased about it. The murder mystery was appropriately difficult to figure out--at least for me--and was resolved satisfactorily. But it's Ms. Heyer's talent for creating memorable characters--including the saintly Mrs. Matthews, and her bitter rival, the waspish Miss Matthews--that elevates her writing above most others."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Glad to find some old favorites electronically. Heyer's characters base their actions in who they are, as in how they react to the murder here. The clue that helps the case get solved was faithfully depicting a victim's idiosyncrasy. As ever, she throws a romance in among the suspects."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I haven't read the whole book yet, but I like the style of writing or I guess the era.Kind of 1930's England mystery. The book came in perfect condition and arrive in a shortperiod of time. The seller took great care to package the book to prevent damage. I woulddefinitely buy from them again."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Uncle Henry has a history of heart trouble and doesn't wake up one morning. No one, even his physician, is surprised. But dear Aunt Gertrude, listening to Intuition, suspects Foul Play and insists on an autopsy. Since Aunt Gertrude is a cross between a battleship and a Victorian bulldog, an autopsy she gets.Surprise! Uncle Henry was, indeed, poisoned. The problem is that all of his relations have a motive. You see, Uncle Henry was not well liked at all; he took positive delight in thwarting his erstwhile relatives. They included two sisters, one sister-in-law, a niece, two nephews, and an attending physician who all had reason to hate him, and all benefited in one way or another from his unlamented passing.Georgette Heyer did a great job with this classic style, village mystery. It is a beautiful microcosm of English society between the wars. And it is very clever - well plotted, well paced, and somewhat intricate; you simply will not figure out whodunit. But where this story really shines is in the characters; they are broad, theatrical, believable, and *very* amusing. They moved the story along nicely with conflicts and idiosyncratic reactions to events. It was just a pleasure to read. The Saturday Review said this story was \\"a marvelous melange of malice, murder, mystery and mirth.\\" I couldn't have put it any better."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I only read the mysteries of GH if my library has them, but they are all rather unsatisfactory to me. They are full of despicable people, i.e the widowed mother in this one, but you knew she wouldn't end up being the murderer, though I sincerely wished something bad would happen to her. And the real killer, in all of her books, is always someone outside of the circle, even though the inner circle are packed full of motive. I also wished something bad would befell Guy, the selfish, idiotic son of aforementioned widow. Plus she always throws in a romance, which I do not need or like in mysteries. Her characters are cliches. The reason for the crimes end up being rather obscure and then the book comes to an abrupt halt."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"If you haven't read a Georgette Heyer mystery, you're in for a treat. Her deft characterizations, lively dialog and original plotting evident in her regency romances make their appearances in this mystery as well. I laughed aloud several times reading this book. It's worth reading the book alone for the character Randall, chief suspect, who always manages to say what will offend the other characters the most.For example, to his officious aunt who discovers her husband has a mistress, Randall declares he'd have several mistresses if he were his uncle married to his aunt. It's always delicious when Randall comes on the page, emitting his amusing and barbed comments, setting the scene in an uproar. Fortunately for the reader, Randall makes quite a few entrances in this mystery comedy of manners, or in the case of Randall, lack thereof.Georgette Heyer has transported her considerable talents and skills honed in her regency romances to this mystery novel. If you enjoy Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers for their ability to capture the flavor of the stylish Golden Age 1930's era in which they lived, and project it as a backdrop in their mysteries, you'll see Heyer has the same dexterity. The era is like another character in the book with its authentic vintage charm and style. This is a gem of a mystery for Golden Age mystery aficionados to relish and cherish."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I'm not a fan of Ms Heyer's regency romances, but I have enjoyed her mysteries. In this book, the tyrannical patriarch of a family is discovered dead in his bed. While his sister, sister-in-law, niece and nephew who live with him believe he must have died of a heart attack in his sleep and his doctor declares he died of natural causes, his other sister who comes over, takes one look at him and demands a postmortem, much to the alarm and horror of the rest of the family.The heir is loathed by all in the family for being irreverent and rude. But is he all that he seems? The results of the postmortem indicate that death was the result of poison. But how was it administered and who could have done it. Our Inspector Hannasyde is baffled at the lack of clues. There is no shortage of suspects ... it seems everyone had a reason to want dear old Uncle dead. In building the case, Ms Heyer keeps us guessing right until the last couple of pages."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"This murder mystery was so much fun! I happen to be partial to Heyer's mysteries, and this was the perfect comfort read for me.The Matthews are a dysfunctional family with lots of eccentric characters. The family head is murdered and everyone's worst qualities are brought to light. Secrets are revealed. Attachments are formed and broken. Everything is chaotic, and no one knows who to trust.Inspector Hannasyde is on the case, but he is not the focus of the plot. The scenes are all stolen by members of this crazy family. I loved the piously hypocritical widow, the cheapskate spinster, and the snakelike elder cousin. In typical Heyer fashion, the characters are memorable and amusing.Recommended for those who love old fashioned murder mysteries with great characters."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I can only wonder what it might have been like reading (eyes) this book; hearing Hugh Dickson perform it was a fine experience. His command of different voices is first rate, he made each character live without any sense of forcing an unreal voice for the opposite sex or different characters within his sexual group. The book, itself, is a family drama of a high order filled with oddity as well as the perfectly normal idiosyncrasies which mark any human group. The plot is admirably obscured save for those who insist on solutions at which a reader can arrive with the clues provided in the text ( as in Ellery Queen's early work). I don't believe the author makes any effort to provide such clues; this suits me since it is the story as story and characters as people which most interest me. If I figure out 'Who Dun It'. it is simply because the logic of the story strongly suggests it. That is not the case here.I was not aware of Georgette Heyer before acquiring this audio book. I see she wrote, as a good professional will, many works in many genres. I note that many of her works have recently been reissued in \\"quality\\" (more expensive) paper bounds. They are also available as text and robotically read works on the kindle (although that is not my source for the product I am reviewing).I can commend this rendition (again, I cannot comment on text edition) to anyone who is not exclusively into the thriller, the courtroom drama or the gritty, out on the dark streets, sub-genres. This is basically the classic British mystery of the Christie or Allingham type, or the American versions of the Ellery Queen type of book."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Although Georgette Heyer is primarely known for her Regency romances, she was also a writer of my classical English mysteries. This one is certainly her best. Although the plot is not exactly brilliant (hence only 4 stars) the characters are up to her usual standards, esp as the odious hero Randall who you love to hate and hate to love. Very entertaining, not only for Heyer's many fans..."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Georgette Heyer was a wonderful author. Her characters live, her conversations scintillate, and her plots are tantalizing."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Even worse than The Unfinished Clue, this one is no fun at all...where's the mirth? Bickering family members nagging each other on the same topics again and again. Almost each one with a plausible motive and opportunity because supposedly the method of administration of the poison was not known. But if you're familiar with the methods of Murder She Wrote and how the camera zooms in on everyday objects because they are major clues, you will also understand how the poison was administered just after the murder because the author \\"zooms in\\" on the clue. Nothing special/clever about the solution. This was my 4th Heyer book and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I believe Georgette Heyer was hoping to make the cousin Randall an attractive bad boy a la Johnny Depp; instead, he comes off as simply repugnant, like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the indie film \\"Happiness.\\" Some of the other characters are simply caricatures. As others have mentioned, Heyer is tight-fisted with the clues, although the set-up is a clever one.Detective Inspector Hannasyde is an amiable and clever fellow, but readers would do better to instead read \\"The Unfinished Clue,\\" which is a better mystery with more likable characters."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"\\"Behold, Here's Poison\\" by Georgette Heyer is a story that lingers in the mind. I read this book many years ago, but had the wrong author in mind when searching for it to reread. It was a delight to rediscover this clever story with a murder weapon I've never seen used in another story.Her characters dance from the opening page as real people we'd never meet except between the covers of a book. This is the second appearance of Supertindent Hannasyde as he struggles to deal with vivid \\"dingbats\\" and less than helpful relatives who will do their dam-est to protect the family name and foul his investigation. Randall Matthews is so finely drawn he is best described by his beloved as a \\"amiable viper.\\"A comic read, which will find a place on your shelf of \\"keepers,\\" if for no other reason than to study the exquisite art of the English verbal insult.Nash Black, author of \\"Qualifying Laps\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers.\\""},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"The plot is not great, but the other qualities in the book make up for this deficiency. Her characters are charming and well-developed, and you'd never guess who the murderer is - although that may be because it's so unlikely. One of my favourite Heyer mysteries, along with Why Shoot A Butler and The Unfinished Clue. If you liked Heyer's mysteries, you could also try Mary Stewart, who writes suspense/romance as well."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"Although she cannot be called a great mystery plotter (the murderer is highly unlikely and there is a dire lack of clues), her characters make up for any defects. The lovely dispicable Randall, is hilarious one of my favorite Heyer unheroes. I prefer her Regencies but the mysteries are highly palatable as well."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"My Sister read this before I did and warned me to re-read it a second time for fuller enjoyment. She was right. Once I knew what to expect I just sat back and enjoyed the banter. I believe this one might just be my favorite Heyer mystery, not for the mystery so much but for the characters especially the \\"Un-Hero\\", his witty insults are excellent in the extreme - to be enjoyed even cherished."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"I love to read British mysteries and try to always reserve time to read during breakfast and about an hour or two after. Then I have other things I must get done. 'Behold Here's Poison' Just would not let me get other things done! I'd put it down and soon find it calling to me, causing me to drop whatever work I was doing to discover the next delicious clue, the next character reveal, the next fun bit of dialogue and so on.I admit it, I do enjoy a bit of romance with my mystery and this had just enough--but that hero! Or was he the villain? I loved the dry wit of him, but the arrogance, the snootiness...or was it simply his way of seeing through so much family pretentiousness? Oh, well, the characters were all of such disorder and varying degrees of crazy-yet-sane, that following them around made for a fun read, and also made the progression of the clues all the more interesting. And what unusual poison. And the heroine was likable and strong and, given the time period (1930s), feminine and apt to turn around for help. I like that she didn't do stupidly dangerous things. And I liked the determined policeman, too.This was a most enjoyable read, amusing, baffling and hard to put down. And the route of getting to the solution was the best part, so this is a mystery I will relish reading again one day."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"This is a mystery novel set in Britain around 1936 (which is when it was written). The mystery was clever, the pacing was good, and journey (full of the the characters' foibles) to the answer was fun.The author introduces a lot of the characters quite rapidly at the beginning. It's not immediately clear how everyone is related to each other (especially since it's an odd assortment of relationships), but it all gets sorted out fairly quickly.Most of the characters aren't exactly nice people, but they are interesting and idiosyncratic. Initially, I didn't like a single character (except maybe Stella), but I soon found myself enjoying all of them. The author adds a good-natured humor to the book which shows up in the dialogue and in the quirks of the various characters.Though this is a mystery, the trouble with solving the mystery comes from the lack of obvious clues rather than from an abundance of them. I solved every part of the mystery except the who-done-it because the critical piece of information wasn't revealed until the very last moment. (However, the murderer was #3 on my list, so it is technically possible to guess.)There is a small amount of swearing by one character. Many of the characters say derogatory (though usually true) things about the others. There are no sex scenes. Overall, I'd rate this as \\"good, mostly clean fun.\\"Genre Reviewshttp://genrereviews.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"After reading such praise of Georgette Heyer, I decided to give one of her so-called \\"regency romances\\" a try and bought a brand-spanking-new copy of \\"These Old Shades\\", anticipating what I thought could only be a new favorite.I was sorely disappointed.After the initial grumble of frustration, the book's pretty cover was about the only thing I could respond positively to.However, shortly after tucking the latter book in some obscure corner of my bookshelf, I ran across her mystery titles and (after admitting that I'm much more of a riddle than a romance gal) I gave Ms.Heyer one last chance.-So- glad I did.As a reviewer before me stated, not a single character in the book is likable from the onset, but slowly and gently Heyer wins you over and by the finale you can't help but love the whole silly lot of them.However, as a true lover of the mystery I can't say that the clues were handled especially well.Heyer is so mum on any clue that when she does attempt to hint, you can only point and say \\"well that's how it was done\\" or \\"that means it was so-and-so\\".In the end, the charm of \\"Behold, There's Poison\\" for me was found in the characters and my surprise in finding how much I had enjoyed them."},{"Title":"Behold, Here's Poison","review":"When they re-issued the dozen or so Georgette Heyer mysteries recently, I was taken in by their appealing vintage cover artwork. What I discovered - to my surprise and delight - were wonderful English manor mysteries, similar in the Agatha Christie style.These books blend a nice, cozy, old-fashioned mystery with Ms. Heyer's wonderfully snarky and dry wit, which adds up to genuine reading pleasure. I've plowed through nearly all her mysteries and will be sorry when I read the last.

The characters are a little wacky, but in a delightful and amusing way. There's the outrageously thrifty Miss Matthews, moocher extraordinaire Mrs. Matthews and her spawn...and then there's Mr. Randall Matthews, newly made head of the family.

It was my first exposure to narrative poetry and it has been my favorite book since then. When I read twenty years later that it was also the favorite book of John F. Kennedy it reassured me that he would avoid war at all costs. It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark. He is able to impart the real devastation of war on the lives of those affected by it. I would reccommend it to anyone who loves poetry and history.

Of course I was also rooting for Elizabeth, the Justice Department agent who was working on the case.This was the first book by this author that I have read (or at least remember reading), but it is far from the last. The great thing about being late to read something is that I don't have to wait for a year for the author's next book. I am happy to be able to get another fix right away. I am especially happy to see there is a sequel of sorts, Sleeping Dogs, which brings back the Butchers Boy and Elizabeth."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"NEVER miss a book by Thomas Perry. I am so glad he made this a series . Every word written is perfect. There is nothing frivolous."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"The Butcher's Boy was published 30 years ago, so it feels a bit dated. However, the characterizations, plotting and flow of the novel are still first-rate, and Perry carries you right along. He's a good writer. I had several people recommed the book to me. I wasn't disappointed. Perry still has The Butcher's Boy in his cast of characters, and I'll have to read some of his more recent books to see if the character and plotting holds up. Definitely worth a try."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I Love this book , I have enjoyed several of Thomas Perry\\"s novels @ the Butcher\\"s Boy is 1st book with that justice's dept. &career retired military men, mercenary solders working mafia.This was a good mystery book."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This book made me want to read everything Thomas Perry has ever written.

Thomas Perry has his main character getting way out of her comfort zone, but she rises to job. The action is believable. I reccomend this book for those who appreciate well written books.WilliamB"},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This is the first of the Butcher Boy series and even though the guy is a killer, you can't help but hope he gets away. Perry has a writing style that is professional and educated at the same time. Can't wait for 2 and 3."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I highly recemmend The Butcher's Boy. It is Thomas Perry's first mystery novel. It is more violent than most mysteries, but the story is delivered in a very interesting style. I read this book over a period of two days; I found it hard to put down. If you like this book, you must read the two sequels."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I'm surprised at all the high praise for this book. I did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy for the hired killer. I found him very flat. The ending was unexpected; I expected a more complete wrap-up. Elizabeth was paranoid about being a woman in a job populated mostly by men. She was weak and dependent, but she was surprised when she was expected to do more menial chores than the men. She wasn't even very good at her job and seemed somewhat slow in her understanding of situaitons. Act weak, you get taken advantage of - man or woman."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I found the book to be rather flat. The motives of the unnamed assasin were perfunctory, the heroine was ineffective and I don't think the character of Maureen served any puprose--how did she help the assasin or earn her pay?In the Introduction, Michael Connelly describes feeling sympathy for the assasin. I did not feel any. The assasin was cold and unsympathetic. Also, by referring to the assasin only as &quot;he&quot;, Perry created some pronoun landmines in spots when he tried to juggle two he's and it wasn't clear which he was he (see how confusing that is?)."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I first read this book not long after it came out (over 30 years ago. Ouch!) and can't recommend it highly enough. This Amazon purchase was a gift for a client who had shared one of his favorite mysteries with me. I read a lot (own over 3,000 books and have donated an equal amount to charities) and I still re-read this every few years. I remember when I finally read a Grisham book (The Partner I think) being irritated by all of the hype when Perry had written in the same style so much better and earlier. The concept of a stone cold killer as a protagonist was very unique at the time and unlike some reviewers here, I found the interweaving of the Justice Department heroine masterful. I know this book so well, I can't look at it with fresh eyes. I don't know is the changes in the world since it was written (airport scanners, biometrics, etc) will make it seem out-dated. I suppose it now falls within the category of \\"historical mystery\\" (ouch again). If you enjoy this, follow it up withSleeping Dogs. It was great to catch up with \\"Michael\\" and Elizabeth."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I read way too many murder mysteries and procedurals.

It arrived earlier than forecasted, and the condition was just as described. Am very pleased with the quality and timeliness of service, and would use this provider again for sure.Thomas Perry is a terrific author. His material is well written with excellent descriptive narrative. His style and plotting keeps you turning the pages, hungry for more."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"After being out of print, we have this tale of a talented hit man back for our reading pleasure - and it is a pleasure. Like most hit men, the Butcher's Boy kills with cold efficiency. All goes well until he murders a United States Senator. This stirs the FBI and Department of Justice into intense action. The reaction worries the Mafia dons that hired the Butcher's Boy. He may be caught and implicate them, so the order goes out to kill him. While he eludes hit men trying to eliminate him, he also becomes more visible to a Department of Justice analyst, Elizabeth Waring. Soon, she is involved in the hunt while the Butcher's Boy goes to war against the Mafia dons. The story alternates between the shadowy Butcher's Boy and Elizabeth Waring. Their paths get steadily closer, and you want to tell her to back off - she is out of her league, but she unknowingly descends into the lair of the Butcher's Boy. The story should give thriller fans a good jolt. It is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I don't know how I missed knowing about Perry, since he's been cranking them out for a quarter-century, but somehow I did. I saw a recommendation for _Death Benefits,_ enjoyed that one, and went hunting for his earlier work. This is his first and it won an Edgar. The title character, never given a personal name, is a \\"specialist,\\" a highly professional hit man, who began learning his trade in early childhood from Eddie \\"The Butcher.\\" He's now one of the best and he works mostly for various mafia families. This job involves the murder of a member of a union local, and then the assassination of a senior U.S. Senator who has begun investigating in certain tax areas the mob doesn't want pried into. When our protagonist goes to Las Vegas to pick up his payment, however, he seems to have suddenly become a liability to his employers, who try to remove him from the scene. Big mistake. Taking out a professional, you had better get it right the first time -- and they don't. Pretty soon, mob soldiers, capos, and their underlings begin dropping like flies. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Waring, a smart young crime analyst working for the Justice Department, gets called in on the union hit as her first field assignment and develops her own theories about what's happening. The interesting thing in this sly and subtly plotted narrative is how often decisions are made on all sides based on erroneous information or misinterpretation of evidence. The characterization is excellent and the pace is frenetic, even though the protagonist is never anything but calm and collected. Finally, the small irony in the last two pages of the book is delicious."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"As usual, No Spoilers Here!\\"The Butcher's Boy\\" is not a new title...it's almost thirty years old, but it was re-released in 2007 in recognition of its twin \\"debuts\\": as author Thomas Perry's, as well as the initial appearance of his crime analyst, Elizabeth Waring.It's got legs, that's for sure, but they sprint, too. This novel reminds me of Frederick Forsyth's classic \\"Day of the Jackal\\": in both books a highly efficient killing machine is being tracked down by a highly efficient, bookish cop. For the duration of these books the two are hard at their task, both of them coping as best they can when things go wrong, as we know they always do.In \\"TBB,\\" both characters deal with their imposed limitations with finesse and expertise, refusing to let the imperfect armies around them control them. And both bend the laws of the seemingly impossible...and accomplish their tasks with an alternating use of clever planning and improvisation.Here, it's Perry's skill at creating characters that's also hard at play: both of the leads are drawn with a caring, expert eye, spelling out not only how they practice their crafts, but also how they think, and how they overcome their inevitable roadblocks and frustrations as well.At one point when Elizabeth is being forced into her menial role at the Dep't of Justice, due to not only her lack of seniority but also her gender, she copes as well as she can. Not only are the tasks given her trivial and backbreaking and meaningless, she can't even complain: \\"...because there wasn't anything to say that was sufficient to overcome the massive stupidity of it. If she tried they'd wink at each other behind her back and tell each other it was probably just that she was having her period. \\" Yet she does soldier on, and it's no spoiler to tell you that her hard work and keen eye do pay off.In his own way the killer is being forced to cope with an uncomfortable position as well, as he finds upon his arrival to receive payment for a recent job -where he'd been forced to think on his feet in one especially fascinating sequence--he could not have shown up at a worse time. A mob war is occurring and they're taking no prisoners.It can certainly be said that we should not root for the bad guy, but it's to Perry's credit that he's endowed his killer with a personality and a rationale for his actions. While he has picked a terrible occupation, his respect for those who practice it well and have left their marks upon him is not only at once creditable, but credible as well.When the killer thinks, he does so in a cut-and-dried manner, with no room for flowery prose--not in his occupation. At one point, when he first comes to the realization that he is in a no-win situation, he thinks only of situation and consequence, as his enemies would: \\"But as far as they were concerned he was dead already. He had been from the moment some old man's mind had settled on him and declared him a possible irritant. All that had remained was the mechanical, automatic translation of the thought to accomplishment...\\"As in the aforementioned \\"Day of the Jackal,\\" it's really interesting to see how similar cop and killer really are: both are meticulous at their tasks and think on their feet equally well. In the midst of thankless jobs, it's their dedication to their crafts that make them the two most interesting characters in the book.Oh--and the action. And the deaths. There's plenty of this stuff to go around. ..I lost count at about ten killings. But it's not just fire and be done with it. There are several nail-biting sequences here--I think I read the book's 368 pages in about three otherwise busy days.My only complaints were that the book's deep background characters, the tertiary ones who at the heart of the crime war, got a bit interchangeable toward the end. It was tough keeping these characters apart, especially with the multi-syllabic Italian names.But it's a small complaint in a book this good. Plan to pick it up when your schedule's clear for an afternoon, preferably on a rainy day. You're going to want to read this..."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"If you like compelling thrillers, Thomas Perry is your man- at least with this book and the sequel- Sleeping Dogs. I discovered this book when it was first pulished, and spent a number of years trying to find it after it went out of print. Now it is back, and I no longer have my copy because I loaned it to a thriller loving friend. Shouldn't really like the book- the \\"hero\\" is a hit man who is truly amoral, and yet somehow you still get engaged with him. The writing is lean and moves the story at a perfect pace. I love deep books about complex charcters, but for relaxation give me a well written page turner anytime. And this book is just that. I recommend reading both books, as I think the story becomes fully fleshed only in Sleeping Dogs. Then move on to the Jane Whitfield novels- great plotting and writing and the heroine is truly that."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I read SLEEPING DOGS and really enjoyed it. Then I spent two years trying to find THE BUTCHER'S BOY in used bookstores (before I owned a computer). Stumbled across it at a yard sale for 50 cents. Couldn't put it down after I started reading it. Stayed up until daybreak to finish it. This is one of the best books I've ever read (and I've read a lot)! The other reviews are all accurate. If you like mystery/action/suspense, buy it. But don't start reading it until you have the time to finish it. You won't put it down. SLEEPING DOGS is great too, but a sequel is a sequel is a sequel. METZGER'S DOG (not a sequel) is also quite good--it's more of a comedy and not on the same level as THE BUTCHER'S BOY."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This guy is great! The writing, the plotting, the twists and turns are terrific. Fresh ways of looking at people's actions & their feelings. Sense of humor is welcome too. I sometimes find 20 or 30 year old books sort of dated but this wasn't at all. Now reading Dead Aim by Perry and finding that just as entertaining. Will be collecting this one.No need to discuss the meat of the book, but I highly recommend this author."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"My library branch head boss likes to recommend the classics of a genre. Before this, she recommended Ken Follett's &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;. Then she thrust this one into my hands after my coworker's son returned it, who had read it in four hours.Although I must admit my more deliberate pace, I will say this is a quick read.This book is similar to Ken Follett's &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; in several ways. Both are fast paced thrillers that feature main characters who are methodical professionals, but professions (spy, hit-man) that require ruthlessness--both characters are kind of like evil MacGyvers.While their characters are flat, their pursuers have a human side. The storytelling switches between killer and pursuer, which paces nicely.While &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; ends with a dramatic clash between two characters, &quot;Butcher's Boy&quot; side-steps the collision of killer and pursuer with a bit of the deus ex machina (the killer just happens to run into the person who has the 2 separate pieces of information he needs, an insane amount of money, and the means to frame his pursuers).Despite this flaw, the real joy comes from watching the Butcher's Boy achieve impossible objectives and extricating himself from certain demise by preparing for multiple situations while simultaneously improvising solutions.Therefore, I highly recommend this to any business school student, aspiring lawyer, or wannabe evil MacGyvers."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Bravo Mr Perry. I started here and have read all of his books. I am so totally stunned and impressed by his writing style. He paints pictures not in flowery language yet you feel you are in very real situations.

We get follow this particular character in subsequesnt books, but Perry is not limited to one arena."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"The main character or protagonist manages to seem human and worthy or our affection despite the fact that he kills people for a living.

I gave it 3 Stars and would give Mr. Perry another try before I make my final decision on future reading."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This is the story of a professional killer who is hired to perform several killings to avoid an investigation. The fun of the book is watching the killer react when his plan goes awry. He cleverly with exquisite execution defuses the situation.The FBI agent who is pursuing him adds very little to the effort. I keep waiting for her to add some significance to the narration but it never happens.The character of the hit man who for some reason Mr. Perry only names once in the book is engaging. We forget that he is a cold blooded killer until we are reminded by an FBI agent. The second wonderful part of the book is the description of Las Vegas. I have shared it with a friend of mine who lived and worked in Las Vegas for several years and from her description it was right on.Lastly and this may be carping. The book would have been better without the last two pages."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"To call it trite would be to give it too much credit. Ridiculously contrived ending. The main charecter added nothing to the story. I cannot think of a more poorly written book. Perhaps the author is waiting for some action from Hollywood. Do not waste your money on this, and if you get it free, do not waste your time."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"SPOILERS. This novel has two stories moving in parallel with each other. We are first introduced to Elizabeth Waring who works for the Justice Department. Her job is to analyse the data from various murders, looking for anything that will indicate the work of a professional killer.The second concerns a professional killer who works for the mob and who has just taken out a minor union activist called Albert Veasy.The narrative moves backwards and forwards between these two characters. Waring is partnered up with an FBI agent called Hart to investigate the Veasy killing; meanwhile the killer has moved on to Denver for his next assignment, the assassination of a senator, which he accomplishes.Just as they feel they are getting somewhere on the Veasy murder Waring and Hart are taken off the case in order to investigate the death of the senator.At this point you feel like you know how the story is going to develop and you read on in anticipation.Except it doesn't. There is no cat and mouse game between the protagonists (the developing relationship between Hart and Waring is dropped when Hart is taken off the case).At no point is Waring hot on the heals of the killer, in fact Waring doesn't even come close to discovering who the killer is.The story moves to Vegas where the hitman is double crossed by the mob and so he spends his time trying to find out why and who wants to kill him. Waring is also in Vegas and is investigating what seems to be a war between the different mafia families, she does not connect the hitman with the various mafia murders. She messes up big time on a couple of occasions and is lucky to keep her job. She does not make amends for her mistakes or saves the day. The story is then wrapped up to nobody's satisfaction.In an introduction to this book Michael Connelly says that it is his favourite Thomas Perry novel. This does not encourage me to try out any more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Cardboard characters. Totally unrealistic plot devices.

I put off reading it for awhile until I was in the mood for something on the darker side. I am surprised by how much I liked this book. Really not sure why. Something in the way Thomas Perry writes I guess. I am fairly certain I need therapy of some kind because I couldn't stop myself from rooting for him - meaning: not hoping for the worst for \\"him\\". (he does have teeny-tiny moments where he showed very, very, very brief moments of some flashes of not being completely and utterly devoid of humanity or maybe I just was trying to justify my moments of rooting for him because he obviously is evily unwell). I did like his MacGyver-ness. Elizabeth was a total disappointment- I think the synopsis totally oversold/misrepresented her. I will now juggle Thomas Perry and Michael Connelly."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"As you read this book, you have to keep reminding yourself that this is the first novel by Perry. It is an excellent debut novel.Looking at the new books, at the library, I saw Thomas Perry's latest novel, Silence. I wasn't sure if I wanted to dedicate time to get it read and returned by the two week limit, so I went in search of some of his earlier works. I decided on The Butcher's Boy. And it was a great read.He (the killer is always referred to as \\"he\\" throughout the novel) is very good. And extremely careful. His jobs always go through middlemen, so he doesn't know who hired him or why. He doesn't want to know. But he is very effective. A union officer is blown up in California. A senior Senator dies in Colorado. Nothing to link either victims or the people that wanted them eliminated. When the killer arrives in Las Vegas, a few days early, strange things start happening and it isn't long before he discovers that there is a contract out on him. But who and why? The killer finds himself running from not only his ex-employers but also a very smart and dedicated Department of Justice analyst.I found this novel riveting. Told mainly from the point-of-view of the killer, you find yourself hoping that he makes it out alive. Even though he is ruthless. And the Department of Justice analyst, Elizabeth Waring, is one of the best female characters in fiction. She is smart, tenacious, dedicated. She feels that there is a link between the union official and the senator, but her bosses aren't about to go on \\"feelings.\\" I looked forward to continuing the novel, spending as much free time as I could reading. For a debut novel, Perry includes plenty of twists and turns, believable dialog and characters, and an excellent plot.A fantastic debut novel, one that will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"An early 80s Edgar Award winner, this wonderful adventure pits Department of Justice prodigy Elizabeth Waring against The Butcher's Boy, the professional assassin who remains nameless throughout the book. He's good at his job. Two early murders, one of an influential U.S. Senator, put the Department of Justice and Elizabeth and her co-workers, sometimes in uneasy alliance with the FBI and local law enforcement, on the trail of an unknown murderer, maybe two since they aren't sure if the homicides are related or not. The factor tying them together turns out to be Fieldstone Growth Enterprises, ostensibly an investment company. Things end up going in unpredictable directions for both main characters, many caused by he role of a mafia-like organization that touches on all of this business and the lives of the murderer and Elizabeth. There are plenty of murders in the book, some first hand, some only discussed, but only peripherally gory in most cases. I found it disconcertingly easy to like the assassin, not the first bad guy of Perry's I liked (see Gordon in Metzger's Dog). I've read half a dozen or more of Perry's books. This is his first, and it's interesting to see in character Maureen a foreshadow of Jane Whitefield (try Vanishing Act), a character I enjoyed immensely in her several novels. This is one more sample of why I find Perry to be a most reliable story teller, entertaining and consistently good."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"It was Michael Connelly's introduction that led me to this book. I read somewhere about the re-issue of \\"The Butcher's Boy\\" with an introduction by my favorite author and I was so impressed with Connelly's assessment of the book that I ordered it from Amazon. I enjoy reading debut novels and I will certainly continue to read Thomas Perry's books. Obviously, he has become an accomplished novelist since writing \\"The Butcher's Boy\\" and I am anxious to read more of his work."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Thomas Perry's first novel is a Killer-Thriller! I had read &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;(the sequal) before I read &quot;The Butchers Boy&quot;. Both books are great. I am glad they re-printed &quot;The Butchers Boy&quot; because it explains a lot I missed when reading&quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. However, each book can stand alone without the other. The &quot;Butchers Boy&quot; is about a hitman that is double crossed by the mob after he completed some contract(killing) work for them. It also tells the story of the Department of Justice Field Agent that is trying to tie all the killings together. It is a race to the end to find the missing link that will tie the knot to this killer-thriller. Also don't miss the few chapters that introduces us to the much loved &quot;jane whitefield series&quot; the lady that can make you disappear. I hope Perry brings that series back-it was one of his best. &quot;Butchers Boy is a good read!"},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Butcher's Boy grabs you from the start and keeps you going. The thing that makes this book so compelling is that you end up rooting for the &quot;bad&quot; guy.The protagonist of this book is a ruthless professional killer who has earned the nickname that is the book's title. Nonetheless, you end up hoping he'll get away from the even more awful people who hire him, and the police (remember they're supposed to be the &quot;good&quot; guys).Perry's descriptions of settings and characters in this, and all of his books, are excellent. This one is embellished by a tight plot and a point of view that is different from other novels.I wish I hadn't given my copy away as the book is now hard to find. Perhaps a publisher will re-issue it; or it'll be made into a movie (hopefully a good one) that will bring it back on the shelves."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Thomas Perry introduces the unpredictable Butcher's Boy in this book and continues the story years later in the novel Sleeping Dogs.

After he assassinates a high profile target in a particularly clever manner, he expects to receive his payment and go about his business. Instead, more dead bodies begin to pile up and what should have been a straightforward job turns out to be anything but. Who is behind the unexpected bloodbath and what will it take for the butcher's boy to escape unscathed?The female protagonist is Elizabeth Waring, a highly intelligent and determined woman who has worked for over a year as a data analyst for the Justice Department. Her job is to go through lists of computer printouts, looking \\"for a pattern that will lead ... to a professional killer....\\" She also helps keep track of the whereabouts and activities of known organized crime figures. When Elizabeth comes across an account of the murder of a thirty-five year old machinist in Ventura, California, she notices that the deceased, Albert Veasy, was a union activist. He died in a monumental explosion that occurred after he turned the key in the ignition of his pickup truck. Who would want this average blue-collar worker, who had no known enemies, dead?Although Elizabeth and the butcher's boy appear to have nothing in common, their interests are destined to intersect. Her boss sends Elizabeth to California to look into Veasy's death, even though she is not an experienced investigator. She and the butcher's boy subsequently spend a great deal of time and energy trying to figure out why so many additional people are being slaughtered, especially in Las Vegas. When the butcher's boy himself becomes a target, he will need all of his survival skills to escape his tenacious pursuers. The hunter has become the hunted.Perry's intricate debut novel has the same brisk style that has served him well throughout his career. He never indulges in purple prose or overstatement. The plot is original and suspenseful. The author captures settings, characters, and moods perfectly with his precise and carefully crafted descriptive writing. Although it may not be politically correct to admire a cold-blooded killer, we cannot help but root for the daring, resilient and ingenious butcher's boy, who takes such pride in his work and is meticulous in his attention to detail. He uses his acting ability, familiarity with surveillance techniques, knowledge of weaponry, and more than a bit of luck to stay alive. This is a fitting introduction to an author who consistently comes up with compelling and original stories about unusual people caught up in forces that they cannot easily control. Perry's world is ambiguous and quirky. It is a place with no explicit set of values, where justice is meted out capriciously, loose ends are left dangling, and there is no clear-cut line between good and evil."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This is the Edgar Award winning first novel by Thomas Perry that introduced us to the hit man known as the Butcher's Boy. It is a first class thriller that set in motion Perry's career and introduced us to The Butchers Boy,Sleeping DogsandThe Informant: An Otto Penzler Book (Butcher's Boy). Don't be misled by the Butcher's Boy title; this is not a gore fest; in fact it is more of a chess game kind of book. You won't find a better, leaner series than this! Get a copy while you still can."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"The Butcher's Boy is not lyrical or beautifully written, it gets straight to the point--action and suspense. It is dark but lightened with sarcastic humor, and it is an intense, page turning thriller: a Female detective desperate to catch the killer, and a killer so well defined that you keep finding yourself rooting for him too. This book has a very satisfying ending no matter which one you were rooting for.And I totally disagree with the reviewer who wanted to leave the last two pages out--they were the perfect, satisfying ending.One of my other favorite books is Ludlum's The Bourne Identity (the movie was NOT based on the book!!! so read the book.) The Bourne Identity and the next two in the series were similar to The Butcher's Boy in that they were page turners that have a certain humor that showed itself just when you needed the relief."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"THE BUTCHER'S BOY, Thomas Perry's first in a long line of first-rate thrillers, introduces the reader to Perry's signature style.

Read this and all his others for pure escapist fare."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"I read this book in one sitting, something I've haven't done since. It always amazed me that a movie hasn't been made out out this great story line: Hit-man on the run, young female FBI agent and Mafia hit-men on his trail. What fascinated me was the detailed picture that Perry paints on the need of a person in a business such as the 'Butcher's Boy' to blend into the background and, by all means, NOT get noticed: what clothing to wear, what food and drink to order at a restaurant, how and where to walk. He's carried this on somewhat in his later books, which are all very good, but this is, I believe, his masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Wonderful main characters and very believeable.

Like all of Perry's novels, it's a clever and irresistible can't-put-down."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"This was one shrewd story. Accurately compared to \\"The Day of the Jackal\\", Perry puts the reader in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the green Justice Department analyst who is pursing a possible hit man on paper, as well as the flesh-and-blood hit man as he tries to escape from double-dealing employers and dumb old bad luck. Perhaps it is because said hit man is clearly bright and has such careful habits and such a will to survive. You wouldn't want a wolf in your back yard, but you do admire their skill, cunning, and life force.It seems that there are many mysteries set in and around Las Vegas lately but this one really does capture the seediness behind the scenes and the grainy textures of the life there.It is a complex, well-told story that is really quite unique in its approach and deserves a read if you're able. I had to scour the used bookstores for my copy - it is out of print."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Guys read this book, and mention it to their close friends, yet don't quite understand why they like it.

The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is sharp, and the story is gripping. After reading The Butcher's Boy, I immediately read Sleeping Dogs, which was also marvelous. After that, I picked up the Jane Whitefield series, and once again I thought I had died and gone to reading heaven.Read all of Thomas Perry's novels if possible."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"Thank you Amazon recommendations, thank you. THE BUTCHER'S BOY by Thomas Perry is an oldie written in 1982. It won the Edgar award for best first novel, very deserving! I Think this book is simply outstanding.

I see a lot of these reviews are describing &quot;The Butcher's Boy&quot; as a page-turner, a novel they couldn't put down, a book they inhaled in 4 hours! That was my precise reaction: &quot;Thank heaven I've found another author of page-turners!&quot; It doesn't happen to me often enough.What I can't figure out is how Perry writes with such enjoyable economy and still manages to create that magic of gluing the reader to the text. If you are a writer yourself, this question is worth getting to the bottom of.A mesmerizing tale of a professional killer going about the business of evading his pursuers, &quot;The Butcher's Boy&quot; is a novel that will send you in search of more Thomas Perry books."},{"Title":"The Butcher's Boy","review":"\\"The Butcher's Boy\\" is fairly good, but I have trouble understanding where all the high praise comes from. The action scenes are well written - particularly the part where Maureen makes love to the protaganist while coldly planning to murder the unacknowledged intruder in their hotel room - but they're not as suspenseful as those in, say, \\"The Marathon Man\\". And there doesn't seem to be a lot of intrigue or building suspense. The Butcher's Boy plots and kills for revenge, but it's not especially clear that he needs to do it to survive. So with that somewhat unsympathetic premise, the reader can be lost. I was, anyway.This is not to say a story can't work if the protaganist is amoral. It can; the Patricia Highsmith \\"Ripley\\" novels are a good example; the original film \\"Get Carter\\" with Michael Caine is an even better one (in that story, Jack Carter's motive for bloody vengeance is all too clear). But one murderous execution after execution without any sort of purpose can make the reader feel rather empty."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Lost your St. John's wort?

It is our great good fortune that he also had the desire and the ability to tell us about it in such an entertaining and riveting way. Cellini speaks so frankly of his terrible temper and bloody feats of revenge--many of which landed him in hot water (and dank dungeons)with the authorities--that we are tempted to think him candid and frank. Actually, what he reveals of himself was flattering to the 16th century Italian gentleman.

ThanksTerry"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This review is for the audio book version of this amazing autobiography. Cellini is an incredibly arrogant individual, but his story is entertaining and gives a fascinating look at the Renaissance and many of its major characters. Even though he is not the most likable man in the world, there were many things to admire about his strength of character. It is easy to see why he had so many enemies, though I'm not sure he understood why. His descriptions of the courts of Italy, France, and the Church give us priceless information on how they functioned. I noticed that historians like Durant referenced this work a lot in their histories. This also affirms to me that human nature has always been the same.The reader for this audio book is Robert Whitfield, whose characterization is exactly what I would imagine for Cellini. He had that touch of arrogance in his voice one would expect from a major braggart, but it was not too grating and easy to listen to. The translation by John Addington Symonds was also excellent and very easy for a modern ear to understand.I highly recommend this audio book for anyone that loves a good story. It has action, adventure, romance, intrigue, and about anything else one would look for in a good book. The audio book is 15 hours long, and the time went by quickly."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"A wonderful romp into old italias glory days.My copy is from 1948, and has illustrations by Salvador Dali,pen and ink, but still...I have spent many years of my life as a goldsmith,and if I had to go through all that Cellini had to, I would have swept floors for a living"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This autobiography resembles a popular life in the American wild west (not what one would expect of an iconic Renaissance sculptor/goldsmith), or so it seemed to me when I read this translation in the early 70's.It's a rare, remarkable work that remains memorable over the years. The saga of a vibrant genius (and the pleasure of reading this work) still remains."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"It's a bit annoying to listen to Cellini talk about himself for 400 pages in such a manner.

You have to be into the Renaissance, or history, to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This book is a treasure; it gives a peek into the 16th Century Italy in such a vivid manner that it takes the reader into a magical journey with cardinals, popes, kings, and famous artists of the time . . .

In trying to find a copy of the book, I found many versions, but, recognizing the cover as the one I'd read, I opted for that one. Surprisingly, the one that arrived was not the same cover as illustrated. It probably will make no difference in the long run, but it was a surprise!"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This translation, though old, is great. The footnotes provide information about the numerous people Cellini talks about whom we have never heard of. Pope Clemmet 7th, Ivan the Terrible of the Church and a Medici, commisioned Cellini amd met him several times, as did Pope Paul 3rd. Cellini reports without comment or condemnation the corruption of the Roman Church when it was fully in the period that produced what Nietzsche called \\"The reaction of old fashioned minds against . . \\"In a way it is as if we had notes from a man who once a week had lunch with Stalin and records his table talk. The superficiality of the religious feelings of these Popes and high churchmen who battled for institutional power in the manner of any prince comes through loud and clear. I found the book and this particular translation fascinating because I have studied the period in some depth.Details are fascinating. Rome is under attack; Clemet VII is pope and in the lower section of a fortification. Cellini, above with a small cannon hits and cuts in half an enemy of Clemet. The Pope is overjoyd with Cellini, who kneels and asks the forgiveness of tghe church for killing the man.Cellini lived during the time of Henry 8th through part of the period of Elizabeth 1st, Pope Paul III, Charles 5th. His insight into the corruption of the Catholic Church is particularly acute: He mentions the \\"French Disease\\" of which priests, especially wealthy priests, are particularly vulnerable; he mentions a particular Archbishop, whom the translator in a footnote tells us had become archbishop at the age 17.Bits, like squirting bird blood directly into his eyes when he had a metal sliver in one eye, the blood pumped from the dying bird into the eye. Many fun things."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Benvenuto. It means Good Arrival. All the same this is not the book that most of our readers might have hoped for or welcomed. Compared with popular biographers, such as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Gore Vidal or David McCollough, Cellini does little to help the reader understand context... the stage on which his character struts his stuff. For example, in No Ordinary Time, Ms. Kearns effectively informs the reader about pre-war America, her people, their prejudices, fears, and aspirations. By providing and illuminating the context, she establishes her two characters' place in history in a way that no one had ever quite done before. By way of contrast, Cellini's potentially extraordinary story reads more like a series of answers to the ongoing question: How did your day go today, dear?Long books seem to be governed by a law of composition which says that the more detail is piled up, the less we understand. Mr. Cellini cannot always see the wood for the trees, nor can his readers. Thus whoever wants to know the attendees, including their middle names and town of origin, at a meal in Rome on December 12, 1567, can find it on page 439. But nothing is made clear about how he learned his craft, how or why he selects certain subjects or materials. Only the previously informed will have the slightest idea of his place in the arts and history. By not fulfilling his duty as a biographer, we are left with an incoherent interpretation of the man. In the end, Cellini the writer fails to do justice to Cellini the artist."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Somewhere in France, Michel Montaigne was working on his immortal \\"Essays.\\" Gibbon described him as the only man of liberality in the 16th century, aside from Henry IV. His honesty, his good will, and his probing nature have recieved the acclaim of posterity.Somewhere in Italy, the same time, a more representative portrait was being painted -- the Autobiography of Cellini. While it has the same honesty, it lacks the grace (written in a colloquial style), the liberality, and the meditation of Montaigne. It is probably more represantative of the Renaissance man, and of modern man altogether. Reading Cellini, one comes to understand what Camus meant by the \\"culture of death\\" at work in Western history.Written as a novel (seen, in fact, as a progenitor of the Romantic novel), the Life of Cellini is a remarkable glimpse into the Italy and France in the times of Michelangelo and the Medici. Characters like Francis I of France, Duke Cosimo, Pope Clement VII, and artists like Michelangelo and Titian come to life in brilliant colors. But one shouldn't mistake the intent of Cellini's book as painting a portrait of his times -- no man on earth was ever so in love with himself, and HE is the subject of this book (I had to cringe every time Cellini, about to describe something fantastic, stops and declares \\"... that is the work of historians. I am only concerned with my affairs...\\" and leaves off).I can't say for sure, but the veracity of this book must be almost incontestable, for the most part. Cellini was simply too shameless to be too much of a liar. A few times he tests our credulity: \\"mistakenly\\" leaving France with the King's silver, an arbesque \\"accidentally\\" firing and killing a man, etc. For the most part, however, we get the whole truth, and in fact more than we wanted to know.Despite the fame and prestige Cellini comes to, he is little more than a common street rogue and villian. In the course of the book, he murders three people in cold blood, each murder worse than the last (the third time he shoots a man in the throat over a saddle dispute... on Good Friday). He delights in describing his violence (\\"...I meant to get him the face, but he turned and I stabbed him under the ear.\\"), and he revels in warfare, brawling, and the misfortune of his enemies. Aside from the three murders, there are innumerable foiled and aborted murder attempts. Cellini's sadism reaches new heights when he forces one of his laborers to marry a whore, then pays the woman for sex to humiliate the man. In his descriptions of his crimes, his many run-ins with the law, and his violent disposition, Cellini seems completely unaware of himself and without shame. In fact, the intent of the book is to show him as the virtu -- a hero of divine virtue in a world of lies and deceit.The portrayal of King Francis alone makes this book worthwhile. He is everything historical events point him out to be. Generous, jovial, and shrewd. The descriptions of the years Cellini spent as Paul III's personal prisoner are another high point, unfortunately capped by the lengthy and horribly tedious poem, \\"Capitolo,\\" where Cellini clumsily elaborates on his suffering.As a history and an autobiography, there are few greater works. But aside from its historical and literary value, the Autobiography of Cellini was just fun to read. The audacity and conceit of this horrible man is almost comical, and the loose and efficient prose makes it a smooth read."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Cellini's story reads better than a novel. He is the quintessential Renaissance man. In his service to popes, kings and a slew of dukes he was a goldsmith, painter, sculptor, soldier and he may have had more near death experiences than any other that I have ever read about. Of course, his tale leaves himself always and forever blameless in each conflict, betrayal or other unfortunate episode that he finds himself in, which is tremendously entertaining. At first, the reader is seduced into believing that this man has been wronged countless times by a world full of the most slippery types of people. By the middle of the book, however, it dawns on the reader that Cellini must have played some part in creating the misfortune and danger that he is constantly in. Cellini's writing evokes vivid images of the places and people that he meets. One of the most engrossing stories in the book is Cellini's imprisonment and later escape from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, where he was confined by order of the Pope (who, according to Cellini, was bent on having him killed in order to prevent his own embarrasement). His escape from the place is a mix of (apparently) classic methods (he climbs down the side of the building using knotted bed sheets!) and terrible misfortune (he breaks his leg, is nearly killed, and is also attacked by mastiffs while crawling away for his life!). Very soon after having escaped the prison, though, he was again imprisoned by the Pope in a wretched and dank little cave in the Pope's own garden (where Cellini claims to have had mystical visions). Cellini has many other adventures in Italy and France (and on his journeys back and forth). Each tale is centered on how he creates his artworks in the service of some nobleman, how the nobleman is always astonished at the work, how Cellini is then betrayed by someone he was kind to (which, through no fault of his own, often puts him in the bad books of the patron). Cellini frequently ends up in a fight where he either wounds or kills the person, and then goes on his happy way. There is a great deal that one could say about this book and its author. It will suffice to state here that the book is a wonderful read, it offers excellent insights into life in the 16th century, and (as is true on my part) it makes the reader crave just half the adventure that this fellow has had."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"There are few books about the renaissance that are as entertaining and rewarding as this autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, one of the most celebrated glodsmiths and artists of that time. The book is candid and can also serve as a tour guide of Florence for the more adventurous. Certainly I would recommnend reading it if you're thinking of visiting. Cellini describes other artsist of the time, famous spats between artists and between artists and their masters. despite the genius of the man, Cellini's book is more interetsing as a first hand docuemnt of what it was like to live in that time. One gets the imperssion of the sort of education parents siught for their children. Cellini describes this without holding back contempt, we also learn of his musical talents and his childhood. Cellini vividly describes his father beating him on the ears in order to leave the lasting impression of the wonderous sight of a salamander in the fireplace. the heart of the book is set in Rome, where he meets the Pope and is then imprisoned in the Fortress of castel Sant'Angelo - the very same made famous by Puccini's Tosca. Unlike the Puccinian Cavardossi, cellini is bale to escape thanks to the clich&eacute; use of bed linens. But remember this is not fiction. I would also suggest to thos interested in this book looking for Anatnio Vasari's &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;, Giovanni della Casa's &quot;Il Galateo&quot; and of course &quot;The Prince&quot; by Macchiavelli. Other renaissance accounts were written by Gucciardini and the Bolognese Paolo Giovio. As a final note I read the original Italian and parts of the English translation featured here. The Tranbslation was very good."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This book covers the eventful life of a passionate craftsman who lived through major events of the Renaissance. In Florence, Rome, and Paris, Cellini managed to gravitate to the most powerful political and artistic personalities, but his relationships with them were always bumpy. Cellini had an artist's temperament and more - his passionate temper and sense of righteousness, combined with the unscrupulous nature of many he encountered, caused constant friction and turmoil which make the book a nonstop and occasionally violent thriller. The book's one disappointment for those interested in history is the lack of extensive description of the places where he worked and travelled. It's centered on Cellini, his relationships and activities, and his craft. He does however have a great description of the defense of Rome in 1527, in which he was firing artillery from the top of Castel St.-Angelo. George Bull rates five stars for a great translation which captures the spirit of the original, its passion, wit, sarcasm, bitterness and insight. Given the work was written with Florentine colloquialisms, this is an achievement. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Cellini was one of the most famous jewellers in the Rennaisance. He was also a sculptor, connoseur, lover and fighter. Not too blessed with modesty, this book filled with intrigue and mania is fascinating reading. Cellini is hedonistic and yet passionate about his art. We get to see a whole slice of papal, court and artisan society in Italy. Cellini is imprisoned and makes escapes, attempts on his life are regular and yet he continues to make amazing commissioned work.The reason I didn't give the book more stars is because it is at times difficult to understand and appreciate. Much of the details with respect to the alliances of Cellini's Italy are hard to follow for someone who doesn't know that much about the Renaissance. Also, he does seem to be a little overbearing on occasion. Still, a great read.My original acquaintance with Cellini was with Alexandre Dumas' \\"Ascanio\\" - where he takes the autobiography as a basis to spin his usual tale of high suspence. As a comparison, reading this and then Ascanio is a pleasure."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Benvenuto Cellini was a leading figure of the Italian Renaissance. He was close to the Florentine court and participated in royal intrigues. He was a major artist in a period of major artists, creating numerous works of beauty that can still be seen today. (His most famous work is the statue of Perseus holding the head of the Medusa, which stands in the piazza outside the Palazzo Vecchio. His description of the making of this work is one of the highlights of the book.) He had numerous love affairs with titled women and numerous feuds with powerful men. He was also a murderer and an unconscious sadist. And he wrote it all in what is one of the great autobiographies of all time. Parts of the book are chilling, such as when he regrets having beaten his beautiful model, not out of guilt or remorse, but because the beating had left her so swollen and bruised that she was no good to him as a model now. Other parts are disgusting, such as when he describes a parasite he vomited. At other times one wonders if he really thought he could get away with such tall tales as swearing that while under the protection of a necromancer he saw the Colosseum full of dancing devils. Cellini was a complex man and a great artist and a great writer. His autobiography is essential reading if one wishes to understand the Renaissance. I consider Cellini's autobiography to be almost as essential as Homer and Shakespeare. Five stars, of course."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This is a great book, a great deal of fun and exciting to read. However, the Kindle edition is missing important parts of the book. I was reading book 2 Chapter IV of the Kindle edition and the story simply did not make any sense. So I checked a print edition by the same translator. Three paragraphs had been omitted from the beginning of this chapter. I began to wonder what else might be missing. I checked a earlier spot that had been a bit confusing and found that in Book 1, the beginning of chapter cxxviii had been left out and the poem that makes up the rest of that chapter had been added to the end of chapter cxxvii with eight stanzas missing, which made the poem unintelligible. So there was no chapter cxxviii. I carried on with the print edition from there on out, so I can't tell you what else was missing both before and after that point.The book contains many footnotes, In the print edition they are on the bottom of the page where they occur. In the Kindle edition they are at the end of the chapter and putting them there makes it difficult to connect the footnote with its reference. So you are obliged to go past several passages without understanding them fully and then when you finally come to the footnotes at the end of the chapter, you have to go through a good deal of effort to go back to see what the footnote refers to.DO NOT TRUST THIS EDITION.

He was not, by trade, a writer, and his rough prose and sprawling narrative testify to that.But what he lacks in writing skill, he more than makes up for in personality, so much so that his brilliant life and gusto for living bursts through the awkward form.Cellini, it is clear, loves life -- he leaves nothing out when telling it, and so he represents very well what it must have been like to be one of the great artists of the Italian Renaissance in the patronage of the papacy, the great Medici family, and Francis I (who supported Da Vinci in his last years).We meet Lorenzo de Medici, Cosimo, Francis I, Cosimo's wife who needs Cellini to help her get a pearl necklace, competitors, thieves, Popes, and beautiful women, whom Cellini kept for modeling and for \\"company.\\"And we get to hear Cellini discussing the design and creation of classic works that still exist today, like the salt cellar, the Nymph of Fountainbleau, and his masterpiece, the statue Perseus, which he describes as so astonishing to the people of the day that they composed sonnets about it and posted them up all over Florence.Cellini recounts his many affairs, duels, scrapes, imprisonments, and commissions, one adventure after another, so that his whole life sweeps by in a grand and vibrant portrait. He always seems to come out on top too, which makes you wonder if he's telling the whole truth, but nonetheless Cellini's autobiography is a thrilling read and filled with life in a time when all the world was stirring with art and passion."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Exquisitely written beautifully illustrated by Dali, a riveting account of gentry (but not gentle)life in 16th century Italy."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"If youre a fan of picaresque autobiography, this book is the best.

It continues the story of the World War I German submarine captured by a combined allied group that gets stranded in a mysterious pre-historic land. The story is typical, light fare, something you might have expected from a black and white pre-history movie. A bit melodramatic at times, nave at others. But so what! I've been reading and re-reading ERB for decades and while we aren't talking classics of literature, the stories are fun to read.Burroughs tackles the issues of evolution in this series, condensing the scope from millions of years to mere generations. Darwinism was still being debated at the time this was written, so it provides a glimpse of the shocking impact and disbelief in certain circles. A fun afternoon read, or something for a pre-teen with an appetite for adventure. (While you can read this book separately or out of sequence, I wouldn't recommend it, too many references to what has happened in the prior books.)P-)"},{"Title":"Night Out in London","review":"The book bills itself as \\"A guide for hedonists.\\" In truth, it's more like a subset of the phone book of bar, pubs and strip clubs. Very little value added information. You're much better off surfing the web."},{"Title":"The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660-1789","review":"I am fairly knowledgeable about the 18th century, but this book brought me some brilliant new insights and new viewpoints - especially on 18th century Prussia, on the popularity of George III and (oddly) of Joseph II. Superb illustration through the history of culture of how the 18th century monarchy in France, unlike that of Prussia and England, failed to connect with the \\"public sphere\\". I found the omission of the Dutch Republic regrettable and a few passages a little tedious; but for me the book ranks with Orlando Figes' Natasha's Dance (see my review) as one of the few books about periods with which I am pretty familiar that has given me so many new angles to think about."},{"Title":"The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660-1789","review":"Blanning drives heavy on ' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere' from Jurgen Habermas on this one. So in order to get a better understanding, you better read Habermas first, or along with this book. They both adress the same isssue, and deal about the way the public sphere came into being. They both show quite good how the French revolution could happen only in France. This last was always a riddle to me, and I think one of the subjects that most early modern historians are looking to explain or place. Habermas gave a very good move in the right direction but I think Blanning tops it. This is mainly because of the coverage of Blannings work, since its 515 pages think, while Habermas's work is only 310 pages. This pages are mainly filled with historical background, body and anecdotes, that truly to justice to the statement. So Blanning is making Habermas's case stronger.As a historian I lways thought Habermas's book was extrordinary good, but it lacked certain historical boody. Im happy that someone did provide this body. However....I must say that both are mainly dealing with Germany, England and France. It leaves me wondering how a public sphere eventually came to being in other European countries, such as the Netherlands, what is not entirely unimportant if you recall what Jonathan Israel wrote about it, as the startpoint of the enlightenment in 'Radical Enlightenment'. But all in all a really good book.If you can, read also Blannings ' Pursuit Of Glory'."},{"Title":"Traveling with Grandkids: A Complete and Fun-Filled Guide","review":"Traveling With Grandkids by Dean and Nancy Hoch If you have grandchildren and already travel with them or never even thought of doing so, this is a book you MUST have.

The book is a collection of radio broadcasts done by Mr. Westwood. I wish there were more broadcasts done today like this one. This format has some problems when being put into book form in that it is a bit repetitive. Westwood reminds the listener what had been spoken about last show, but for the person reading there is no time between one \\"broadcast\\" to the next. However, since this is the format, I can hardly turn this into a negative. I am about 3/4 of the way in and I am on the passages of Romans that deal with election. In this, he seems to be taking a Molinist point of view, but he doesn't push this envelope too strongly. This will obviously aggravate Calvinists, and to a lesser extent people who subscribe to Arminianism. He doesn't seem to have the exact formulation of Molina as he doesn't develop the actual system. He more relies on God's knowledge generally speaking. For me, this was a bit of a letdown (so far) but again I cannot fault him for this because it was based of a radio show, and who would tune in to a Molinist systematic theology?This is the brilliance of the book. He sets up the book of Romans like a courtroom where the Jews and Gentiles are being tried. This is a great way to approach Romans and helps open up the book for better understanding. He shows how both are guilty yet how both can be made innocent by Jesus' work. I would say this is a great introduction to the book of Romans, which many find to be a difficult book. It gives you a good device, the courtroom setting, to open your mind for the logical presentation that Romans is. One good way one might want to read the book is in a devotional manner. The book is set up perfectly for this. Just read on segment a day. I would highly recommend this book. (or audio)"},{"Title":"Spain in the Seventeenth Century (Seminar Studies in History)","review":"Superb, once again Graham Darby wrecks the review curb with a work that is both incisive and challenging. I have yet to find a more consistently excellent historical author, or one that is so willing to challenge established convention. It is refreshing to find a new slant on a time worn subject, and doubly so on a subject that is so often considered open and shut. I don't know if Graham Darby is considered the historian of a time, but for writing a book such as this he certainly deserves to be. This book, until he writes one about Palmerston or Castlereagh (possibly the greatest foreign secretaries Britain has ever had) will remain his 'magnum opus'.The fact that this book is willing to give as much attention to the domestic situation in Spain at this period as to the foriegn situation gives it an incredibly balanced feel, and makes it useful for both students of history, and those who instruct in that fine subject.If you need a book on this subject, then you need this book. It is all too often true that historians focus on the negative aspects of history, but Darby has shown that the history of Spain is both an invigorating, and an enjoyable read.

He mentions different types of fuel injection but not which type Hondas are typically equipped with. This is a common theme throughout the book.That being said, the background information on engine development and tuning is very useful. The information is broad and detailed and, for a tuner looking for general information and bolt on performance, the book may be useful. In the blurb about the book, a specific engine buildup is mentioned (the reason I bought the book). This engine buildup was described in two pages which did not even begin to cover the detail I was looking for. The author mentions in the beginning that the book is not just a series of ads for bolt ons but he does plug certain vendors pretty thoroughly."},{"Title":"High Performance Honda Builders Handbook (S-A Design)","review":"I think that Petttit did a good job if you are looking to rebuild your engine or do some internal engine mods. There is not enough room in one book, however, to cover everything. The book by Ancas (Honda Performance Handbook) seems to pick up where this one leaves off. The Ancas book is more entertaining to read and doesn't repeat what you would find in a Honda Worshop manual. But if you want to do a rebuild yourself, you should buy the Pettit book too as Ancas doesn't go into internal engine details. I myself sent my block out to a Honda shop to have it done and don't really care to know exactly how they did it - just that they did it. But if you are serious about a Honda project, you really need both. The one thing they both avoid is the advertising-driven hype that you read in the magazines. That info is misleading and deal with pie-in-the-sky projects, not what we really drive on the street."},{"Title":"High Performance Honda Builders Handbook (S-A Design)","review":"From the moment I opened this book I was unable to put it down. Having been a Honda lover for years, I've found this book to be extremely helpful. Especially in helping to make decissions on which parts I should/should not put in my engine. Joe Pettitt has done a great job explaining the inner workings of the late model Honda engines. In a country that's in love with the American V-8's, it's hard to find many books on the subject of import performance. That is one reason this book is so valuable to the Hondaphile. In the future I hope that more books are written on this subject. Regardless though, if a thousand books make it to the stands, I still think High Performance Honda Builder's Handbook will remain one of the best."},{"Title":"High Performance Honda Builders Handbook (S-A Design)","review":"I own a 1992 Integra GSR and have been working on Hondas for about 4 years now. Joe's book was way too high-tech for the average home mechanic who tinkers in his spare time. I don't have access to the high tech equipment Joe referred to, I've only had limited dyno time (at $75 an hour) and the stuff he covered is never going to be attempted by the average Honda enthusiast. Most of his statements were so vague and unconclusive (e.g. AEM intake: did he recommend it? Who knows?)

There's nothing really new or useful in this book as half the information in it can be found on the Internet for free. The supercharger section is straight out of the Jackson Racing website and the fuel injector section is straight out of RC Engineering's website. The book is full of spelling and grammatical errors (nobody's perfect, but it is a published piece of work). Don't get me wrong, this book does provide the reader with a lot of information, but most of it is not useful or practical. As I read through the technical parts, I kept on saying to myself......so what? who cares? who is this book designed for?I cannot wait to get my hands on the Honda &amp; Acura Performance Handbook (Performance Handbooks) by Mike Ancas. It sounds like it's the book to get (this time I did some research). It is supposed to have real world tips (The author shares his experiences, mistakes and all).... covers everything from mild to wild, what works and what doesn't, modifications in stages, etc. And, you can get free information updates from the author/publisher's website (www.handbook.com)."},{"Title":"High Performance Honda Builders Handbook (S-A Design)","review":"I would not recommend this book and here's why: 1. The book does not go into enough detail for a beginner to understand the parts being described or how they operate. 2. For an experienced mechanic, they will understand what is being described but will already know the information being given.To summarize; the book is to advanced for the beginner but is not advanced enough for the experienced mechanic.

I agree with some people who wrote a review on this that this is more of a informational book and not so much a &quot;how to do it yourself&quot; kind of book so if you're looking for a how to book this isn't for you. If only Joe Pettitt can come out with a coresponding how to book it would be nice.

Basically, the book gives you information on what to do, but not really how to do it yourself.

When I was a child, I could never get enough of them to read. As an adult now, I confess, I have still not got over the magic. I come from India where there are very few books available in the market for kids(as compared to the US)and Enid Blyton is undoubtedly the most popular children's books author there. Come to think of it, there is something truly magical about her stories. They are filled with all sorts of characters. She has written schools stores(St.Clares series, Malory towers series), adventure stories(famous five, mystery,secret seven etc), stories with elves, goblins,fairies etc. Practically every topic that could fascinate a kid(as well as an adult)is covered. The famous five series is an adventure series that relates the adventures of Julian, Dick, Anne and their cousin Georgiana(read George since she hates to be called by her actual name) and their dog Timmy. If you are an avid fan of mysteries and are not in the Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys groove yet, this is the best bet. One of the best features of this book is that it is thoroughly clean and ideal for kids. As a child I loved it and my parents never had a problem letting me read this stuff because it was clean! The adventures are exciting and will thrill any 8 or 9 year old. The five children always fall into one adventure or the other. They camp out, do exciting things, eat healthy food(something that kids today have a problem doing)and show good manners(another problem with most kids today). One of the reasons why these books were so popular with my parents was because of the way they depicted good manners, healthy habits and good values without the sermons on the same. The storyline is also well developed and the five children often end up catching smugglers, thieves and other bad elements with the usual share of treasure hunting. I remember spending many an afternoon with a famous five book and enjoying the pleasures of reading. Hope you get to do the same. A must read on all accounts."},{"Title":"Five get into a fix","review":"Much like The Famous Five in this book, I was at home ill when I first read this novel. I remember though that despite having a slight fever and feeling in the worst state, that I was simply unable to put this book down, which should be no surprise since it is a very good read.Perhaps it's that strong impression that this novel had on me. Or it's startling resemblance in style and content to three of the Blyton Adventure novels (love those) - \\"Castle of Adventure,\\" \\"Island of Adventure\\" and \\"Mountain of Adventure.\\" But this, the seventeenth in the series, is my all-time favorite of the series.After a couple of disappointing books, this adventure seems to breathe new life into the series. Indeed it reads much more similar to the Adventure series of novels. There's also a change in locale for the book opens not in the familiar Kirrin, but instead towards the end of the Christmas holidays in the home of Julian, Dick and Anne. Soon though the group are sent to stay with the gardener's aunt (a Mrs. Jones) who rents rooms in Magga Glen in the Welsh mountain's in the hopes that the fresh sir will do the children good.Persuading Mrs. Jones to let them stay in a mountainside chalet rather than at her farm, the Five begin to experience strange goings-on. There are underground rumblings and an eerie shimmering in the air. They also meet a young rascal of a girl in Aily (who bares a remarkable likeness to Tassie from \\"Castle of Adventure\\") and her dog Dai and lamb Fany.Of course, one staple element in the Famous Five novels is complete without the presence of some secret tunnels and this novel is no exception. Aily shows them the passageways into a mysterious house with a tower (more shades of \\"Castle of Adventure\\") and also gives them a note she found that reveals that the woman they saw earlier in a window of the tower is being held prisoner.That begins an entertaining series of adventures into the house and deep underground which will keep the reader engrossed. The novel itself, as with all the Famous Five adventures, is very \\"kid-safe\\" and easy to recommend.The Famous Five novels by Enid Blyton are a British institution in the United Kingdom and occupy a place in the bookshelves of nearly every self-respecting pre-teen. When I was growing up in the UK I devoured all the Blyton books I could get a hold of and then went onto her Secret Seven and (my all-time favorite) Adventure series.The format for the books is essentially the same - a band of children (on this case the Famous Five - Julian, Dick, Anne, George, and her dog Tim) get into a series of adventures thwarting criminals and solving mysteries. It's like Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, but imbued with that classic British idiom and that fast-paced, expertly crafted Blyton style that give it an edge over her American counterparts.The success of the formula is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that the majority of the Blyton books I read were handed down to me from my mother who had received them as a child herself in the 1940s and 1950s. It's an unusual feeling opening a book and seeing it inscribed to a parent when they were your age. There are 21 stories in the series and 40 years later in the 1980s the series was even continued by French author Claude Voilier (who wrote several continuation novels).The majority of the books are compulsive reading and even as an adult I sometimes have that nostalgic desire to return to a more innocent time and read a Blyton novel.These books are rather difficult to find in the United States though I was able to track down one online retailer that sells them as a complete set. However, if you want to sample the Famous Five series before putting down your hard earned cash for the entire series, this novel, is well worth the expense.Your children will thank you for itIncidentally there is a DVD production available in Region 2 of the first Famous Five adventure adventure (\\"Five on a Treasure Island.\\" In the 1970s a British television series was also produced of the Famous Five adventures, and a second one in the 1990s and a 1981 movie adaptation of the first of the Adventure series (Island of Adventure).Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"After first hand working with Ray, I received this book as a parting gift. I was fantastically impressed. The book delves into great detail on optimizing organizations and overcoming certain obstacles, such as culture clashes. It is absolutely amazing how well it puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together; it highlights those fundamental, pivotal points throughout the book, after having given the reader a chance to look at the problems through the eyes of a manager. Also praiseworthy is the way that the book puts all these points together; many of these points are seen in some fashion dispersed throughout an MBA, experience, and other books, but Ray puts them together in one unified place and gives them order. This book should be standard, core reading for managers. It takes so many lessons and puts them all together in one compact, meaningful book. I would also emphasize this reccommendation to those involved in M&A restructurings and those coming into a company in need of new practices.

If management is about two things then organizational structure and communication are perhaps the two most basic. Great Boss, Dead Boss has made me rethink both of those. I'm deliberately not telling you what the book is about because that would spoil it for you. What I can say is that it takes the form of a novel similar to Eli Goldratt's The Goal. However, despite the fact that Ray Immelman is part of the TOC community and works for Realization Software. This is not a TOC book. It's a book about people, about relationships, about affiliation, motivation, loyalty and leadership. It's a book which is very applicable to the agile software community.

His insights into our tribal behaviour and how the dynamic of individual and collective security and value can not only be understood, but practically applied to the betterment of all, raises the bar for all interested in the field of group dynamics. His decision to use the form of a novel as the vehichle for the explanation of his insights makes them accessible and easily understood, whilst not diluting the power of the ideas themselves. I have always wondered how you can get a group of people with different and varied affiliations to not only work for the common good, but actually want to excel at doing so. In Great Boss Dead Boss, Ray shows the reader some high leverage answers to the question. The book, written in a captivating prose style, follows the protagonist Greg's journey of discovery, mentored by the crusty, wise Butch. In the storyline are countless nuggets of wisdom and insight which would serve well anyone who aspires to a position of leadership."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"This book has excellent materials, and some very good common sense ideas which seem to be not so common.I would say however that the story line did not seem very realistic given the time line. When a company has significant cultural issues, it seems that a realistic turn-around could easily take two to three years, not weeks. Certainly after several weeks, a certain percentage of employees might start to recognize a change; however it is my experience that the vast majority will take a wait and see attitude.Another aspect of the book which seemed a bit misleading was how smoothly the physical transformation of the facility seemed to go. The success of the organization was based on everything going smoothly with the physical transformation, yet the problems were minimal; this is not typical of this kind of transformation.Finally, the author seemed to downplay other business tools like Six Sigma, Lean Enterprise, TQM and more, suggesting that they all lowered employee morale. I would disagree and say instead that all of these programs, including the ideas presented in this book are nothing more than tools. A good Change Agent should learn as many tools as possible and use the appropriate tool for the problem at hand. If none of the tools in his or her box fit the problem, he or she should seek out another tool. When various initiatives fail, it is often the result of someone trying to force his tools to fit the situation, rather than determining which tool will work best for the organization.In spite of my comments, I still recommend this book. Read it and learn the tools, then combine what you have learned from this book together with the other tools in you box."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"Just finished reading this book and I am overwhelmed by both the simplicity and the depth of the story and the message. There are just too many situations in real life that reflect the events in this book. The \\"tribe\\" is still alive and well and here to stay. Whoever is able to apply the concepts in this book skilfully will surely reap benefits as a great boss. Hope to become one of those people soon."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"For the last few years I've been building my company to have a specific type of self-reinforcing corporate culture. There is still authority, there is still people with assigned roles, but I wanted my group to feel truly energized about working on our products and projects.I have noticed over the years that management books recommend a lot of activities but the subtext was always this: communication is the heart of a good environment.My psychological training (sorry tom cruise) has also given me great insights into what motivates and what demotivates people. But those mechanistic models of action and reaction were always searching for a unifying construct.Ray's construct is tribal behavior and balancing our need to feel good about ourselves and the groups to which we belong.In essence, people tend to gravitate toward groups that reinforce their self-worth. Traditional business structures tend to rigidly group people and, by doing so, people identify with smaller groups of their own design rather than their larger corporate or office group. The results are seldom good.When I was working for a large consulting company, I was initially part of and later the lead of their Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Group. We had millions of dollars in contracts every year and, despite the work we put into educating the planners and engineers of what we did - they would routinely sub out ITS work.At first we thought they were not getting what it was we were doing. But in reality what was happening was that they got much more value from subbing out our work. This value came from raising their stature in planning / engineering by being the \\"Prime\\" and maintaining their relationships with other companies thereby ensuring future work for their group.Their tribal needs (engineering or planning tribes) were better served outsourcing the work, when our tribal needs (ITS tribe) would have been better served by keeping the work in house?Who was right? Well, we both were. But in the end, the lack of communication between our groups created an adversarial atmosphere which impacted relationships and quality of work throughout the firm.I find some holes in Ray's model - for example I find it a bit weak on the outside issue front. There are people out there who have issues outside the office that directly impact their response to things inside the office. Ray does cover this, but compared to his attention to detail on the rest of his model - this part seems a little weak.Having said that, his model is sound and a great construct to help diffuse otherwise tense situations. You can be told that angry people have an unfulfilled need and that the proper response is to find out what that need is and discuss it all day ... but when someone is yelling in your face that's pretty hard to zero in on.With Ray's model, there is a short cut to analyze the type of threat (as opposed to the specific threat) the person or group feels and then deal with that.We're in the process of creating an employee manual and it's been bothering me for quite a while. It's rigid, dictatorial, and top-down. Great Boss Dead Boss has given me an inkling of how I'd like to re-create the concept of an employee manual. ... but it's just an inkling.Lastly I'll note one other element of this model: when you think of your organization as an entity - as a tribe or whatever - it's important to give that entity substance. Substance that comes from a strong definition (not a mission statement) and a good sense of self.Oddly, I had been working on that for the last few months. Gathering up the lore of Gray Hill Solutions, identifying why our processes work, and incorporating those two things into a single narrative to better explain why we do the things we do.Suffice it to say, I'd highly recommend you read Ray's book.Oh, and it's a narrative. But don't let that stop you."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"While I've finished reading this book for the first time, I'm just now going back and digesting some of the tastier nuggets Ray has offered up. This isn't a book I'll read once, but one I'll dig into as my own perspective grows. As a fellow ToC person, I was expecting a novel in that vein, and, to be honest, there were several respectful nods to Eli's _The Goal_ but the similarities stopped there.I've enjoyed looking at several organizations (business, congregations, etc.) through the lenses he proposes and am impressed by the clarity I've gained. To paraphrase George Box, one of the most influencial experimental scientists of our time, \\"All models are wrong, but some models are useful none the less.\\" Certainly there will be people who find fault in Ray's model, but I would be certain that many, many more will recognize the usefulness of the ideas he set forth and that this book will attract the readership it so richly deserves.Bravo & Thanks!"},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"There are few books that change the way you view the world. Great Boss Dead Boss is one of those books. I have seen many situations where the strategic and tactical plans in an organization appear optimal on the surface, but the team still fails to achieve its full potential. Ray Immelman has managed to pull to the surface and describe the undercurrent of tribal behavior running through every organization that, if ignored, is the primary reason for the failure to achieve the organization's goals and objectives. After reading this book, I can look back and see how management inadvertently directed the competitive focus of various teams internally against each other, rather than focusing the teams externally at the true competitors. In the future, I am confident that I can use the attributes and dimensions Ray describes as a competitive advantage to unify and focus my organization in the future."},{"Title":"Great Boss Dead Boss","review":"Written as a business novel, this must is a must read for every business owner.

Although it did not tell me a lot of new information, it helped tie together things that I already knew about Suge Knight and interjected new details along the way.There are times in the book that Sullivan gets bogged down in the minutiae and loses the reader. There are also moments where Sullivan is clearly sympathetic and biased towards the ex-cop (Russell Poole). This book is loaded with details but it is one man's view of the events.The book also jumps around from different characters, events &amp; dates. So there is not a natural flow from chapter to chapter.All in all, I enjoyed reading LAbyrinth. I recommend the book to all. But please remember that this is one man's interpretation of the facts.

The amount of information on Tupac is probably one page at most and Biggie maybe four or five. I felt that Det. Poole and R. Sullivan were more about getting back at the LAPD (not that his information is not valid) than discussing the details about Tupac and Biggie's murders. This books title should be LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the L.A.P.D. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for answers or information about Tupac, cause you won't find it.

The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. First, the idea that Suge and Kenner had both Tupac and Biggie killed is nothing new. Second, Death Row Records being associated with drugs,drug money, gangs, corruption...nothing new here. The only thing that is even remotely new is the addition of Officers Mack, Perez, Lyga and Gaines to the scandal. I find it hard to believe that a few rogue officers orchestrated both murders and then scared their co-workers and superiors into assisting them with a colossal cover-up. The book reads more like a HORRIBLE soap opera than a fact based investigation. And as for poor displaced, discouraged detective Poole, he needs to get over it. There are politics and scandals to deal with on EVERY police force. I also did not like the way the author dragged O.J. Simpson and Johnnie Cochran into the whole thing by implying that they are some sort of \\"race card\\" kings. Whenever you do inferior police work and can't solve a crime on your own merits...blame someone else for playing the race card. If you ask me, Poole is playing the race card better than any minority could. Bottom line...the book holds no earth-shattering dicoveries. But if you want to witness both Poole and Sullivan blaming everyone from Willie Williams to Bernard Parks to Johnnie Cochran for the unsolved crimes, then you may actually want to read it. This book is for anyone who is not familiar with the all too common politics and scandals surrounding both record companies and large police departments. Save your time and money...read something else."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"As a fan of both Tupac and Biggie, I was very interested in learning more about what really went down. Former Officer Poole seems to think he has the answers so I was eager to learn what he knows draw my own conclusions. I was very disappointed.First of all, to my absolute surprise, nobody else seems to have picked up on the author's extreme bias. For example, on page 14 of the hardcover version, Sullivan notes that \\"[In the early 1960s], as now, black males committed a hugely disproportionate amount of crime in Los Angeles and across the country.\\" WHAT? I can't even believe that went to print. Question: do black males commit a disproportionate amount of crime in this country or are they accused and convicted disproportionately? At the very least, if you're gonna make such outrageous comments, back it up. With no statistical data, I consider Sullivan's comment to be hearsay. Then, just a few pages later, on page 18, Sullivan gets a little diatribe going about how the LAPD hiring process has become less stringent over time, noting that \\"liberals had successfully argued that [baring applicants with juvenile records] limited the number of blacks and Hispanics who could join the LAPD.\\" I'm not even 20 pages into the book, and my reading of the author is that he really doesn't like minorities or \\"liberals,\\" whatever the latter term means to him because he sure doesn't define anything. Yet I decided to take these and similar comments with a grain of salt and press forward with the book.If one-tenth of what's written in these pages is true, Biggie and Tupac were just as despicible as Suge Knight, the LAPD, the affiliated gangs, the attorneys and just about everyone else who graced the pages of the book. And that made me really sad because it's hard for me to listen to the music the same way. Tupac and Biggie were not innocent; they were just greedy [...] who courted violence successfully. Truthfully, none of the stuff about the LAPD or any of the other authority figures surprised me. Money and testosterone--bad combination. Lest you think I'm a man-hater, the women in this book are appalling, too. I hate to say it but Tupac and Biggie got what they deserved.I do think that Sullivan's style is extremely readable and engaging. I also like the way he attempted to provide background on the LAPD history, the history of the Crips and the Bloods, etc. If you're not likely to be critical going into this book, it's not bad for escapism. Unless you were living in a plastic bubble or don't keep up w/ current events, I doubt that you'll be blown away by the overall picture Sullivan paints."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.

If you are looking for a detailed autobiography of Biggy and/or Tupac this is not the book but it does discuss the theories involving their respective murders along with all sorts of corruption in the LAPD and a connection between several officers in the LAPD and Deathrow records. It is a little disheartening that corruption on multiple levels such as what is documented in this book can occur in today's society (especially people paid from our tax dollars).

There's no rambling, it's very well researched, and the way the stories and facts are expressed are not dry at all. The writer, Randall Sullivan, writes for Rolling Stone magazine, so it's presented in that style. Even if you aren't interested in the Tupac/Biggie story, this book still goes deep into the origins of the Bloods and Crips, East coast and West coast rap feuds, and especially, just how corrupt the LAPD was(and probably still is). I've read other books on these subjects, including the recently released book by \\"hip-hop cop\\" Derrick Parker, but this book is by far the best.

The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"I'm not sure why I grabbed this book -- at best I'm a very casual rap fan, being more of an \\"old school\\" type (very old school). Perhaps it was my interest in the history of police corruption in Los Angeles, which goes back to the days of Raymond Chandler and beyond.In any case, this is an excellent read. Sullivan takes a very complex tale with many players and makes it easy to follow. The writing is clear, crisp and clean. His logical analysis of the controversies in the investigation seem very sound. This is not a book that will titillate people with a voyeuristic look at the rap lifestyle. He keeps the focus very tightly on the murder investigations and the connections between rogue LAPD officers and Death Row records.I guess I have only two quibbles. First, the book needs an index. We get a timeline (very helpful), a cast of characters, even recommended further readings. But an index would be nice. Second, and this is not Sullivan's fault in anyway, this is a very grim tale. Evil goes unpunished, the truth is suppressed by authorities and good guys are in short supply.People who lived through the L.A. police corruption scandals of earlier eras would find much to recognize in this tale."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"I was drawn to this book by a radio interview I heard a year ago or so, I believe with the author (I missed the beginning of the interview) in which he detailed some of the allegations of shoddy policework that attended the LAPD's investigation of the murder of Christopher Wallace, who went by the rap alias Notorious B.I.G. One eye-opener was an eyewitness to the shooting who was willing to cooperate but was never contacted by authorities, and was shot to death in a housing project back east two months later. So I bought the book, and basically more of my opinions on the LAPD scandals of the last several years were confirmed.The book starts with Russell Poole, a decorated detective with basically impeccable credentials, investigating a shooting in the San Fernando Valley. The shooter and the victim both turned out to be police officers: the shooter, Frank Lyga, was a white undercover narcotics detective, the man killed, Kevin Gaines, a black patrolman. When the detectives went to the house the black policeman was living in, they were a bit taken aback to discover it was a mansion in Beverly Hills. The man's girlfriend was Suge Knight's estranged wife. Knight, the owner of Death Row Records, had an unsavory reputation for intimidation, extortion, drug dealing, and murder anyway, so the police were somewhat taken aback.Soon, Poole agrees to become the lead detective in the investigation of the shooting of Wallace mentioned above, and discovers that there may be LAPD officers involved in the killing, or at least working for Suge Knight. Soon, that part of the investigation is derailed, and Poole is ordered by superiors to look in other directions that he's sure will be fruitless, and of course they turn out to be. Meanwhile connections to other incidents, including the killing of Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas, surface, but nothing's pursued.The minutae of the story does at times bog it down. This does one bad thing in terms of the book: it serves to obscure the author's basic message, which is that the political leadership in Los Angeles and its minority-run suburbs (notably Compton) are unwilling to investigate people like Suge Knight too closely, and the Los Angeles media is willing to cover for them because to do otherwise would damage various minority (read black) politicians and city leaders. Prominent in this category is Bernard Parks, the controversial now ex-chief of police. Sullivan has him basically uninterested in corruption among black police officers when he was in charge of the Internal Affairs division, and later when he was chief. The mayor, and Maxine Waters, our most prominent local black politician (she's a congresswoman from Compton and South-Central LA) are also implicated, if not in corruption, then in condoning it.The last part of the book, however, was a surprise for me. When Poole was investigating the connections between Death Row Records and various black police officers who were illegally working for the company providing security, one of the officers involved was a gang task force detective named Rafael Perez. For those not up to date on LA current affairs, Perez was caught with several kilos of cocaine, and turned state's evidence in return for a reduced sentence. The subsequent investigation led to what's been known as the Rampart police scandal, after the Rampart division where it occurred. His testimony got many (hundreds) of people released from prison, and has resulted in the city paying millions (some estimate it's going to run into the hundreds of millions or even more) in damages to the alleged victims. Perez himself is something of a chamelion (black to blacks, latino to latinos, colorless to whites) and apparently has been fabricating at least some of his allegations, but meanwhile he's worked himself a deal such that he's already negotiating a release from prison. Poole's investigation seemed to show that Perez's allegations should be carefully viewed, but the higher-ups in the LAPD wouldn't listen, and the whole thing has blown up in their faces. Even worse, they shut down the gang task force that Perez was part of, and predictably gang homicides increased almost immediately.This is a tangled, convoluted, difficult book. People get killed left and right, and most of those killed aren't exactly angels themselves. Notorious B.I.G., for instance, was a drug dealer before he became a rapper, and Tupac shouldn't need any introduction. The implication that the police are or were running interference for the people who killed them, however, is pretty horrifying, and the author presents some evidence that one cop should be at least looked at in connection with Notorious B.I.G.'s murder itself, though an associate of his is the likely shooter. While this is troubling, it's the racial politics that's the most aggravating to me. One person is quoted as saying that the L.A. Times, for instance, wouldn't investigate the story further because they didn't want to be involved in bringing down an African-American police chief (Bernard Parks). This sort of thing has to stop. While Suge Knight is black, yes, so were most if not all of this victims. Failing to demand justice on that rationale is insane, and if the allegations in the book have merit, they should be investigated thoroughly."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"A book like LAbryinth is so compelling, and so right on that it is amazing that LA society in general does not get up in arms when they read of the lax police policy that allows thugs and gangsters to foist rap music as an artform, and brutality as a modus operandi on the public. OK OK all people are entitled to produce their personal music, but the crude lyrics are far exceeded in debauchery by the tacit police compliance by LA's famous Chief Bernard Parks and a band of his hand picked corrupted officers. THAT A FIRST CLASS DETECTIVE LIKE RUSSELL POOLE RESIGNS BECAUSE HE IS UNABLE TO DO HIS JOB is not only frightening but should be totally unacceptable to anyone who reads or hears about the book. Chief Parks' contract has not been renewed, but why is this LAbyrinth information still not blasting from the front page of the LA Times? Informed readers shake their heads, and the rappers shake their booty. What needs to shake is the very foundation of the LA police department."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.

The book was thoroughly researched, well written, and is the most definitive work written on the Biggie Smalls/Tupac murders. Although there are plenty of dates and facts throughout, the book's narrative is easy to follow, and it doesn't really read like a text. If you're interested in true crime and/or the rap industry's seething underbelly, then this should be a top choice. Also included is a startling portrait of the LAPD as one of the most corrupt police organizations in U.S. history.

And if the reader from Trenton did know so much about Suge Knight, then he would not have found it highly unlikely that these rougue cops who were associates of Suge Knight could instill the kind of fear into their co-workers as they did. The book exposes the dirty side of both politics and law enforcement and although it does happen in every city it doesn't mean it's right. And apparently the Chief of police was not doing his job since he was not re-elected. I admire this detectives time, dedication, and courage to expose Suge Knight. I also admire his dedication to trying to solve the horrific murders of these great entertainers and it is just unfortunate that politics is overriding these two unjust murders and who knows how many others.

It is more about the currupt issues surrounding the LAPD in the 90's but does go into the Tupac/Biggie murders very well great book for anyone."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"Sullivan does an excellent job of taking a web so tangled it could have been a James Ellroy plot, and presenting it in a clear, logical order. The rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper as the pages turn, until we start to wonder if we can ever possibly know just how far it reached. Every answered question leads to ten new questions, and the more we learn, the more complicated it gets.I first learned of the connection between Notorious B.I.G.'s death, Tupac Shakur's death, Suge Knight, and the LAPD's CRASH Unit Rampart Scandal from Sullivan's \\"Rolling Stone\\" article. This book expands on that research and tells the story in vivid detail. There were moments when I felt like I was there."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"The gist of whats going on in this book is that the author concludes, mainly through interviews with a detective that was on the Biggie Smalls murder case that the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls were hits ordered by Suge Knight and were carried out by police officers who were affiliated with the Bloods street gang and worked as security for Knights Death Row record label.I don't know if he gets it right or not but he does make a pretty good argument that this is the case. When a white detective who thought he had enough to make arrests in the Smalls murder but wasn't allowed to by LAPD higher ups spilled the beans on what was going on the media didn't pursue the story because \\"you can't tell a story where the good guy is a white detective and the villians are all black\\"! The police didn't want to delve to deeply into the case because the evidence that was there pointed to the most likely scenario being that the triggerman in both murders were probably Bloods street gang affiliated police officers who were carrying out the hits for Suge Knight and they did not want to deal with the public relations disaster. The weakest link in all this is when Shakur was gunned down Knight was sitting right next to him in the car. Old fashioned common sense tells me if Knight was planning on having someone killed it wouldn't be in a situation where he would be sitting right next to the person. But overall Sullivan makes a good case for his argument. I found this very entertaining for about the first 2/3s of the book and then it gets a little bogged down and boring the last third."},{"Title":"LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. The Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal","review":"I've read just about every book and seen every documentary regarding the murder of Tupac Shakur, and if you have any interest in the case at all, this book is a must-read. It is filled with information from a former LAPD officer who worked the case - many of which fuels the theory that Suge Knight had a hand in both artists' deaths. Some information, however, instead backs the idea that Shakur was killed by a Crips gang member. Whichever story you choose to believe (or if you believe something different altogether), this book has a lot of information you can't find anywhere else."},{"Title":"At the Name of Jesus","review":"Sarah Hornsby is a spirit filled Christian author. I have prayed through and own every book she has written. However my favorite is &quot;At the Name of Jesus&quot;. Since it was published in 1983, I have given this book to over twenty friends. Starting with a title of Jesus from Scripture, Ms. Hornsby's 365 meditations explore the attributes of Jesus from Jesus is the Alpha to Jehovah Jesus is the Savior-Messiah. This book has lead me to an ever deeper and more personal relationship with Jesus. Chosen Books should bring out a new edition. This book is too precious to remain unavailable."},{"Title":"At the Name of Jesus","review":"At the Name of Jesus is a wonderful devotional book. Each day's reading is short &amp; to the point but deep enough to ponder all day. I have given this book as a gift to many people.

This book is a true blessing."},{"Title":"At the Name of Jesus","review":"I have had a copy of this book for years and I love it so much! It is a short daily devotion that tells you about a name of Jesus and has a Bible verse that goes along with the name for that day. It's short but means a lot. I bought some more copies to give to some of my closest friends - that's how good it is and how much I love this book."},{"Title":"At the Name of Jesus","review":"Since 1998 I've been blessed by this dear little devotional on the names of Jesus.

After receiving just ONE book and then charged for it I complained and eventually wound up returning the book and receiving a refund. I suggest very strongly that Amazon.com check out these \\"book sellers\\" and their history before offering them as a source to order a book. Yes, I will order from Amazon.com again but I will do everything in my power to avoid this particular bookseller."},{"Title":"At the Name of Jesus","review":"At the Name of JesusNice quick but informative devotional. Gives scripture and a small bite to think on thru the day."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"This is simply a Great book by a Great author about a Great subject. This book is written for Christians that either want to be inspired or be reminded of the Christian Cross to stir up the passions within one's soul.A concern was that the writing may be stilted, dated or out of style and therefore a drudgery to read but that was the furtherest from the truth. This book will certainly cause you to view the Cross with a passion that you may never have experienced and I write as a minister with over 30 years experience.There are 7 sections each with 4 or 5 chapters that stand alone and therefore could be read as a devotional that is dedicated to the Radical Cross.Chapter titles such as: The Cross is a Radical Thing; No One Wants to Die on a Cross; Coddled or Crucified; Dead in Christ and What Easter is About.I challenge ANY believer to read this book that would like to have a new fire in their faith because it will be impossible not to be affected with this author's writing and understanding.This is not a theological book, though there is theology, this is an inspirational book.Read it and be inspired!!!"},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"Be forewarned: After reading this book, you will be held accountable for its contents!This book is NOT for those who are satisfied with their walk with God. I know this sounds \\"harsh,\\" and \\"negative,\\" but one can only say what is on one's heart.Aiden W. Tozer did not play with God, and his writings enjoin us not to either. To him, the Christian walk was serious business and in no where else was this seriousness made more manifest than on Mount Calvary. There on that Mount, the greatest sacrifice that would ever be made, was made when the Just and Holy One gave His Life a ransom for many, that He might purify a people, zealous of good works, unto Himself.This book needed no introduction, yet it has two which I feel are a distraction from what Rev. Tozer was trying to show us. This work did not need anyone to speek for it; the Holy Spirit Himself would bear witness. Nevertheless, this prophet of old's voice rang out against the \\"cross-less\\" Christianity he saw in his day, and which has gained in popularity in our day. Throught his simple words you can sense the Holy Spirit pleading with the professing Christian not to be satisfied with dead works, ceremony, sacramentalism, and form, but rather to lay one's life down, take up your/my cross, and follow Him daily; that we would partake of the greatness of the spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus by dying to self.This book, along with The Pursuit of God, make great resources for one's own devotional life. I promise you as a sinner saved/kept by grace, that your walk with the LORD of ALL will not be the same if you take Tozer's words in these two books seriously."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"Who knew that this collection of essays would become one of my favorite Tozer works? I enjoyed it so much, I have also bought it as a gift for others. Always speaking with clarity, conviction, and timeless relevance, Tozer really provides a priceless devotional work for the hungry Christian with these essays. Though better known for books such as \\"The Knowledge of the Holy\\" and \\"The Root of the Righteous,\\" this book, along with \\"Of God and Man\\" are my personal favorites of Tozer's works. If you have not been introduced to his work, and are ready to challenge yourself with the authentic teachings, commands, and examples given by our Lord, then this is an excellent place to start your Tozer discovery."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"\\"The Radical Cross\\" is yet another great title by AW Tozer and focuses on the supreme cost that Jesus Christ gave so we may have eternal life with Him in heaven. In Jesus Christ, we also can have the abundant life here on earth (though, not necessarily in physical riches).Among some of the topics covered include:1. Be careful of the church that tries to make you too comfortable.2. There are times that Christ's followers must walk alone.3. Jesus Christ came to die for all people.4. Suffering for Christ's sake has a great purpose.5. The Christian life is one of paradoxes that conflict with the world: to live we must die, to be victorious we must surrender to Christ, to be the greatest in God's kingdom we must serve others.These are just a few of the topics covered so eloquently by Tozer. Although he died almost 50 years ago, his works still speak clearly to us today.Read, enjoy, and be challenged.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"I'm a huge fan of A.W. Tozer's writings. This was actually the first of Tozer's books that I've read...though it has become my favorite. I recommend this book to everyone. Though not written or intended to be a devotional, I read it as such. While each chapter may only be a few pages, those pages are full of revelation and meditation on the Cross of Jesus Christ. It has altered the way I view the cross. And has change my response to it, as well. Excellent, Excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"Great book.His teachings are presented in a way that are easily understood.

(HEART) Helps you make the decision from being a Sunday Christian to being a full time Christian. Full of biblcal truths and hard facts."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"Dr. Tozer hits right at the heart of things with this compelling book. It will encourage, motivate, convict & change you. His description of the incredible Christian can only be fully understood by one who believes, is nothing on their own and has been made alive fully by the powerful blood of Jesus Christ. The A.B. Simpson add-on in this book is also worth well more than the price of the book. Buy, read, enjoy, live differently."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"EVERYONE ought read this book. It is a series of short chapters relating to the experience of the cross -- and is is SURE to impact your life!"},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"It's all about Jesus. How he took up the cross and what the means for us as Christians. Easily one of my favorite books. I highlighted a ton of good quotes using my Kindle and made it into a Word document to send to my friends to try and get them to read it too!"},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"AW Tozer's book the Radical Cross is such an important teaching tool that if I had eight or ten copies of it I would turn it into a small group Bible study. I highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn from one of the oldtimers of the faith. I believe that Mr. Tozer died in the 60's. Don't quote me on that though. His teaching is more recent and up to date than a lot of the preaching you'll hear on the radio or television."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"AW Tozer was a godly man. I have never read one of his books without being convicted and that is a good thing. I fear that we have very few uncompromised preachers like him today which is sad."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"I have read a couple of books from Tozer. I love how he talks about God. His view of God is so big and majestic and awesome.This book was given to me as a gift cause I put it on my amazon wishlist, but I wish I had done a tad more research on the book prior to adding it to a list. I'm not a big fan of books put together after the author passes away. I feel like when the editor combines the chapters he is in part adding to the messages written by the original author.This book is full of short messages by Tozer. I really didn't get into the book cause the book was full of short, choppy chapters. I have nothing really bad to say about Tozer's message. I sincerely believe His God is much bigger and that mine needs to be bigger like His.The only crticism I have is Tozer's sense of notsalgia. He implies the faith of yesterday was stronger than today and theat modern Christians are weak and lazy. There may be some truth to that but I think it is a little too simple to say yesterday is better than today. It doesn't get us any where.Those are my two cents, nothing great but I hope you understand what I mean."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"An absolute great read. Tozer takes the revelation of the Cross to new heights & standards. He takes the Cross out of the arena of being \\"cute\\" & \\"sweet\\" & puts it back in it's intended position in Christianity. This is a definite MUST for your library."},{"Title":"The Radical Cross: Living the Passion of Christ","review":"This is one a book that will \\"radically\\" change your life. It will also tremendously improve your \\"walk\\" with Christ. Truly a must for every Born again Christian."},{"Title":"The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy","review":"I admit it's a guilty pleasure, finding it in the Young Adult section of the library. I'm sure they'd be interested in some of the language, in the back room at the Central Branch, but never mind -- excellent read. TP seems to falter slightly with the first novel (ONLY YOU CAN SAVE THE WORLD) but persevere! He hits his stride with JOHNNY AND THE DEAD, and is a bit too complex for his own good but resolutely enjoyable with JOHNNY AND THE BOMB. Highly recommended. Six stars, only they won't let you do that."},{"Title":"The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy","review":"I've never understood why the books in the Johnny Maxwell series are so hard to find. Not only are they written by one of the world's most engaging, brilliant authors, they are a rare example of truly intelligent books aimed at a young adult audience; they are loads of fun for adults, as well. It seems a little strange to journey with Terry Pratchett to a place other than the Discworld, but this little jaunt is quite enjoyable - and future echoes of Discworld begin to emerge as the series progresses. Johnny Maxwell is just a normal twelve-year old kid, or at least he tries to be. When we first meet him, he is living in Trying Times, sort of left to take care of himself while his parents argue. Trying Times moves to Being Sensible About Things, and by the second book we find Johnny living with his grandfather. He's still a normal kid - it's just that things seem to happen to him that don't happen to anyone else - aliens inside a computer game surrender to him and name him their Chosen One, dead people start talking to him, and he even manages to stumble into time travel.Like any kid, Johnny enjoys a good computer game every now and then, and his friend Wobbler supplies him with just about any pirated game he could want. He has destroyed all but the last alien ship in the game Only You Can Save Mankind when a message suddenly appears on the screen: We wish to talk. Thus begins a journey that takes him inside the game as the Chosen One, the human who will lead the alien ScreeWee race back to safety beyond The Boundary. The reptilian captain of the ScreeWee is tired of fighting; the human fighters appear out of nowhere, kill and destroy ships in her fleet, and keep coming back no matter how many times they are killed. She has seen what happened to the Space Invaders and would rather surrender than die fighting.As always with Pratchett, the characters are well-developed and quite remarkable. I really liked Wobbler, the future hacker who designed his own game called Journey to Alpha Centauri to be played in real time, meaning all the thousands of years it would take to reach Alpha Centauri is how many years the game would take you to actually finish it. Beyond the comedy present in this story, there is also a message. The backdrop of the earth-based events of the book is the Persian Gulf War, and the juxtaposition of this war that is real but seems like a game with the computer game that becomes real for Johnny Maxwell conveys a message about violence and one's attitude toward it. It is not an overbearing theme, but it is there to some degree, helping make this short novel much more than just a juvenile read intended to entertain the reader and nothing more.Johnny often takes a short cut to school through a local cemetery, and it is there that he meets the Alderman, the long dead and buried Alderman. He and the rest of the good folks residing in the cemetery are quite put out by the fact that the cemetery has been sold by the city to a corporation planning on putting office buildings there. Since Johnny is the only human who can see them (and why Johnny can see them is rather a mystery, although the Alderman thinks it is because he is too lazy not to see them), the dead look to him to save their eternal resting place. Stopping a big corporation from doing something the city has granted it the legal right to do is no easy task, especially for a twelve-year-old boy and his friends, but Johnny is wonderfully resourceful.Johnny and the Dead rings quite distinctly at times of the type of humor showcased by the author in his Discworld novels. The dead people add a lot of life to this book, oddly enough. Their vibrant personalities more often than not clash in a number of very funny ways as they all try to cope with modern life - or the lack of it.In my opinion, Johnny and the Bomb is the best book in the series. It bears a strong resemblance to Pratchett's Discworld ideas and characterizations, containing much more social commentary, satire, and sidesplitting comedy than the first two books. This time around, Johnny becomes a time traveler - quite unexpectedly. The whole gang (Johnny, Wobbler, Bigmac, Yo-less, and Kirsty) goes back in time to 1941, the very day preceding an accidental bombing of the town. They try to be careful not to mess the future up, but Bigmac and Wobbler seem to have a natural attraction to trouble. Finding their way back home to the future is a difficult task; arriving back home without Wobbler and having to figure out a way to go back and retrieve him is even harder, especially since it involves convincing the 1941 authorities that the town is going to be bombed at a specific time.The characters of Johnny's remarkable friends are fleshed out in this novel to a much greater extent than they were in the previous two novels. Time displacement forces the kids to deal with issues of racism and sexism, for example. Serious issues aside, though, the book is just hilarious; the proffered hypotheses about the different legs of the Trousers of Time is vintage Pratchett material. This adventure really is the type of thing you might expect to happen on the Discworld, and I daresay any Pratchett fan of any age should enjoy this book (and the whole series) immensely. I find myself wishing for more Johnny Maxwell stories; I feel as if I know these characters now, and they are a fascinating, increasingly funny bunch of guys to hang around with."},{"Title":"The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy","review":"Don't limit yourself to the Discworld series. Terry Pratchett shines just as brightly in his other literary works. The Johnny Maxwell trilogy is one of these. So if you've ever harbored any ideas that you were special and different as a kid, you'll find great joy in Johnny's experiences."},{"Title":"The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy","review":"Bought as gift. Had to purchase on the used market as it's out-of-print. Had read the first book as library copy. Great imaginative story for a pre-teen."},{"Title":"The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy","review":"Terry pratchett writes a great bunch of series for young adults and for adults. This one is written for young adults but adults will love it too."},{"Title":"Family Ties Don't Have to Bind","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has felt that their parents have never let them grow up and be adults. It is a quick and easy read and includes easy to understand examples of dysfunctional parents who try to continue to impose themselves on their adult children. It gives you the tools to identify the classic &quot;symptoms&quot; of worrisome parents that overburden and how to remove yourself from the situation. The book gives you permission to allow yourself, as a healthy adult, to get on with your life and not let your parents burden you with their self-centeredness and neediness. It makes it very clear that raising your parents is not your responsibility. I have recommended it to several friends who have dealt with &quot;crazy&quot; parents. It helps you to understand that not all parents are wonderful and it gives you permission to let go. I highly recommend it for adults whose parents are more of a burden than a blessing."},{"Title":"Alaska Trees and Shrubs","review":"This book contains a tremendous amount of information. Most of this book comprises detailed descriptions of each tree and shrub that grows in Alaska. Each write-up includes a physical description of the plant (including description of various seasonal forms), description of uses of the plant by humans and wild animals, description of the plant's range (which is illustrated on a range map for each taxon); and the names of closely-related plants. And every write-up is accompanied by an excellent, detailed black-and-white illustration of parts of the plant (most are drawn actual size). Given all of this information, I had no trouble identifying most of the trees and shrubs that I have encountered in Alaska. And I am no botanist.Includes an introduction generally describing the vegetation zones of Alaska, and a key to identifying trees based mainly upon characteristics of their leaves. This reference is still cited in the academic literature today; and although it lacks color photographs (and plants are organized taxonomically rather than by color or other feature) I believe it would be an excellent reference for the non-expert who is interested in learning about the trees and shrubs of the arctic and sub-arctic Alaskan environments. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Alaska Trees and Shrubs","review":"This book is the only one generally available on the topic and it is, in general, an excellent book. It does a very good job of being accessable to non-experts and yet provides enough detail for serious botanists. The major criticism is that the map published with the original printing is no longer available. It is unfortunate, because it would have been an excellent resource. Another criticism is the very small maps for ranges of various plants. Aside from these points it is a good general guide. Of the many keys I have used in many different texts, the ones here are unique, combining a blend of taxonimic and non-taxonomic characteristics to make them useful and easy to follow. I was very impressed with the key for willows, which many books have a very difficult time with. The winter and summer keys were also helpful for many species. The black and white drawings are excellent and numerous. It packs a lot of information in a very small book."},{"Title":"Alaska Trees and Shrubs","review":"This has been the BEST plant, tree, and brush/shrub identification book I've found yet! Although it doesn't have \\"flowers\\" or \\"berries\\" in the title, flowers and berries are in there (well, if they're a shrub, like wild roses, but not like irises or chocolate lillies)...Black and white sketches with a few color photographs, AK state map of distribution, some historical notes, and, sometimes, common uses are listed (although I haven't seen any medicinal uses). Vegetations grouped by family. Detailed description of the plant from the leaf to bark to twigs to flower to berry (if applicable) to wood (if applicable)...detailed enough to differentiate between two closely related species. Great reference book!"},{"Title":"Alaska Trees and Shrubs","review":"This book contains a large amount of information about the trees and shrubs that grow in Alaska. I particularly appreciated the differentiating data and illustration of different seasonal forms. This book allowed me to accurately identify the trees and shrubs on my property, as well as basic information about my soil and subsoil based on the condition and density of these plants with the habitat information provided in this book. An invaluable resource for anyone living in the woods of Alaska!"},{"Title":"Alaska Trees and Shrubs","review":"The second updated edition of a definitive work on the woody plants of Alaska updates an edition that has been the standard on the topic for over three decades. Any collection specializing in Alaska botany must have this: it completely revises information and provides updates on habitat and taxonomy plus offers a centerfold of color photos in addition to the black and white drawings throughout. Descriptions of leaves, twigs, bark, wood appearance, flowers, habitat and distribution make for invaluable study and reference.Diane C.

She helps us understand more what we read while reading Shakespeare."},{"Title":"People's padre (Macfadden Bartell book MB 60-211)","review":"I am always interested (as a recent convert to the Catholic Church) in the stories of former Catholics. People's Padre is a well-written, thoroughly documented auto-biography. Ten years ago I would have read in this story a deserved expose of a wicked hierarchical system, and today I read in it the understandable grumblings of a sinner who was sinned against. Both sides are right, and both are wrong. Fr McLoughlin was a gifted administrator and politician, and proud of it. He transformed, almost single-handedly, the 1930s and 1940s social fabric of Phoenix Arizona by his work with the poor and with the health care system. Had he stayed humbly within the discipline of the Church, he might have shared the stage with Mother Teresa, but he found so much to dislike about obedience, and so much to (rightly) complain about, that he was unable to stay with the Church. He quit altogether, got married, and continued his work as a Protestant believer. He deserves appreciation. But his righteous indignation shines through to the point I'm not sure I'd like him as a next-door neighbor.This narrative would make terrific discussion material in any apologetics or RCIA class, and should probably be required reading. No one can dispute that the sexual sins of the Bishops and priests of the Church in the last fifty years are heinous, and that obedience to such monsters is submitting to abuse, but what of the sins of superiors who are simply high-handed or unreasonable? Protestants have no problem; they simply leave, join another church or start another church, without much fanfare. But in the Catholic Church, unity of teaching and purpose is a central dogma and this principle needs far more discussion than it probably gets. Obedience \\"in the Lord\\" is prized, and reading of any Saint, such as Teresa of Lisieux, or John of the Cross, or St Francis, or Jesus Himself, will show the value of such obedience to the soul and to the world.Fr McLoughlin, to his credit, gives praise to the Church in many areas. Many of the letters he reprints show a sincere compassion and wisdom from friends, colleagues, and superiors. While some of his conclusions about the Church are well-deserved indictments, others are borne of frustration, myopeia, unforgiveness, and the over-arching need to \\"just get things done\\" without interference.In short, a worthwhile read which should lead the reader to a prayerful assessment of the saints and sinners which comprise the Body of Christ on earth."},{"Title":"People's padre (Macfadden Bartell book MB 60-211)","review":"A fantastic and well written autobiography by an ex-priest. He wrote this expose' about his years of training in Roman Catholic seminary, years as a priest and of his becoming disillusioned over time with the Roman hierarchy. He rebuts Rome in point after point while telling the very readable story of his life's work."},{"Title":"People's padre (Macfadden Bartell book MB 60-211)","review":"I waited almost 50 years to read this interesting book. When I was 13-14 years old, this book was published in Phoenix where I was born. It was written by a former Franciscan priest who had married my parents and baptized me. The priest was loved for his compassion, aid to the poor of the area, and big personality. As soon as the book was published (or perhaps just before), our monsignor admonished our entire parish from the pulpit that no one was to read or purchase this book because it was written by an excommunicated priest. My mother, a devout Catholic, had always admired and respected this excommunicated priest--but she also followed the dictates of her religion explained by our parish leader.Fifty years later, when she was undergoing treatments for cancer and we were finding interesting books for her (she was 86, still worked every day and was antsy just resting at home), my mother said she'd love to read \\"The People's Padre,\\" and wondered if it was still in libraries. I located a used copy via Amazon and ordered it for her. She loved the book and said that for her it was a wonderful little history of Phoenix in the 30's and 40's when she was a young Catholic wife and mother. Soon thereafter I read the book and loved relating to the various locations and learning of the political climate I was unaware of because I was born in 1940 and too young to know some things. Since ordering that one book I think I have ordered five or six more, sending them to various former classmates. If you lived in Phoenix from the 30's through the 60's, you would find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"People's padre (Macfadden Bartell book MB 60-211)","review":"This book went through more than 20 printings in ten years. Unfortunately, that means that Amazon Marketplace sellers felt it necessary to create new product pages for each one. The 1963 printing is the same as the 1960 printing is the same as the 1958 printing is the same as the 1954 first printing. Too bad Amazon can't combine these listings and give us a true picture of where it stands on the \\"best seller\\" list."},{"Title":"Cities and society;: The revised Reader in urban sociology","review":"Here is a comprehensive study of urbanism, with an emphasis on American cities. The chapters were written by various authors, from the 1940s-50s. The authors explain several issues like demography and how this has or can change in a city. Driven by such causes as technological change or socio-environmental factors like improved life expectancies.There is also a chapter on volunteer groups, written in 1942. The US had a surfeit of these, compared to Europe. People came together from a commonality of interests, into such groups as Rotary or Masons. An interested reader should compare this chapter with the recent \\"Bowling Alone\\" text, that decried a fall in participation in such groups during more recent years."},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"Jill Mansell is one of my all-time favorite authors, however, I was a little disapointed by the predictability of her newest novel. It's still well-worth reading, but if you think that you know what's coming next, you probably do."},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"I have read all of Jill Mansell's books, and I have to say this is one of her better.Light, frothy, and surprisingly compulsive, this is a great summer read. The characters are all likeable, the plot isn't at all challenging, and the ends are all a bit too neatly tied, but if you're in the mood for a good piece of chick-lit that's not too taxing on your intellect, give this one a shot."},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"Jill Mansell's great strength as a writer of 'chick-lit' is that she writes funny, loveable and believeable characters, and her stories, while fairly predictable (although I like this about them too), are well-written, well-crafted and immensely readable - again and again. I have read this book twice, and I loved it just as much the second time as I did the first. Carmen and Nancy are characters you wish you could hang out with, and Rennie and Connor especially are lovely. The story moves along at a good pace, and I didn't get bored or want to stop reading... I didn't want to put the book down. If you need a relaxing, indulgent read that will put a smile on your face and take you off for a few hours into a world of friendship, romance, love and adventure, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"It is so nice to read a book that is good all the way through and not just building up to a point where the last ten pages only are good.The last ten pages ARE good, but so are the 2 or 3 hundred before it!Her real to life situations are realistic, not outrageoulsly silly. Even when her main character is not being laugh-out-loud funny(which she is-alot!)its still consistently entertaining. I've found each of her books to be better than the last. As an American, I just wish I understood British English slang a lttle better! 5 stars"},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"I am only 13, yet i have read plenty of books of all genres; including the handmaids tale, gone with the wind, all of sarah dessens, meg cabots, and Hemingway (yet i do not have to explain myself). And this was truley one of the best books i have ever read. Its plot was well thought out. And even though it sometimes told you everything without having to figure it out; it had plenty of twists that kept you guessing the plot's results up until the very last page.Mansell is very skilled in areas where most authors struggle in. Its hard to define who in fact the main character is because she keeps all the plots flowing vigorously while never letting the reader get lost.She has spun the perfect web of hilarity, romance, and meaning! A fantastic read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The One You Really Want","review":"Jill's books are true mind candy. I can never get enough of her delightful characters and plots. Whenever I want to relax, I'll pick up one of her books."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"Having been raised from a traditional, fundametalist viewpoint, I found this title extremely enlightening and thought provoking. I have always felt, intuitively, that there was more to the Biblical accounts than just the surface explanation. A work as great and inspired as the Bible must lend itself to multiple interpretations/applications to withstand the changing tides of time. Troward presents an excellent launching pad to a deeper meaning, and he is not without support. See Galatians 4:24. I highly recommend &quot;Bible Mystery Bible Meaning&quot; to any seriously reflective individual."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"While reading this phenomenal text that was originally copyrighted in 1913, I looked up (as to the heavens) and thanked the author, Thomas Troward for this contribution not only to my own spiritual development, but to the fantastic meaning and understanding that any student of spiritual text will find to be extraordinarily enlightening.There is so much meaning in this book. So much that conveys what both Moses and Jesus taught. The meaning behind their words, and the meaning in our present day lives.I strongly recommend this book to anyone from any religion, as this book truly and clearly explains the \\"mystery\\" behind the \\"meaning\\" of the words in the bible.This is a serious book, that requires a dedicated mind, that is, a mind in love with the process of Truth and spiritual enlightenment.I would also really recommend this book to any ACIM (A Course in Miracles) student. It is an engaging, mind opening read, and after reading this book, I can say with all sincerity that you may walk away with a great deal more understanding of the meaning of the words that the Bible tries to convey than before you first picked it up.I have many books at the top of my list, and this is now one of them."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"This insightful work by the author ofThe Creative Process in the Individualis a rich elaboration on hisEdinburgh Lectures on Mental Science. Troward viewed the whole Bible as a commentary on the words \\"man is the image and likeness of God\\" and pursues this thread throughout. He also considered it as the book of emancipation of mankind for deliverance from sickness, sorrow, poverty, uncertainty and limitation.The Bible is not just a collection of fables or incomprehensible dogmas but a statement of universal laws. In chapter 1, The Creation, it is emphasized that God is One and man is made in His likeness. The creation narrative is explained as Spirit working on Itself - the Spirit of God upon the waters or psychic stuff of the cosmos, when the laws were set in motion, like the law of cause and effect. The Fall looks at the allegory of the two trees in the garden of the soul. The tree of life is the perception of spirit and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is mankind's habit of seeing 2 powers, i.e. considering evil as a subject of knowledge.The deluge is explained as psychic forces that overwhelmed mankind because of rampant occultism. Many ages later the Patriarchs appeared; this is a transition from allegory to history. Troward analyses the three syllables of the name Israel, with reference to Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion. These others had part of the truth but it was not in balance. The three elements of the name Israel represent three modes of one life, symbolizing wholeness. In the chapter The Mission of Moses, he explores the holy name I AM and its significance, that of Being in the Absolute. Moses' task was to build a nation based on the recognition of the principle of the One, the people of the I AM. This nation was to be the custodians of truth until the coming of Jesus Christ through whom all nations would come to the light. See alsoThe Irrevocable Callingby Daniel Juster in this regard.Chapter 5, The Mission of Jesus, considers the metaphor of the shepherd and the stone and the concepts of sacrifice and covenant. The universal cannot act on the plane of the particular except by becoming individualized upon that plane. Christ's was a voluntary sacrifice; he is the foundation and crowning stone and also the rock of our salvation. The next chapter covers the meaning and symbolism of Solomon's Temple with its two pillars called Yachin and Boaz, whilst chapter 7 examines the Name of the Lord as a source of strength and protection. The name is explored in its 4 Hebrew syllables Yod, Hey, Waw, Hey, letter by letter to derive at the logical meaning. The name of the first woman, Hawa in Hebrew, derives from the second syllable. In this chapter the author points out how Jesus used this verb and considers the meaning of the creation of the cosmos by the divine word.Chapter 8, The Devil, looks at the negative disintegrating force as a manifestation of the integrating power operating at a lower level. The negative power has its root in our denial of the affirmative. This section also deals with the law of attraction and the nature of disembodied spirits. The antidote to all these things is the right conception of God as the one and only Originating Power. The law of liberty is discussed next; the law of the Bible is the law of human individuality. We are individual centers for the expression of Spirit. To be ourselves, expressing life by the creative power of thought is the law of liberty that leads to perfect social harmony.In the Teaching of Jesus, Troward provides a connected idea of the general scope and purpose of the Master's teachings, by referring inter alia to the parables of the prodigal son and the talents. He explains that the law is not vindictive but causal, and reminds the reader of the words of Jesus in John 16: \\"The Father himself loves you\\". In short, the gist of it is: \\"You are a conscious individual expression of the One Universal Spirit; recognizing this truth will set you free; you must believe that That which is infinite finds a centre in you.\\" I was struck by the similarity of Geza Vermes' conclusions in his bookThe Authentic Gospel of Jesus.Chapters 11 and 12 are about sin and forgiveness. Sin is a statement of the law of correspondence, but Spirit desires to forgive. An essential quality of Spirit's self-recognition in its relation to the human race is its ability and willingness to forgive and heal. Further interesting topics in these chapters include the reasons why Jesus said \\"your sins are forgiven\\" in some of his healing miracles, as well as thoughts on specters, hauntings and ghosts. Chapter 13 deals with Divine Giving, the desire of God to give to us in fullness and why one must cultivate receptivity. In order to receive, the individual has to become an expectant receiver. The Bible is filled with promises and by the law of creative power God provides in a multitude of wonderful ways.The last chapter is titled The Spirit of Antichrist. Denial of God is the opposite of the principle of Sonship. Referring to St Paul in Thessalonians and Daniel 11 & 12, Troward explains God as the originating spirit Animus Dei and the Anima Mundi as the eternal feminine, receptive subconscious mind or the soul of nature through which He operates. The Anima Mundi is amenable to suggestion, and therein lies the danger. A certain class of people with a powerful leader will shape the neutral Anima to their own thought and volition in a principle of self-deification. Those with God in their hearts will also work so that Anima Mundi is knocked out of the equation, leaving only the opposing forces. And the greatest of that is Divine Personality, our Everlasting Father. This scenario is frightening but also comforting and reassuring. I have found Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning to be a most illuminating and thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"T. Troward was a genius.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"All of Judge Troward's books are good. This one addresses the Bible from an enlightened perspective according to Metaphysics. The central theme according to Troward involves the liberation of mankind from the limited beliefs of fear, hatred, persecution, sin and condemnation and their consequential results, due to stubbornly held religious dogma and erroneous cultural indoctrination. The Right Honorable Judge Troward seeks to demonstrate the consistent parallel truth of infinitely expansive benevolence available through Divine Providence resulting from free-will according to our choice of God-consciousness: choice of belief in petty, fickle, mean god results in suffering, while choice of belief in God of Loving Excellence results in state of Grace, Blessedness and Paradise. While the preferred choice would seem self-evident, Troward observes the long Biblical account of erroneous allegiances to inverted truths. Covers old and new testament from what might be thought of as Jungian version of Adam and Eve, through the Ideal and symbolic interpretations of Moses and the New Israel and their continuity into the Redemption of Anthropos via the Christ, among other esoteric topics along the way. A serious book: well worth it.

It was a part of their literature series early in the year. I have no children of my own and I own both the board book and the paperback edition of this book because I love the illustrations and the rhythmical quality of the text. As someone who has professionally worked with children ages 2-12, I find that this kind of text is invaluable to early readers (ages 2-7). Children can easily pick up on the patterns in the sentences and begin developing many pre-reading skills (like being able to identify the left to right movement of written sentences). To find books that your young child will want to read over and over again is a jewel in their literacy development. To find books like this that you will want to read over and over again with your child is a treasure box of time shared!"},{"Title":"I Went Walking","review":"This book is cute however the text is nearly identical to E.

The watercolor paintings are colorful without being brash, and the child and animals are all realistic and yet stylized at the same time. I love how the child is not defined by the story as being a boy or a girl, and that it looks ambiguous enough to be either.The repetition of the story makes it easy to read and easy for an older child to learn, and yet isn't the kind of repetition that drives parents wild. As the child gets older, you can drop words and let them &quot;fill in the blank&quot; as they look at the pictures to identify both the animals and the animals' colors.When I was a Nanny my charge and I adored this book and read it at least a hundred times. Now that I am home with my own son, I bought the book for him and he loves it too!"},{"Title":"I Went Walking","review":"Our son loves this book. In his shorthand he calls it &quot;walking&quot; and asks for it regularly when we sit down to read.

Repetition the very thing our adult mind questions, children ask for repetition that they need. They learn to &quot;read&quot; you the book even when the book is not there. This stage of memorization is the first stage of reading. The child then moves to recognizing the words.

They say, \\"I saw a _____ (black cat, etc.) looking at me!\\" and then the children assigned that animal got up and followed me on my walk.

The brilliant colors and delightful character representations interest every one- adult reader to baby. This beautiful book grows with the child: every page offers much to notice and comment on, while the simple text is soon memorized and repeated by the learning-to-talk crowd. There are things to count, objects and creatures to identify, and the sheer joy of renewing the small adventure of the walk. We have given copies to babies on up to 5 year olds, and out of all the options this one is most often reached for at story time. As with all picture books the illustrations are of prime importance, and these endearing characterizations absolutely steal the show."},{"Title":"I Went Walking","review":"The book was purchased for my daughter who had to read it over the summer for 1st grade.

The basic plot device of the book is that JEB Stuart is court-martialed on charges that he failed in his duty to Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia before the battle of Gettysburg. Presentation of this plotline involves a detailed examination of the conduct of the battle, and of several of the principals--Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Hood, etc. John Singleton Mosby serves as Stuart's defense attorney, while Hood, Pickett, and Beauregard serve as members of the Court. A school of thought has existed for decades that the failure of Confederate forces at Gettysburg was the fault of General Longstreet. Lee, of course, took the blame upon himself. Others blame the disparity of numbers, and some actually give credit to the Union defenders (which is probably where credit should go). This well-written novel examines the various theses in historically-accurate detail in a manner highly-satisfying to Gettysburg buffs, although all will not be satisfied with the verdict of the Court-Martial. Gray Victory is well worth reading, and for far more than it's &quot;fantasy&quot; characteristics (which are quite interesting in themselves, by the way). For anyone to criticize this type of book because &quot;it couldn't have happened that way&quot; is missing the &quot;what if?&quot; point of the genre's concept. It is a well-researched book, grounded in fact, but launched into fantasy by the creativity of the author and the willing suspension of disbelief by the reader. I found it excellent."},{"Title":"Gray Victory","review":"This is speculative fiction in which it's postulated that the South has won the Civil War. It's a fun book. The analysis of the battle of Gettysburg is interesting -- that's obviously where Skimin did his research -- and the maps are good. The courtroom drama scenes are exciting, and one ends up wishing the author had included an epilogue telling us whether his imaginary CSA really made it. Now, the faults -- Skimin didn't really do his research on social behavior. His characters are astonishingly promiscuous for higher-class people of the time, especially the women. Also, his historical characters, particulary Stuart and Mosby, while reasonably engaging as imaginary people, don't really resemble the real-life version of themselves very much. His Stuart is too humorless, his Mosby too benevolent, his Breckenridge far too malevolent, his Longstreet too crazy. Nevertheless, if you take it as mind candy and not a serious work of literature, Gray Victory is quite a page-turner."},{"Title":"Gray Victory","review":"This novel is set in an alternative history in which the Confederacy succeeded in winning its' independence in the Civil War. Jefferson Davis' wife had a dream in which Atlanta would fall to Union forces if the defending forces sallied forth from the besieged city to fight. In our world, the defending general(I don't remember his name) takes his forces out to fight the Union army outside his defensive works, gets his clock cleaned, and gives Lincoln a major victory and PR boost just in time to narrowly beat McClellan in the 1864 presidential elections. In the prologue of Gray Victory, Davis orders the Confederate General to hold his defenses (by the way, while being only mediocre on the attack, this general was a master of fighting from a fixed defense), Atlanta does NOT fall, Lincoln loses the election, and immediately recognizes Confederate independance, since McClellan had promised to do exactly that and end the war if elected. Enough background - it's now a few years later, and the Confederates are trying JEB Stuart for losing the Battle of Gettysburg by disappearing for 2 crucial days and leaving Robert E. Lee without any screening cavalry. The trial is as much a sensation as any high profile celebrity trial in our modern world. Swirling about this a managerie of historical and fictional characters in a plot to carry out a major assassination at the trial. It's a race between the would-be assassins and a Confederate detective that would make Clancy or Forsyth proud. I particularly liked seeing how the author logically figured what the actions of the many vivid civil war figures would do after the war."},{"Title":"Gray Victory","review":"\\"Gray Victory\\" is a novel of an alternative history where the Confederacy won the Civil War, which allows Robert Skimin to have a military court of inquiry look into the charge that Jeb Stuart was responsible for the South losing the Battle of Gettysburg. It takes several chapters to discover what changes Skimin hath wrought to construction this alternative reality, and it boils down to Stuart surviving his wound at Yellow Tavern and McClellan defeating Lincoln in the election of 1864. However, why this certainly explains how the Confederacy could lose the Battle of Gettysburg and still win the Civil War, there is nothing to indicate what made the voters elect McClellan. Ultimately this is inconsequential because Skimin is simply overcoming the historical hurdles to such an inquiry, specifically the fact the war was still going on and Stuart's death before its end. Skimin simple wants to air out all the charges and countercharges that have fascinated Civil War historians for over a century.At one point it dawned on me that \\"Gray Victory\\" is a rebuttal of sorts to Michael Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels,\\" which privileges Longstreet's version of Gettysburg. Longstreet always had something of an advantage in this historical record since he wrote his memoirs and Lee never bothered to before his death. One of the most striking aspects of the novel is how few of the historical figures are portrayed as being admirable. John Mosby, the chief of Military Intelligence for the Confederacy and Stuart's counsel at the inquiry, and John Rawlins, Grant's chief of staff, are the only laudable figures. Jefferson Davis, James Longstreet, John C. Breckenridge, Judah Benjamin, and the rest of the Confederate leaders are not portrayed favorably to say the least. Robert E. Lee is kept out of the picture until the climax, simply because as soon as he takes a position that is the end of the trial, which would defeat the purpose of Skimin's novel. I might find Lee's timidity in these circumstances suspect, but without this contrivance the court of inquiry would be over before it started. The only major \\"error\\" I would point to is that Skimin allows Davis to run for re-election as President, whereas the Confederate Constitution permitted only a single six-year term. I do not think that Davis needed to be involved in self-serving political machinations to have Stuart called to task for his actions.There is a major sub-plot having to do with the son of John Brown and a southern black revolutionary movement that plan to restart the Civil War in order to restore the Union and abolish slavery. Obviously this is going to come to a head at the same time as the court proceedings, but it detracts from the entire argument about who was responsible for what happened at Gettysburg, and also serves as a reminder that the novel is not really taking a position about what the Confederacy would have done about slavery. In the final analysis, \\"Gray Victory\\" may not change your mind for who was ultimately responsible for the Confederate defeat, but it will certainly compel you to rethink your position, whatever it happens to be. The strength of Skimin's novel is that he comes up with a compelling narrative format for laying out the various arguments. This is one of the better alternative histories in which the Confederacy wins the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gray Victory","review":"Robert Skimin's alternate history novel is built around an amusing conceit: two years after George McClellan's victory in the 1864 presidential election leads to independence for the Confederacy, the incessant rehashing of Jeb Stuart's conduct in the battle of Gettysburg leads Jefferson Davis to convene a court of inquiry to settle the matter once and for all, thus allowing generals of both the real and armchair variety to revisit the conflict. For a group of Northern abolitionists training as terrorists, the venue is too tempting a target to ignore, and they plan a spectacular event that they believe will restart the war and achieve for good the postponed emancipation of the slaves.Though Skimin's novel starts out slowly, over time it develops it an enjoyable read. The basic denouement is predictable enough, yet Skimin proves more than able enough to keep the suspense mounting as to the details of the outcome. While he identifies Joseph E. Johnston's continuation of command of the defense of Atlanta as his point of divergence, there really are two - the other being Jeb Stuart's surviving the pistol shot received at the battle of Yellow Tavern, which gives him a rich and flamboyant personality around which to construct his novel. Yet his shrewdest decision was to focus the remainder of his narrative on second-tier historical figures, men such as John Mosby and John Rawlins, which gives himself more latitude in developing them as he sees fit. The result is a good read, and one of the better contributions to the famous \\"what-if\\" genre of Civil War alternate history."},{"Title":"Gray Victory","review":"I had a sinking feeling when this book fell open and I noticed a reference to a Lady Baltimore cake, which did not appear until a 1906 novel of the same name by Owen Wister. This sinking feeling continued when I started reading from the beginning. The year is 1866; the Confederacy has won its independence, and... Jefferson Davis is up for re-election. Uh oh.The President of the Confederate States was elected for a term of six years, starting in 1862, and was ineligible for re-election. Nitpicky? No. Every Civil War buff knows this, as does every other writer of alternative history, from Turtledove on down.Whatever the merits of the tale Skimin tells, and however much he has researched Gettysburg, he has been unforgiveably lazy in researching anything else, and it shows. The entire scenario by which the Confederacy is supposed to have achieved its independence is ludicrous. Yes, leaving Johnston in charge (instead of replacing him with Hood) MIGHT have delayed the fall of Atlanta, which MIGHT have meant Lincoln's loss of the 1864 election to McClellan, which MIGHT have made the US more amenable to a negotiated peace, but the idea that the US would sign an unconditional surrender the day after McClellan's election is simply... dumb, and undermines the credibility of everything after the book's preface. I couldn't get past that."},{"Title":"Instruments of the Money Market","review":"You can download this book for free from the Richmond Fed's website as a PDF. google it"},{"Title":"Instruments of the Money Market","review":"You can download this book for free from the Richmond Fed website as a PDF. google it"},{"Title":"Abner's Gulch & Judson's Landing","review":"This is a fun quick read that you can share with your kids or grand kids.

As I don't know the Chinese language, I was looking for reliable English translations to translate them to my mothertongue, Dutch. One would expect that the Soto zen school would provide reliable translations. When I received the book, it was a big disappointment. It consists of two parts, respectively 125 p. and 111 p. The first chapter of the first part is going about the \\"principles of practice and enlightenment of the Soto sect\\" (sic!), the second chapter is \\"an outline of buddhism\\", the third \\"the extract from the gospel of buddha\\", the fourth going about \\"what is zen\\", and a fifth chapter, \\"supplement\\". These items are all interesting for beginners, but I know them already from other books written in a more contemporary style, and above all, they were not the reason for buying this book. The second part it fully written in Chinese, so I even don't know what it all is going about. Maybe this part contains the sutras, but they are clearly not translated to English.

I will not hear him playing with his toys in his playroom, go peek in on him, and there he will be, sitting transfixed in front of this book, flipping through the pages and mumbling, \\"vroom! vroom!\\" to himself. If your child loves trucks or tractors, get them this book! My husband takes our son for rides on our tractor & lawnmower all the time, and this is his (my son's, not my hubby's) all-time favorite book!"},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"We've had this book (along with a couple other Bright Baby books \\"Aminals\\" and \\"First Words\\") for quite a few months and my 20 month daughter stills loves them all. She enjoys paging through the book to find what we've asked for. These books are a good size for small hands, making them easy to carry and turn the pages. The pictures are real, clear, and colorful on primary color backgrounds. Some of the larger vehicles take up two pages. The only other thing on the page is the name of the object (black letters in a kid-like font).I get a kick out of asking her to find the \\"car transporter\\" or \\"airport fire engine\\". She squeals every time we're in the car when she sees an actual \\"car transporter\\"."},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"Great truck book! Tractors, excavators, milk truck, fire truck, ambulance, loader, big rig, bulldozer, etc. All in all about 15 different kinds of trucks. The pictures are very appealing, bright backgrounds with the real pictures of the trucks filling the entire page. No clutter in the pictures, just the truck and the background and the wording on the type of truck it is. Great for kids who love trucks. My son takes it everywhere with him. Now I'm looking to buy more books from this series because of the beautiful pictures."},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"my DAUGHTER loves things that go - trucks, buses, cars...we both have learned lots from this book -- there are so many types of trucks and things that go that I did not the names to and many common things we see every day like the mail truck or fire truck."},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"Great pics!! The only con--if any, I think is that maybe the words could be a little more general. (i.e just \\"firetruck\\" or \\"tractor\\" instead of the formal full name.) But overall this book is awesome!

Pictures, colors, totally engaging and enticing to my 1 yr old. Hooray!"},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"Encarta Dictionary defines truck as \\"large commercial freight transport vehicle\\" or alternatively \\"a large vehicle for transporting goods by road\\".On the back cover of this Bright Baby book the publisher pledges \\"This book will increase your child's vocabulary by associating words with beautiful pictures\\".So what's the problem?On the front cover we see a bright yellow mini loader - interesting, but definitely not a truck. The book also wrongly identifies tractors, diggers, scrapers, bulldozers, grass cutters, and excavators as trucks. All are fun to look at heavy equipment, but none are trucks.Books purporting to be educationally valuable should be factually correct.Therefore the most I can give it is three stars. It would be two except that my nephew's one year old Jacob just can't get enough of it, notwithstanding the inaccuracies."},{"Title":"Trucks (Bright Baby)","review":"My 18 month old is talking up a storm and LOVES trucks. He insists on reading this book over and over. The pictures are clear and he can now name EVERY truck in the book although he has some trouble with \\"car transporter\\". The word is a bit long for a kiddie book but he's certainly up for the challenge. I would recommend this book for any truck lover or word enthusiast. It is not a story book, just pictures and words.

It is very warm, and contains recipes for delectable treats from African-American churches throughout the country.

This is a wonderful book just to flip through - the stories are amazing - and the recipes will exceed anyone's expectations!! My favorites so far are the Macaroni and Cheese and the Mean Greens. (They are my favorites because those are the only two that I have tried!) I made the Macaroni and Cheese last Thanksgiving and being one of the last dishes to the table I was surprised to see it as being one of the first to go!! My family asked why I didn't make more! And the Mean Greens have given me a name. (The only thing that I hate is that people keepe requesting them!) I left this cookbook over a friends house by accident and because I know I will have a fight on my hands tryig to get it back so, I just ordered another one so that he can have it! I also ordered Brown Sugar, the dessert version of the same cookbook. I can't wait!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"What put this book up on the competition in my opinion, is the consistent and real world cooking advice that is embedded in the recipes. There are no lies in this book. I leaned on it very heavily this past Thanksgiving and my family raved about the food."},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"This is a really practical book full of easily followed recipes, anecdotes and pictures. Those of us raised in the church know about the important role of those manning the pots. Not just anyone got to serve on the kitchen committee. No indeed. Only those accomplished cooks who knew how to &quot;put their foot in it,&quot; were allowed to toil most church kitchens. I am glad to see that this author has drawn on the wisdom of these faithful chefs and was able to get them to share their recipes.I love to cook whenever we have big family gathering because we're all so busy now and spread out all over the East Coast. We don't always have the time to prepare these types of meals for ourselves on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this is one of my favorite books. I especially like the wheat bread recipe. One day when I'm feeling bold, I will move on the dinner rolls and angel biscuits.I enjoyed looking at the black and white pictures showing the cooks working and the parishoners enjoying the food. There is a lot of history in this book. You might just want to order two copies -- one for the kitchen and another for the coffee table."},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"I collect Aferican-American cookbooks. My perfect book is a good mix of authentic recipes and backroung info to add to heritage of the recipe. While I like the format and actual page layout of other African-American cookbooks better, this book has some solid recipes. Where this book excels over others is that there is a story behind nearly every recipe and there is lots of variety in the recipes. The recipes are easy to follow and do remind you of church anniversary dinners!"},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"It would be impossible to single out one recipe in this book and say it's the best. They are all the best and they work well together. I must say, I never thought molasses would be a staple in my cupboard but it is. If you bought this book just for the neat meatloaf recipe, it would be worth it. These are tried and true recipes of the past, each one with its own unique story."},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"A cookbook will be judged primarily on its recipes and this one really delivers the goods. Unlike so many books that chase prevailing food trends and offer gimmicky recipes with needlessly lengthy ingredients lists, this one presents plenty of time-tested classics that are economical and simple to prepare. A cookbook that you'll really *use*, rather than just put on your coffee table. The affectionate background material included by the author is a charming bonus."},{"Title":"Soul Food : Recipes and Reflections from African-American Churches","review":"This is a great cookbook. It brings back many memories of great and talented family cooks. I gave away six copies as Christmas presents to family members.

I could not get pass the smell, so it was thrown away."},{"Title":"Lectures on quantum chromodynamics","review":"First, I think that I should mention that, at least for me, some parts of this book were a very tough read. To a large extent, this is because the book is so incredibly compact, which, since it covers most of the important theoretical topics in QCD, implies that it cannot possibly be as meticulous and explanitory in derivations as, for instance, an introduction in QFT. In other words, this book is for those who are thoroughly familiar with QFT and with its mathematical structure to the point that you can fill out the details of most proofs without too much difficulty.This aside, I must say that this book is filled with fascinating, sometimes a bit unorthodox, insights not only into QCD, but also into all of quantum field theory itself (for example, take his wonderful chapter on path integrals in QM, which stands very well all on its own, or the intriguing viewpoints on gauge fields and their quantization, or especially on his exceedingly compact, elegant, simple, and yet philosophically complete treatment of radiative corrections and in particular on Wilson's ideas on renormalization).Although this book is not filled with a great deal of phenomenology, I do not think this is the point of the book; it, for me at least, is a profoundly philosophical text on QCD, in other words food for the mind and the soul."},{"Title":"DEADLY BREW: She Loved Him to Death","review":"This mystery is well thought out and supplies clues along the way for those who like to try to solve the crime before the author gives the answer.

I read the series in middle school and was thinking about it so I ordered the series. I discovered there was a 4th book that I didnt know about back then. So I also purchased Cutting Loose, the 4th book in the series."},{"Title":"Cutting Loose","review":"After clearing his name in the murder of his deaf little sister, 18-year-old Matt McKendrick has finally gotten his life back on track. He's made some close friends, including the four uniquely quirky and hilarious Schuyler siblings, and bonded with his adoptive family, that of the LAPD lieutenant who helped solve the case. Now, Matt's just graduated from high school and is looking forward to one last carefree summer before embarking upon the next phase of his life.But first, Matt's got to face the ghosts and demons of his past. His childhood best friend Gary begs him to come home to Idaho and help work at a ranch...the one where he grew up. Putting aside his discomfort, Matt decides to take Gary up on the offer, taking Meg and Will Schuyler along with him.As the trio learn just how hard running a guest ranch can be, Matt deals with the unresolved issues he left behind at age 15, when his parents died in a car crash and he fled for Los Angeles with little Katie. By the time the summer winds down, Matt discovers it's possible to live fully in the present, while knowing that those who are gone are still with him.This is the fourth of four books."},{"Title":"Cutting Loose","review":"This is one of Mrs. Miller's best, the fourth and final book in the McKendrick series. Matt exorcises his demons and returns to work on his parents ranch. Meg and Will tag along, and Matt learns some very valuable lessons about life and having faith in other people. This is an awesome read on it's own, but it is better if you read &quot;The Truth Trap&quot;, &quot;Aren't you the one who..?&quot; and &quot;Losers and Winners&quot; first. All of these books are wonderful stories that make you laugh and cry. Mrs. Miller is such an awesome writer; you can feel Matt's heartache, confusion and elation as if you are living it."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"From what I see this book has a lot of listings of guns, but is hard to find what you are looking for. There are about 750 different guns and accessories (including all the different versions of some guns, and gernade launchers), compaired to the Ultramodern Firearms at 250.This book lacks tables of any type, except for a few where they show the different versions of certain weapons. Trying to find a weapon can prove to be a challenge with the large number of guns from all generations.Overall, too much info, not enough use..."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"If what you're looking for is a book full of repeating stats, then this may be your book. As it is, several of the guns have errors in the history section (i.e. Colt is still making the 1911) and they even duplicate some guns in whole (i.e. Beretta M9 and 92 are seperate entries). The book adds nothing to the game besides an unreliability mechanic, which is a seperate roll before you roll to hit, as opposed to building it into the to hit roll.(by this system, the gun jams just before you shoot it, as opposed to when you do.)The book was $20 discounted, and I'll probably lose money for sending it back, but it's not worth me keeping it."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"In reading about one weapon i found it contained numerous innaccuracies. If i had time to read more and if the authors data continued as it did for the M-134 it would have about the same use for this as a comic book. As a guy who maintains and operates the M-134 \\"minigun\\" i found the info he supplied laughable."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"There's a fact : if you even think of buying this, it's because modern weaponry will have a major importance in your game. Another fact is that, even to the detail minded, the weapons described in the basic D20 Modern book should be enough for most campaigns : the variations ins statistics between similar weapons are just not that great in D20 system.If you insist on getting a book just for weapons, you still have a choice between this one ant the Ultramodern Firearms published by Green Ronin, which I deem the better choice.The good points of this book are these : the sheer number of weapons covered which range from ther very old (pistols dating from the early 1900s and wwII machineguns) to th so new they are described as still in development. Also, unlike the other offering, this book covers grenade launchers, a weapon system or accessory which I deem rather important.The bad points now : a) disorganization : the weapons are listed by type in alphabetical order, and you'd better know how it's organized, because there is no index or recapitulative table to help you find it . (a real bother when you are looking up a british weapon; and while the Uzi SMGs are listed under their maker, IMI, this is far from systematic). b) repetitions : a number of weapon systems, which exist under variable denominations but with little variation are listed more than one. c) poor graphics : the weapons are illustrated with line drawings which go from barely fair to downright bad. it seems that they suffered from unsufficient resolution when being digitized, if they weren't bad to start with. d) incoherence : funny enough, the same cartridge does not do the same damage according that it's fired from a machinegun or another weapon system, and weapons described as quality and expensive have their price listed as cheaper than cheap, mass produced versions... d) close to no attention given to ammunition ... well, there ARE rules for special ammo types, but no study of the myriad cartridge types (i.e. wha't the fragging difference between the 9x18 Makarov used in classical pistols and SMGs, and the one unsed in the newer PMM; why does the 7.62R do less damage than 7.62NATO?)well, you see the overall picture... frankly, unless you need a fairly comprehensive, if disorganized catalog of weaponry, or give a great importance to greanade launchers, you'll be better off with the smaller, but better made Ultramodern Firearms, or even, unless you are a compulsive collector, contenting yourself with the basic list in D20 Modern."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"Weapons Locker is a very nice addition to d20 Modern. The sheer amount of weapons is nice, allowing you to make more unique characters. The book also has more ammo types and a helpful explaination of the surpressed/silenced rules. The only glaring flaw of the book is the lack of a table of gun stats at the beginning of each chapter, leaving you to leaf through the book to find the stats you want. However I am still quite happy with the book and I have found a lot of use for it in my campaign."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"I'm a personal fan of \\"stuff\\" books and this one does not fail to deliver. Like all d20 modern things it is totally compatible with 3.5 and pathfinder (steampunk anyone?). The list is so unbelievable it is impractical from a game mechanics point of view. This book has dozens of guns that are virtually the same. But then what makes it so good?All the information in this book is dead on. So much care went into making the weapons locker and you can totally feel it. For someone who started on 1st edition d&d; this is the kind of thing I get giggly over in a book. You can truly build your character with this, too. No more \\"I have a pistol\\", \\"so do I, suckerfish\\". You can give your character more depth of personality, more realistic gun styles, and that's just incredible.And, finally, the way they present the rules makes it very easy to convert into other systems. I've used the same weapons locker book to get more depth into: d20 future, steampunk d&d;, all flesh must be eaten, gurps, dark heresy, and paranoia.The only other \\"stuff\\" book I would advise more than this is 3.5sArms and Equipment Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying Accessory)."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"In this book you can find most of the weapons you're likely to come across in everyday life. The additional section at the end of the book explaining which weapons are typically carried by different law enforcement agencies around the world is quite useful, but I would have liked to see it expanded, and made a little less US-centric.If you're after a specific weapon not listed in the book (one of my NPCs carries a South African pistol that isn't listed) you can always compare the weapon to one of those that is available and use those stats.Altogether a handy compendium, but as always more detail would be better."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"Look at it this way -- I don't even play D20 Modern and I bought this book. There's a wealth of information on numerous guns, presented not only in a graphically neat and enjoyable way, but easily accessible. This is an excellent supplement for any modern-era RPG, D20 or no. A good investment."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"Oh yeah. Guns. Guns. More Guns.You gotta love it!What I liked most about this book is the fact that it provided context for the guns. Need to know what type of rifle a Chinese army regular carries? How 'bout an FBI special agent's sidearm? And what does a Serbian anti-tank specialst lug around? Sidearms, rifles, sniper rilfes, submachine guns, machine guns, anti-materiel rifles and grenade launchers (I think I got it all).This book has everything you need and context for all of it.It will add a dose of realism and flavor to your campaign.I highly recommended you purchase this product."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"I own this book only because someone had bought it for me as a gift because I'm a huge fan of the d20 Modern line. Now I'm a more story geared GM meaning I have the players try to find solutions instead of fighting all the time. So obviously when my players saw this all this went out the window... I can admire all the guns and in fact being a gun nut irl I found alot of favorites. Considering all the games I like running or X-files/Conspiracy games."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"I am rather surprised at the quality of this supplement, especially when compared to the other books in the series. This book is well presented and attractive when it comes to the actual book, layout and art. But is also full of errors and repeats, you could just as easily buy a copy of Janes and use comparable stats from the campaign book. If you simply must have a D20 weapons guide Ultramodern Firearms is much better. And The Modern Arms Guide for Spycraft is also very good, with statistics that are a big more on the realistic side and it covers more weapon types than Weapons Locker or Ultramodern Firearms."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"Good selection, same issue as stated before with the same-caliber weapons doing different damage... This issue has popped up in many video games to date; it's more of a balance thing than anything else.I would like to note that on page 73 of this book an AK74SU is pictured in the stead of the correct image, that of an M16A4.More or less worth it if you want the weapons in your campaign, especially so since it denotes 'Who would carry what?' in the back of the book."},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviews I've read. It's alot of useful stuff but not in any useable order. It really looks like a sub-standard product from wizards.

These are not mere dramatizations; they are full metamorphoses. In a hilarious example, the story &quot;A Man of Sorrows and Acquainted with Grief,&quot; Stern uses Bach's THE PASSION ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN to leap into, of all things, small-town born-again Christian Texas...as seen from the point-of-view of a Jewish high-school orchestra director who gets pulled over for speeding on the interstate.The stories also &quot;riff&quot; off of Robert Frost poems, Wallace Stevens' &quot;The Man on the Dump&quot;, W.B. Yeats' &quot;The Second Coming&quot; and even Borges.These are stylish and smart, always moving and masterfully composed. Bravo, Stern!"},{"Title":"When We Were Very Young","review":"Here's the nicest edition of When We Were Very Young since its 1924 publication! With a font reminiscent of the original, and Ernest H. Shepard's gently colored illustrations similarly-placed amid the text, this book is a joy to handle and peruse. Of course, this volume lacks the pencil and crayon embellishments that my sisters and I added to our mother's original edition, but the soft and urgent messages - and all the pleasures - have been beautifully preserved for a new generation. It's gratifying to be able to reread and recite and relive these poems that voice the essential concerns of children everywhere."},{"Title":"When We Were Very Young","review":"I have always loved these poems and wanted to share them with the youngest generation.

He's five and I don't think anyone reads to him, but he's starting to do it himself. There are enough people who think it important that he have the latest X-box.

The first 10 or so poems just seemed incomplete to me. \\"Independence\\" caught my eye first. In very few words it pretty much tells us adults that our kids are going to do what they want, despite all the things we say. It's followed by the wonderful poem \\"Nursery Chairs\\" where a child pretends the chairs in his house are different things. Then after \\"Nursery Chairs\\" is another strong poem, \\"Market Square\\" where we learn that there are things all around us in nature that we don't need to get from the market.\\"Disobedience\\" is another interesting poem. It's kind of a role-reversal story about a kid whose mother disobeys his orders to stay away from the end of town, and she gets lost as the result of her disobedience.\\"Spring Morning\\" emphasizes the beauty of nature to us, saying, \\"It's awful fun to be born at all.\\" Next is \\"The Island\\" which has a wonderful closing message that screams, \\"God made it all - FOR US!\\" to me.And there are so many other joyous poems in this quick read too. There's \\"Jonathan Jo,\\" \\"Rice Pudding,\\" \\"The Wrong House,\\" \\"The Dormouse and the Doctor\\" (which has some terrific rhythm), a very touching \\"Little Bo-Peep and Little Boy Blue,\\" \\"The Invaders,\\" \\"If I Were King,\\" etc., etc.But perhaps my favorite poem in the collection is \\"Halfway Down\\" which is about nothing more than sitting on stairs.

The real test of a reader's poetic prowess is A.A. Milne, the living room couch and a handful of kids waiting for your renderings of growling bears and timelessl human characters.It takes an extraordinary book to capture children's attention on the strength of words alone.It's not that there are no illustrations here, just that each poem has just one or two small, original ink drawings; delightful, but bowing appropriately to the genius of words that can hold children spellbound. For instance, Milne takes a subject like sidewalks and transforms it into the stuff of playacting in Lines and Squares - an irresistible cadence to chant on a walk (or a lumbering gait):And the masses of bearsWho wait at the corners all ready to eat the sillies who tread on the lines of the streetAnd I say to them, \\"BEARS.....Just look how I'm walking in ALL of the squares!\\"As I read I can now recall the precise inflection and finger-shaking combination from Disobedience that it took to elicit giggles from my sisters and me, now working its comedy on my four-year-old son:James James SAID to his mother, \\"Mother\\", he said, said he;\\"You Must Never Go Down To The End Of Town If You Don't Go Down With ME!\\"When We Were Very Young is a collection of poems for children, about childhood, and for those who wish to remember its special magic view on the world. This book is a beloved tradition in my family, starting with those cozy evenings on my Grandmother's couch as we all snuggled up to hear about the brownie that lives behind the curtain, Jonathan Jo (who had a mouth like an O), the three foxes and Christopher Robin, who couldn't stop his hoppity hop.

He had great talents and love for his country and its constitution; and he had great flaws that were magnified by his greatness. One thing he didn't have was a great modern and objective biography. He now has one, thanks to Mr. Remini.Along with Henry Clay, John Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams and other notables, Daniel Webster represented the generation of Americans to whom the Founder Fathers entrusted the nation they had fought for and created.Webster took that responsibility very seriously and used his intellectual and oratorical powers to help shape the interpretation of our laws and constitution to the needs of our growing and expanding country. He was involved in many important Supreme Court cases, many in front of John Marshall, who is still considered by many to have been our best Chief Justice.Webster's greatest fame is probably as an orator, mostly in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Remini shows us that he wasn't necessarily a great legislator or floor leader in terms of moving important legislation. Henry Clay was the man to do that. However, Webster's rank as one of the country's top senators of all time is merited by the incredible ability he had to express what this nation stood for, what the constitution stood for and that the Union, above all, was what was most important. Several of his speeches, which he would edit carefully for publication, are still moving and were generally printed fully in the press and memorized by children. His \\"union\\" stance many times cost him in popularity as he had to take some stances on specific legislation that may not have been \\"morally\\" acceptable to many (like his defense of the Slave Fugitive Law), but that was necessary to uphold the law.It is little known by many that Webster was a very able Secretary of State for three different presidents (Harrison, Tyler and Fillmore) and that he used his knowledge of the law (maritime law in particular), the constitution and America in general to develop foreign policy designed to continue gaining international rights, commerce and respect for our nation. In particular, he did much to open trade relations in Asia and Latin America.Unfortunately, Webster's flaws (drinking heavily, money mismanagement, duplicity and abuse of friends) were also great enough to prevent his being elected president. People just did not trust him enough. He was acknowledged as perhaps the best orator of the day and \\"Defender of the Constitution\\", but he had trouble relating to the common man. He was essentially an East Coast snob and the people of the south and the expanding west could not really relate well to him, or he to them. His stubborness also caused him to commit some real blunders on the foreign policy side, but I think that on balance he had a very creditable record as Secretary of State. That stubborness probably cost him the presidency at least once (he could have acceded to have been Harrison's VP but refused to; John Tyler accepted and became president when Harrison died just a few weeks into office) and cost the Whig party the presidency in at least another ocassion when he refused to concede during the nominating conventions.Men like Webster get lost in the popular mind between the greatness of the Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln. Yet, at a very crucial time in America, when the country was expanding at incredible rates, when interpretation of the constitution would define our legal framework to the present day and when the union was threatened to be torn asunder by nullifiers and abolitionists, men like Webster, Clay, Calhoun and Jackson were there to make sure the Union's survival was the primary object. In the intermediate term, they failed because the nation fell into Civil War (after they were all dead), but while they were alive, they compromised, orated and legislated to avoid that awful event. After the War, and even today, many of the things that America stands for and are taken for granted. But they were formulated and imprinted on our national character by men like the \\"Godlike Daniel\\".Remini has written extensively on the Jacksonian period and has detailed and excellent biographies of Jackson and Clay as well. These men did not all necessarily care of each other and Remini doesn't play favorites in his biographies. He deals with Webster very fairly, granting him his well-deserved greatness, but also being very frank and objective about his shortfalls and political failings and blunders."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"This is a perfect book. Remini does an excellent job on Webster's great Supreme Court cases, not from a legal standpoint but from a personal standpoint. His chapters on Webster's great orations make Webster's words come alive. Webster was a flawed man--he drank to excess and could not handle money--but he had magnificent powers and this boook tells his life as well as it could be told, IMHO. A great, great work."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"The unfortunate result of the growing power and focus on the executive branch is that historians tend to focus on presidents as prime movers for american political development. Remini's biography of Daniel Webster proves paradigm deeply flawed, particularly in the early years of our nations history.Webster, though never achieving the presidency, deserves great credit for setting the tone of american government and the supremacy of congress that survived through the 19th century. Remini does a tremendous job exploring the early 19th century and the issues this second generation of american leaders faced.Recent great interest in the revolutionary generation hopefully will not eclipse the study of those, like Webster, who came next and solidified the nacient insitutions that the founders created. If the founders were the fathers of our government, than men like Webster was that government's teacher in primary school.A wonderful read, if you are really interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"After reading this, I had not only a good sense of Webster, but that I had a good sense of the ante-bellum United States as it was built by the generation immediately following the revolutionary generation. The author clearly admires Webster, yet does not hide his flaws. The book takes a while to plow through, but it is a worthwhile immersion into an era in which public men could speak publicly, and move the public with -- not only the style of their oratory, but the thoughts behind it. Excellent, excellent reading, and a feast for thought."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Robert Remini brings us Daniel Webster as no one else can.... In order to paint such a perfect picture of a man that is as complex as Webster requires the knowledge of a true expert.Remini gives us a very fair and well balanced portait of a man who was a contemporary of Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and John Calhoun (all of whom Remini has written authorative biographies on).Make no mistake, Daniel Webster was a very complex man. One who was capable of pure genious but could also be unbelievably ignorant. His feud with Henry Clay probably cost both men the oppurtunity to be president. His ability to amass ungodly debts and then refuse to pay them is equally bizaar. However, this is the same man who argued many of the ground breaking case before the Supreme Court. He helped to stall the Civil War for 20 years by showing unflinching support to Andrew Jackson (Who was in the opposite political party) handling of the nullification crisis.Remini shows us all of these sides with the rare ability to help us get into the mind of Webster. Remini understands the age and the politics of this era like no other... therefore, if you are interested in learning about the great Daniel Webster.... look no further!However, as much as I enjoyed learning about Webster I admit you have to be motivated to read the entire book. While the politics of Webster's time were undoubtley the biggest of the time - it is hard for to finish all 800 pages when living in 2004. Make no mistake this is a great book... but even great books can be a bit dull."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"This is a great read, organized in the way one wants biographies to be organized. Its format is superlative. There is chronology in the front to guide one to the life, and the footnotes are where they belong--on the bottom of the page, so one does not have to go to the back of the book, only to find that footnote is just a page citation. Remini makes Webster's famous orations come alive, and I thrilled anew to words long famous, expertly guided by the author of this fantastically good biography."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Unlike Remini's three volume biography of Andrew Jackson this work shows a real person not a god idolized by the biographer. Webster was a talented, ambitious and complex man. He played a heroic role as Secretary of state, he defended the Union against the South Carolinian secesssionists, he solicited money from many people including N. Biddle in support of the Bank of the United States. He illustrates the difference in what we consider unethical acts among politicians. He was cursed by the radical abolitionists because he refused to put the Union in jeopardy to stop the spread of slavery.It could be said that Remini redeemed his reputation as an impartial historian with this work."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Absolutely the definitive biography of Daniel Webster. He, along with Henry Clay (2/3 of the the 'Great Triumvirate' with John C. Calhoun) remain the 2 greatest men not elected to be President of the United States. And they were not for 2 reasons: they lived and thrived during almost the exact same decades, after the Founding Fathers, prior to the Civil War, and both had such over-weening ambition that they committed mutual suicide on each other; and 2) both were too closely attached to the more aristocratic, federalist period, and could not catch onto the more democratic, post Jacksonian era of popular politics.For me, the best thread throughout the book was the 'Godlike Daniel, Black Dan' reprise. That is, like the girl with the curl, when he was great, Webster was very very great, and when he was bad, he was rotten. His major speeches, at Plymouth, Bunker Hill, Webster-Hayne, Webster-Ashburton Treaty, at the Supreme Court, etc., can hardly be surpassed; his perpetual indebtedness, his elitism, and his unrealistic presidential ambitions, among other qualities, are not attractive.Although obviously this was a very long book, i wish the author had left out many chapters, and concluded more with a consideration of the effects, positive and negative, of the life and career of Webster on his nation. I'm sure it would have been overwhelmingly positive."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"A very serious and in-depth look at a hugely influential figure in our young country. Undoubtedly Daniel Webster helped to frame the young nation in a time when many things could have turned out differently. Webster's desire to bring us together as Americans to row together under the Constitution was completely clear.And yet Webster had flaws. It is important to know that even the legends have crucial human failings.The additional national context helped me to appreciate a time that I didn't know well--after the Revolution, before the Civil War, that I had never really explored before. I feel much smarter for having persisted with this book. It was worth my time."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Almost 800 pages, a little too vast for the subject -even if Daniel Webster, but written with the craftsmanship and love-of subject typical of this masterful historian. The man, Webster, indeed had a long and busy life, personally and professionally, his impact on the nation as a leader, his voice epitomizing the American soul, of an America still a teen, so to speak, made him one of those few American personages deserving of a place on the top, right there with te Founding Fathers themselves.Calhoun, Clay, and Webster, as the author well puts it, are the three last great men, after the miraculous coexistence of the founding generation. The three men together took on the job of sending off the USA to work, just as young people leave school or college and meet the real world with all the responsibilities attached to their own actions.Little or nothing did I know about the man. I deeply appreciate this effort to bring to life this great figure, with all his weaknesses as a man, and not as a myth, and letting us readers really see those times (from the Revolution to almost the Civil War) as clearly as through a clean glass, with no fog of ages in between.The writer of this biography, again, is truly the right person to take on a life of such a great American figure as Daniel Webster. Alas, America, how much your soul has been soiled, how much like Europe you are again. Full circle."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"This is an excellent biography of Webster and history of America and American politics during his time in Washington. His issues and relationships with Jackson, Clay and Calhoun are covered. His activities with the Supreme Court and the review of major cases illustrates his impact on the development of constitutional law and its impact on our country. There is good coverage of his major speeches - the context and selected excerpts.The breadth of Webster's contribution through the Courts, Congress and as Secretary of State is quite a story and this book covers it in 750 readable pages - warts and all. I rate this nearly on par with Chernow's Hamilton."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Occasionally, nature produces an individual with towering intellect and mesmerizing oratorical abilities, but haunted by deep and seemingly irrepressible moral flaws. Their lives are filled with a mix of remarkable achievement and profound disappointment; monumental success and disgrace both seem inevitable. The late twentieth century had Bill Clinton, and the early nineteenth had Daniel Webster.Webster's story - like Clinton's - is at once inspiring and frustrating, laudable and detestable. There is certainly an element of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" in Daniel Webster, and the noted Jacksonian historian Robert Remini uses that split personality as the foundation in building this important biography of one of America's greatest and most unique statesman.Webster's genius is undeniable. His many natural gifts, which even his bitterest enemies had to concede, earned him the highly flattering sobriquet \\"the Godlike Daniel.\\" No private attorney has affected the course of American judicial history as much as Webster. With the ideologically sympathetic John Marshall presiding over the Supreme Court, he successfully argued nearly every landmark case of the early nineteenth century: Dartmouth College, Gibbons vs. Ogden , McCollough vs. Maryland. He also added his considerable talents to the defense of the Union, first during the South Carolina nullification crisis in the celebrated Hayne-Webster debates, and then in the twilight of his life as the debate over slavery mounted toward civil war he delivered an impassioned speech in defense of the Compromise of 1850. His many public addresses lauding the ideals and principles of the American republic - the Plymouth Oration, Bunker Hill Oration, commemoration of the lives of Jefferson and Adams - are legendary and were once memorized by schoolboys. When a Webster speech was anticipated in the Senate, the halls were jammed with attendees eager to hear history in the making. Indeed, as Stephen Benet notes in the classic The Devil and Daniel Webster: \\"You see, for a while, he [Webster] was the biggest man in the country. He never got to be President, but he was the biggest man.\\"But there was also a less admirable, more human side to Daniel Webster; an alter ego to the Godlike Daniel known derisively as \\"Black Dan.\\" Addictions to alcohol and gambling were the duel crosses Webster had to bear through out life. These afflictions ensured Webster was chronically in debt despite a flourishing law practice. These debts eventually presented conflicts of interests and put him in compromising positions, which undermined his moral authority and ultimately cost him the White House.It has been written that most great men are made by the events of their times, but a very select few would have been great regardless of time or place. Remini's splendid biography suggests that Daniel Webster is a strong candidate for the latter category."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"I purchased this book for a friend who said he had been looking for it for along time. He hasn't read it yet. The book was used book but was in good condition and came right away after ordered."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","review":"Let's face it - most Americans, even history fans like myself, have trouble keeping our attention every page of a 700+-pg book. Credit Remini with making the life of Webster as interesting as to keep you hooked and reading till the end, wanting to find out more. Credit him as well with fine research - he seems to have read basically everything written by Webster that remains in one collection or another. This was all impressive, but keeping the material interesting and keeping the strength of the orations on paper are too much of a task even for him. I am not sure what non-history fans would think of this but I think it would definitely interest any others with even a passing interest in the heritage of our nation."},{"Title":"Death Goes on Retreat","review":"This was a one of those mysteries that is enjoyable but not because it's a pageturner with a complicated plot. No, I enjoyed the descriptions of people and settings, and it takes you into an interesting world, which the author understands well. It's also better written than many of this genre.The story begins with the detective character, Sister Mary Helen, going on a retreat with her friend Sister Eileen. Unfortunately, they arrive at this beautifully located California retreat house a week early (mixup with dates) and there's a priests' retreat going on. They intend to just spend the night and return home, but a murder means that they must remain in residence while the law enforcement officers are investigating the case. The police detectives are convinced it's one of the people on the property at that time that committed the crime, so they're basically looking at nuns and priests -- a small group, who we get to know fairly well.Sr. Mary Helen is the one who finds the body, and she is unable to restrain herself from conducting her own investigation -- not that I blame her, because I'd want to know who among the people I was with was a killer (although questioning possible killers is not a good idea, if you ask me.)I read a lot of mysteries, so that may explain it, but I had a hunch who the killer was from the front. I kept waiting for an explanation of the motive, because I think people don't kill without good reason, but even at the end, the motive just didn't seem adequate -- which is probably why I enjoyed reading the book but came away a bit disappointed by the ending.This is my second book by this author and I intend to read more."},{"Title":"Death Goes on Retreat","review":"The saga of Sister Mary Helen and friend Sister Eileen continues as Sister Mary Helen finds yet another body. Sister Mary Helen's talents aren't in the finding of the body (too convenient) but in the discovery of clues and the ability to get people to tell her things and the thoughtful putting together the information she has gathered. Her escapades are fun to read and makes a quick read as well. Sister Mary Helen is never boring."},{"Title":"Death Goes on Retreat","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books written by this author.

At first, the plot seems interesting and well conceived. However, as she starts jumping around historical periods, following the trace of the sheet with which the body of Christ was covered and on which the image of Christ miraculously appears, the plot goes astray. Too many characters, and very few of them are fully developed.She tries to cover too much in 500+ pages....Knights Templar, a couple of french kings, Constantinople....and so on. The book does not involve you in any way. Definitely not a page turner.....Not to ruin the book's ending, suffice it to say that one of the greatest misteries in history is resolved in an extremely simplistic manner.I originally bought the book because it is a great hit in libraries in Madrid, which is usually a decent indicator of how good a book is, but in this case, big dissapointment."},{"Title":"Hermandad De La Sabana Santa (Spanish Edition)","review":"Julia Navarro has style, investigates her subject well and offers a constant rhythm and an acrion packed plot throughout the book.

I would recommend this book to anybody. Spanish is my mother tongue and I enjoy reading in Spanish to keep my vocabulary and grammar. I loved this book!!"},{"Title":"Hermandad De La Sabana Santa (Spanish Edition)","review":"... it was a bit too long. Up until the last five chapters, Ms. Navarro was still introducing new (!!) characters -- and with names at that (the two other priests with Fr. Yves), not even anonymous bystanders like the woman who drives the mudo to the cementery.Ms. Navarro also included some details that can be off putting, like noting several times that Sofia liked to wear Armani suits. (Well, it might be interesting for some to know that Armani hardly uses red.) At least, she didn't write in a scene of Sofia shopping for Armani in Turin just before a police operation.I read the version in Spanish and there were minor printing errors (Ives instead of Yves, among others) which should be corrected in a later edition. I'm going to read the English translation to see how it compares.I don't mind the Templar connection that the author made. After all, the Holy Shroud dates back (supposedly) several centuries and it wouldn't be surprising if the Templars came in contact with it during their heyday. Julia Navarro gives a believable version of events related to the s&aacute;bana santa and she explains it clearly.I agree with the reviewer who noted that the explanation for the carbon 14 discrepancy was quite clever. Not bad for a first novel. I just started La biblia de barro, Navarro's second novel, but I'm afraid I see traces of S&aacute;bana santa in the novel - like the chapters alternating between past and present and a female character who bears a resemblance to the ill-fated Ana.A pesar de todo, merece la pena leer esta novela. Adem&aacute;s, he o&iacute;do que La sangre de los inocentes, la tercera novela de Navarro, es mejor que las dos anteriores.Dan Brown fans would do better to read the Spanish writers who've been writing historical fiction about religious enigmas years before Brown did. For one thing, the Spaniards seem to have a more matter-of-fact (and not hysterical) attitude about everyday Catholicism and they don't seem to want to tear to pieces the beliefs of their readers. In this novel, the mystery is at the center of everything, not the religion behind the mystery.

But one look at uchronia.net shows the depth of alternate history. But it can be challenging to reach back and find the gems that may have been buried by limited print runs, obscurity, or other reasons. If Israel Lost the War is one of those gems, and I'm glad I found it.The story is a simple one. It's a basic inversion of the Six-Day War in which Chesnoff posits a sudden, Pearl Harbor/Operation Focus-like strike by the Egyptian Air Force against the IAF. The attack is a success, and events flow logically from that point of departure. With their armies already massed on Israel's borders and complete air superiority now in hand, the Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian armies advance across Israel rapidly. The events flow logically, one from the other, and the scenes and characters are colored wonderfully.Instead of following one character throughout the story, we're given dozens of pages-long vignettes, scenes from every portion of the warring states and even places like Washington and New York, where the diplomatic traffic flows fast and freely. In some ways, the book reads like Sir John Hackett's The Third World War, but with much of the division-by-division detail of most of Hackett's book replaced by individual-level stories.The book was written by Chesnoff, an acclaimed journalist -- though he was not nearly so well known in 1969, when this book was published. And although the date is nearly 30 years in the past, the story isn't dated at all. Some of the historical information has been somewhat dated by modern historical revelations -- I disagree with the overwhelming success of the Syrian, Jordanian, and Egyptian Air Forces, even with a surprise attack, but because the story's goal is a simple inversion of the Six-Day War and I'm not sure what information Chesnoff had available, that's easily excusable.But where this story really shines are the scenes set after Israel's fall and occupation by the three invading countries. There are wonderful examples of the butterfly effect throughout, and though a contemporary reader might have been soured by the moral of the story -- defending Israel is key to the United States holding off the Soviet Union -- I'm certainly not, especially since that moral is as interesting as a historical relic as the story is in and of itself. Far too often, modern alternate history writers feel as if they have to have their stories end on a happy note: The good guys win, everyone goes home happy, and the world is made safe for democracy and apple pie. Even Turtledove's Timeline 191 series had a relatively upbeat ending, despite some pretty horrific wars. In this story, we're left with an untidy, downbeat -- though not nihilistic or dystopian -- ending. And it works extremely well.This is not a happy story, but it's certainly a fascinating one. And in a period of time that we're treated to an unending series of U.S.-centered alternate histories, it's nice to read a story that doesn't revolve around the United States and presents itself in a readable, fascinating package."},{"Title":"If Israel Lost the War","review":"Why would anyone be interested in a book with an ungrammatical title? \\"If Israel Lost the War\\" is New York pidgin, which has no subjunctive. It apparently means, \\"if Israel HAD lost the war\\" but then it wouldn't be New York pidgin. Is the entire book written in NYP? I'll never know, but I hope it's better than Chesnoff's \\"The Arrogance of the French,\\" which is one constant whine (pronounced wine in NYP) based on petty personal slights suffered by the author at the hands of \\"The French,\\" yet he continues to live there.

(Mike Bardon, Former Oneness Pentecostal) If you can relate in any way to this quote, regardless of which particular &quot;christian craziness&quot; you've repented from, this book is also for you! Mr.Adams once again presents an insightful view of the real state of today's &quot;professing&quot; church, and it's woeful lack of biblical discernment with regards to many of the unbiblical practices and teachings currently found within the &quot;Christian&quot; church. He clearly describes not only the problems and how they became so prevalent, but he also provides real solutions to those individuals who may ask &quot;what difference can I make?&quot; Geared towards those who honestly wish to be part of the solution rather than add to the problems, &quot;A Call to Discernment&quot; is a trumpet call which perhaps will only be heeded by the seeming minority - those folks who are dissatisfied with the current flavour of &quot;Experiential-Touchy-Feely-Don't-Think-Just-Receive&quot; Christianity. Many will be offended by this piece, but those who seek the truths of God Himself as revealed in His Word will be refreshed and almost relieved by Mr.Adams' book (Like Elijah, it's always good to know you're not alone!). It's a must read for anyone who has ever found themselves involved in beliefs and/or practices that originate way,way outside of scripture, and may be useful in the healing process if you've ever asked yourself the question &quot;How on earth could I have fallen for that one or strayed so far from Truth?&quot; This book is not just a call to be more Discerning, but gives practical relevant help on how to actually BE more discerning!"},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"A wonderfull Heyer read, in the tradition of Detection Unlimited, this rollicking mystery will keep you guessing wildly till the last page!

But I had no idea she also wrote contemporary mysteries. Contemporary, that is, when she wrote them in the 1930's. I love British mysteries from that period--art deco furniture and decorations, sleek, romantic clothes, and dialog chock-full of the idioms of the day.The \\"Him\\" of the title is Mr. Silas Kane, patriarch of the wealthy Kane family and senior partner in the firm of Kane and Mansell. The story opens at Silas's sixtieth birthday party, introducing us to the eccentric cast of characters and the story setup when Silas refuses to do business with an Australian firm his partner, Joe Mansell, champions.The next day, Silas is found dead, apparently having tumbled off a cliff on his nightly walk. An accident, surely. The firm, and the disagreement, passes to his nephew, Clement, who welcomes his uncle's fortune so that he can pamper his spoiled wife, Rosemary.Alas, Clement's riches last only a short time, because, in a matter of days, he is found shot to death in Silas's library. Murder is definitely in the picture now, and the local police summon a Scotland Yard superintendent to untangle the case.Who murdered Clement? Was Silas also murdered? Suspicion falls on everyone from Silas's starchy mother, Emily, to her self-contained companion, Patricia, to her grand-nephew, Jim, who is Patricia's fiancee and now the senior partner in the company. Other suspects include Trevor, Rosemary's oily would-be lover, the Mansells, father and slippery son, and even Oscar, the genial representative of the Australian firm. About the only person not suspected is Jim's half-brother, fifteen-year-old Timothy, who has overdosed on American gangster films and \\"helps\\" the police, thereby earning the nickname of \\"Terrible Timothy\\". (Hint, one of the suspects listed here is the murderer.)The story is fast-paced, funny, and I didn't figure out the murderer until Miss Heyer revealed the culprit at the end.All in all, a highly enjoyable read, and a book I couldn't put down. I look forward to reading Miss Heyer's other mysteries.ARC provided by Sourcebooks"},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"Silas Kane just turned sixty and everyone has gathered for the occasion. The party is not going so well as it is marred with arguments. When money is involved nothing can ever go well. Silas decides to go for a walk in the fog and the next morning he is found dead. Everyone thinks it was just a accident, that he slipped and fell of the cliff in the fog, but then someone shoots Clement, the hier.Now we can tell that this murder mystery is all about who will inherit, Silas Kane's money and who has the greatest motive to kill. Everyone is a suspect, Mrs. Kane didn't even shed a tear when she heard her husband was dead. Rosemary couldn't wait to move into the bigger house and get more money. Mr. Harte was always saying something about knowing that the night looked like a great time for a murder. Joe Mansell was mad because Silas wouldn't expand the firm like he and his partners wanted. Everyone has a motive for murder, but who is the real killer and why?Talk about your big whodunit, Georgette Heyer lays out a great murder mystery in her book They Found Him Dead. This one the first book I have ever read by this author and its a classic (1937) I wish I could say that I had some great authors to compare her too from these early era's but I am sorry to say I have not read as much of the classics as I would like too. Shame on me I know, but I have never even read a Agatha Christy novel, but I am sure Georgette Heyer would rank up there with her in great murder mystery authors.It was a little hard for me to read about times, but most classics are if you are not use to them. Books from different time era's just read different. That doesn't mean that she couldn't deliver a great book. I always thought I might have guessed who had done it, but I was a bit surprised at the ending.The characters reminded me a bit of reading a Austen novel, the were funny and witty and loathed each other. It is always fun to read about rich families and how much they pretend to love each other as long as they get the money. Though sometimes the dialogue was hard for me to follow, it was fun and brough the characters to life.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of whodunits."},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"They Found Him Dead by Georgette Heyer is a delightful little read with an equally delightful cover. I can't say that I judge a book by its cover but I really like these cute little mysteries and their covers. The cast of characters in this mystery are a great mix. You have the two deaths at the beginning of the story Silas Kane and his cousin Clement Kane. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else and everyone comes under suspicion. Clement Kane's wife Rosemary is spending her husbands money like it is going out of style. Emma Kane is the crotchety old matriarch of the Kane family and really not liked by anyone so she is numero uno suspect. Stepbrothers Jim Kane, who is the next heir and \\"young Mr. Harte\\" Timmy are suspects also. Sir Adrian Harte who is the father to Timmy and stepfather to Jim is another quaint character. Lady Harte (the mother) is somewhere in the Congo but does show up eventually. Timmy insinuates himself into the investigation with his own theories and has his own mishap with a sinking boat that also makes him suspicious.So Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant Hemingway(characters in other Heyer mysteries) have their work cut out for them in investigating the deaths.. Miss Patricia Allison, assistant to Emma, is engaged to Jim Kane and they also have a mishap with a car so it almost looks like Jim could be next on the murderers list. Mixed in with the suspects are Silas and Clement Kane's business partners, Joe and his son Paul Mansell along with Oscar Roberts who have a scheme to what they call \\"the Australian deal\\". The Kanes, deceased, did not really like the deal that Oscar had and did not want to participate. So with this colorful cast of characters this story is a who dunnit that keeps you hooked to the end to find out who the killer is. There are other minor characters, the maid, butler and some nosy neighbors. All this comes together nicely so that I was surprised at the end as to who the murderer actually was. No the butler didn't do it..It is refreshing to read books that are entertaining and suspenseful and witty. I liked this book so much I have three more mysteries to read. If you want a light fun read, this is it. I highly recommend it...I did not get paid for this review"},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"I enjoy all her mysteries (mostly stories of cases handled by Scotland Yard inspectors) are wonderful entertainment to young and old.

And the mysteries are clever and not easy to figure out. I heartily recommend them."},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"They Found Him Dead is a mystery in the tradition of the cozy English country house whodunits, and I loved it. A birthday party is held for Silas Kane at his country home, Cliff House and a whole cast of quirky English characters attend, including his mother, business partners, young cousin, and the cousin's half brother, a rambunctious teen who loves exploring and is into everyone's business. When Silas does not come down for breakfast the next morning, family and staff look for him and he is found dead at the foot of the cliff, apparently falling during his pre-bedtime walk.The inquest declares it an accident, but young Timothy Harte is convinced it was murder, and it looks like he may be correct when Silas's heir is shot dead at his desk. The local constabulary calls in Scotland Yard, and with Timothy in the middle of their investigation, they still manage to gather information and come up with several suspects. The investigation takes a fresh direction when it appears that attempts are being made on the life of Jim, the second heir!I enjoyed all of the quirky characters, the ladies' maid who is overly loyal to her mistress, the no-nonsense young housekeeper, the smarmy business partner who likes to make moves on the ladies, the demanding and crotchety grande dame, and all the others. Each character description is precise, right down to their clothes and hobbies, making them vivid and easy to remember when try to figure out who is committing these murders. Definitely try They Found Him Dead or one of the other Georgette Heyer mysteries that have been re-released by Sourcebooks. They are all very reasonably priced and in paperback.[...]"},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"\\"They Found Him Dead\\" is a mystery set in the 1930s in England. I think this is my favorite of the Heyer mysteries that I've read so far. The characters were nicer and less, um, neurotic, than normal, so I actually liked them rather than simply finding them interesting or amusing. The humor in this book was provided by Timothy's youthful ideas and antics regarding the murder. I found all of the characters complex and engaging.As usual, Heyer introduced a large number of characters at the very beginning, many of whom had non-typical connections to each other. This made for a somewhat slow start as I tried to figure out all the \\"who is who,\\" but the pacing picked up and was excellent after that.The mystery was very clever. I did guess correctly who-did-it and why about halfway through, but only because I've read way too many mysteries. And I still thoroughly enjoyed discovering if each new clue supported my theory or not. One thing that I thought particularly clever was that Heyer had her Inspector go through all the possible culprits the same way the reader is so it's not simply a matter of picking the one suspect that no one is looking at closely.There was very minimal bad language and no sex. Overall, I'd highly recommend this mystery as well-written and entertaining clean reading.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher.Reviewed by Debbie from Genre Reviews(genrereviews. blogspot. com)"},{"Title":"They found him dead (Panther books-no.1188)","review":"I love Inspector Hannasyde!

This ever-popular strategy never fails, and you can be sure that plenty of Europeans will praise you, and perhaps even give you the Prix Goncourt.Monsieur Romain Gary's book was first published as a short story in 1970 in Life Magazine, perhaps the most popular magazine in the USA at that time. The editors of Life had reason to regret the publicity that they gave Monsieur Gary, because his story was later enlarged into a book called White Dog. This book was widely loved in Europe because it ferociously denounced American racism, hypocrisy, and violence. The entire point of the book seems to be that Europeans are immune to the virus of racism because of their superior civilization and culture (kultur?). The recent collapse of Germany into the abyss of the Holocaust, not to mention the undeniable facts of French collaboration and cooperation with Hitler's genocidal extermination programs, are conveniently overlooked as Gary excoriates the USA for every possible racist fault and crime.Less than a decade before Monsieur Gary penned this toxic book, President Dwight Eisenhower sent US Army tanks into the street of Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce the desegregation of public schools in the United States. What was France doing at that time? France had just lost a prolonged and highly racist guerilla war and was forced to abandon the smoldering remains of its decaying empire in Black North Africa. During this so-called Algerian War, France institutionalized torture chambers and mass murder on a very large scale. But for Monsieur Gary (actually a Polish refugee who became hyper-French in his attitudes and enthusiasms) La Belle France could do no wrong. And thus he tried, perhaps unconsciously, to whitewash the racism of France by denouncing the racism of the United States.All that was in 1970. Now let's fast forward to today, only 40 years after the publication of this fascinating piece of anti-USA propaganda. What's happening in the hypocritical, racist USA? We have a Black president! And what's happening in France? Anti-Black attitudes are growing at an appalling rate due to millions of new immigrants who happen to have Black skins. In actual fact it would appear that the situation vis a vis race relations has been turned upside down, with La Belle France as the new storm center of racist beliefs and actions in the Western world.What would Monsieur Gary think about this great change? Perhaps he saw it coming, because he chose to turn in his ticket, as the Russian novelists would say, several decades ago. Maybe he finally comprehended the truth about his beloved France, and the shock was too much for him to bear. There was a gun, and a note.Am I telling you that White Dog is a totally useless book, a moldy historical relic with no relevance to today's world? Not at all, mes amis! IMHO this book is required reading for anyone who plans to travel to France. It will give you a very accurate idea of what the French still think of the United States, and inevitably of you. They are very happy to grab your tourist dollars, but behind your back, you will always be that dirty, noisy, stupid, racist American. If you don't believe me, just go there and see for yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Hilarious Roasts, Toasts & One-Liners: The Ultimate Source for Speeches, Toasts, Parties or Anytime For Pure Fun","review":"Even though there are plenty of books on jokes,oneliners,etc,I think that this one has more to offer.Suitable for all types of speeches."},{"Title":"Hilarious Roasts, Toasts & One-Liners: The Ultimate Source for Speeches, Toasts, Parties or Anytime For Pure Fun","review":"This is quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Defoe (EL-E-PHANT Books)","review":"Whether or not you will &quot;like&quot; this book is really quite irrelevant ... if pick it up, make no sense of it, and put it down in disgust then you have missed the point. This &quot;novel&quot; is an experiment in what literature of the future might look like, how far we can get from narrative and still &quot;mean&quot; something to a reader, and so on.Read this book if you are turned on by surrealist literature (like stuff published by Atlas Press), John Ashbery's poetry, the films of Stan Brakhage and Ernie Gehr, or Derrida's epistolary novel &quot;The Post Card.&quot; The Brakhage connection is particularly apt here -- his films are often viewed with incomprehension themselves, but their influence has subtly permeated our culture by impacting the vision of many filmmakers. You can't look at TV for ten minutes these days without seeing Brakhage's influence in a commercial or TV program.

It's not perfect by any means, but understanding it can improve the game of nearly any player of intermediate or better strength. (Rubber bridge players can get by without it, though advanced players ought not; matchpoint duplicate players can't survive without it.) Larry Cohen's first book on the subject, To Bid or Not To Bid, is a fabulously valuable explication of the principle.Unfortunately, the Law is fairly simple and can be presented, as it is, in one not-lengthy book. Why is that unfortunate? Because Cohen didn't stop at one. The sequel, Following the Law, wasn't necessary, and it doesn't even manage to be valuable. Well over half the book is presentations of deals on which the Law was applied, or could have been. Golly, ya think it worked in those cases? Little is gained from these examples, and they serve only to justify a book that otherwise could have run around thirty pages.Cohen also includes some tips on adjustments, but there's far too little of this, the most difficult aspect of applying the Law for most players. He also discusses the DONT convention in detail, but there are better explications elsewhere. The rest is little more than a rehash of what was clearly stated before.If you haven't read the first book, do so. If you have, skip this one."},{"Title":"Following the Law: The Total Tricks Sequel","review":"If you have read Cohen's first total tricks effort, understood it, and incorporated the principles of the Law of Total Tricks into your competitive bidding, you do not need this book. If the Law of Total Tricks does not inform your competitive bidding decisions, buy this book or the original. The second effort has a cleaner presentation including a thorough description of the wonderful DONT convention for competing over natural adverse notrump bids. If you take your bidding seriously, you owe yourself a solid understanding of Cohen's total tricks principles."},{"Title":"Following the Law: The Total Tricks Sequel","review":"Though I have read the book 'To Bid or not to bid', I have found that I often count it wrongly. This book tells me how to use it a real situation. It is very helpful."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"Touring the Universe Through Binoculars remains the single most authoritative source for people who want to view the night sky with binoculars. Sure, there are other books on the subject, but Touring the Universe stands apart for its thorough survey of the binocular sky. This book lists objects that the other books miss entirely (and that the authors probably don't even know exist!).But readers should keep in mind that Touring the Universe is really aimed more toward seasoned amateur astronomers. Those new to astronomy may find some of the discussion a little beyond them, at least at this point. But you will certainly grow into the book if you stick with the hobby. And thanks to the flowing words from the author, that's an enjoyable task.Readers should also be aware that the book does not have any star charts. That means you will need to get either a star atlas like Sky Atlas 2000 or the author's companion CD-ROM (which Amazon does not offer, but Sky Publishing and Orion Telescope Center do). It's great software even without the book!"},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"This book covers +1000 deep sky objects plus solar system objects for binoculars. It includes many faint objects that can be seen with ordinary binos under very favourable conditions so the observers with large binoculars can use this book better. Although there are +1000 objects given in the book, most of them are not explained but rather their basic data like coordinates and magnitude are given. It does not have maps so you need an atlas with this book. However; this book is very useful with its tabulated data and constellation-based organisation. You cannot find any other complete and well prepared list and data of objects visible in binoculars. The author also groups Messier objects into 4 difficulty groups which is helpful for inexperienced observers."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"Anyone interested in binocular astronomy should consider this book (and Binocular Astronomy by Crossen and Tirion too). The book is available through Amazon with a good discount (20%), but even so, it still costs $28 plus shipping. For a paperback book that's not cheap.Harrington's book has a good section on the moon, the planets and the sun but the meat of the book is a blast of information on literally a thousand sky objects to see. Organizationally, the information is broken down alphabetically by constellation, with a table listing the objects and key information about them (Type, Right Ascension, Declination, Magnitude, etc.). I would have liked to have had distance too. Following each table was a brief (maybe too brief) description of each object. For list-oriented people this works well. I was inspired enough to enter them into an Access database, which was much more work than I thought it would be, and I'm not sure how useful it will turn out to be. The sheer magnitude of the list is what sets this book apart. I look at binocular astronomy as a lifelong pursuit but looking at the length of the list makes me think I'd better get started quickly. I'm running out of time!In short, Harrington's book is a solid wealth of information but it doesn't have the same warm and fuzzy feeling of Crossen's Binocular Astronomy. It's more like a cookbook. However, if you're really interested in binocular astronomy, you'll probably want both books. If you only get one, get Crossen's book (see my review of that book too)."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"I have used this book since it first came out almost ten years ago, and have always found it a big help when planning an observing session with my binoculars. It talks about sky objects that are ignored by just about every other book out there, but that are *easily* visible through binoculars! Guess none of the other binoculars books bothered to really research the topic.But now, the book has gotten even better with the new Touring the Universe Through Binoculars Atlas CD-ROM. A great value for the price too! I first looked for it on Amazon.com, but I guess they don't sell it. (hey, Amazon! hint hint). I ended up buying it right through Harrington's home page. Together, the book and CD are the most complete survey of the binocular sky ever created! My advice is to buy the book here and get the CD separately. If you like binocular observing as much as I do, they make a great team."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"I never realized just how much there is to see in the sky with binoculars until I read this book! With it, my binoculars, and a star atlas, I've been able to see sights in the sky that most of the people in my astronomy club don't even know exist! For instance, I never knew that the stars in Orion's belt belong to a big open cluster. No other observing book ever mentioned it, except for this one. And that's just the beginning. The book lists over 1,000 deep-sky objects for binoculars, covering the entire sky with a depth unmatched in any other binocular book. It also describes over 100 surface features on the Moon, plus gives advice on viewing the planets, comets, and even binocular meteor showers! I highly recommend Touring the Universe Through Binoculars!"},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"The first problem with this book is that for the urban or suburban observer with less than giant binoculars, it is too hard to find objects that you will really have any luck with. You have to sort through long lists of 9th-magnitude star clusters to find anything that would really be visible. The second problem is that a large percentage of the objects listed are pretty dim and crummy open clusters, and in most cases it is extremely hard to tell whether you are seeing the cluster or not. The photos are no help, because they are all long photographic exposures taken through telescopes, nothing like what you actually see through binox."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment after hearing all the glowing reviews. After wading through 6 chapters with terrible photo reproductions of telescopic (not binocular) views, where many sky objects are described as not suitable for binoculars, we arrive a chapter 7 which is the reference list of binocular objects. This consumes half the book and is a complete reference list ordered by constellation with a paragraph description of most. But you will need another reference to find them since there are no maps here.The book is 15 years old and shows it. The author's comments about roof prism binoculars are dated and of course no discussion of image stabilized binoculars. Surprised not to even see discussions of the different ways to hand hold binoculars with illustrations.It excels as a reference list of binocular objects but is not the type of book to excite the interest of those not already so inclined."},{"Title":"Touring the Universe through Binoculars: A Complete Astronomer's Guidebook (Wiley Science Editions)","review":"The book gave great text descriptions but I think it needed more illustrations and/or photographs showing what a beginning astronomer can expect to see while using binoculars.

Harrington, and this one is the worst among the three.This book has no maps (star chart) so the novices don't know where to locate the objects, there's no sketch of DSO in binoculars view so the novices don't know what to expect to see in binoculars view, the photos are black and white, this book also enlist unnecessary DSO of his personal list (Harrington's), and this book discuss very little about making choice of binoculars, unlike the other two.And I believe that some statements on this book are flaw. For example, it is stated on this book: \\"Both 7x35 and 7x50 binoculars offer up to a 10 to 12 field (page 44-45)\\" As far as I know, the widest field of 7x50 binos are 7 degree, not 10 degree.\\"M57 (NGC 6720), the Ring Nebula, visible in binoculars?

I swallowed Dr. Harrison's story whole, but it took me no time at all to realize that her experiences did not jibe with mine or with any of my female classmates, nor with those of my colleagues as I've worked around the country. Yet this book will not die, and is referenced all the time by people who wish to critique the healthcare of women as it is delivered in the United States.Michelle Harrison was a single mom returning to her medical education as a part-time resident. She had many personal difficulties centering around child care and her own lack of social support and left her residency after a mere 202 days. The normal residency is four years of full-time work. She was clearly very unhappy during this time.However, the hospital world she describes was unrecognizable to me. My education was peopled by men and women who were passionate about women's rights and safe care across all levels of the system; she describes a bunch of villains who got kicks out of attacking women with surgical instruments in the OR. To be charitable, we could assume that hers was a bad program with some bad eggs, or that things had changed radically during the few years between her training, and mine, but I think the reality is that this was a very unhappy woman, very unsuited in temperament for a surgical specialty, who made the right choice when she quit."},{"Title":"A Woman in residence","review":"This is the first book I read on my journey into the complex and highly specialized world of medicine.

Think of the book as a family album for all of humanity, by capturing all of the wonderful and touching moments (including the sad ones) that make us all part of the human family. As such, the book reinforces love over prejudice related to surface differences, and a human focus over a political one. Some will be disturbed by the images of women nursing, and others will find the messages to be a little too political. All will enjoy the great photography.The book's images include black-and-white and color photographs of pregnancy, birth, nursing, child care, smiles, twins, wonder, dads, carrying, hugging, hanging out, music, beaches, saying goodbye, kisses, marriage, dancing, festivals, conversations, love, grandparents, the aged, eating ice cream together, walking, and intergenerational connections. These themes are sometimes formally built up, and sometimes just carried on for two images or three.Perhaps the most stunning two photographs are of Kim Phuc. She was the little girl in the famous 1972 photograph of napalm's horror. The other shot is of her holding her baby, Thomas, while revealing some of her napalm scars on her shoulder and back. She had never expected to marry and be a mother. Her happiness in motherhood is bound to bring tears to your eyes.The book's captions are interesting. Before the frontispiece, they are just one word per image. In the rest of the book, you get one quote per image to help put the visual message in perspective. You can either read these or not. The book works well either way.The opening essay will seem overly political to some. If it doesn't agree with your views, just skip it and go on to the photographs.The essay has a number of key sentences that capture the book's overall feel. &quot;These images speak to all of us with clarity, universality and . . . joy.&quot; &quot;Family is the last and greatest discovery. It is our last miracle.&quot; You are encouraged to see this as a &quot;family album.&quot; As you look at the images, you should &quot;hear the sounds of hearts beating all across the world.&quot; &quot;We have hope.&quot; &quot;That kind of love, family love, makes us powerful beyond measure.&quot; &quot;May your love, like these pictures, last forever.&quot;The project itself (Moments of Intimacy, Laughter, and Kinship -- MILK for short) is worthy of comment. The organization ran a global competition to select these images. 17,000 photographers provided 40,000 images. From those, 100 photographers are represented here. I think this is a good model for how more photography and art books should be done. Obviously, you have to have a great screening committee and editor, but we should more often try to create the combined best of all people. Don't you agree?As a result of the competition and fine editing, the works are truly wonderful in their emotional appeal, compositions, and diversity of themes and styles. No single photographer could ever have hoped to capture all of this.If you like the book, I suggest that you give it as a wedding gift to those you know who would enjoy it. I can think of no better time to reintroduce the concept of family.After you enjoy the book, may I suggest that take some time in the month ahead to experience the most meaningful images in the book that you have not done lately? When was the last time you held a newborn? . . . sat on a park bench eating ice cream with an aged relative? . . . carried a sick person?Let the beauty of the experiences flow into you!"},{"Title":"Family: A Celebration of Humanity (M.I.L.K.)","review":"This is one of the most inspirational coffee table books I have seen in a long time. It's beautiful pictures of young and old alike are accompanied by lovely and fresh inspirational quotes. After I got my first copy, I bought four more for presents. It truly does celebrate the miracle of life, death, and love in the funky units we call family. A great gift for your immediate family or the friends you call family. Enjoy!

My applause to the people responsible for putting together such a wonderful book. I especially appreciate the acknowledgements in the back which were vitally important to identifying the photographs."},{"Title":"Family: A Celebration of Humanity (M.I.L.K.)","review":"I was in Auckland, New Zealand at the end of my Christmas vacation, and walked into the M.I.L.K. exhibit by the harbour. The exhibit moved me like I had never been moved before. It made me laugh, cry, and brought a great end to my trip. Best yet, the books contain more shots than the exhibit did. The only problem with the book compared to the exhibit is that the explanation of the photographs are at the end of the book and not on the pages so one must flip back and forth a lot (the stories behind all of the pictures are half of the experience). I highly recommend the entire series- very well worth the money."},{"Title":"Family: A Celebration of Humanity (M.I.L.K.)","review":"While this book had the potential to be a real stunner, sadlyit falls short. First of all, the book jacket and 5 largepages of written comments are practically illegible becausethey are printed in silver ink. Very difficult to read.Why evenbother? Secondly, there are several fold out pages which are irrelevant, more gimmicky except for one vellum page imprinted with the profile of a child, which presents a lovely soft-looking image and then the more intense image.Third,the photographs at the start of the book are just blatantly there...upon investigation, again with tiny print in silver, one gathers they are there to introduce the various topics of m.i.l.k.But their placement there does nothing to whet one's appetite. It seems redundant to see the same photo,later in the chapter in which it belongs.Fourth, the print size of the photographer's name next to thephoto is too miniscule. Again, difficult to read. Fifth, while the poetry and quotes are okay, I think it would have been more appropriate near each picture to have the information about the photographer instead.After all, the photographers responsible for the images comefrom all over the world, and what better international groupto help express &quot;family&quot;? Also, it would help give a clue as towhere the photo was taken. Instead, the information about eachphotographer is relegated to the back of the book, and again,is small and very difficult to read.Additionally, I think the &quot;Milk Collection&quot; standing formoments, intimacy, laughter, and kinship is too confusingbecause of the current Milk Advertising Campaign When I firstheard of this book, I thought it was affiliated with the milkads.The opening photo of new infant born still umbilically attachedis frightful. This photo works much better showing thecontext of the 2 surgically attired attendants.Redeeming this book are perhaps about ten really powerful,special photographs, but the overall design of the book doesnot enhance the images, it sorrowfully detracts from the flowand impact of those few very wonderful images."},{"Title":"Ziegfeld Girl: Image and Icon in Culture and Cinema","review":"I read this about a year ago... well, read most of it, and emailed the author asking for explanations about where she'd come up with certain 'facts' about the Ziegfeld Follies and Ziegfeld Girls. I never heard back. It was apparent to me that many things she wrote were simply lifted from other erroneous Ziegfeld accounts previously published. The author included only what would suit her premise.The author apparently knows little if anything about Ziegfeld and his \\"Girls\\" or his shows. And like the other reviewer said here, this book is beyond boring.There are many good books out there on Ziegfeld. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"Title":"Ziegfeld Girl: Image and Icon in Culture and Cinema","review":"This incredibly boring and technical book deliberately skips any possible entertainment value (No kidding - she sneers at other Ziegfeld books and movies in her preface) to focus exclusively on feminist revisionism. Instead of telling us anything personal about the showgirls, headliners or Ziegfeld himself, the whole book is viewed through a psychoanalysizing lens that echoes that familiar boogeyman story, \\"How The Big Bad White Man Hates You\\". Every musical act is sexually sinister, every costume a deliberate put-down, and only SHE can decode what they all REALLY meant. For example: There is a picture of Anna Held donning a costume where a black mannequin is affixed to her waist, making it appear that her servant is carrying Anna around in a basket on her back. You've probably seen variations of this costume every Halloween but I'll bet you never saw any sexual meaning behind it, did you? Well, the author does. She writes extensively about the significance of the mannequin being attatched to Anna's waist, giving it an imaginary sexual significance that granted Anna the alleged animal-like sexual appetite of the *lower* class black person while keeping her face attractive, clean and white for the paying audience. Oh yeah, OBVIOUSLY. Sort of puts those Gorilla-holding-a-man-in-a-cage costumes you've seen in a different light now, doesn't it? But REALLY now, could she have had the mannequin sprouting from her neck? Or her back? As Freud reportedly once said, \\"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\\" A lot of the book is like this. A LOT OF IT.The author reads WAY too much into this stuff, and while I'm sure some of it has a basis in fact, the rest is opinion and revisionism on a grand scale. It's the polar opposite of equally annoying books that breathlessly claim Ziegfeld's follies to be the apex of beauty and humanity, and that we've all gone to hell in a handbasket since. The real story lies somewhere in the middle. Remember that if you read this book."},{"Title":"The Most Wanted Bachelor","review":"In 1887 Denver, Kathryn Jordan believes she needs to marry a wealthy man to save her family from poverty. She chooses the enigmatic Daniel Hall as her future spouse because his father destroyed her father, leaving Kathryn, her sister, and their mother in these dire circumstances.Many poor people and reporters anticipate Daniel's arrival in town. While waiting for Daniel to come, a journalist interviews Kathryn and mentions that the next day Daniel is leaving town for Minnesota by stage. Kathryn enters the stagecoach with the intention of gaining Daniel's interest. The reporter is on the stage, but Daniel is not there. Outlaws hold up the stage stranding the reporter who is actually Daniel and Kathryn. They walk to a nearby town to await the next stage, but instead fall in love, make love, and marry. However, she knows his true identity and is worrying what will happen her to their relationship once he learns the truth.RWA Golden Heart award winner Susan K. Law writes an entertaining western romance starring a brave but poor heroine and a troubled but wealthy hero. The story line is fast-paced and picturesquely describes late nineteenth century Colorado. Kathryn and Daniel are a wonderful duo whose relationship shakily rests on top of a weak foundation. The support cast provides depth to the plot and motivation to the lead protagonists. When it comes to excellence in Americana romances, Ms. Law remains a law onto herself.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Most Wanted Bachelor","review":"This book is a good one from Susan, but as a new reader of her books it would have been helpful to know that most of her books intertwine. Read this book second, as &quot;Home Fires&quot; is when we first meet Daniel as a boy with his step mom and this book is him as an adult. I read &quot;One Lonely Night&quot; first then &quot;Most Wanted Bachelor&quot; followed by &quot;Home Fires&quot; and I wish I had read them in order. The trilogy is wonderful and I really like Susan's books. This book is wonderfully written and really rings true. It is an age old story of what some women will do for her family, even marry a rich man so that her family will no longer suffer from poverty. Kathryn goes after Daniel for all the wrong reasons, money and revenge for her dad, but does fall in love with him. I must say, Kathryn is a great character, she knew what she wanted and knew what she had to do to get it! It is the age old story of a woman using her &quot;gifts&quot; to snag a man. More power to her. I can't wait till another book comes out. I recommend this book to her fans..but do yourself a favor and read &quot;Home Fires&quot; before this book. The trilogy comes together nicely and you want to read all three in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Most Wanted Bachelor","review":"Daniel and Kathryn really come to life in this story about a woman who plans to marry for money without telling her future husband that it's his cash she's after and not him. Daniel finds out too late that the &quot;one woman in the world who doesn't even know he's a millionaire&quot; is, in fact, a gold-digger. Of course, since this is Susan Kay Lw, there's a whole lot mor going on in both these characters than originally meets the eye. In my opinion, Ms Law is the best Americana writer today.

He went on to design amazing and incredibly improbable creations, including the mind-boggling Babelfish, worn inside the ear of galactic hitchhikers.

Led by his friend Ford Perfect, Arthur Dent travels the galaxy, meeting many people and creatures along the way. The book is dripping with situational humor like the Earth being destroyed 5 seconds before the secret of life is to be found, as well as the often unintended sarcastic remarks from Ford Perfect, who is sent through the galaxy to revise the electronic book Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. Although somewhat confusing at times, the creative imagination and description helps the reader actually envision intergalactic travel. Arthur and Ford are led through much of their adventure by The Intergalactic President Zaphod Beetlebrox on the spaceship \\"Heart of Gold&quot;. Zaphod is a creature with two heads and three arms, he was later described to have gained the third arm to improve his ski-boxing. This is another example of Adams' imagination and creativity. A humorous portion of the book comes when a computer says the calculated meaning of life is 42, which offers no more of an answer than anyone else's theory of the meaning of life. Along with humor, Adams uses satire to mock things like society and government. He states the Zaphod's duties as president are to take the attention away from the governments actual power. Zaphod achieves these goals by spending the first two years of his ten year term in trouble with the law. If satirical and sarcastic humor mixed with sci-fi entertainment sound appealing, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy has exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.

Remember Arthur and Ford being thrown out of the Vogon ship and worring about asphyxiation?

This is why our astronauts even bother to wear SPACESUITS in stead of just oxygen masks."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams's 1979 adaptation of his popular BBC radio drama spawned a cult following that persisted through four sequels, a TV series, and a movie and continues to thrive eight years after his death. The sometimes witty, often satirical, and always humorous quasi-science-fiction/fantasy story about a young man traveling the galaxy on an involuntary quest for the meaning of existence has managed to survive and remain startlingly current through an entire generation of changes in technology and literary trends.Arthur Dent doesn't have a lot on his mind other than surviving his hangover when he wakes up one morning to find that his house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a bypass. His objections are met with sympathetic indifference by the crew chief until he lies down in the mud in front of the offending bulldozer. What he doesn't realize is that the earth itself has been slated for destruction by the evil Vogons as part of the development of a hyperspatial express route. Moments before the earth disintegrates, Arthur and his secretly alien friend Ford Prefect escape by hitching a ride on one of the Vogon ships, and their journey begins.As Arthur and Ford and the improbable gang of galactic characters they join up with travel from system to system in search of the mythical planet Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer, they are guided by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an e-book that offers such insightful wisdom as \\"Don't panic\\" and contains articles on subjects such as the importance of towels as well as helpful information about various planets and species. Along the way, Adams hilariously lambasts everything from religion to art to politics to human nature.The story, while mildly entertaining, is not what makes the book work. Rather, Adam's sardonic narration and ultra-dry humor are what make it worth reading. Virtually every page contains at least one description or parodic exposition that makes you want to either laugh out loud or groan.Since the book doesn't have a message or even much of a plot, it might be hard for some to find a reason to read it. But those who enjoy British humor (think Monty Python) or want to see how the destruction of the earth can be so funny may well enjoy it. The good news is, if you really like it, there are four sequels, so you could potentially be laughing for a long time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've always thought of Monty Python as the Thinking Man's SNL. I now think of Douglas Adams as the seriously Thinking Man's Monty Python. The subjects it tackles are those of time and space. The jokes it makes are humorous, drawing snickers and belly laughs from the readers. The points it makes can even be thought provoking at times. The story is this. Arthur Dent is saved at the last minute from the destruction of the world by his friend Ford Prefect. Ford is not actually from the planet earth. He is an alien from a planet in Betelguese who is writing a revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For technical reasons he has been stranded on earth for 15 years. They hitch a ride on a spaceship and their adventure takes off from there. I won't tell you the whole thing, I'd ruin some of the greatest jokes. I'll just tell you to read it. If you're interested in &quot;Destruction of the World&quot; stories, do yourself a favor and don't read &quot;Left Behind&quot;.

This isn't science fiction. It's social satire. And I'm afraid the satire has dated rather badly. Since Margaret Thatcher was ousted, putting the boot into the class gaffes of the newly trendy seems pointless. I no longer find it funny to joke about how seriously one takes going out to lunch (which, in the roaring eighties, WAS kinda funny, especially at the hands of skilled actors like those who did the radio shows). Adams writes very droll modern dialogue, but putting it in a book kinda takes away the punch. Adams was once script editor for Dr. Who, and I think HHGTTG harkens back to his luvvie days at the Beeb.For social satire that plays with the conventions of science fiction, get Harry Harrison's &quot;Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers&quot;.

I thought it was engaging, hilarious, profound, etc. That's how I remembered it. I decided to give it a shot again, so I bought this nice, trim, hardcover edition from Amazon. I was sad to find that it just has not stood the test of time -- which is ironic for a book that plays fairly fast and loose with the concept of time. The humor may have worked back in a day when just about anything Python-esque was considered cutting edge. But unlike, say, Monte Python's Life of Brian -- which HAS stood the test of time and then some -- the Hitchhiker's Guide is, today, about as engaging, funny and/or profound as Jabberwocky. As with that lackluster Terry Gilliam flick, The Guide develops a compelling premise for cultural satire and philosophizing but, alas, bogs down in its over-reliance on a now-dated notion of what constitutes drollery. I know this evaluation amounts to sacrilege for HHGG's true believers, but the truth of my judgment can be demonstrated empirically.On the other hand, kudos to Adams for anticipating the iPad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't need to tell you that this book is amazing so I will leave it at that (if you don't agree, you probably take life too seriously).What you need to know is that this version, for the Kindle, does not honor the content.

There was no thought put into the cover design (the image that Amazon posts for it on the Amazon.com is NOT the same that is delivered inline with the text, only the cover art) and the table of contents is a travesty.

The author has a distinctive ironic style that you'll either enjoy be annoyed by. This is a funny book, using the characters, common modern man and the elites to humorous effects.

It's hard to write a heartwarming and hilarious book that begins with almost total apocalypse. But Adams pulls it off flawlessly.More than anything else, I think the Hitchhikers Guide is all about the absurdities of everyday life. All these things we take for granted, like mice and potted plants and fancy dress parties. What if they weren't normal at all? And what if they had more significance than we ever could imagine? Those are the sorts of questions Adams is asking.Arthur, Trillian, and Zaphod run into some interesting things as they try to determine the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, but it wasn't what they were expecting. Read this book, you might discover something unexpected as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My dad had me read this when I was twelve. By the time I was thirteen, I had read the entire series (some more than once). Space travel has always been looked at as either an abduction or a mission. Never before has somebody gone at the last minute out of necessity. And then his adventures! This guy can't stay out of trouble even when he's already in it! If you like comedy and space travel, this is the perfect book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"You simply must read this book! It is filled from cover to cover with incredible language and humor. You will not read a paragraph that does not spark loud and uproarious laughter from within you... If this book does not, you must be dead."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'll make this short and to the point. &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; and &quot;Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; are the funniest novels ever written. The two together would make one incredible book. It seems like the story really ends at the end of &quot;Restaurant&quot; and after that the series starts getting a bit worse, so at least read the first two. If you like this type of humor you'll probably also like the funniest nonfiction books ever written too -- Woody Allen's 3 books. These 2 by Adams and the 3 by Allen make the 5 funniest books in the world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is non-stop laughs from beginning to end.

Very highly recommended to any reader with a vivid imagination."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was hilarious, and surprisingly deep for its small size. For those looking for an answer to the Great Question, the answer is given to you in this book. Funny that a satirical science-fiction novel has a hidden message!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sit down and hold on to your seats of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. This book is a satirical look at the way that governments work. The entire story is overflowing with British comedy. Most people in American society today do not understand the paticulars of that kind of humor. For some reason they do not find it funny. Hitchhiker's Guide is true to its British creator. The concept of the book was even funny, since it came to Adams while he was lying drunk in a field. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is intended to be a sci-fi, what with the aliens on Earth (well before it is destroyed in order to put in a pointless hyperspatial express route). The main characters are Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Trillian. Some of these &quot;people&quot; are very odd. Such as Zaphod, who is portrayed as completely insane. Ford is a dry character, put in for comic relief. Arthur is the stereotypical human, who is completely clueless in the ways of space. Trillian is also human, but she actually has a working brain. Adams manipulates words and characters to fit into his perfect little universe. He twists logic so that it is beyond recogntion. But that's what works for him. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a woderfully satiric story that is worthy of the short time it takes to read the 143 pages of the book. Remember to have your towel with you, just in case the Earth is destroyed along the way and you are force to live the rest of your life in space, hitchhiking."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Superb and impeccable!

Nevertheless, this is certainly a good read!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams has a unique writing style that can make the most ordinary of things funny.

Mr. Adams caught the true essence of good story telling, which made it a very quick and enjoyable read. I would love to hear copies of the radio show some day.My favorite mental picture from TH2G2 is that bureaucracy is just as screwed up in the whole of the universe as it is on planet Earth. I thoroughly enjoyed the description of Arthur Dent protesting the demolition of his house while Mr. Possner, the local bureaucrat, stood and thought, \\"Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent, and he hoped to God it wasn't him.\\" To then read about supposed higher life forms making the same errors, having the same inferiority complexes, and looking for the same easy exits out of the day-to-day hum-drum of earning a living is classic.Enjoy. Good story telling can be fun, which is what this book provides."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever produced. It should be required reading for all high school students as an example of British literature. Maybe I exaggerate but after 30 years it doesn't feel the least bit dated. I am dead serious when I say that Douglas Adams's Hitchhikers quadrilogy is to sci-fi humor what Tolkien is to fantasy.I can remember reading this book as a teenager and wishing I had my own Hitchhikers Guide. In a certain sense Douglas Adams was a visionary in that the Hitchhikers Guide is essentially a laptop and Wikipedia. Slap the words \`Don't Panic' on the case and you have a terrestrial version. The one complaint I've heard about the series is that there is no real plot which probably stems from the fact that it was originally written as a series of radio programs. It plays out like a literary version of Monty Python in that that overall plot is much less important than the individual setups for jokes. In literature humor is perhaps that hardest genre to pull off but Douglas Adams nails it. Hitchhikers is the kind of series that's so good it feels like the author made a demonic pact to briefly give him the talent to produce a book of near perfect quality. It would lend weight to my theory in that Mr. Adams was never able to recapture the magic that was the Hitchhikers Guide and after his two Dirk Gentry books seemed to just give up on producing novels. Alright, I don't actually think Douglas Adams made a deal with the Devil.Douglas Adams managed to pull me into the book so thoroughly that when the super-computer Deep Thought was preparing to deliver the answer to life, the universe and everything I half expected him to actually do it. For me the Hitchhikers Guide is about as close as a book has come to a mystical experience. This may well be my all time favorite book and I can give it nothing less than a perfect score."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book is written from the point of view of Arthur Dent, an Earthling who doesn't know much about the Galaxy. Arthur and Ford Prefect are beamed up from Earth into a Vogon ship. Unfortunately, the Vogons don't like guests, and throw them out of the ship. Fortunately, Arthur and Ford land into another ship, the Heart of Gold, which is piloted by Zaphod Beeblebrox (who also stole this ship from the planet Damogran), Trillian (who plays perfect foil to Zaphod) and Marvin the Paranoid Android (my favorite character). The five of them travel to the planet Magrathea, which they are curious to explore as its denizens create designer planets. There, Arthur learns about the Answer (to Life, the Universe and Everything), and finds out why the Earth was created, and other bits of fact like how human beings are only the third-most intelligent beings on the Earth. The book has some complicated scientific ideas but it is not necessary to understand them to enjoy the book. A fun read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a witty piece of fiction, written by the creative genius Douglas Adams. You definitely have to enjoy this particular kind of humor to fall in love with this book. It is absolutely random and there is no telling where the author is going to take you next. The answer truly is 42, and you should read the book just to find out what the question is. Perhaps a bit on the geeky side, it is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Warning -- Reading this book will result in periodic outbursts of uncontrollable laughter!

No other author has succeeded in writing a book that is so thoroughly detached from reality, and yet full of astoundingly cynical observations of human life. He systematically demolishes people who read too much into life, everybody from Jesus to Freud. The main thing you notice about the book however, is the style of writing, not the humour. This is an author who would be just as comfortable writing the biography of a physicist as writing a sci-fi novel about an alien and a neurotic broadcaster. Douglas Adams is a literary genius with a flair for the english language, and an obvious passion for storytelling.

It was getting boring, until I picked up The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. This book is about Arthur Dent, who has a friend, Ford Prefect, from a foreign planet writing a book, when he says that the world is going to explode. This is the adventure through space to stay alive.My favorite part of the book is in the beginning when Arthur finds out that his house has to be demolished.'\\"But the plans were on display...\\"\\"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\\"\\"That's the display department\\"\\"With a flashlight.\\"\\"Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.\\"So had the stairs.\\"\` This is one of my favorite parts because it just really sticks out in my mind and stays there. Another one of my favorite parts is when the Guide is speaking.'Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm the Galaxy lies a small unrewarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the idea of digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerted with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.' I find this funny because it sounds a lot like me and my friends, because we are amused easily.This book isn't like any other sci-fi book. I like it a lot because it is very funny and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone for its humor and adventure. It reminds me of Star Wars, except that it's not about jedi's, the force, and Yoda. I would say always have a towel on hand, and don't panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I wrote this for a class, that's why it sounds like it was written for a class.Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, or H2G2Although this book was not listed on the required summer reading list, I was told that any book \\"free-read\\" this summer could be reviewed for this assignment. This summer, I re-read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the sixth or seventh time. Obviously, as I am a fan of this novel, and the rest that follow in the series, this review will not be critical.Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy chronicles the exploits of Arthur Dent, a human, Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent's friend who, posing as a human on earth, was collecting data for the actual Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the Galactic president, and other eccentric characters, including Marvin, a manic depressive robot. This novel is amazing, and so are the others in the series. Read them.One of the main strengths in this book is the comedy throughout. Sometimes dry, sarcastic humor, sometimes slapstick, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book. Everything from the characters' names (e.g., Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox) to the omniscient and sarcastic narration (e.g., the head of the construction crew at Arthur Dent's house at the start of the novel being a descent of Genghis Kahn) makes this novel difficult to overlook. Also, if so inclined, the reader can look deeper than just the superficial hilariousness of this novel, and actually gain something from Douglas Adams' view of everything, which is intelligent and insightful. Still, it is not Camus, but I am fairly sure Douglas Adams knows that.There are few weaknesses in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because, this being a sarcastic and comedic view at the way things works, a reader either likes sarcasm and irony or they do not. For me, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not only a funny novel, but full of insight which I have actually benefited from, but I guess there are some people who do not have a sense of humor that parallels the sense in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As far as addressing one of the \\"essential questions\\" is concerned, I wouldn't use Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a reference point for \\"fine art,\\" at least not traditionally (note: I am trying to avoid the debate of what is \\"fine art,\\" \\"art,\\" etc..), but I think the novel is \\"timeless and universal\\" (i.e., no. 6) because the story does not feel dated, and the concepts throughout are universal and still reflective of contemporary culture. In fact, it is the timelessness and universal qualities of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which make it so appealing. Being read this novel when I was little, many of Douglas Adams' concepts have stayed with me my entire life, and whether or not it is a good thing, I judge many things I hear with the concepts I found so universal and appealing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"On top of the cliffs stood a reception comitee.

The conflict in this colorful science fiction cliche is generally controlled by the infamous Six Degrees Theory. The theme when you get down to its very core is to live life to its fullest and take whatever life throws at you head on. I think this is a great book for anybody looking for a comical science fiction that isn't extremely confusing. It is a good light readand an incredible Introduction to an incredible series, I had hoped for another great series by Mister Adams but saddly he passed away in May of 2001 of a sudden heart attack at the age of 49.

A small investment to get such a big answer in return.This is a tribute to the Author of the Hitchhiker Books who died on May, 11 2001, in the age of 49 on a heart attack and much too early, without being able to see his finished product on the big screen."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is about the fastest book I've ever read. It's a really weird kind of book about two survivor's of Earth's destruction and the journey they face. The book is easy to read, but understanding it (or even putting into words your feelings about it) are much more difficult. It is a sci-fi, alien meets man, adventure story which you will enjoy (but you'll never know why)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have to say that this novel caters perfectly to my sense of humor. Its really something when I'm inclined to say that about anything, much less a book, in a science fiction setting. Adams confidently strides into absurdity and I couldn't ask for more. I didn't know what to expect out of this book outside of general greatness (through word of mouth), so I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. I'll be venturing out to see the movie soon now as well.However, I can't say as I appreciate the attached 'Making Of...\\" featurette. That's the unpleasant surprise with this particular copy of the book. The book's screamingly abrupt ending was rendered especially sharp by, what was it...92 pages of this non-sense? I suppose I should have realized that it was included in advance, but there's no way I could have anticipated the (lack of) ending, and its effect was only worsened by having so much more of the bulk of book ahead of me. Oh well. It only helped encourage me to seek out the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy compilation."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is about a human, Arthur Dent, on a quest through space to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything after he narrowly escaped the destruction of earth. Adams' takes the point of view of an alien so he makes everything humans do seem ridiculous. It apeals to science fiction readers along with those interested in philosophy. Don't pick up hitchhikers, but definitely pick this book up at your local bookstore....or on amazon."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say that the previous 652 people that gave this book 5 stars haven't already said? Probably nothing. But it's my favorite book of all time, so I have to write something. The dry humor is brilliant, and I actually laugh out loud reading this book. The sequels are so-so, but this is just perfect. This isn't a sci-fi book, it's just a really funny and crazy story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you like scifi then you have to read this book. If you don't you will miss about half the jokes in all other scifi and miss one of the funniest pieces of literature ever written."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book, of that there is no doubt. However, it's far too short and moves far too fast for me, though I could readily keep up with the plot. The ending was far too abrupt, and his description of some scenes was nonexistent (at best), though I appreciated him letting the reader create his own \\"Heart of Gold\\" and picturing what each of the character's look like, with a little bit of direction.The nostalgia factor (though this was my first time ever reading Adams' work) definitely helped me like this book because all my friends still speak fondly of it.Whatever the case, I am a fan of Adams: I may not think he is greatest author (I disagree with some of style), but he is a damn funny one. The man must have been a stand-up comedian, because he knows how to make someone laugh. He's got comedic timing down for pat. So, if you're reading the book for the first time, I say (especially if you have a Kindle) get the sample first. Personally speaking, you won't be disappointed.After all, the answer to Life, the Universe, Everything is... well, you'll just have to read to find out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Soooooo Long and thanks for all the Fish.... well...

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is full of quotations such as this, which stimulate thought and the funny bone of anyone who understands British humor. Indeed, the adventures of Arthur Dent, the thoroughly confused Earth-man, are full of bits of satire and comedic dialogue. When Dent is rescued from going up in smoke with the Earth, so begins a journey that takes him from the bowels of a dead planet to the deck of a spaceship made to do the improbable. Alien wrecking crews, insane presidents, manically depressed robots, and a confused sperm whale all tie into the story, all with hilarious effect. The interaction between characters is often done with tongue in cheek, and it is genuinely hard to stop from laughing. Arthur's confusion leads to hilarious dialogue, often after he has failed to take in a situation. Though short, this book is a staple in the diet of any comedy science fiction reader. If you think the movie will be a perfect replica of the book to film, prepare to be disappointed: Hollywood had its way with the script, and the second half of the movie is thoroughly edited. I recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate British humor, or anyone who loves and understands satire.

Able to hitchhike aboard passing interstellar crafts, Ford, a writer for \\"the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor (6)--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy--saves his friend Arthur from its destruction and into the clutches of a Vogon Constructor Fleet, or rather, into the clutches of the insidiously inane personalities of the Vogon aliens. Whether a gift or a curse, Arthur is soon able to understand Vogon speech (and particularly awful poetry, including the wrenched poem beginning with \\"O freddled gruntbuggly...\\" [60]) due to \\"probably the oddest thing in the Universe\\" (55)--the Babel Fish. Considering the Vogon's ill-temperament towards hitchhikers, the unlikely duo are soon jettisoned into the expansive vacuum of space, which \\"...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is\\" (70).With the probability of 2276,709 to 1 against being rescued by a passing craft, the two are normalized within the confines of the stolen starship, The Heart of Gold, which had been stolen by the Zaphod Beeblebox, the President of the Galaxy. The ship with the Infinite Improbability Drive is crewed by the widely eccentric president, his Section ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha-native tag-along Trillian (Tricia McMillan), and the paranoid android himself, Marvin. Unbeknownst to even himself, Zaphod is out to find Magrathea, the industry specialist of \\"custom-made luxury planet building\\" (102).Their initial welcoming consisting of guided missiles, the ship turns on its Improbability Drive and is randomly shifted to the surface of the same planet a whale had recently descended upon in an amazing free-fall of self-discovery and splattered blubber, the occurrence their landing on the same planet 8,267,128 to 1 against. The seemingly abandoned surface and derelict innards of the planet factory's office give rise, after an unfortunate bout of gassing, to the wondrous facilities of the factory in full swing. Just who are benefactors of the colossal project, what are their objectives, and how in good name of fjord engineer Slartibartfast will the quartet escape to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe?------------The tumultuous cavalcade of silliness is typically unrelenting; something which can't be said for the remaining four books, in my memory serves me correctly. Arthur should be described as a protagonist if he wasn't also the whipping boy for the more free-willed, free-wheeling Zaphod and Ford. Arthur plays the silent role, more in the novel for comic relief at the expense of the monkey-like humans and their pathetic planet than for his sheer diligence, social prowess or keen insight. It's Arthur's role as lost boy amid the galaxy with a couple of crazies that's the most entertaining bit in the premise. Sadly, like mentioned above, Arthur seems to be left out or seems to have taken a passive, backseat role. Some resulting sections of \\"coincidences\\" are simply too random to be funny and borders more on absurd than witty. This absurdity over wittiness is more prevalent in the sequel: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVE IT!!!!

There is a lot of interesting history and other behind the scenes type information about the book, but when it comes to the section with the book itself, they use huge borders around the text, leaving the readable area about the size of a trade paperback. That makes it very distracting and awkward to read. Also, I had somehow gotten the impression that all three books were included in this edition, much like the Ultimate HHGG. However, it is just HHGG and not the two sequels. I'm not factoring that into my review as I went back and read the description and didn't see anything mentioning it containing all three, but I wanted to point it out in case anyone else mistakenly had the same assumption I did.

Arthur Dent is a typical male human being from England who wakes up to a typical sunny morning to find out;that his house is going to be demolished to build a bypass through. Arthur's wacky friend Ford Precept has much more concerning news and that the Earth will be destroyed very soon. As a alien race of creatures known as Vogon's destroy Earth, of course Arthur and Precept escape by boarding their craft and are now in for a wild adventure.Ford who has been stuck on Earth for 15 years has come out saying he's from the planet Beatleguise who has in his possession,\\"DONT PANIC\\", 'The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy'.

The ship called \\"The Heart Of Gold\\" has been stolen by Zophon himself and he's positive he knows of the unknown wives-tale that is the planet \\"Magrathea\\".Zaniness ensues and the most unpredictable science fiction book I've read in a long time has tickled my brain. Some of his writing reminds me of another one of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut. The ideas of 'What if?' and the ultimate question;Why are we here, what is life?, is always intriguing and makes you think outside your box.Whatever you think this book is about,it's not,whatever you think can't happen will and what does a sperm whale, a pot of petunias,dolphins and mice have to do about it? Everything or nothing?.I found myself out loud laughing to this book, so silly and understandable?, it's hard to explain. Maybe the point is that the universe is much to vast for our understanding. Maybe we aren't supposed to, read it and you'll have a blast waiting to find out.\\"THGTTG\\" is part 1 of a 5 part series.This book is wonderfully written for young teens to aged adults, because we're never too old to take a ride through the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I loved this book! It's hilarious -- I was laughing out loud almost through the entire thing, and I thought it showed some pretty insightful observations about life, people, and the world in general.It starts off with Arthur, a man from Earth who is trying to save his house from being torn down to build a new bypass on the land. He's friends with Ford Prefect, a man from Betelgeuse 5 who is a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and who has been stranded on Earth for fifteen years. In the beginning of the novel, Earth is destroyed to make room for a sort of intergalactic bypass. However, Ford saves his friend Arthur, transporting them onto a nearby spaceship. Crazy adventures ensue.At first glance, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may seem ridiculous and random for it's own sake. However, Adams has crafted a novel that speaks about how it is to live life. Sometimes, weird stuff happens and you just have to go with it. Like Arthur, we will find ourselves in strange situations, completely out of our element, and we will need to figure out a way to get through it. And maybe, just maybe, we take ourselves too seriously sometimes.As for the narration -- well, it was narrated by Stephen Fry, so I think that's enough to tell you that it's amazing. He brings such personality to the characters that it's hardly like reading a book at all. Rather, it's more like being a bystander in events taking place.I highly recommend this book.

He'll need it. Soon, a giant cube comes out of the sky. This is a Vogon ship, Vogons are ugly alien creatures with almost no compassion. They are here to destroy earth, to build an overpass.

His life is changed completely when his house gets bulldozed down and Earth gets blown up,to make room for an intergalactic highway. He and his alien friend Ford Prefect are picked up by the spaceship Heart of Gold and go on to completely improbable adventures around the universe.My favorite part in the book is when Ford and Arthur have just got picked up by the spaceship and a crowd of monkeys trying to write a Shakespearean sonnet attack them. I also like when they get to the planet Magrathea and are informed that the world is run by mice and that Earth is a planet manufactured for rich idiots.I would only recommend this book to people who get the point of not needing an explination for everything in life. I found it entertaining, since I like Monty Python, but some people might not get it at all. I will always remember one part in this book, and that is that the universe is always safer if you bring a towel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams illustrates a vast universe in an extremely humorous light. Much of the novel revolves around a particular book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which, instead of a novel, is actually what its title prescribes. The book follows the life of an extremely perplexed human, who one day awakens to find the Earth being destroyed by Vogon Constructor ships. He is then carried of into one of these ships by a long time friend who happened to be an Alien all along stranded on Earth. From this point on, he is constantly making new discoveries of the universe as he hitchhikes his way through vast amounts of space. The narration throughout this novel is clever and random and often lectures on completely irrelevant but increasingly comical facts. For example, the narrator at one point in the story explains the most popular drink in the galaxy, the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster. The effects of which, are like having one's brain smashed out with a lemon wrapped around a gold brick. The narrator finds deems it worthy to bestow the reader with these tidbits.The story is page-turning and exciting. Around every page there is a surprising new outlook on the fast developing story. Though there is a sharp lack of visual details, the dialogue paints a very visual image of the chemistry between the main characters. Some of which include a manically depressed robot and a two-headed galactic president. Each character has something excellently amusing to offer, and each have drastically distinguishing characteristics that make for an excellent combination of conflicting personalities. There is even a character named Slartibartfast.Adams takes on a very innovative tactic in this novel by making the narrator extremely personable and pointedly witty. The narration is what really makes this book such an entertaining read. Several times the narrator will read excerpts from the real Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Many of which are seemingly educational but are of course only relevant to one traversing the galaxy with nothing but a towel. According to the novel, a hitchhiker's towel is his most important possession. This is because when someone picks up a hitchhiker and they have a towel, it is automatically assumed that they also have a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit., etc.Adams' approach to antagonists in this novel is more than likely supposed to be the mice. According to the novel, humans are third most intelligent beings on Earth behind mice and dolphins. The mice are pandimensional beings that commissioned, paid for, and ran Earth. Ultimately they were seeking the ultimate question to the ultimate answer of forty-two, and earth was a 10 million year project to compute this question. The entire plot is comically sinister and complex and creative to boot. Adams did a fantastic job in illustrating an imaginary universe and concocting a very interesting tale for the human imagination."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVED this book! It was one of the best books I have read. If I could give it six stars i would. Douglas Adams is such a brilliant writer. He puts all the right combinations of humor and sarcasm in all the right situations. It was very intelligently written book that makes you question everything that is! And that British humor! You have to love that British humor! This book keept me laughing till the very end! I would recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in reading anything. Well I'm going to go read the other three now."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let me say that this review is for the book itself, not for any given edition or printing.That being said, let the plaudits begin. When I say that this is where it all began, I mean it. The (very-innaccurately named) trilogy, the cult surrounding the books, my sense of humor and consciousness of the world around me; everything. (Of course, to be totally precise, the BBC radio show preceded even the book, but why split hairs.)I have probably read this book (as well as the other 5 in the series) at least 7 or 8 times, and it gets better with every read. There is so much in it, that every time I read it I can come at it from a different angle, and find something new, laughing the whole time.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" can't be called \\"irreverent,\\" because people usually use that word to describe pointless diatribes made up of bad logic, poorly worded; Adams' prose is impeccable, clever, and strong. He makes fun of humanity, and all that that entails. Nothing is sacred. And yet, Adams' brand of very British nihilism is so charming, one can't be offended.I won't tell you the plot, because this is a review, not a synopsis. But the premise, the idea, of this book, is to take a man, place him in totally alien environments, bounce him around the unfamiliar and frequently noisome universe, in order to draw out (and then skewer mercilessly) that which makes him, well, a man. Like all truly great science fiction writers, Adams succeeds in using the fantastic and whimsical to magnify the particularities of the personal. He doesn't beat you over the head with his philosophy at the end of it all, either; no proseletyzing here. He just shows you humanity in a petri dish.If all of this pretentious posturing sounds a little too cerebral for you, don't worry; this book works on many, many levels. At its heart, it is an adventure story of a man, his Betelgeusian friend, the girl he once loved, the 2-headed rock star who stole her away...ad infinitum. Each of the myriad characters in this bizarre galaxy is as colorful (and often delightfully despicable) as the last. Adams' masterful writing carries you through the travails of his protagonists as quickly and surely as their starship, the Heart of Gold, carries them through this vast universe we call home.In short, this book is funny. Very funny. (If you like Monty Python, you are bound to love this book. If you don't like Monty Python, there's still a pretty good chance you'll like this book.) And, if you let it, it can be profound as well.If you've ever wondered about the meaning of it all, the answer lies here. (Literally.) Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well, folks, it turns out that man is NOT the most intelligent species on Earth, after all.

Premise sound stupid? No, it's really the best in British humour (not humor!) that I have come across. Only a Brit could pull this one off successfully; and he did.Adams's approach is quite novel: combine comedy with science fiction.

Hyperbole, metaphor, didactics, truisms and sarcasm fly in hyperspeed as Dent copes with the needless demolition of his house (and planet) and hitch hikes his way with the freelancing writer for The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy. It might not all make sense, but hey it is a big galaxy after all and the tidbits from The Guide and the universal translators known as the Babel Fish seem to help - well kind of.The absurdity of everything, anything and nothing all come under the cosmic microscope as we take in the busy, bizarre business of the universe. Bonus material: find out what the ultimate answer is to everything, life, existence and the universe!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams death is a sad thing, putting an end to a great carreer, and at the same time a greater loon. I finally started reading this series whenever I heard about the movie.(which is great by the way) Wacky humor, strange decriptions of the ordinary, and super intelligent mice. Don't ask. Don't panic, and whatever you do Read this book.Trying to describe the plot is pointless, for one it makes no sense, and it's not why you read a Adam's novel. I won't give away any jokes, or the such, but if you like Monty Python, or better yet have the smallest hint of a since off humor, read this series. Expect to get a few confusion induced head aches.For those off you who have played the monkey island games, think of Adam's as the Tim Schafer of Books.Remember 42.Oh and Douglas, So long, and thanks for all the fish."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I am very late to the Hitchhiker series of books having just read this one a week or so ago. In fact, I saw the movie before reading this book. That being said, I can see what my friends have been recommending all these years. This is a very funny novel, very inventive and will stretch your imagination. One caveat would be if you know you don't like the British sense of humor, this book probably won't work for you.Though it made me laugh a lot and shake my head at its ingeniousness, it gets 4 stars because of some basic problems in that there is virtually no character development and the plot is razor thin. But it's a short book and easy to read and very funny."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's guide is an excellent story about a man named Arthur Dent and his adventures through the galaxy. The book has many interesting twists and turns along with large amounts of dry humor mixed in. The word play and puns quickly catch the readers' attention and hold it there throughout the book. And although the book is occasionally confusing, the wit and energy quickly ensnares the reader all over again. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs refreshment from the clich&eacute;d books they have come to know. Let Hitchhiker's dry humor, wit, and just plain compelling story line sweep you away."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book itself will always be timeless and I think it would be daft to write any kind of review on a book so well-known and loved.So, instead, I wish to berate the awful quality of the bonus material at the end of the book that is largely illegible. Considering the price of the eBook and the unfortunate quality of the bonus material, it's hard not to feel ripped off.Hopefully Amazon will deal with it and upload an improved version at a later date.For now, apart from the convenience of having it in digital format, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was a graduate student in philosophy when Hitchhiker first came out. Either because I was overwhelmed with school work, or because I (foolishly) thought I was too brainy for Douglas Adams' little gem, I breezed through about half of it, concluded that it was crap, and tossed it aside. (Shades of Majikthise!)Now, some 30 years later, I've given it the serious read it deserved all along, and discovered why Hitchhiker has so many fans. It's hilarious, of course; Adams' talent for weaving together non sequiturs is unparalleled. It's incredibly imaginative, marrying the best of cosmology with the (intentional) worst of pulp science fiction. Best of all (at least so far as I'm concerned), it's extraordinarily philosophical, chock-full of logical jokes and wonderfully paradoxical arguments. But it makes its philosophical points parabolically, and with such a whimsical and funny touch, that the depth can easily be missed.Some examples: the hilarious logical conundrum involving identity and substitution in which Ford Perfect entwines the bulldozer-happy Mr. Prosser; the famous Babel Fish demonstration of the nonexistence of God; the sly allusion at the end of Chapter 9 to design arguments for the existence of God; the sperm whale's discovery of impermanence in life and personal identity; the parable about searching for undiscoverables that features Veet Voojagig's search for Planet Ballpoint Pen; the ontological nature of a world in which improbabilities become probable; the wrangle between humanists and technicians; and of course Deep Thought's search for the meaning of everything--which, among other issues, invites readers to think more about the propriety of questions than the virtue of answers.Even though it's taken me 30 years, I'm glad I've finally rectified a serious failing in my education by reading Hitchhiker. And now, on to the greatest test of all: using it in the classroom as a text! I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great book, irreverently funny, very interesting, and a fast read.

Afterwards my Dad, pleased with how much I liked the first one, bought me The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, all five books in one. But I still keep my first book and read it over and over and over again, the 25th Anniversary Edition. If you like surprising, funny books, you should read this one!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Two years ago I had the privilege of hosting Douglas Adams at my home in San Francisco for a brainstorming meeting on a game project (which eventually became Starship Titanic). I had heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, aka H2G2, but hadn't read it. What I had heard was that it was very funny - Monty Pythonesque humor applied to sci fi. Wanting to get a rise out of Douglas, I made him some tea and served it in a ceramic mug from Japan with a little ceramic frog hiding in the bottom of the cup. Douglas sipped his tea coolly, and when the frog emerged from the depths of the tea Douglas gave a little startled grunt, caught my eye and laughed, and continued to drink his tea. As I expected, unflappable.Now years later, and three years after Douglas' untimely passing, I am finally enjoying what brought Douglas his initial fame. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in a five book trilogy in which our unsuspecting hero Arthur Dent narrowly escapes the Earth seconds before it is demolished to make way for an interstellar highway. Arthur escapes with his colleague Ford Prefect, who reveals to Arthur that he is actually from another planet and was working on a guidebook to the galaxy before getting stranded on Earth. Catching a lift with the cooking crew of the Vogon ship that destroyed Earth, Arthur and Ford are subjected to the torture of Vogon poetry before being ejected into space, only to be picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galaxy's BMOC, with his Heart of Gold improbability spaceship.Thus starts the string of ever more unlikely events in this romp through astrophysics and the hilarious imaginings of Douglas Adams' mind. Adams is a master storyteller, rarely letting his readers rest before hitting them with another plot twist or belly-acher. His humor is quintessentially British. One could easily imagine a young John Cleese in the role of Arthur Dent, deadpanning his way through the most absurd of events. Even if you have never read or enjoyed science fiction in your life, if you have any sliver of a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book.Since the combination of a lot of driving, an iPod purchase, and a subscription to audible.com, I've started to listen to more books than I actually read. The Hitchhiker's Guide is one of those books, read outloud and with great fourish by the author himself, Douglas Adams. As I understand it (someone correct me if I'm wrong) H2G2 was originally broadcast by radio. Thus it is ideally suited to be listened to as an audiobook. Adams has perfect comic timing in his delivery, though the book moves so quickly and covers so many diversions and plot twists I may want to listen to it again just to make sure I catch everything.The next book in the H2G2 5 part trilogy is The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Equally funny and absurd, Dent and his co-horts escape total destruction once again and set off to find this fabled restaurant."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\" Gordon Logan (Scotland) - See all my reviewsThe book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway. He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity\\"Well gordon, this book was published in 1979, before rachel corrie was killed or born. What the death of rachel corrie and \\" The hitchhiker's guide\\" have to do with each other is beyond me. It seem the only thing that \\"descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity\\" is your bizare review of this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, to read this book, one must be willing to do two things: laugh, and enjoy the book for what it is.A warning: This book isn't very plot-heavy. So, if you're the type of person who must always have all loose ends tied up, be prepared for disappointment.Personally, I found this book to be absulutely hilarious. Adams's observations on the overall stupidity of mankind are right on target (Goodbye and thanks for all the fish!) The part that I found to be the most funny was when Adams made fun of philosophers. I actually doubled up with laughter when the man proved to God that He didn't exist. (I think I might have bruised a rib laughing.)And, as a sidenote, the Vogon poetry part is also another favorite of mine.I actually went on to read the rest of the \\"trilogy\\", which, was, to put it simply, mildly disappoiting. Following the example of the first book, the series ends abruptly with too many loose ends to name."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first, and undoubtedly the best, of the several books that (somewhat confusingly) make up the Hitchiker's trilogy.Adams has blended a fantastic sense of humor with a brand of philosophical thinking that would have left Socrates tied up in mental knots.There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there? Adams uses this departure point to take us into outer space, where advanced interstellar communication is old news, and the collaboration of alien species is as common as it is in Star Wars. But this tongue-in-cheek universe is a far cry from that straight-laced epic series.The rulers of this universe are often bogged down in the same type of senseless rituals and paperwork requirements that plague the corporate and bueaucratic world here on Earth.Adams throws so many curveballs and insane elements at us at once that it's difficult to know what to expect when you turn each page.There's no sense in trying to explain the impact on the plot of a Vogon construction fleet, a ship powered by an Improbability Drive, or the long sought after answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You just have to read it.This might sound like the book itself is confusing, but that's actually not true. Adams has a way of explaining the inexplicable in a way that makes it, if not completely logical, at least entertaining.I highly recommend this book, especially to a young teen reader who might be looking for some answers that aren't in the rule book. This book might not have the answers either, but at least it raises the questions. Or maybe it doesn't even raise the questions so much as make us laugh about the results.Or something like that.Anyway, this is a must-read. I can only hope that the impending movie does it justice."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One would believe that Earth is a normal planet in a normal otherwise insignificant solar system along with other normal planets with no normal intelligent life. However, Arthur Dent is about to learn much more about Life, the Universe, and Everything than any other Earthling ever will. This is mostly because his planet is soon blown up, his best friend happens to be an alien named Ford Prefect, and he has been living on a planet that was really the most intelligent super computer ever created and was run by mice. Although Arthur gets past the fact that he almost dies on two occasions and has a fish living in his ear, he never gets past the fact that he has no idea what is going to happen next. He and his friend then become \\"hitchhikers\\" and get picked up by a criminal named Zaphod Beeblebrox, who just happens to be Ford's cousin. After all of these incredibly bizarre and improbable things happen, Arthur learns his destiny as part of the genius super computer called the \\"Earth\\" that was created to find the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. But will he be able to escape the cops, whale and flower missiles, and mad mice that want the Question more than a run on the exercise wheel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not long ago, I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and i. was pleasantly surprised about how much I enjoyed reading it. Everything from the writing to the concept it embodies had me positively spellbound.This book is about a dispossessed earth-man named Arthur Dent and the tremendous effect he is having on the universe. After narrowly escaping from the destruction of the Earth with his friend Ford Prefect whom he had believed to be from earth but turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse, they travel around the galaxy together meeting up with a large ensemble of friends along the way. The whole series of books follow Arthur Dent's journeys around the galaxy taking him to many mysterious places such as the ancient planet of Magrathea, and to a very strange planet named Brontital in a synthetic universe in one of the offices of the MegaDodo Publications (the home of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) on Alpha Centurai. And also to pre-historic earth to see the cavemen wiped out by a bunch of telephone sanitizes.The whole series is completely astounding and to think it all came out of the mind of Douglas Adams; the creator of the television show, the radio show and the author of all five novels. I would firmly advise this book to anyone who enjoys to read science fiction. Even if you do not ordinarily like sci-fi usually, there is a good chance you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book because it was a choice for one of those aggravating reports we had to do in 10th grade, and it was the thinnest one on the list.

Yes, we are a &quot;gifted kid&quot; magnet school, but let me tell you... the humor in this book is just astounding! We reference this book at least once a day (and who wouldn't, what with 42 and towel lines right there at our disposal?). As a reader of decidedly more serious sci-fi, I was expecting something along those lines when I picked up this book... imagine how delighted I was to find what I actually held in my hand was one of the best parodies of the genre I've seen.

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is a master. Anyone who hasn't read his Hitchhiker's series needs to prioritize better. Hitchiker's Guide is light enough to never stop being fun, but looks seriously at humans and why we are the way we are. He seems to be able to capture the human condition through farce without becoming shallow or pandering. This book is a necessary element of any serious Sci-Fi reader's library."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If I were to rate all of the books that I have ever read, this one would be the funniest. He takes statements that sound very scientific, draws them out so they sound even more scientific, and then ends them with something so stupid and random that it leaves you wondering why you thought that the sentence sounded so scientific in the first place. An example of this is the first couple of paragraphs of the book, which say this:&quot;Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 98 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape- descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;I recommend this to people who have a British &quot;Monty Python&quot;-like sense of humor, are science fiction fans, or are both."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first read this book in college some 20 years ago, and I still highly recommend it.

I bet at least one person responds &quot;42&quot;!). It's imaginative and very, VERY funny. I've never read anything so unusual in my life.

Not many books are like that -- friends who have read this have all plowed through it at least 5 times. I myself discovered it in the early 80s, and have definitely read it dozens of times by now, no lie. There's just something about it. You can't stop, can't get away -- aaaaaahhh!Seriously, this straddles the line between &quot;funny-odd&quot; and &quot;funny ha ha&quot; more successfully, and more hilariously, than any book I can think of. One thing I should tell a person coming to this for the first time -- Zaphod Beeblebrox actually does start to make sense, during the sequels. Well, not &quot;SENSE&quot;, exactly, but his self-sabotaged brain becomes the key to a lot of cool hijinks. The second half of this book, after Arthur and Ford are picked up by the Improbability Drive, appears TOTALLY random, but actually does make sense in the context of the later books in the series. You should remember that this was originally a radio series, and this book is just the first few installments of it. The cutoff point is sort of arbitrary.As the series continues, Douglas Adams makes some really good philosophical points about getting along with each other. We should thank this guy, I think. The more I think about it, the more I realize what a solid, good person Douglas Adams is, to be able to laugh at the insanity that governs our modern lives. To even be able to SEE that it's insane is good, and to get others to laugh out loud at it all is GREAT. What a guy. Cheers to Douglas Adams, I say.

The answer to the question being 42 (am I right on that?) and a sulking robot named Marvin not to mention the construction of a highway through space which causes earth to be demolished. This book is definitely not for the &quot;cool&quot;. It's for the geeks and freaks who haven't grown up and are still enjoying life. You'll laugh at every page as you go through the book. And I love the name Slartibartfast.And mice are the most intelligent creatures on Earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was obviously written by someone who had tried the first ever Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster on the earth. The plot is well hidden by the inclusion of humorous information for those who wish to see the marvels of the universe for less then thirty Altairian dollars a day. I suggest that anyone who likes serious stories or well defined plots avoid this book at all costs, anyone else though should read this book so they can catch a ride on a starship before the Earths impending destruction.While reading this book I found it immensely hard to stop laughing. Upon finishing this book I had to read the others in the series immediately (well not immediately I had to get them first...but that's beside the point).

Just like everyone else in the Universe, or at least that's what he thinks. But space is closer to him than he ever could imagine. His best friend, Ford Prefect isn't from Guildford as he usually claims. In fact he is from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. And just seconds before the Earth is being destroyed, Ford manages to save himself and Arthur by hitch-hiking. This is the beginning of a whole new life for Arthur, and for help he has got an electronic book, a book that tells you about everything that is worth knowing about in the Universe. The book is called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.The main characters are Arthur, who is a dark-haired human dressed in a dressing gown throughout the whole story, and Ford, a tall humanoid alien who works as a roving researcher for the reference book \\"the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". But the story is also about Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian and Marvin, a depressed robot.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the best book I have ever read. It is both entertaining and deep.

This book is about a man named Arthur dent and his friend ford prefect. In the beginning of the story Mr. Prosser wants to knock down Arthur's house. They want to knock it down to make a bypass. Arthur doesn't want them to knock it down so he sits in a mud pile in front of his house so that the bulldozers wont knock it down. Later his friend ford tricks Mr. Prosser to sit in the mud pile while they get a drink. Mr. Prosser then gets in the mud pile and sits there while ford and Arthur leave to get a drink. When they go to the bar ford tell Arthur that he is an alien and that the earth is going to be demolished. Then ford tells Arthur to drink 3 pints of alcohol before the trip to leave earth. While Arthur is drinking he hears his house get knocked down and run to try and save it but is too late. Then they left and an earth was destroyed. Then they get off the planet as hitchhikers. They where on a ship that belonged to the Vogon. The Vogon are evil so they kicked all the people that came on the ship out. They where thrown in space and they held there breath for 29 seconds and bearly escaped dying. The where aboard a ship called the Heart of Gold? On this ship ford and Arthur met a robot named Marvin. Marvin tells them to follow him to go to the captain of the ship Zaphod Beeblebrox who is also the president of the galaxy. Marvin later tells them that Zaphod has stolen this aircraft. Zaphod is an old friend of ford and once met Arthur at a party. At the party Zaphod takes the girl who Arthur had liked. The girls' name is Trillian and later Zaphod tells her that he is a real alien and takes her with him back to space. Later Arthur goes to sleep and the rest of them found the planet Magrathea. They where looking for this planet because this planet belonged to the rich people who made planets. The next day they where going to land on the planet when a recording said that they should leave the planet. Later it spoke again and it said that it would be firing missile at them. Just second before the missile was going to hit them Arthur bushed the improbability drive and saved them. Then they went to land and they got out and started looking. They found a cave and went through. Zaphod told Arthur and Marvin to stay out and secure the land. Later a man named slartibartfast told him to come and they went into his aircar. Then slartibartfast began to tell him the story about a man named lunkwill and his friend majikthise who went and asked the computer a question. They asked the computer what is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. The computer told him that he would have to think a while to answer the question. Then they asked the computer how long and he responded by saying 7.5 million years. So they left and 7.5 million years later he told then that the answer was the number 42. Then the two men asked him what do you mean. And then the computer told him the answer is 42. The computer also told him you asked me the wrong question. They asked to tell them what question they asked him to answer but he told them that he will not be able to but I know how you van find out. The computer told them I will tell you what to build and you build it. The computer told them that the answer will come from the rats on planet earth and it would take 10 million years to build it. Then the tem billion years past and they where about to find the answer when but 5 min before they where going to find the answer the Vogon have destroyed the earth. Know trillion 2 mice where with Arthur and the rest of the gang. They have already stated building the new earth when they said that they could take Arthur's brain and find the answer out. But Arthur refused and they ran away. Then two cops where shooting at them and then later there backpacks explode. Then they leave the planet and the mice continue on building the new earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is an extremely funny book, with awesome characters and dialogue.

Douglas Adams is an exceptionally talented writer. Throughout the book, he approaches details far from the main flow of information and in the last sentence of the chapter makes it all fit together. It is extremely hard to describe his style except that of what some would call slapstick comedy. This type of comedy is completely zany and just throws around plot elements, introducing new items very liberally and taking others away rapidly.The plot and content are excellent. The charcters are very developed and interesting. Because most of the book does not take place on the Earth, Adams pokes a lot of fun at the Earth and its not-so-brilliant residents, humans. The book is constantly refering to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (an actual book in the story) giving the reader more information and continuing to reveal the plot in Adams's unique style.I really enjoyed this book. I was often laughing out loud and recieving interesting looks from the other kids in study hall. This book is unequivocally humorous with a very extensive plot and developed characters.

The Guide entertained me with its humorous, gut wrenching absurdity while educating me with its witty dialogue and sardonic social satire. The election of the nihilistic puppethead president Zaphod Beeblebrox pokes fun at the very hypocrisy that is politics.A great, quick read that will leave an indelible impression - and leave your sides hurting from laughing so much.\\"Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work?\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is amazing. No other word can describe it. The events that ensue in the zany storyline should depress one if anything, considering it is the end of the Earth. Yet it is pulled off so remarkably it seems inspirational. The characters are so odd, yet so much like us (or at least me) in some way.Trust me, if you like some silly nonsensical (yet it makes great sense) humor, read this. If not, read it anyway. What am I to tell you what to do? Do whatever you want.PS-I also recommend the other novels in series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining. Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with this absurd sci-fi novel. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect(who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is about to end.Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive-makes the improbable happen. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. Then discover that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the planet was desroyed. Ah, the irony!This book was all over the place, in a way that reminded me of Slaughterhouse five. The characters would go off on weird tangents that didn't really have much to do with the plot of the story. But I enjoyed its off the wall style and bazaar storyline. Its definitely unlike any other book I've read, and I admire its originality."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Funny sure, wore out two copies yeah yeah, brilliant etc. etc. ad nauseum ad infinitum.The part that usually gets missed in all the adulation is that Adams' trilogy (and *only* the original three) are also a grand and cutting critique of capitalism, bureauracracy, multinational industries, colonialism, organized religion, militarism, etc etc.Yup, these books are smart AND funny, and far far shorter than the Illuminatus! trilogy. That in itself is a blessing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is having a really bad Thursday. Not that that's unusual for him. He's just learned that his home is to be demolished to make way for a new freeway. As is the earth. But moments before the earth is destroyed, he is rescued by his friend, Ford Perfect, an alien who's been living on earth. Together, they start a wild adventure that will introduce them to Zaphod and his girlfriend Trillian. Not to mention a depressed robot.I've been hearing about this book since high school. Many of my friends have recommended it to me, but I've never gotten around to reading it. Believe me, that was a huge mistake. I was frequently laughing out loud at the book. The characters, the situations, and the narration - all of it was perfectly comical. I'm sure I averaged a laugh a page, leading to some strange looks from my roommate as I was reading.If you're looking for a fun, improbable book you won't be able to put down, look no further. I'm already planning to pick up the rest of the increasingly inaccurately named trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I heard about this book as a humoristic book. Well, it does have some funny parts, but it's not hilarious. It is, though, very interesting. It is the only book I've ever read that doesn't fit itself to your logic, but you need to fit your logic to it. It is a crazy book, and I don't think it fits to all people, but if you liked it, you'll find yourself quating it at any opportunity. I found metaphors in it that fits to almost any discussion: About Capitalism, Zionism, science, and everyday conversations. It's an amazing, funny and weird book and I think you should at least try and read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked up the Hitchhikers' Galaxy to the Galaxy beacause of the recommendation of a friend. I really had absolutely no idea what to expect except for the seemingly, pointless question he asked me, \\"What is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything?\\". Needless to say, I didn't know what the heck he was talking about, and was even more perplexed when he told me the answer was 42. So, when my class was sent to the library to pick out a fiction novel to read for class, I found this book in my hands, and I'm glad I did. I find it quite difficult to describe this book, because I know I won't be able to do justice to it, but let's say I was constantly laughing the whole way through. The plot, or lack thereof, revovles mostly around an ape-descended lifeform living on the wretched blue-green planet in the Western arm of the universe, named Arthur. Arthur lives in England and lives a rather typical humanoid life, with the simple exception of his friend, Ford Prefect. Ford is a wonderfully interesting character who really is not a human, but an alien hitchhiking through the universe with the assistance of the trusty guide, yet finds himself exiled on Earth for 15 years and befriending Arthur. As it happens, a Vogon spaceship shows up and destoys Earth and all mankind to make way for an intergalactic highway, yet Ford and Arthur escape due to Ford hitching a ride on the Vogon ship. Thus, begins their adventure. Through a long, and quite improbable journey, Ford and Arthur meeting old aquaintences, the ruler of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and another surviving human, Trillian. Together they go on a entirely zany and humorous adventure. It's really quite worth the read and the book we leave you desiring to read the next 3 books of the triology (yes, there are 4). My only complaint is that there is really no defining moment in the book that makes it truly memorable. I guess you could say its lacking any real climax. Also, the hundereds of juxtapostions, ilogical and improbably things, and oxymorons really leave you kind of feeling a little empty. For all the humor, the book is really lacking any substance or something to take away from it, even if you do now know the answer to the universe. Yet, I recommend it to all who are looking for a great laugh. Its a wonderfully written book and will keep you involved, so go check out!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first in a series of humorous science fiction novels that had their origin in a BBC radio series, first airing on March 8, 1978. This first story by Adams was also made into a short television series. The stories are centered about an alien named Ford Prefect, who has been spending some time on Earth serving as a roving researcher for &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and his human friend Arthur Dent, a common English &quot;everyman&quot; who is constantly searching for a drinkable cup of tea. At the start of the first novel, Dent wakes up in the morning to discover that his house is being destroyed to make way for a bypass. Ford Prefect arrives to tell Dent that Earth itself is about to be demolished in order to make way for an interstellar bypass by the Vogons. Just prior to Earth's destruction, the two stow away on a Vogon ship. The two survivors are thrown out of the ship but soon meet the egocentric Zaphod Beeblebox, Ford's cousin and President of the Galaxy (&quot;President in particular is very much a figurehead-he wields no power whatsoever&quot;), who has a surgically-added extra arm and extra head. With Zaphod is the girl Trillian (Tricia McMillan) who had been picked up at a party on Earth by Zaphod. They are traveling in a prototype space ship, &quot;The Heart of Gold,&quot; stolen by Zaphod. The ship is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive, which can be used as a method for crossing vast interstellar distances in a &quot;mere nothing of a second&quot; by generating small amounts of finite improbability. The development of an &quot;infinite improbability generator&quot; was made possible by calculating exactly how improbable such a generator was and creating this finite improbability. Another character in these books is Marvin, a manicly depressed android with a powerful brain. This unusual group of characters travel to the planet Magrathea which specializes in custom-made luxury planet building. However, two nuclear missiles are fired at them. Fortunately, Dent accidentally triggers the infinite improbability drive which turns the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. They discover, from the character Slartibartfast, that Earth had actually been designed by the Magratheans as a gigantic computer whose job it was to find &quot;The Question.&quot; Another computer, &quot;Deep Thought,&quot; had earlier calculated the answer to life, the Universe, and everything: the answer was &quot;42.&quot; But, no one knew the question. Unfortunately, the Earth had been destroyed five minutes before the completion of its analysis by the Vogons. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great reading by Stephen Fry.

The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book which incorporates some of the most brilliantly put together random event while all somehow making sense together in sequence. The theme of the entire book is put together from douglas's amusing imagination where some of the most hilarious scenarios scientifically fit together while integrating our current history and politics.

After convincing him to leave his post to share a drink, his unintentionally conspicuously-named alien (unbeknownst to Dent) friend of five years, Ford Prefect, plies him with drinks and then shares the big news - the earth is about to be demolished to make way for...an intergalactic byway. Fortunately, Prefect is able to save them both from demolition, after which they become space travel companions. Defying what appear to be insurmountable odds, the two are able to survive certain death and spend time with former acquaintances. During their journey they learn what Prefect has been missing during the 15 years he was stranded on earth, as well as the meaning of life and how the earth was first formed. A central part of the plot is the existence and content of the guide that Prefect was working on when he got stuck on earth, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It contains helpful information on a variety of topics for galaxy travelers like this, (p 76) \\"Space...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is.\\" This short novel provides a sometimes silly, frequently funny look at alien-human interaction but is probably better for fans of space-related science fiction than average readers.

Wells."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before you read this review, you should know that I am not a fan of science fiction. The only other book I've read that any reasonable person might claim is science fiction would be Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut. Any fan of sci fi will tell you that Vonnegut isn't actually a science fiction writer. He's a satirist.I decided to read the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy because of its popularity. For the uninitiated (and I'm barely initiated) the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was originally a radio show on BBC. The first novel (which I am reviewing here) was based on portions of the radio show (although Adams mixed the order of things up when he set down to write the novels). Other novels followed until there were four (the trilogy of four). Some years later a fifth book was added to the series. There has also been a movie, record albums, a TV show and so. It gets confusing because the novels, TV shows, and movies of the same name, mix and jumble the order and content of the original radio show. To further complicate things, the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy title is often used to describe the entire series of novels not just this one.Like I said, Sci Fi is not my thing, but this novel isn't serious science fiction, it's inspired lunacy (I didn't make that up - I read it somewhere, but it's true. The novel has a \`Monty Python like quality'. I especially enjoyed many of the little diversions from the main plot (like the tale of the warrior-like planet that attacks the earth but fails to take scale into consideration and are inadvertently swallowed by a small dog).It's something of a mystery to me though why this novel is such a sensation. Sure, it's amusing, but in an inconsequential way. I liked it, found it quite funny , but I have to wonder if it deserves such high praise and loyalty. I can't say this light hearted romp deserves much more than 3 stars.Personally, I prefer Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I thought this book was a really good book.The only reasons why I started reading the series is because I saw the movie.

I was caught in between. I, on the other hand, had first hand accounts of how the other one lived, died, and copulated with the other. It seemed as if I had an omnipotent position in the poitics of teen angst. Soon, I was to learn, that I myself was a pawn in the chess match we call puberty. In that confused state, I was introduced to the most informative, amusing, piece of literature, that any intelligent life form of any age could have been privy too stumble upon. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the first and only reason I began to read. It was the first book that I became involved with, that I began to understand. Life, the universe and everything, meant more than words. Douglas Adams is a shaman, not in a religious manner, but in an intelligent, an understanding, and in the most human of emotions kind of way. Douglas Adams to me is a sort of father, in that he showed me the way to understanding, in a world that refuses to accept science and the understanding of truth.

I'd definitely characterize this book as Monty Python-like in its humor and approach. And, if you think about it, the original release of the book parallels those early Monty Python movies like the 'Life of Brian'. And, this book basically is about the meaning of life. I for one enjoy British humor and found this book to be a fun romp thru space. The author has a keen imagination and uses it well. The fun part about this book is that it is a fantasy and as such the author is given free reign to conjure up all sorts of silly and outlandish plots and schemes. However, I found that he wrapped the story with just enough \\"scientific\\" data that it bordered on the nearly, almost but not quite believeable. The improbability drive is one just such example. You can tell the author has fun making this journey up and you end up having fun being pulled along by some of the witty antics. At times I found myself laughing out loud about some of the dialog and insights given by the characters. Even the thought that mice rule the Earth does get one to thinking about \\"what ifs\\".

The cult following begat a franchise of video games, radio programs and a TV series, all of which deal with this dry witted tale of Earthman Arthur Dent and his journey through the galaxy.I'm not sure if the book has aged as well as its most loyal fans would claim it has. Much of the humor that seemed edgy 20 years ago now seems outdated in a Weird Al sort of way. Nonetheless, any book that opens with the destruction of Earth can't be all bad.Following our famous cast of characters through the bizarre events that they mostly seem to have no control over is always a pleasure, even when it's a bit of a corny one. The dialogue is steeped in Adams' very British humor and has always seemed like the best thing about the series. The conversations between such oddball characters as Ford Prefect and galactic president/scoundrel Zaphod Beeblebrox are worth any lapses into the preposterous."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"interesteing read and concept though this novel has no real beginning, middle or end, a bit like outerspace. if your into over the top humor in sci fi form, pick it up and have fun."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is the best book ever and anyone who hasn't read it is a loony"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Book was misrepresented to attract buyers.Book was advertised as 1st edition and it was NOT.Also the image that was chosen for an item was absolutely misrepresentation (I'm talking about an autograph).Seller did not respond to my emails after the purchase.As I was looking at a book it had a price tag of $2.00 from used book store.It tells me that this person did not make an innocent mistake.I think everyone needs to be aware of this and think twice before dialing with this seller."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I clearly did not understand this book at all. I read it based on a recommendation of a scientist I work with who said it was an incredible read, but this came out as one lame novel. Maybe it's because it was written for a previous generation of reader, but Adams's novel doesn't really do anything all that exciting. The premise is intersting enough, Arthur Dent being a human being who is saved from the destruction of the Earth because of the need to build an intergalactic highway. Some of the details are also fascinating (and what saves the novel from being 0 stars in my eyes), especially the way religion and technology are described in such a satirical form, but the book iteself is poorly written, choppy, and frankly unentertaining. If someone can tell me what I was supposed to get out of this novel, please pass the information along.I really do think that my negative views towards the book stem from it seeming dated in my eyes and how the humorous and sarcastic tone coming out as something quite standard in today's writing world. Maybe the novel was a breakthrough when it came out for the way it viewed the world and the way Adams pokes fun at almost everything, but none of this can cover up the fact that in my eyes, this seems like a poor, finished product, one that relies on its somewhat interesting satirical moments to cover up its other flaws."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is HILARIOUS!

One feels though that the Author is a touch cynical about everything around him and implements his cynicism in his characters.The c! haracters are probably not very well defined with the exception of Arthur Dent who I guess everyone identifies with.Everyone else in the book is very wacky and all of them would be very good case studies for aspiring psychologists.

Adams has gone into writing this book with no story, no caracters and no plot. This is the only reason why Douglas Adams is the finest writer ever. He has what most other sci-fi writters don't, and that is the abillity to keep a reader interested without having to introduce a multitude of caracters or having to fil the book with scientific babble ( Arthur.c.Clark, David Brin).

The novel was completely devoid of plot, making the reader ready to put it down after only a few chapters. It was also rather confusing at some points and the reader is led to believe many occurrences of improbable events that are explained as intentional because of the &#8220;improbability drive&#8221; in the main characters&#8217; space ship.The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy severely lacks plot. The story focuses on the travels of four unlikely comrades and their morose robot, Marvin. The entire plot of the story can be summarized in a few sentences: The two characters from Earth get a ride on a spaceship, seconds before the Earth is destroyed, only to be kicked off of the ship into open space. Conveniently, they are picked up by a stolen ship powered by an &#8220;improbability drive&#8221;, hence the convenience of the Earthlings&#8217; pickup.... The book is pointless and has really no theme, symbolism, or any of the elements of literature that are to be expected in a novel.There is also surprisingly frequent use of common grammatical errors such as missing commas, misplaced modifiers, and sentence fragments. The grammar in the book makes it hard to respect the author much for his writing ability. There also seems to be large words used where they are unnecessary that just seem to be attempts to make the book seem better and the author smarter.One thing I liked about the book was the author&#8217;s use of the character Marvin, the eternally depressed robot programmed only to make lives miserable. Although Marvin was rather annoying, he accurately represents and criticizes people who act very much like him. Marvin was so depressing in fact that he saved the heroes lives by talking to another machine, making it feel compelled to kill itself. Obviously, Marvin is an exaggeration of people who only see the bad side of things, but he still brought forth thoughts of how people could be like that.Overall, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a rather poor piece of literature that seemed to be more of a waste of time than an enjoyable novel. Douglas Adams shadows some aspects of the real world, but the poor writing, lack of plot, and undeveloped characters made the book less interesting and made it harder to notice a theme or relation to my life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I do not understand why people love this book. Or why they think it's funny. It's just so boring. There's no plot, there's no character development, and the characters are one-dimensional anyway.The entire story can be summed up in one sentence: The Earth is destroyed, and Arthur is saved by Ford Prefect, who is an alien researching Earth.Woo, what an exciting plot. Honestly, I'd rather be on the Earth when it was destroyed than go on this boring adventure.However, it's obviously a cult classic, and I guess it's just one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime. And finally I've been able to understand a lot of sayings and jokes that I've been hearing for all these years and not knowing where they came from. :)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\"By Douglas AdamsPublished by Pocket BooksCopyrighted 1979?Confusion?\\"A towel, it says, is the most massively useful thingan intersteller hitchhicker can have\\" If you thoughtthat was confusing, then this book will be justthat..... confusing.I'm not much of a reader in the first place, but Iread this book about half way through and I didn'tunderstand it that much.

Its only redeeming quality is that, while I found it to be boring, uninteresting, and at best marginally funny on occasion, it was a very fast read, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time on it, or just give it up entirely. Right up until the end, I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. I can think of at least two dozen books written in the 20th century that were better written, with better plots, characterization, and, for some, even humor. If you think a book is &quot;good&quot; because it's trendy and popular, by all means, this is THE book for you; but if you're interested in quality literature -- something of more substance, meaning, and purpose than you'll find on the magazine rack at your local convenience store -- &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; is something to avoid."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I suppose this book is written for a different type of reader than I am.

For anyone else looking for a serious read, buckle down and get some Heinlen or Gibson."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I listened to this book on CD; the six CD BBC Radio production. While I certainly found the book amusing, I don't know why people are so excited about it. It seems that Adams pretends to have a plot but really does not want to have one. The tone is too ridiculous to be meaningful and the characters are too flat.The event that starts the novel is the demolition of Earth for a hyperspace bypass. Only one human, Arthur Dent, escapes with an alien taking human form, Ford Prefect. Following this, they meet some other characters and have a random, bizarre romp around the galaxy.There were some interesting ideas here but Adams just didn't pursue them. Super-beings create a computer to determine the answer to the meaning of life (this in itself could have an interesting point; man relies on machines for the most important of tasks etc...) and after millions of years, it reaches the answer. &quot;The answer is 42.&quot; As this made no sense to the super beings, they designed a planet-sized computer called Earth to find the question to the meaning of life. In the novel, the question is never revealed even though one of the characters knows it.The title of the novel is an actual book in the story. It a collection of articles and miscellaneous data about the galaxy, towels, alcohol and all sorts of different topics; this could have formed the basis for an interesting plot. The story could have featured, Ford Prefect, himself a contributor to the guide travel about and write about the places he visits and other such tidbits. It could be some sort of \\"Lonely Planet\\" book for the galaxy.There were other parts of the novel that were just plain weird; the editor of the, &quot;The Hitch hiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; takes an inter-galactic cruise in his office. The main characters travel in a space ship powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive. The characters visit a restaurant that exists at the end of time...I fully admit that the book is funny; it has a sort of British humor that I just love but after that, there's not much of substance here. However, seeing as it is incredibly popular for some reason, it may be worth a read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a very funny book showing up some of human nature.

A light read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A trip down lunacy lane. This is a unpretensious riot that along with its THE RESTURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE makes two great books. Ford Prefect, Zaphod, and Arthur Dent and Co make a great addition to the world of fantasy. More a parody of moden culture that a book of fiction you will do better just sitting back and laughing as each improbable event comes faster than you can count to 42.

I came to this book and thought, how is it possible to do science fiction at the same time as satire? And, as I found out through reading, it was quite simple. The first thing that sticks out in my mind as amusing was that Adams completely threw out the rule book on grammar in book-writing, and just went with whatever fit him. It was such a bizzare break from the norm that it felt quite good, and was also, as a result of making up rules, quite amusing.Furthermore, the work he did with the characters was quite good. Sure, they were still shallow enough to see the pits by the end of the book, but considering it left enough to be desired to buy the next book at the same time as giving enough to fit in the original, that's forgivable. And really, they were all extremes, except for the humans, weren't they? That made it all the more funny, to me.If you don't trust me, which is entirely possible, trust the other 400+ people that have already posted reviews. Surely that many people unanimously can't be that wrong about a judgement.............. or maybe they can, in the wrong Universe...RIP DNA :-("},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book several months ago to fulfill an independent reading requirement for my high school English class. Being the type of person who doesn't really read much, this was something that I was not too excited about doing. I ended up taking a trip down to the library and basically grabbing a book at random. That book was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. What really amazed me was the fact that I actually enjoyed reading this book. Since then I have even gone on to read the rest of the &quot;Trilogy&quot;. I think that what really got me hooked on this book was the author's, unique writing style. The best way to describe this is to take a look at the first page of the book.&quot;This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with the digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the ocean. And then, one Thursday, nearly 2000 years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible, stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.&quot; (1)While it is obvious that the author is trying to be comical, if one is to dig a little deeper it can also be seen that Douglas Adams manages to introduce many of our society's different social problems such as technology, economics, evolution and religion. It is typical for his writing to criticize everything in a skeptical and humorous way. But at the same time he never presents any concrete solutions to the problems he deals with. He leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not it is something they are concerned with. I think that this is important as it allows for each reader to use their imagination and see the story from their own perspective.His humorous style lies in his objectivity. He doesn't come right out and say, &quot;money doesn't cause happiness&quot;, and instead he says that people are always concerned about the movement of small green pieces of paper. Douglas Adams just suggests as to what is going on and leaves it up to the reader to figure things out for themselves. He also uses the example of digital watches in order to criticize technology, which is something that we are very proud of. But if you think about it, you become aware that he isn't actually criticizing digital watches, he is criticizing the whole technology, which is in his opinion not the great thing that we think it is.Another reason I liked these books so much is that you can read the books over and over again, and each time you manage to find something that you did not notice before. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is so full of jokes. He always manages to find a twisted and unexpected solution to the problem at hand and really keeps the reader baffled as to what will happen next. He looks at things in an original and very interesting manner. For example, he makes fun of the fact that the human race thinks that they are the most intelligent beings on earth, and explains that this isn't quite right. He says that the most intelligent beings are the mice, then the dolphins, and humans are only the third most intelligent beings. The mice are in fact responsible for the construction of the Earth, in order to find the question to the answer of the Meaning of Life, Universe and Everything. Humans used them as laboratory experiments but they actually just used us, not as we thought that we used them. Now to someone not familiar with the book this seems rather strange and doesn't make much sense, but somehow all of it manages to fit together.Overall, I think that this book really helped to open my eyes as to just how creative and interesting a good book can be. It may not be a classic in the true sense of the word, but it was something that I truly enjoyed and that is not something I can claim about many books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I actually don't read books very often but I read this one seven times now and I still can't help laughing out loud every time I read it again. Also, a very good Dutch translation is available."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ever a fan of the late great Douglas Adams, I would like to add along with my fellow reviewers who gave this novel 5 stars that it is one of the more imaginative stories ever thought out, and indeed one of the oddest. It is quite hilarious and Mr. Adams was one of the few science fiction writers who could insert some real-life humor into his work. While you read about Arthur Dent whizzing around space in a most improbable ship, his experiences and feelings are instantly recognizable.Perhaps some people don't get it. It's on many schools' summer reading lists and kids might be expecting Homer or Shakespeare instead of some good laughs. But the laughs certainly aren't at the expense of your intellect. These aren't stupid jokes. Perhaps that's why not everybody gets them."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit I am one of the many Hitchiker Nuts out there. I have read the book, re read and then re re read it over and over. In fact I have read it so many times that I am currently in the process of getting my 3rd copy of it! As for the book itself..it is bizzare, strange and altogether confusing. My advice when reading it for the first time is to remember what Adams says at the start of it where he talks about where he came up with the idea of for it...being drunk in a field. Just kind of look at the book through that approach and maybe it will make sense. If not read it again, keep reading it til you get it and then move onto the next one and so on. And of course...dont forget to ask WHAT THE ULTIMATE QUESTION IN FACT IS!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining. Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with his absurd style of writing. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Denton and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect (who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is going to end. Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the \\"Heart of Gold\\" which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. And they learn that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the Vogons destroyed it. Ah, the irony!But I don't want to give anymore away so I'll leave you with that. This book is great for all ages and hard to put down the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My book club read this and all four of us agreed it was great. Full of comic irony and random events, every few pages the author turns conventional reality on it's head in increasingly funny, offbeat ways. You'll travel through the galaxy, through time, and through perception looking forward to what comes next. Our group had a great time looking at the absurdities the book raises about human intelligence, politics, and control over events in our lives. This was a rare experience in that it really made me think and also totally cracked me up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I would rate this as one of the funniest books I have ever read. It to me was clearly way up there along with Wodehouse. The comedy of Douglas Adams is difficult to categorise as satire or pun. It has satire and puns, however i think his books do more. Douglas Adams makes you laugh using parts of brain whose existance you may not even have been aware of previously. Reading this book was to me like getting hooked on to some strange device which would trigger those areas of brain responsible for laughing which the other books and movies have missed. The ridiculousness of some of the ideas in this book and (most of the) series is unbelievable. The humour can be a bit nerdy and I guess hard to understand. However all in all it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I was in elementary school, this was a common series read by the male nerds and geeks in my school. After reading it, I can now see how much it shaped their speech patterns and writing styles. I found myself smiling as clouds of nostalgia unexpectedly overtook me while reading the series. I was also surprised to find phrases original to this series that have worked their way into the American culture. For example, in order to understand people who speak other languages, the characters in this series simply put a &quot;Babelfish&quot; in their ear. In real life, Babel Fish is a language translation program available on the internet. Since the book it appears in was published in 1979, there's no question of which came first.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXYWe find out that the earth was actually created as an organic supercomputer with the sole purpose of determining the answer to life, the universe and everything. Arthur Dent finds himself whisked away from the earth only moments before the earth is destroyed to make way for a intergalactic bypass highway. Unfortunately, this is right before the earth was to have computed the answer to the question. He and Ford (an alien that has been marooned on earth) hitch a ride on the unsuspecting spacecraft that has just caused the destruction of the earth. They continue their hitchhiking journey throughout the galaxy to a ship called the Heart of Gold (which is actually a stolen vehicle). There, they meet with a series of unlikely coincidences thanks to the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ends as the Heart of Gold heads for a bite to eat at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.This series is bizarre comic sarcasm at its best. A smile automatically paints itself on your face as you begin to read. The series reads like a highly improbable dream sequence. I sort of wonder if the author had any conclusion in mind when he wrote it or if he just let the story write itself (not unlike a dream)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"At any given point during reading, I've been either 1) wondering how the author would clear-up the complicated situation he had created in the preceding chapter, or 2) laughing out loud on some seemingly logical, mostly innocuous, but totally nonsense sentences. Dull moments were rare, and fickle as human brains are, even in those moments I found myself cooking up some nonsensical variation on Adams' play-of-words. My only regret is re. the depressed robot Marvin. Though it was initially delightful to imagine a sentient, melancholy machine, in my view Marvin's level of conversation never reached those of the other main characters (Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillian). Marvin kept on wearing the same depressed mold over and over and remained annoying, whereas the other characters remained maddeningly annoying!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sporting the words \\"Dont Panic\\" in large friendly letters the cover to the hitchikers guide conceals such important information as how to see the wonders of the universe for less than 30 altarian dollars a day, how to mix a Jynnin Tonnyx,and which alcoholic games are the most popular the hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy Is an elaborate Textbook reference to anything and everything conceiveable...and quite abit that is beyond our comprehension. This is due to the massExplorative Journalism and Inter-specie Authoring of the Guide.That is The hitchikers guide to the galaxy the Textbook in a nutshell...But to sum up the actual book, written by a one Deceased Douglas Adams (Who Is Greatly Missed...not to mention needed to ensure Disney doesnt fumble with his movie) Would take A) the reading of the rest of the series B) a sense of humour C) a realization of impossiblity and D)A very very very long time to explain all of these things to anyone who is willing to listen.Basically the book is wonderful...pick it up.

This is a kid who hates all books. The only thing you will regret, is that now you'll have to go and buy the rest of them."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's series is arguably one of the greatest satiric productions ever devised by mankind. As for Douglas 'hating' his own books and characters...well, forgive me if I'm a mite dubious. Throughout the books he shows a genuine love for his creations, especially the oft-confused Englishman Arthur Dent and the delightfully odd Ford Prefect. To call these books anything less than a masterpiece of wit is not only an insult to the text, but an insult to one of the greatest comic minds of the 20th century. So he hated his works?? Interesting, since he wrote little else. If he were to denounce Hitchhiker he would basically be dismissing himself as an author.But all retaliatory remarks aside, this book (and all the sequels) is an absolute triumph of the ludicrous over reason, a battle that I wage daily. So treat yourself to a view of the Universe as it should be seen!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams may be the funnies writer I've ever come across. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a witty and hilarious trip that begins with the Earth's untimely destruction for an interstelar bypass. Fortunately, our hero, Arthur Dent, narrowly escapes with his friend, who unbenounced to him, if from a planet near Betelgeuse. Adams' humor ranges from situational to a play on words to social commentary to downright silly. Sometimes, he gets them all going at once. I laughed until the tears rolled down my cheeks in a few spots."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book, which I found entertaining to the end, follows Arthur Dent journey through the galaxy. Earth is destroyed for a galactic freeway. Luckily for Arthur Dent, his best friend Ford Prefect, who is a researcher for \\"The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy\\", saves him by sticking there thumbs out into space. After being picked up, they have a very wild journey through time and space. I would suggest to the readers that if you do not understand what Ford Prefect is saying, or any other alien, that you continue reading because it will either explain its self or it is not important. I read this book and the following 4 books in a volume called \\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" I would recommend that you either be prepared to have all 5 books or buy the volume with all 5 books, since each one leads into the next. Have fun reading this hilarious volume wonderfully written by Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the funniest books in the English language. So much has been written about this book I'm not certain that I can add much more than to say that it's a cross between Monty Python and Arthur C. Clarke. Try to catch the BBC radio version of the book which is currently playing on NPR; Douglas Adams adapted his novel for the radio version so it's true to the source."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams: a satyrist and a lyrical poet. He is at his best when he breaks sci-fi cliches to smithereens, making you snigger or laugh wildly, yet demonstrating a deep feeling of what is the real sense of wonder of space. So, pour example, you have the bickering between cynic Ford Prefect and enthusiast Zaphod about Magrathea...and be caught in awe in the perfectly evocative description of &quot;The fires of dawn! The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm!&quot;. You'll laugh at the quirks of Eddie the Computer, be sympathetic whit poor Marvin, and you'll admire the curious clash of personalities serendipitously reunited...Ford the cynical and resourceful alien that can still be taken aback by an unexpected ruse by the insecure and shellshocked Arthur; the brash bravado of Zaphod,countered by the cool rationality of Trillian. The Planet Building Factory is a very original invention, and Slartibartfast is something of a Doctor Who mingled whit Obi Wan Kenobi...but lacking the self assurance of both. But the best moment of the novel is in the Story of Deep Thought and the Ultimate answer. This is pure Teather of the Absurd, and reminds us of Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan. The message from Tramalfadore could well have been &quot;42!&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's President on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice and fly at the very dangeous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young readers, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. When I read this book, I didn't understand some advanced jokes, and lingered over challenging wording. I was force to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themselves on The Heart of Gold during the ship's improbable journey. Everything seems random as I realized when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This befuddled me until I found that it came from a saying stating, \\"If 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet.\\" This story may be hilarious, but Douglas Adams' terminology often goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at a level too high for most Junior High/High School students, but for me, the laughs in this book far outweighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less savvy readed. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece. I recommend this book to less skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seaching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they are young. However, it will take an older advanced reader to fully take in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When the planet Earth is destroyed by the Vogon alien race in order to build a new hyperspatial express route, Arthur Dent catches a ride with a passing Vogon ship with his alien friend Ford Prefect and rides off on their first adventure. Ford, as a researcher for making the new Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, now goes to make new additions while traveling. As you go discover new members to this group, soon enough, the crew is full of a whole hilarious genre of characters. From the two headed Zaphod to an always-depressed robot name Marvin, this book will make you laugh with jokes on almost every line! As the first book in the trilogy of four, I personally can't wait to read the next one.This book easily gets 5 stars from me, even just based on its comedy and story line. It's a great science fiction that will have you laughing even when making fun of the stupidity of the human race at times. My favorite part was actually in the beginning when Arthur is stressing about his house being torn down, when the whole world is about to explode within the hour! The author, Douglas Adams, uses a unique kind of writing style that always keeps this book interesting, and the way he describes things will keep you connected in the book. He makes up tons of alien words, but still lets you know what he's talking about through mini Hitchhiker's Guide entries.Overall it's a great book, and you should for sure pick it up as soon as possible. Not only will it entertain you with a creative story, it will start you on an adventure throughout the next three books in the series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of the four books in Douglas Adams' trilogy, or so he calls it, as well as one of the funnier books that I have read. This comedy is about a man named Arthur Dent who suddenly becomes at risk of being blown up with the rest of the Earth when it is demolished so that there can be room for an interplanetary highway. He is saved by his alien friend, Ford, by way of hitchhiking onto a Vogon, a rather disgusting and apathetic alien, ship. When they're thrown out of the ship they end up on a new ship, The Heart of Gold, they meet the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebop, and Trillian McMallan, the only other survivor of the demolition of Earth, only because she left earlier. The four of them go on an adventure to a place that no one really knows much about and find out the surprising secrets of the planet makers; Arthur gets a tour of their factory, as well as the secrets of the financers of Earth. I, personally, loved reading this book. The characters were all important to the story and no one of them took the spotlight for too long, they all shared. I particularly liked the humor of the story, it was simple and quick, and the style of writing; it left much for the imagination, making it all in all a great book, not the best I've ever read, but great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To me, there's certain literary classics like Les Miserables, the books about the Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and a lot of Shakespeare books where they're often quoted or referenced and on people's classics of all time list yet how many can actually stomach Les Miserables' 1300 pages? Hitchhiker's Guide is like this only it's very short, funny, and really needs the other books to understand the story.Arthur Dent wakes up in the morning and finds a bulldozer wanting to bring down his house so he lies in front of it. A man named Ford Prefect comes up to him and convinces the bulldozer to not demolish his house. However, an announcement says that a galactic highway(or something, lot of science speak in here) needs to be built and Earth's in the way so Ford and Arthur escape just in time.They eventually get aboard the Heart of Gold, a ship carrying Zaphod, a rather smallminded man who just happens to be President of the Galaxy, his science-y partner Trillian, the ship's computer \\"Eddie\\", and Marvin, the depressed robot, also the Paranoid Android(yes this is a Radiohead song). They then find themselves on a legendary planet which does rather cool business and want to know the answer to Life and Everything.One thing that I didn't care much for was as soon as things were starting to get good then woosh, book's over. Unlike Narnia or Harry Potter which are standalone books, this feels like a big book seperated into smaller books. You could even read one of the Lord of the Rings books without even reading the other 2. Here it's like \\"you just read 200 pages, now buy the other books.\\"However, the book is funny and contains interviews with cast members and a foreword and photos(Zooey Deschanel who plays Trillian is sure hot), just be warned that you'll probably end up getting the others as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love this book! It's just so much fun to read and it's a really exciting story! Everyone who likes sci-fi should read it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Critics call it a \\"romp of cosmic proportions.\\" Many are \\"not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979,\\" and as one clear-minded (and totally spaced-out) Adams' enthusiast points out \\"There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there?\\"What is it about perfectly dry, diaphragm-jiggling British comedy that sets human beings all over the world rocking on their heels with laughter? Its a mystery to me, just like every single one of Douglass Adams' utterly ridiculous topics of sarcasm. I read one review for the book that called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a waste of time, and gave it the most severe form of anti-praise possible by condemning it inferior to the cultured genre of sci-fi novels everywhere. If The Guide made me cry from laughter, then that review made me cry from ignorance. Here is what this sadly unenlightened reader has to say about the book: \\"Total garbage. It didn't make any sense at all. Read the other reviews. Everyone says how wonderful the book is but no one says what the book is about.\\" This guy is obviously a very unappreciative, pea-brained Vogon in disguise, because his sort of poetry is most assuredly not the kind I want to be reading. I wish some practical people could just sit back and enjoy something as marvelous as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, even if their isn't any clear point, if only for its sheer hilarity.While we're in the mood for galactic puns, I will try to be a bit more down-to-earth, as they say, and will concede that there are several points of real relevance in the story. One, Adam's pure sarcasm and mind-bending logic has a gigantic, blaring message: as obnoxious as a bullhorn announcing your impending death by Kill-O-Zap gun for stealing one hell of an expensive government/science project powered by the most improbable form of improbability ever discovered. And that, my friends, is satire. The Universe. It's nothing more than an over-sized and very bizarre perspective of our earth: a whacked-out upside-down kind of microcosm (in reverse)! Throw in a few bureaucratic hyperboles, and you've got a real slap in the face aimed pointedly at many single-minded businessmen. I'd bet you anything that critic was an economist.Just a note on Adams' humor; Be forewarned: don't drink anything before you read it (this is a very dangerous thing to do) and you may want to finalize your will (or your taxes, if you are financially-inclined) before you turn the first page (the one that says \\"for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtonians for tea, sympathy, and a sofa\\") just in case you die of laughter. Also, you may not want to read this book in front of your psychiatrist least they come to believe that their fears have been confirmed and you have indeed gone stark-raving mad (they did predict that was going to happen in the end, after all).Such is the style of the late Mr. Douglas Adams. Oh, he's really a riot (and I say that with all sincerity). Who else could come up with a scenario where two white mice deceive us all and actually control the earth right under our noses? This is how I would define him: A lot of dialogue, a lot of adjectives, and a lot of completely insane British humor. Not only have I closed the book with a zillion new ways to look at our universe, but I've also got a fairly oversized dose of hilarity thrown in the bargain as well (lucky me). If there's someone out there who likes to critique, a sci-fi geek, or a rodent-loving freak who hasn't picked up The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy... jeez.

Now I do for nostalgia's sake, and some of the references no longer hold true (I suppose we can replace our fascinations of digital watches with iPhones now). The thing that makes HGTTG such an extraordinary funny book is the absurdity in the writing, the way that Mr. Adams can turn a phrase and paint the word picture.There are things I wish I would've known before hand that got lost on this American reader when I first got started (like Ford Prefect was named after a car, I don't know why in the American version they just didn't rename him Ford Escort or Ford Crown Victoria), but it didn't detract from my utter enjoyment.If you have some time, read this book, it is truly wonderful.

This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time.

I would have to say that the bst part was you could acually relate to the characters in the book. in a way you find yourself going through all of the troubles. You find yourself in the middle of a situation in which you, just like the character is trying to get out. I think the funniest part of the book is the part where Arther just got to the new galexy and had had to put a fish to his ear if he wanted to speak to people, and when he wanted to understand he had to use a shell. I would have to say my only dislike is that the book goes off on tangents a lot. At times it is hard to go back. Other then that it is a great book.

This book cannot be described by words, or any human emotion. Douglas Adams MUST have had extra-terrestrial help to construct this book. This is beyond human capability. In this story everything hangs together, bonded by sarcasm and laughter. You really get a good look at this world, if you can read it while you're crying your eyes out with laughter. This is a very famous book, and rightly so.

Arthur was saved by his best friend ford prefect,who was not really from the planet earth but some where form the vicinity of Betelgeuse and how the two main characters hitchhike through out the galaxy. in this book you learn about the power's of the universe .the babble fish which is placed in to Arthur's ear so he could under stand how other species talk,the galactic gargle blasters and a paranoid android, also don't forget a towel , You might think that this is just a SCI-fi book and it wont be any good for people who don't like SCI-fi. and if you think that you are wrong , this book may get a little absurd but I liked and it is my dads favorite book . The reason I liked it was that I had looked so hard to find a funny book that didn't include politics and when I read this book it was more than I was looking for . this is one of those kind of books where you read it you let time pass and you read 40 pages and when you realize this then you look back to make sure you did not skip any pages . it is one of those happy go lucky books that are just fun to read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is really awesome. Actually the whole series in one book is really awesome. It's my opinon that Douglas Adams is a genius. Anyway, I saw the movie when I was in Grade 3 (7 years ago) and all I remembered was the scenes taking place on the planet of Magrathea. Six years later I heard the radio broadcasts by mistake (when I went the wrong way on the dial trying to find the CBC in the dark)on Rock 101 CFMI. I seemed to remember the name Arthur Dent, so I asked mom, and she said that it was from the Hitchhiker's Guide. So I got the book from the library and read it and was excruciatingly impressed. This was about a month ago and now I'm reading The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul and have Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective agency on order. In other words I like Douglas Adams.

I know this series has a very loyal following, but I have to say that I think these books are absolute crap! The overall premise is sound...pretty cool in fact, but the books themselves? not so much. The writing is just way below par. This is the sort of book that is based more on gimmicks than story. Things don't have to make sense, because the author will just think of a device to justify them. My favorite (or least favorite) example of this was in the first book (I think) where an invention called \\"improbability drive\\" means that anything can happen, at any time, for absolutly no reason. People can fall out of the sky, time can jump forward, whatever, it doesn't matter. Plot be damned! I dunno...it must have it's merits considering the cult popularity of this book, I just don't see them. It's not that I have no sense of humor, I just think funny things need to make sense too. This book is string of random events stuck together to form a story, and moved along by a cheap plot device. It has it's moments of side-splitting, rolling around on the floor laughter, but they're few and far between. The hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy is fine for a weekend read, just don't expect anything profound, or logical even...but hey, maybe logic is overrated. :-)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Maybe the movie ties it together better. Reading this book was a complete disappointment. I will not be reading anymore of this series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I tried to get into this book years ago when my brother sent me a copy. At the time I had difficulty because it seemed just pointless chatter. Recently I had the opportunity to view the old series on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I read The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The book is wacky and fun, and has more than a mild amount of social criticism concealed in its pages.Since I'd enjoyed Restaurant, I returned to Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and again found it difficult to get into it. I was well into the tale before it seemed worth the effort. Even then I found patches that were dull.Despite the on-again/off-again interest, I did enjoy it over all, partly because I was familiar with the characters from Restaurant. As a first book, it's not bad, but I'm glad I read Restaurant, or I might again have given up on this book.My favorite character here, as in the second book, was Marvin the depressive robot. Most of us probably know someone just like Marvin; I know I do. In fact I've known several. His poorly disguised attempts to gain sympathy and his unwillingness to take it even when it's offered, lest it decrease the satisfaction of his \\"martyrdom,\\" is very funny precisely because one does know people like him.I didn't care much for Beeblebrox, but I don't think you're intended to. (I've known people like him, too.) He's an extreme, the other end of which seems to be Arthur. Because of this, they're both memorable types. Ford on the other hand, after the brief stir created by his introduction, seems so middle of the road that one either confuses him with Arthur or Bebblebrox, depending upon what he's doing or saying at the time. Trilliam, too, gets lost after her introduction. She's very bright but she's just there. She's not independent as a personality. She's a \\"straight man\\" for Beeblebrox and support for Arthur. If she were removed from the book, I don't think it would make the slightest difference, which is too bad. More could have been made of her character than was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...that hasn't already been said?Probably nothing, though it didn't stop all 494 of you from trying.#495"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I WAS EXPECTING THE BOOK TO BE MUCH FUNNIER.

If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all, it was not worth the time for me to read and understand this book, because it didn't catch enough of my interest."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Perhaps this is just another unfortunate example of the hype exceeding the final product, but despite the ubiquitous praise and, more importantly, the highly entertaining book, I found myself ultimately disappointed with the final experience. Sure, Douglas Adams is a funny guy. Sure he's got an astounding imagination, with a gift for the turn of phrase, not to mention the idiosyncratic character. But the absence of one aspect of the experience truly depleted for me what could have been the grand sci-fi/humor classic that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy had been portrayed to me as: the lack of an epic feel.Adams quickly throws us into the midst of the absurd, yet entertaining events of his first novel. If any one thing can detract from this book more than another, it is the pace. It moves fast. It moves very fast, and to an extent I can comprehend how this is necessary. Adams needs to take the reader for a ride, from one local to another, one character to another, one hilarious punch line to another. But in the mean time, the flow of the novel is sacrificed, not to mention coherence, character development, and valuable descriptions of what are certainly some of the most imaginative environments. Instead, Adams takes it on faith that we will fill in all of his numerous blanks. It's no surprise that this novel reads more like the radio show from whence it was born.As far as the story goes, Adams must be commended. He notes in the foreword that he only figured out the plot as he went along, and nonetheless, the structure of the plot certainly doesn't feel that way. The ultimately problem resides in the fact that the entire novel seems unfinished--as he states in his foreword, it was. This is not to criticize his strategy to turn the book into a series (or a trilogy of five books, as he prefers to call it), but more a comment on the conclusion of the first book. It is all well and good to prolong a story over several novels, but the way to make up for it is to give each novel its on independent narrative arc, making it more of an episode in a series rather than the first act. Unfortunately, any reader whose interest is remotely piqued will be forced to buy the subsequent novels simply to understand the first.But ultimately, the novel--and hopefully the remaining books in the series--are purely entertaining and fun. Indeed, there is much I can criticize, but nonetheless it is oftentimes overshadowed by the fun and funny style and story presented in the text. At the very least, I can say that Adams has a grand gift. Narrative humor tales are few and far between today, and so The Hitchhiker's Guide takes the tally as certainly one of the better representatives in that genre. The book still possesses all the potential to be a truly great masterwork, even the sci-fi/-humor epic that Adams intended. Comprehensively, however, it fails to encapsulate the image of the galaxy rather than just the style."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As it seems most people love this book, I am a voice of the silent minority, or perhaps majority. Anyways, they are silent so no one really knows. This book did not have much going for it except for the fact that it weighs in at a slight 320 pages. With the Harry Potter books approaching 1000, 320 is slight. The problem with this book lies in the fact that it never ends.Despite a mildly engaging premise, the book quickly lapses into slapstick humor and cheap laughs. The poetry fiasco being the first of many encounters sprinkle throughout this book. My main quarrel with this book is actually in the ending, I would say spoiler alert, but there is no ending to spoil for anybody. The characters simply get back onto their ship and the book is over. I actually found myself turning the page expecting some sort of conclusion.Now, not every book without an ending is bad. Take Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.(spoiler) Even though the main character meets his end on the last page without any sort of fanfare or conclusion, the ending is so well crafted that the reader is not left feeling lost. After all, the world ended, why shouldn't the main character. But in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the characters just continue on as if nothing has happened. The reader is faced with many unanswered questions about what will happen next and why the earth is so unimportant. Call me earthcentric, but I don't know what Douglas Adams has against humans and the earth.I know many people love this book and I am not here to argue with their views, but the other side's views need to be expressed. So, if you open this book with the expectation of it being anything more than a collection of anectdotes without conclusion, I do not recommend this book. Find yourself a nice book that will leave you feeling full."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"the book had that old book smell and the pages were tinged a little yellow, but there were no missing pages or rips, as well as no marks to the cover or pages."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Rest of the book is pretty good too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, deals with Arthur Dent, a survivor of the destruction of the planet Earth by the green sluggish Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

At least, not all the way through. Sure, I have tried in the past to get interested in a book, but I've never found a book that captured me to the point that I actually finished it. I've graduated high school, and I even have a year of college under my belt, and I somehow managed to do it all without reading any of the required material from any class.Then one day in the summer of 2001, I make my regular visit to Slashdot, to find that an English fellow by the name of Douglas Adams had died. The news post had 600+ comments on it from other Slashdot readers, so I knew this was someone big, but I had never heard of him. Well I did a little bit of searching and found that he almost has a cult following, so I decided to check it out. The thought of trying to read *another* book was definitely unappealing, but so many people had so many great things to say about him and his works, so I decided to go for it.1 month later I had finished all five books in this series, and it remains, to this day, the only book(s) I have finished completely... And I have tried diligently to find other books to capture my imagination like these books did.It's really tough to call these \\"books,\\" because they are so much more than that. They all have a very unique life and soul to them... They're so warm and friendly, so comforting and relaxing... And ever so funny. It's also really hard to explain what's so darn funny about them. Adams doesn't make any punchlines, he just tells the story... But the way things work out, and the way people say things, you find yourself cracking up much more often that you'd think.I know, you're probably thinking, \\"The way they *say* things is funny? This is just text!\\" Well there's a point to that. But the other side of the story is that these characters really become a part of you, and when you're reading, you begin to act everything out in your head... You can see the people, the spaceships, the planets, the wild locations, the facial expressions... And it really starts to turn into a movie inside your head.This series of books has forever changed my life. I look at everything in a new perspective, I have a new appreciation for a lot of things (You start to realize what you've got when you read about a guy who travels through the galaxy with almost nothing except a towel), and I have an almost renewed sense of humor. I can not say enough about this wonderful series, and my only wish is that Douglas Adams were still alive so I could thank him myself for writing such an inspiring work.If you are even remotely considering purchasing this book, I would wholeheartedly urge you to give it a shot. It's only [price] for the greatest piece of literature you could ever hope to own... And if your life isn't somehow changed by this book, or the series that it belongs to, then I think you need to re-evaluate yourself; You could be missing your soul."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This has to be the funniest book I have ever read.

Having been promised that, I picked it up and thoroughly enjoyed the high-minded wit and glee that endows THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. That and the book is rather short, making it perfect for when the mood calls for light reading but not junk food. Adams obviously had fun with this, kicking at all matter of conventions, including the genre in which he chooses to phrase his satire. His quintet of travelers are personable, even the self pitying robot. Written some time ago, the book presages some technology that is beginning to appear now; the titular travel guide referenced throughout the book, for which one character is a writer, resembles a Palm Pilot, for instance. My only complaint as an outsider to the genre is that there is no real climax and resolution in the story; after the initial, hilarious exposition, it heads into episodic adventure and just ends en route to another destination.

ITs basically about a simple man, Arthur Dent, who is warned by his alien friend, Ford Perfect, that the world is about to be destroyed. Only for the use of interstellar highway. The rest of the tale is about Arthur traveling around with Ford and discovering new people and new things in the vastness of the universe. The Novel was very intersting becuase the characters were very witty, though very funny at the same time. The book is very enjoyable to read and makes you laugh. This is a book for anyone! Male, female, whether u are intersted in science fiction, comedy, or approach it at a logical angle, this book has it all in one! If you like thinking, laughing and interesting novel about the univerese and its humours happenings with funny characters this is most definitally your book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was everything I expected. I was really looking for a humorous sci-fi action packed trip and I was not disappointed at all. Reading this book was similar to the experience I got from the movie Men In Black. The Guide is similar in the way it depicts the univers as simply a zany place to be, full of action and swashbuckling adventure interspersed with a funny undertone. Ive read books before that followed this sort of humourous angle, but mostly turned out to be silly. The Hitchhiker's Guide may not have the most developed characters, but it has a unique charm that draws you into the action and keeps you there with a laugh and leaves you with a cliffhanger ending. The best time to read this book is right after you've just read something overly serious, epic, boring, or studious. Another book I would recommend that has this same similar sci-fi/humor relationship is a book by Piers Anthony called Prostho Plus. Pick up this book, but consider investing in the novel that encompasses all three books in the trilogy. Surely, if you only read this one, you will want more."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was everything I expected.

This is Alice in Wonderland of the 21st Century. The book is very funny, yet fast paced with plenty of action. I am not going to give you brief content of the plot, read it for yourself. Just take my word for it - the book is awesome. Douglas Adams reads it himself, and he is a wonderful narrator (unlike Stephen King, who is a horrible narrator yet still insists on reading his own books). This was very enjoyable. It's aweful that Douglas Adams died so young. I enjoyed his books so much that I take it as a personal loss."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very funny and interesting. Earth is destroyed, and mice are actually OUR owners. Humans WERE the third most intelligent species on the planet, but the earth was actually a computer designed by mice to give the ultimate question, to which we know the answer- forty-two. Adams keeps you entertained and begging for more with his dry and witty humor. The insane improbabilites are only matched in this world by what will happen next in this entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a book that really knows where its towel is. It has anything you may even dream about finding in a comedy book. It has missiles, sperm whales, potted plants, people with two heads, and these all just happen to be on the same page. When reading this you are nearly guaranteed nonstop laughter. Well I can't say nonstop, because you have to breathe at some point. This may sound an overstatement but I do not believe that it is. My parents banned me from reading this book after dark because I kept them up at night.Now some of the humor may seem a bit childish but we all have to be a little childish at times lest we go crazy, and act really childish all the time. This book is nearly unbearably clean humor, in a good way. It proves that toilet humor is most definitely outdone by nonsensical humor.I don't believe that you can just take the word of some random stranger and go read a book so what I would recommend you do is go to your local library, find this book, get some help if you need it, check it out, drive home and read. Don't buy this book because, you know, not every book is for everyone. This is how to read books and find out what you like. And if you like this book, tell someone. They will be happy to hear it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the whole 'trilogy' of five...and loved every syllable.

But a note of caution: Make sure you read all five, but do so in the RIGHT [chronological] order. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the story of an ordinary Englishman (complete with all the nuances and eccentricities that usually accompany) and his extraordinary companions from various other points in the galaxy. It is the story of the destruction of the Earth to make way for a hyper-space expressway. It is the story of the theft of a starship that has the ability to pass through all points in the known and unknown universe simultaneously (talk about the perpetuity for getting lost). It is also the story of the discovery that the goings on on the recently demolished planet Earth held a lot more universal significance than was generally thought by its former inhabitants - which isn't surprising considering that it is also revealed that those who thought they were the most intelligent beings on the planet were actually only the third most intelligent.Douglas Adams has the very unique gift of being able to successfully bend science fiction with British humor. His observations are hilarious, intelligent and are very true to life. He is also has the propensity to be able to show just how silly people can be as well as how dependent they can be on their technology.This book is the first in a trilogy of five books (please don't ask me to explain) including \`The Restaurant at the End of the Universe', \`Life, the Universe and Everything', and \`So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish' and now a fifth book entitled \`Mostly Harmless'. The story of \`The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is based upon a radio program Douglas Adams originally wrote for the BBC in the early 80's with some changes thrown in to solve some continuity problems as well as some back-story. There are also several books on the original radio scripts that are work checking out as well as condensed versions of the radio show that are available on various media.It's a must read for any fan of science fiction - especially anyone who enjoys British humor. It's one of those books that can be read over and over again without diminishing its freshness. In any incarnation, it is a very enjoyable series and well worth taking the time to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For readers not too enthusiastic about the vision of a futurehumanity trapped in a maze of the ultimate machines, Adams hasan optimistic insight, unusual for a science fiction writer.You can summarize it in a sentence: this ultimate machine,which will do everything and will make us practically dispensable -well, this machine will have a button, and this button won't work. For itwas built by this ridiculous remnant of those old times - Man.Or perhaps the machine will work, but won't do the thingswritten on its package. Or do them, but not exactly. Very not exactly.In a media enchanted with super technology and hyper machinesthere is nothing more refreshing than this basic insight, whichturns and flipps the narrative of the novel to the most unexpected,grotesque and hilarious directions, leading it to an orgyof the destruction of meaning.very funny and optimistic in it's weired way - maybe one of the fewways open to optimism in our all to serious world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Every person who has even the slightest bit of nerd in them has been exposed to references from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. People make references to it damn near constantly. Before reading it, I imagined what a wonderful story I must be missing out on. Finally, I got around to reading it for myself. The story itself is painfully dull and pointless. Adams' writing style is distracting and juvenile; not juvenile in a lighthearted storytelling sort of way way, but juvenile in way like it might literally have been written by someone in middle school. Names like Zaphod Beeblebrox and Slartibartfast for example. I imagine Adams sitting at his type writer trying to think of a name and not coming up with anything so he just starts speaking in tongues letting his mouth move about while doing an impression of Corky from Life Goes On. Eventually the random combination of palatal fricatives and lateral approximants formed these combinations of sounds at which point Adams shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Slatribarfast, good enough'.But it's not the writing style or the non-existent story that makes me hate the book. It's that before when I heard a reference to this book I would imagine the smart witty story that went along with it. I imagined the epic tale that was waiting for me someday when I actually got around to reading it. I looked forward to the day when I would get where the references fit in and smile knowingly along with those people who have read the book. Instead I will now frown when I hear those references. In a sense the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is stunningly hilarious, it's one big twisted joke like the infamous 'Man Eating Chicken.' I imagine that on the last page, of the last book Adams probably delivers the master punchline by revealing that anyone who made it that far is now infinitely aware of the horror that is Vogon poetry."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Oops. Did I just say that here? That can't be a very popular thing to say here, what with about 500 people giving it 5 star reviews. But again: Not That Funny. Well, now you're thinking that this guy just doesn't get it, has no sense of humor, etc. But I don't think that's it. I believe I have a good sense of humor; I think Monty Python and The Holy Grail is hilarious, as well as many other British comedies. I also like Science Fiction. I wanted to like the book; the concept is hilarious and it seems like it would be something I would really enjoy. But it is not done well. The biggest problem is that for the most part the laughs are far apart, and not all that funny. And it just doesn't work as SF without the humor. You should do yourself a favor and, before you buy it, read 5 or 10 pages next time you're at the bookstore. I'd bet that there will be a lot of you that aren't that impressed. If you're still reading this (and I have my doubts) let me recommend an alternative: Doorways In The Sand by Roger Zelazny. This has some similar elements to Hitchhiker's Guide (aliens posing as humans) and is witty, clever and highly readable. Zelazny at his peak. If you like Hitchhikers I promise you will like this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams mixes dry British humor with science fiction to produce an astounding novel satirizing the arrogance of human beings on Earth. This novel is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This novel begins with Arthur Dent trying to stop bulldozers from destroying his home in order to build a new superhighway. He meets a guy named Ford Prefect. Prefect hitches a lift right before the Earth is demolished by alien Vogons. The author satirizes humans' trust in technology and philosophy in this story. He uses quirky phrases that are so stupid and out of this world one has to wonder what he was on while writing this novel. This novel causes me to laugh aloud. I think anyone who enjoys sarcasm and satire will love this book. It's easy to read once the science fiction is gotten past. This a great novel in order to appreciate twisted British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a normal man (Arthur), and an alien man (Ford) in their quest throughout the universe. These two men get swept off earth right before it turns into gravel for a highway. These two men then travel from ship to ship, and from planet to planet in the search to complete a book on everything.My favorite part of this book had to be when the two men where inside of a planet trying to get away from these guards. The guards had come after them because they where trying to protect a wanted man. During this scene though, the two cops where shooting at Ford, Arthur, and Zaphod. During the fire though the two parties where talking about how they shouldn't be shot and how they had to shoot at them. Soon this all stopped when the two cops had been shot in their air supply but something unknown.I would not recommend this book to people with an undeveloped sense of humor. This book includes many jokes for older people and many scenes that don't seemed to be finished. During this book you are reading in Fords' point of view then without realizing it you are now reading in Arthur's viewpoint. These sudden switches lead me to confusion and didn't allow me to see the moral of the story. After reading this book and kind of realizing some of the jokes and meanings, I realized the author has good ideas but i don't think he expresses them well. This caused me to not like the book and discouraged me from wanted to read any more of his books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you've watched the movie, read the book.If you've read the book, don't watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can we say about this book? Something that has so thoroughly entered the lexicon and mindset of the people in the late 20th century and early 21st century can only be regarded as a great book. It has had an incalculable effect on the genre of science-fiction. Deep Thought and HAL (of 2001, A Space Odyssey) have completely created the idea of artificial intelligence and a writer can't begin to write a phrase uttered by a computer intelligence without dealing with that reality. If it teaches the genre anything, it teaches it the importance of humor. We have said that some writers are too ugly: M. John Harrison's Light suffers from this; China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and The Scar suffer from this; the classic Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever suffered from this; hundreds of overly-pretentious, read-it-it's-good-for-you-just-like-broccoli books published every year all suffer from this same fact. Laughter is very, very important to the human condition and it can't be ignored successfully. It is wrong to dismiss The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a flight of fancy but ultimately unimportant; it is, in fact, tremendously instructive.WHO SHOULD READ:Everybody should read this book. Everybody. There really is no audience that it can't appeal to. Children as young as 12 or 13 can enjoy as equally as codgers in their 70's. The institutions that Adams was bashing so many years ago are just as relevant today. It's a slender book, a fast read, and widely respected and, as such, comes with a pedigree. We're not sure if the movie will be anywhere near as good as the books (though we have hopes given the success of the radio series) but to the extent that it inspires more sales of this book, so much the better for our world.WHO SHOULD PASS:There is a certain group of people--a people suffering from a strange psychiatric illness--that have no sense of humor. These are the people most often associated with enforcing political correctness. They are the people claiming offense and injury at all audible and epistolary provocation. They are the people who think children shouldn't run or laugh but sit still and silent until spoken to. They are the tragic wastrels of a life fiercely lived with a clutching, grasping notion of universal justice, imposing order (most often religious), and political retribution. They are the people who leave shopping carts abandoned in the parking lots because \\"those people\\" are paid to put them away. Douglas Adams will be entirely lost on these individuals. They should return to reading whatever hate-inspired literature that teaches them to abhor who they are, where they live, and that people exist at all.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ok, honestly, Hitchhiker's Guide is one of the funniest things I've ever read.Was I touched?

If your into the whole space-fantasy thing then you will love this book. There were some random parts that didn't even really relate to the plot that stuck with me and were actually very very funny. You really need to have an open sense of humor and can handle a lot of different types. There is a lot of cynical humor, and some cracks about British people. Actually now that i think about it, this book is very satirical and if your one of those people who really hates the world and human culture then this is the book is for you! This book will make you laugh out loud.After reading it I want to read the rest of the hitch-hikers series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker&#65533;s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the funniest books I have ever read. In fact, it probably is the funniest book I have ever read. The story starts off simple, but gets more and more complicated and detailed, with many seemingly meaningless happenings. As the plot thickens, Aurthur Dent, the main character, gets more confused and out of the loop, and keeps getting more confused throughout the series. Aurthur Dent is the last surviving human from Earth after the Vogons blow it up to make way for an interstellar bypass. Aurthur is led by his alien friend and fellow hitchhiker, Ford Prefect through the adventures this catastrophe leads to, but most importantly, he is guided by The Hitchhiker&#65533;s Guide to the Galaxy. This book is full of exciting twists and turns, and will leave you wanting more of this hilariously and ironically complicated book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The best book I have read in recent memory was A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I also recommend all of the other books by in this series, although I don't recall their names. The sequel to this book is called something like the restaurant at the edge of the universe or something like that. A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, is an extremely entertaining book. It takes place in a Galaxy that is quite different from our own. The book doesnt really have a clear plot but does feature hundreds of strange technologies and many different species. The book is written in a pretty random style so you never really know whats going to happen or what tangent the author is going to fly off on. I recommend this book to any one and every one. Especially those who enjoy science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've never read a book quite like this one. Douglas Adams is a very creative and original writer whose ideas cause you to think about the universe in a new way.

All in all a really fun read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is what historians call a &quot;classic&quot; - at least, if we travelled into the future, it's what we will have called it. That is, if the Earth is still around.Read it before you're demolished by Vogons."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How many books try to combine two very different types of writing, let alone do it successfully? Well, Douglas Adams has done just that in this little book, and he alone rules this genre of sci-fi comedy. He has weaved together some wild futuristic scenarios using an improbability drive, the Vogons, the planet factory, the mice, and of course the guide - always with unpredictable British dry wit. The contrast of Zaphod (the care-free, figure-head galaxy President), Ford (the partying hitchhiker and reporter), Trillian (the mysterious woman), and Arthur (the bewildered last man on earth) is fantastic! Many sci-fi books have a robot, but how many are depressed and cynical? Guess what, Marvin is. Adams even throws in a some social commentary, which just makes you laugh at the way some things go around here. The fast-paced action and humor will always keep your attention as you learn why the earth was created and the answer to the question of the life, the universe, and everything.This book is a classic in both science fiction and comedy. It's a quick read, and you probably won't put it down. Unless, of course, you find out that the earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass and you've got almost no time get off!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've read Gone with the Wind more times than I can count. I read Charlotte's Web in 1st grade.

My mother and I happened to be in a bookstore recently and I was becoming very ed up with the selections we were going to buy. Then, on my way out, this book caught my eye. 'Douglas Adams,' I thought. 'I know him. He made the great, mind boggling game I have at home. maybe I'll give his book a shot.'Now, it takes alot for me to be impressed by a book, being that I get through them so fast. It frustrated me when I realized that this book wasn't going to be a fast-read, like the usual stuff I read.True, it took me longer than usual, but when you take it slow, you catch these *gems* that make you laugh. I suppose that my being cynical has much to do with my liking towards this book, but I think that if you're impressed with the way that he describes earth, in the begining of the book, than the rest will be a sure ride from there.If not, you can always sell it at a garage sale...but then again, who knows when you'll need a good mind teaser..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Between his own tilted perspective and his sarcastic puns, I couldn't stop laughing.

At others, like watching a Monty Python sketch that drags way too long."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Arthur is thrust into situations where he loses limbs. At other times, he is suddenly thrown out into space with only 30 seconds to live.

I must admit that there were occasions I laghed out loud while reading the book. The author's humour, his sarcasm for the significance of the human race and it's place in the galaxy, as well as his absolutely whacky plot are probably the highlights of this book.

(Did I spell that right?) I had a few good chuckels with this one. I like how the author, Douglas Adams, sometimes strayed from the plot, wich was a nice break from the story. I could relate to the main character, Arther Dent, who was just a normal guy who got swept off his feet into a world were the impossable can happen. The style of writting is excelent and makes ful use of the interesting settings and events. I liked the supporting characters, too. Each had their own destinct view on life and the universe. The Bad: The main character didn't interact withe the supporting cast enouf. He barly even talked with one of the most interesting character. I would have liked them to continue fighting and not getting along. Aurther Dent is to normal. He should have had more to do with the story. I felt like the author was just using him as a camera, to take pictours and not to interact withe the world.

I *LOVE* everything Douglas Adams haswritten -- including this book, The Hitchhiker's Guide...This review is NOT a review of the BOOK.

The Reason I read this book was, pretty much, because the movie was comeing out, and I didn't want to see it with out reading the Book first. I'm Glad I did beacause if i had seen the movie first it would have ruined the book for me. The one thing that I noticed about this book was it's so great that you read it really fast, and when u finish you wish you hadn't read it as fast as you did.Anyway I've never Read anything like this book and probably never will again. I recomend this book to any one who likes to read good books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Despite the trashing that this book has taken on the review boards this book was rated one of the Top 100 Books of the Twentieth Century. Why? It mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy and humor of everything in human society, from the ridiculous to the sacred. Examples - the ridiculousness of atheism (Babel fish), inherent human supremacy (dolphins and fiendishly clever mice), ethical conundrums (Lintilla), engineers (Zlarty Bartfast), egomaniacal thieves (Zaphod Beeblebrocks), economists (defoliating the planet to increase the value of the leaf as currency), philosophers (the Babel fish again), inefficiency of governments (the destruction of the Earth), and myriad others. I have gotten more enjoyment from this book than almost anything else I have ever read. It is also worth every cent to purchase the BBC audio adaptation of the story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I re-read this book after far too many years away, but found that it hasn't stood the test of time all that well. The humor and style are still there. I still wish that I could writing as wittily as Douglas Adams. The plot, however, begins to crumple after too many re-examinations. So do the characters. Arthur Dent just isn't that exciting a hero. This book is best considered as a clever satire on sci-fi conventions and on the world at large.Why have I found this beloved book to be wanting? Perhaps it's exposure to some of Adams' later works, where plot plays more of a role and where characters come to life more (I think - next up will be a return to the second HGTG book and to Zaphod's harrowing adventures). Perhaps it's the bitter taste left by the fourth and fifth books in the series, written by someone who didn't care anymore. And perhaps it's exposure to the works of Terry Pratchett, Adams' equivalent in the fantasy genre. Whereas Adams was content in this book to simply have fun making fun, Pratchett develops some of the most intriguing heroes and villains and ordinary people and makes you feel at home on the Discworld, which is really just a good metaphor for our world. Adams doesn't really seem to like people that much, but Pratchett does.Still, any sci-fi fan or fan of Monty Python should give this and its first two sequels a try. Adams is a great wordsmith, and his departure from novels for other pastures is a bit of a loss."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well just wrapped up this book...And unlike other reviewers, I promise I wont write a book report giving every thing away.Any hoots, this book did have some laugh out-loud moments. After the first few though you began to see the setup long before the punch. Some long roads were traveled to get to the 'funny' and at times were a little too predictable.This type of humor has been played out to death since the time of this books writing. So the wit-factor is just not there.At times I got the impression this book had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. Almost as if it was not really thought out and planned but more just banged out and made up as Adams went along.Well all the reviews loving this back can't be wrong either. I guess this book is really more not to my personal taste. Thats my review and I'm sticking to it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"That book could be rewritten as a good 20-page short story. That would be room enough for all the witty comparisons and good ideas it has. Also, the true randomness of the writing would still be interesting as a novelty.As a full-length book, it is a disaster. There's no plot, no characters, the randomness doesn't make any sense. If you shuffle the chapters the book would probably be as readable as it is now. It reminds me of some writing I and my friends did when we were 11 years old, only duller.I don't understand the high praises it has.BTW, I like a lot \\"nonsense\\" humor from people like Monty Python. You might call it nonsense but what they do is precisely crafted."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I saw the many reviews of this first volume in the then trilogy and decided to dig out my first edition and check the notes I had written at the time. As you can see by the score, I was not as entralled by this novel as the more recent readers seem to be. It seems to be so much hype for a novel that appeared in the just reinvigorated sci-fi world of the early 80s.It is okay reading for young adults, but not for the seasoned sci-fi reader."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the story of an Englishman called Arthur Dent, and how he's saved from the destruction of the planet Earth by his friend Ford Perfect, who's in fact not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.I read this book because I wanted to do so before seeing the film, and because I wanted to know the Answer to the Great Question to Life, the Universe and Everything (well to tell you the truth, I actually knew the Answer, but I wanted to know the Question, too), and because I'm a great fan of English humour (Pratchett, Monty Pythons). But overall, I was a teensy-weensy bit disappointed, probably because I'd heard so much praise about it, I really expected to laugh my buttocks off, and I didn't. OK, I chuckled quite a bit and even guffawed sometimes, but it wasn't as hilarious as I thought it'd be.You've got to love Marvin the paranoid android though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sebastian EstenssoroMrs. SmithEnglish I/ 3rd HourFebruary 22, 2004The Hitchhiker's Guide To The GalaxyIn The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses Situational irony against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. He and his friend, Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years, are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. Their rescue was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. On his journey through space, Arthur discovers many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and that the Earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes the book a hilarious and entertaining read.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is completely full of situational irony that enhances the novel's over all effect on the reader. In the beginning of the book, a alien warship comes to destroy the planet Earth to make room for an interstellar bypass. Similarly, on Earth, the main character, Arthur Dent, has been trying for days to stop a wrecking crew from destroying his house to make room for a interstate highway. The alien ship says that a notice has been posted 300 light-years away at their home planet, and that the inhabitants of earth have had thirty years to see the notice. The alien invaders promptly destroy the earth seconds before it completes its function. To find the question to the ultimate answer, forty-two. Arthur and Ford are rescued by the heart of gold, a ship that has just been invented it is so advanced that it makes interstellar bypasses no longer need by the universe.All these events are situational irony. The fact that the alien wrecking crew posted a notice 300 light-years away from earth and expected the humans to read it and lodge a complaint against the rest of the galaxy is very ironic. Also in this book, the earth is a giant supercomputer that has been working for billions of years to find the question to the ultimate answer. Five minutes before it has completed its task, it is destroyed by the alien demolition crew. Many other ironic situations exist in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, everything from extremely depressed robots, a universe contained in a piece of sponge cake, and how mice have secretly been controlling humans since the beginning of time.It is because of all these ironic situations in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that make this a very entertaining book. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony definitely enhances the overall meaning of the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book I read was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. I am so glad that my english teacher, who shall remain nameless, recommended this book. It was an excellent book. The storyline kept me so hooked that I enjoyed reading every bit of it. The characters were very unique and humorous at the same time. Now Douglas Adams isn't any ordinary writer, Adams had an unusual way of writing conversations. This only made it better though. From what I hear, almost every book has a theme, but I could not find the theme in this book. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in my opinion, was a book writen only to make others laugh, not to teach a lesson. One of my favorite conversations in this book was,\\"You want me,\\" said Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, \\"to come and lie there...\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In front of the bulldozer?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Instead of Mr. Dent.\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In the mud.\\"\\"In, as you say, the mud.\\" -p.17.This conversation went on and on and kept me laughing the entire time. I would have to recommend this book to others for a number of reasons. The most important reason is the fact that this is one of the only books that I have ever read that actually made me laugh. I would definatly have to say that this book is one of my favorite books right now. I used to hate reader so much, that the mere sight of a book got me angry. After reading this book, I probably will never hate reading again. This book makes reading fun. Another reason is that this is a book that my namless english teacher enjoyed reading as well, therefore making it teacher approved. If I ever had, or wanted to read this book again, I would probably enjoy it just as much as the first time, and I am sure you would too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is a wonderfully paced comical satire on ... life the universe and everything. Filled superb writing and quirky storyline this book is short enough to read in one day. Thankfully there are four sequels in this trilogy there is no shortage of adventures and insane situations for Arthur, Zaphod, Ford, Trillian, Marvin and whoever is met page to page. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rambling humor. While the book is confusing, it only makes you want to turn the pages more. The writing style reminded me of Joseph Heller. I may be one of a handful of people who have ever compared Heller to Adams, but the irreverence and the quick chatter gave me a definite feel of Heller. One of these reviews said that this book was a great work of British comedy, don't let that scare you, it is really a great work of comedy. Also don't let the Science Fiction genre scare you either.

He is saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien who has been stranded on earth for 15 years while trying to write an update to the now outdated Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five. It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2).The best part of this book is being introduced to the wonderful cast of characters that Adams has created, especially Arthur and Marvin. If you have a sense of humor, they will make you laugh. There's not much of a plot to speak of, which is the book's major weakness. However, it is an appropriate setup to the rest of the series, and I would definitely advise everyone to at least read this initial installment before plunging into any of the other installments.My advice: read it. Expect a classic, but don't expect the greatest that Adams has to offer (that, in my humble opinion, would be the fourth book, SLATFATF)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book about a book.

I loved the unexpected jokes, the whimsical names, and the way millions of years of anticipation and egos are deflated by single hilarious sentences.HOWEVER, I agree with several other reviewers that this book is way too short.

The reviews simply split into two camps. The 'I didn't get it' camp was home to a small, and unfortunately quite vocal, minority who simply thought the plot was confusing or the author was 'dumb' or some such schtick. Not to berate these readers, some were genuinely confused, but the sole reason they didn't like it is that they didn't *get it*. The people who understood the context of the novel, grasped its underlying satirical genius, loved it.

I usually hate those kinds of books, and I'm also not a big fan of Sci-Fi books in general, but this book was quite funny in certain places and I got a kick out of reading it. I particularly liked the part where the police officers discussed how they were really sensitive literary people during their big shoot out.I wouldn't be surprised if I finished the entire Hitchhiker series because the first book is pretty funny as far as written works go, and I would imagine the whole series would move as fast as this book does.

Very good book for people who enjoy funky reading!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read! It is so well written. I usually don't like science fiction, but this book captivated me. I really like Douglas Adams's style of writing.

It's funny, eeasy to read, but realy captivating, I read the whole thing in only 2 days, that's how captivationg it was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"All of the sci-fi books that I have read are pretty much about the same thing. It was getting boring, until I picked up The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. This book is about Arthur Dent, who has a friend, Ford Prefect, from a foreign planet writing a book, when he says that the world is going to explode. This is the adventure through space to stay alive.My favorite part of the book is in the beginning when Arthur finds out that his house has to be demolished.'\\"But the plans were on display...\\"\\"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\\"\\"That's the display department\\"\\"With a flashlight.\\"\\"Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.\\"So had the stairs.\\"\` This is one of my favorite parts because it just really sticks out in my mind and stays there. Another one of my favorite parts is when the Guide is speaking.'Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm the Galaxy lies a small unrewarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the idea of digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerted with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.' I find this funny because it sounds a lot like me and my friends, because we are amused easily.This book isn't like any other sci-fi book. I like it a lot because it is very funny and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone for its humor and adventure. It reminds me of Star Wars, except that it's not about jedi's, the force, and Yoda. I would say always have a towel on hand, and don't panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The \\"fight scenes\\" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. \\"We don't want to shoot you!\\" \\"Well, that suits me just fine!\\" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?). The chapter on the philosophers literally had me laughing out loud. No matter who you are, there's got to be SOME kind of humor in here for you!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had read this book quite some time ago, and I somehow misplaced it over the years.

A great book and a great product combine.....let me get my towel!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My interest with this series of books began when I started with the Time Warner Cable National Division. The trainer, who had just started as well, created a Hitchhiker's Guide to Cable(we still use this reference today). The test accounts in our billing system were built with the character names from this book. So, I watched the movie and loved it. I promptly purchased the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and placed it on my bookshelf. It sat there for 4 years until Saturday when I choose it for my next book using a very complicated system called the alphabet(Adams, Douglas).That said, I must tell you that I love Stephen Fry. His reading of this book was so perfect. What a lovely man. And what a lovely, hilarious book. Mr. Adams, I wish you were still with us."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this as a boy and now my daughter (10) and I listen to it on Books on Tape on long trips: we laugh hard and long every time. Now we are reading it together before she goes to bed every night and it is an absolute hoot. Fall-down funny! Seeing and hearing her laughter at the very jokes that still amuse me if one of life's great pleasures.I love the laid-back swinger's voice that Ford Prefect adopts, the twisted logic of his arguments, Dent's continual flusteredness, the digressions, everything about the book.I have to think that Adams himself must have been a great friend and lover of life. Can't say enough good about the book or its author.Reading it now, and this will seem like a stretch, I am reminded of The Lord of the Rings. Many people have commented on Tolkien's ability to make Middle Earth seem like a land steeped in a history and literature of its own by citing scraps of poetry and historical figures without completely explaining them. Adams' digressions have the same effect, in a comic key (a great example of this is the description of Old Janx Spirit at the beginning of the book, and the blues-ish ditty of which it was the subject). This style makes an otherwise simple tale much more absorbing than a bare retelling of the plot would suggest.I envy anyone who is opening this book for the first time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and it met them all. There is a story in here somewhere, as an undercover alien rescues his buddy just before Earth gets destroyed, then they hitch a ride on a crazy new spaceship, but the plot is not what provides the pleasure in this book. Adams had me laughing out loud multiple times with his nearly-nonsensical asides. For example, there's a tense scene, and all of the characters are transfixed on something Very Important, but one of the minor characters starts humming ironically because he hates everyone else so much. Just one line, never followed up anywhere, but it's a brilliant way to get a laugh while engaging in consistent characterization. There's also a deliciously absurd chapter about how one line of dialogue gets caught up in a space-time wormhole thing and starts a massive galactic war and leads to a charmingly unsuccessful invasion of Earth. This book didn't teach me any Valuable Life Lessons or enrich my view of Life, the Universe, and Everything, but it made me laugh a great deal, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I look forward to reading other books in the \\"trilogy.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book that takes us all around the universe through the life of two hitchhikers. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams. The general purpose of the book is that humans are not the smartest beings in the universe or even the planet. The intended audience would be teenagers to adults. People who are looking for an interesting science fiction book should read this book because, it is very interesting, and because of all the events in the book it makes the reader not want to stop reading.This Science Fiction book has one of the most unbelievable plots, I have ever read. It starts off with Arthur Dent, the main character of the book, and he has just found out his house is being demolished for a highway system. At the very same time this even occurs, Vogons(aliens) are getting ready to destroy earth for a hyper-drive system. Only seconds from extinction, Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, grabs on to him, and hitchhikes onto the Vogon ship. This jump to the ship, sets Arthur and Ford, on an amazing journey. Ford meets an old friend Zaphod, and Arthur meets Trillian, a girl he met at a party on Earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I didn't expect to laugh out loud reading this.

Just a great book, and if you like this one, read the other four! They're great!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're considering buying this book it is worth the investment. The only problem with it is that you will want to read all of the rest of the trilogy. This is probably the best book I've ever read with the possible exception of &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; which is even more bizarre and delightful."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is amazingly funny. It is totally unlike any sci-fi book you've ever read (unless you've already read one of the trilogy), and cannot fail to amuse even the most uniterested of people.It's characters are all interesting in their own right, with the arrogance of Zaphod, the ignorance of Arthur and the know-all-ness of Ford providing a for a totally original revelation in science fiction.It will suit all types of reader, never failing to amuse. Adams' flippant style is allways engaging and no-one can fail to admire his style, as well as the many amusing plot distractions that seem almost unique to his writing.To breifly summurize the plot: a simple Earthman, Arthur Dent, discovers that a good friend of his is actually an alien working for a remarkable guide to the galaxy. This alein friend, Ford Prefect, rescues Arthur from the planet Earth which is demolished and takes him on a highly entertaing, spin around the galaxy in which they are both blown up more times than is healthy, and are almost totally deprived of tea.The first time I read this was in Wales, and this book alone kept me sane during the week I was there. (no offense to Welsh people, I have Welsh blood too [although admitedly I keep it in a small box under my bed][only joking]).I actually compared this book to Red Dwarf by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor for my GCSE (an exam) in English, for which I got a solid B, I've also read the 5 books in the trilogy at least half-a-dozen times, so I'm more than familiar with the book. And it's still funny.Thankyou, goodnight, and hang onto your towels."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you saw the recent movie version of HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and wondered, \\"What in the name of Zarquon is going on here?\\" it probably means that you've never read the book upon which the movie was (loosely) based. Or, in my case, you've read the book often and you were still mystified by events unfolding onscreen.So, forget the movie. Forget the theater in which you saw the movie and the snacks you had while watching it. Forget the nap you took during the movie, or the couple making out behind you when they thought you were still sleeping.No, forget all of that, and make a point of getting this book and its sequels as soon as possible. To say that the book is better than the movie is like saying the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster is a fairly potent drink.The late, great Douglas Adams created an altogether, wholly remarkable universe where the space-time continuum was so ripped, torn, swirling, rife with eddies, and filled with floatsam and jetsam that it would take me a millinnium of riding a runaway Chesterfield sofa just to contemplate it and explain it to you.Let me just say: the book is laugh out loud funny. Imagine crossing the priceless lyrical wit of P.G. Wodehouse with the scientific imagination of H.G. Wells, and you may begin to approximate the genius of Douglas Adams.Our beleaguered hero, Arthur Dent, endures a series of increasingly improbable journeys that take him from one end of the galaxy to the other. Amazingly, far reaches of the galaxy--exotic though they may be--have many of the same problems that we have here on earth. Namely, too many telemarketers, lawyers, and lemony fresh handi-wipes. And too few places to quaff a decent cup of tea.OK, I give up on describing the book. It's actually harmless. Mostly harmless, anyway. Get it. Read it. Laugh one of your heads off."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is still so funny and original (the film's not too bad either with the guy from The Office off BBC America). I just love Brit humor - it is tops (check out Ben Elton (Stark) and Steve Horsfall ( You Are Here )too)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that manages to blend in bits of a fantasy sci-fi world in a way that makes it seem realistic and entertaining. Other reviewers who complained about the plot (notice how few there are) miss the value of this book. It is a place to be, a hitchhiker in a detailed and fantastic universe, who, hopefully knows where his towel is. This book is endlessly quotable. There is a rhythm to this book that taints your thinking. It is funny and intelligent.However, I did dock this book 1 star in the review because it is a slow-starter. It takes about a third of the book to get off the planet (literally), and all the real fun is in space. However, once you get past that first hump the rest is smooth sailing except for the abrupt ending. (Douglas Adams had trouble meeting his deadlines and so the manuscript was taken, as is, at a slightly awkward spot.) Be sure to have The Restaurant at the End of the Universe ready to read right afterwards because it really does seem to &quot;finish&quot; this book's plotline.I rarely enjoy reading a book I've already read before but this one and the rest of the series are an easy exception."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first thing to note is that despite its name this is not a guidebook. Rather, it is an intricate story about a group of people - and a paranoid android - with rather nebulous connections who use, work for, or are otherwise involved with &quot;the Guide&quot;.Although some fans of &quot;hard&quot; science fiction do not have much time for this book, I think that it is a classic. Adams uses everything from subtle irony to blatant sarcasm - plus a fair about of slapstick - to weave this complex and highly improbable story which pokes fun at most professions, many ideas and just about every thing else in the history of time and space.If this book doesn't make you laugh you need a vacation. If it does, the good news is that Adams manages to keep the concepts and jokes fresh throughout most of the 5 book \\"trilogy\\" which is testimony to his skills as an author.And a final note - which has got to be the most compelling reason to buy the book - if you don't know what the number 42, towels, yellow bulldozers, and mice have in common - Don't Panic! - you will once you have read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm in the seventh grade and wanted to read book for enjoyment.

I am currently studying at Oxford University and I take offence at those misguided souls who think that HHGTTG is childish, has no lasting worth or will only be enjoyed by undiscriminating readers. Hitchiker is not only a supremely funny and inventive book - it's also extremely intelligent and full of subtle insights. It works on so many levels that it is accessible to everyone (if they keep an open mind).Vogon poetry, the Babel fish and the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster are surely all the evidence you need of Adams' sublime genius (and there are 4 more books of it).Oh, and Douglas Adams has been hinting that Hitchiker 6 might be on its way (pleeeeaaaase! pleeeeeaase!)Anyway, my heart belongs to Ford Prefect forever. And remember, Hitchiker isn't just a book, it's a way of life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sorry about my little review below. I just can't understand people who don't like this book. This is the best book by my favorite author. I am an aspiring author and if I could write anything half this good, I could die happy. I'd been trying to write zany space comedies even before I'd even heard of Douglas Adams, but once I read this, I knew I had a long ways to go. Anyway, the rest of the series pales a little in comparison to this book, (especially 'So Long...&quot;) but they're all massively entertaining. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Trilogy, try his Dirk Gently series as well. Also, Douglas wrote 3 excellent stories for Doctor Who, &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; in season 16, and &quot;City of Death&quot; and &quot;Shada&quot; (unfinished, unfortunately) for season 17, a season in which he also served as the show's script editor.Someone said that this book was a Star Trek wannabe. If anything, it serves to show just how limited Star Trek can be when there's books like Hitchhiker's Guide and shows like Doctor Who and Red Dwarf out there. Those poor trekkies, I feel a little sorry for them actually.Anyway, I've gotten a little off the point here, that being that this is the best humor writing around and anyone who can't appreciate this humor just doesn't get it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must say that Douglas Adams reminds me a lot of Mark Twain for his sharply satirical syle of writing. &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is short and sweet and all readers will find it hard to put down.

I find that the experience of having read it, connects me to so many people in such a variety of backgrounds. High school students, PhD professors, Americans, Norwegians, Buddhists and Muslims. People in Japan, in Egypt -- people in so many walks of life connect with Douglas Adams references.It is such a great experience as a book that the world can gain Douglas Adams references. We describe the inadequacy of the administration systems in our college by talking about how the main character in Hitchhiker's Guide had gone round to see the display department. He finally found the plans in a locked lavatory with a sign that said, &quot;Beware of Leopard.&quot;That's the display department.It was dark.Well the lights had gone.So had the stairs.This book comically captures the world we are living it.

To keep your sanity in the modern world, read this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you took the dry humor of Joseph Heller and the unique science fiction of Kurt Vonnegut, you would be near an understanding of what this book is. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a bit of fresh air from most other Science Fiction. Everything from Existentialism to Asimov's Foundation series is hilariously scrutinized by the metaphysical universe that Adams used for the setting of this story. The humor of this book reminds me most of the story-lines on the Simpsons. The action of this book requires the reader to suspend his disbelief. This book is so grossly absurd that it almost seems to parallel some of the problems of modern life. In the end, this book shows that while most of these problems will never be overcome, there will always be fodder to poke humor at, and that's at least a start."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Absolute genius! I first read the series when I was about 14 (20 years ago, or so) It was engaging and entertaining then. Since then, I've read any other Adams literature I could get hold of. Any shape or form you can use to experience this, do it! Old BBC TV broadcasts, or the radio series - all excellent entertainment. I just re-read the series, upon Mr. Adams' passing, and realized how much it really had changed my perceptions. While not earth-moving, Mr. Adams has succeeded in making me look just a little sideways at any 'scientific certainty'. Its a great book / series, currently reminds me a bit of Scott Adams' Dilbert in comedic sensibility, with Star Trek science (and pseudo-science), tempered with dry British wit."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hitchhiker &quot;trilogy&quot; is a wonderful series, from a wonderful author, one who recently died. His death is truly tragic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of few books that I have enjoyed reading. It is a mixture of humor and science fiction correlated through a strong, but somewhat confusing, plot. Douglas Adams, the famous writer who incorporates humor into sci-fi, is the writer of this fantastically written novel about a character by the name of Arthur Dent and his adventure around the universe. He is miraculously saved from the earth's destruction by one of his friend's. Arthur never knew his friend was an alien until this day. His friend, Ford Perfect, is an alien who has been trapped on earth for fifteen years; originally he came to earth for research, in order to expand The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The story continues and Ford Perfect saves Arthur's life from the destruction of earth. They hitchhike a ride on a Vogon ship; Vogons hate hitchhikers. Ultimately the Vogons throw Arthur and Ford out of their ship. In the mere ten seconds they have, to survive in outer space, the most improbable phenomena occur. The Heart of Gold, a new ship designed with the new Improbability Drive engine, saves Arhur Dent's and Ford Prefect's lives from the vacuum of space. Amazingly, the person in charge of the ship is Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government. In his kindness and generosity, he allows the two hitchhikers to stay on board. The story picks its' pace from this point on. Douglas Adams wrote a book that would not only interest the young and feeble mind, but also the mature and intellectual mind as well. His well-developed characters and great sense of detail throughout the book really makes the reader become part of the novel. The confusion the reader feels towards the storyline of the book is directly proportional to the confusion Arthur Dent has with his surrounding. By making creating a sense of confusion around the reader, Douglas Adams does a wonderful job of presenting Arthur Dent's character. Another well-developed character in the book is Ford Perfect, the researcher of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This character is the \\"know it all\\" type of character. He is the one that guides Arthur to his confusion about everything around him. Whenever Arthur asks Ford a questions, he gets an answer that confuses him, as well as the reader, even more. This sense of confusion and intellectuality between the two central characters is very unique and interesting. In addition to a well-developed character line and plot, the book targets the reader's weak understanding of life and the universe, creating a sense of mystery for which the reader ponders to unravel. The only weakness this book has is its confusing plot. But the reader will get used to this after he/she reads the first couple of chapters. As a teenager, I believe that this book is an excellent choice for any age group. People can have hours of fun reading it. It is full of comedy, action, and suspense. Once you pick it up, you will not want to drop it down. As of the answer to the most fascinating question of all time, the answer to everything, well, you will have to read the book to figure out this one for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's hard to argue that this book isn't painfully funny (unless you happen to be painfully unimaginative), but I found this book to be especially wonderful for it's sharp satire and philisophical statements. I guess you may call them anti-philisophical statements because it makes the reader view life with a new sense of it's intrinsic absurdity. My favorite character is Arthur Dent, and throughout the book he is continually disparaged as some sort of simpleton. However, throughout the course of the series, we are subtley made aware of Arthur's virtues in contrast to the other characters, and in particualr, the Guide. Adams makes them so seemingly complex, that they are in fact utterly ridiculous and nearly pointless. He applies this same logic to life in general. It is chaotic, absurd, and often pointless, so like Arthur, you might as well enjoy a good cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Intriguing! Well-developed characters, understandable plot, this book has it all! It's about hitchhikers traveling through the universe. There are billions of planets and one digital book explains all of them, plus everything else in the universe. The book starts with the Earth blowing up. There is someone named Ford from another planet who is on Earth and he grabs his friend and gets on one of the spaceships that is blowing the earth up. They are thrown into space but Ford's cousin, Zaphod picks them up with the spaceship he stole. Then they continue to travel the universe together with Trillion (an earth woman), Arthur, (Ford's friend) and Marvin, a robot. I loved Douglas Adams' writing style! The descriptions were a little weak, but it is fun to imagine what characters and objects look like. Whether you like science fiction or not I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No matter how many times I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I've read it quite a few times already, it never fails to thrill me and induce bouts of almost uncontrollably hearty laughter. With this novel, Douglas Adams gave life to a phenomenon that will long outlive his tragically short life, delighting millions of readers for untold years to come. I'm not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979. This is science fiction made to laugh at itself while honoring its rich tradition, but it is much more than that. Adams' peculiarly dead-on humor also draws deeply from the well of sociology, philosophy, and of course science. Whenever Adams encountered a sacred cow of any sort, he milked it dry before moving on. Beneath the surface of utter hilarity, Adams actually used his sarcasm and wit to make some rather poignant statements about this silly thing called life and the manner in which we are going about living it. This is one reason the book is so well-suited for multiple readings-a high level of enjoyment is guaranteed each time around, and there are always new insights to be gained from Adams' underlying, oftentimes subtle, ideas and approach.Arthur Dent is your normal human being, and so he naturally is more concerned about his house being knocked down than facing the fact that the world is about to end. His friend Ford Prefect, he comes to learn, is actually a researcher from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, but before he can even begin to comprehend this fact, he finds himself zipped up into the confines of the Vogon space cruiser that has just destroyed the planet Earth. Things become even trickier for him when he discovers the great usefulness of sticking a Babel fish into his ear and then meets the singular President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and his shipmate Trillian, both of whom Arthur actually met months before at a party. Such impossible coincidences are explained by the fact that Beeblebrox's ship is powered by the new Infinite Improbability Drive. Dent grows more and more confused during his travels on board the Heart of Gold, and the story eventually culminates with an amazing visit to an astronomically improbable world.Much of the humor here is impossible to describe; this novel must be read to be appreciated. It seems like every single line holds a joke of some kind within it. The characters are also terrific: the unfortunate Arthur Dent, who basically has no idea what is going on; Ford Prefect, Arthur's remarkable friend from Betelgeuse; Zaphod Beeblebrox, with his two heads, three arms, and cavalier attitude; Trillian the lovely Earth girl who basically flies the Heart of Gold; Slartibartfast the planet builder and fjord-make extraordinaire; and my favorite character of all, Marvin the eternally depressed robot. Life-\\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\" is the Paranoid Android's philosophy. One brilliant thing that Adams does is to step away from the action every so often to present interesting facts about the universe as recorded in the Hitchhiker's Guide; here we learn about Vogon poetry, the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, Trans Galactic Gargle Blasters, and other fascinating tidbits about life in the crazy universe Adams created. He even gives the reader the ultimate answer to the question of Life, the Universe, and Everything in these pages.This novel is just an amazingly hilarious read that will leave you yearning for more; to our great fortune, Adams indeed left us more in the form of four subsequent books in the Hitchhiker's \\"trilogy.\\" If you don't like science fiction, it doesn't matter; read this book just for the laughs. The most amazing thing about Adams' humor is the fact that everyone seems to \\"get\\" it. Adams broke all the rules in writing a novel quite unlike any that had come before it, and he succeeded in spades. This may well be the funniest novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Since there are many reviews of the book itself, I thought someone should review the audio versions independently. There are two versions of this title in audio format, the dramatized edition, which is abridged, and the version read by the author, which is unabridged; I have both! I you are a fan of the dramatized versions of books please be sure before you buy which version you are getting. I enjoyed both the dramatized version and the version read by Douglas Adams himself as each has its own pros and cons.The Dramatized version, done by the BBC (or at least the version that I have is), is very well done, as are all of the BBC dramatizations. The cast does a fantastic job as does the special effects team on the sounds. Be aware that dramatized versions are typically abridged, which is not a big problem generaly but some people don't care for it. This version was originally released as a multiple part radio program so if you are familiar with that format you have a good idea of this version. The only drawbacks are the it is in an outmoded format (cassette) and that it is abridged.The unabridged spoken version is read by the author, Douglas Adams, and is very good. This is a special treat since he has passed on. I enjoy the ability to hear the author's concept of how the story should read in his own voice. This version has a permanent home on my iPod so that anytime I need a little boost, I can queue it up. It is easy to listen to and quite enjoyable but if you are used to the dramatized versions of audio books you may find that it takes 5 or 10 minutes to get used to the single voice. It is worth it though!I would recommend either audio version to anyone that commutes or has at least thirty minutes of free time at a stretch. Both versions are well done and are enjoyable to listen to. For anyone who has not experienced audio books before, I would recommend a good tile like this to start off with."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With the passing of Douglas Adams on Friday 5/11/2001, I picked up this book after quite a number of years and gave it a good ol' read....and you know what... this novel will forever be poignant, witty and downright entertaining. I laughed all over again. I mean, I really laughed. I'm going to miss Douglas.Douglas wasn't just at the forefront of comedy-sci-fi....he basically created the genre. My only regret, along with quite a number of fans, is that we shall never again relish in the adventures of Arthur Dent and the gang. No more Vogon poetry. No more Pan Galactic Gargleblasters. No more Babel fish. No more tongue-twisting names. Therein lies the real shame.New readers to Douglas Adams, take heart! Each of the novels that make up this series are all fantastic tales! If you own a copy of Hitchhiker's, you hold in your hands a classic! Cherish it always and read it as it was intended.... as a truly light-hearted romp through the cosmos.Take a look at some of the reviews listed here. Over four hundred people can't be wrong. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books of all time by a quirky and innovative author. (We'll just have to forgive him for wearing a digital watch.)Thank-you Douglas for the fun and adventures. You were one of a kind. May we one day meet at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The first round's one me. I'll bring the towel.A classic. A gem. You must own this novel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm probably treading on thin ice here, talking about a revered piece of pop culture. When I was in college, Douglas Adams had a cult following that knew all the jokes and could quote them to each other.I find myself in a middle ground. I was first exposed to Hitchhiker's Guide when it ran as a BBC radio serial (I heard it on NPR, I think). It got a some laughs out of me, and I enjoyed it, but it didn't inspire in me the kind of devotion that it did in other geeks.Having read the first book, I have to say the radio series is my favorite presentation of this material. Playing as a serial, the gags were front and center, the serial format left the listener with the impression that there was a lot more to come and ensured that Adams didn't overstay his welcome. Read as a novel, the book seems a little pointless. Adams wouldn't know a narrative arc if it hit him.That said, a lot of the jokes are still funny. Adams was a vocal atheist, and at his best he has the satiric touch of a Voltaire. Evenhanded, he enjoys skewering atheists in his book: Oolon Coluphid, the atheist writer that Adams posits as \\"the author of philosophical blockbusters,\\" seems quite pretentious and silly, at least in his choice of book titles.Occasionally, there is a true insight that is nicely played for a joke. My favorite revolves around the babelfish, a fish that is used a universal translator. When a babelfish is placed in one's hear, one can hear and understand the words spoken by another, regardless of the original language spoken. The end of Adams digression on the babelfish ends with the acidly ironic observation that the babelfish is responsible for more wars than any other species in the universe.(John Durham Peters, author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, makes the point that we often hold an implicitly utopian view of communication, believing that differences between people will automatically be resolved with better communication, whereas sometimes the truth is the opposite: the better two groups of people understand each other, the less they like each other.)I place Adams in the same category as Kurt Vonnegut. They're both writers that have a special appeal to the young, to high school and college age readers. They both write satirical, absurdist fiction which skewer traditional beliefs and middle class norms. Adams tends to be more detached, more bemused, less pointed, passionate, and angry than Vonnegut. In some ways, that makes him easier to take. On the other hand, I don't think he's as compelling, for the same reason."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is fitting that this audio adaptation of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was voiced by actor Stephen Fry. Fry was a close friend of the late Mr. Adams, and he also narrates the new H2G2 movie as the voice of the Book. Fry does a great job of making this classic novel come alive, drawing the listener into the story. This audiobook makes a great tribute to Douglas Adams and the world and characters he created in the H2G2 universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thoroughly strange book, that at the same time is oddly charming. It starts in a really weird way, with the demolition of Earth (yes, our planet) in order to build a interestellar highway. Only one man survives the end of our world: an Englishman, Arthur Dent. Arthur is saved from sure death by one of his friends, Ford Prefect, that also happened to be an alien doing some research for \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (an electronic book that \\"tells you everything you need to know about anything\\", and that specially highlights the need for a towel).Ford got a lift for them with a Vogon spaceship, where they would soon be subjected to a danger worse than death: Vogon poetry. Anyway, as nothing bad last forever, there were soon ejected into space to suffer certain and painful death, only to be rescued again just in time to begin their adventures.Both Ford and Arthur are interesting characters, but I found Arthur's whining particularly funny. For example, and in his own words to Ford: \\"you are talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It is now just after four in the afternoon and I am already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light-years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\\".There are other characters and things you will find interesting, like an eternally depressed robot (life, \\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\"), Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the Babel fish (capable of translating any language in the galaxy if you put them in your ear). There are also some scenes that appear out of the blue, but that are quite enchanting. For instance \\"Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. - Is there any tea on this spaceship?-he said\\".On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Its premise is extremely original, and you will have lots of fun reading it. If you can, buy it know, and be ready to meet the mice * :)Belen Alcat (* = you will understand that phrase only after reading this book!!!)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Setting the ultimate questions of life, physics, and digital watches against a backdrop of science fiction, Douglas Adams successfully creates an amusing and thought-provoking story that is considered a must-read by millions. Arthur Dent, the fortunate Earthling who has been miraculously rescued from the destruction of Earth with the help from some friendly Dentrassi cooks, acts as the readers alter ego due to his complete lack of knowledge concerning the universe. Arthur asks the same questions that we would ask, should we be in his position. The majority of the answers about the universe obviously come from Ford Prefect's copy of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Within this manuel, Douglas Adam's provides the reader with a brilliantly shaped world which lives within his imagination. The most clever aspect, however, is the fact that Adams has a rational explanation for each of the entries in the guide. For instance, he explains for a page and a half why putting a Babel fish in one's ear allows the brain to understand every language in the universe. In addition to his wonderful imagination, Douglas Adams must also be praised for his humorous treatment of the major questions of life. When asked the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, Deep Thought(the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space), comes up with the very simple and unexpected answer of &quot;forty-two&quot;. Adams plays off of the reader's inquisitive nature by building up the suspense and finally showing them that in order to know answers, you must understand the questions. This is an amazing journey through philosophical experimentation that the reader will never forget."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thing that is most improbable about this book is that its critical mass can be contained within 216 slim pages, albeit sandwiched between slightly denser covers, without blasting itself to smithereens of funny matter and dispersing these all over the galaxy.It all begins with Arthur Dent wallowing in the mud to prevent the destruction of his house, while galactic bureaucratic wheels are cranking out much bigger misguided projects.By coincidence, his pal Ford Prefect just happens to be a researcher for the extremely useful book \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and having been stranded on earth for fifteen years, is anxious to hitch a ride on the next passing saucer.Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away, Zaphod Beeblebrox, totally powerless figure-head President of the Imperial Galactic Government, is wending his merry way to what will be the most unforgettable launching of a unique spaceship.Discarding and disregarding his prepared speech, he pauses to acknowledge Trillian, a hot chick that he picked up at a party on another planet, thereby irritating the heck out of the attending party hacks, who are obviously unaware of the uncontrollable misbehavior of Presidents when it comes to hot chicks.Arthur and Ford Prefect manage to hitch a ride shortly before ground zero, and after enduring some Vogon poetry (third worst in the Universe), they get chucked out of an airlock with only a lungful of air to fly on.Thanks to Trillian, and Zaphod's amazing technicolor Infinite Improbability Drive, our heroes are rescued from certain doom - or are they? A fugitive, a hot chick and a manic depressive robot do not usually make for happy endings, even with a little improbability thrown in.The adventure continues as they learn the simple answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, only to realize that they don't know the question.Going now to fix me a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, and start the second of the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy. I've already got my massively useful towel packed, and my fish in my ear.

Time warps, charming aliens with two heads, and improbability spaceships are not my usual reading. Yet I loved this book. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is one of the most fantastic, funny, and inconceiveably creative books I've ever read. From the moment Zaphod, a unique character with two heads, steals the most famous spaceship in the galaxy, things happen quickly and with seemingly little connection to any event. That's the beauty of this book though: all events, no matter how random, are tied together in a humorous, deliciously complex way. Every character has its own distinct personality that draws you into the book even more. From Marvin The melancholy Marsian to beautiful and brilliant earthwoman Trillian, this book has everything. Which just goes to explain why it's one of the most sought-after collector's books. If you want to read a deep, romantic, drama this is not the book for you. However, if you're in the mood for a good laugh pick up this book. Even if you don't normally like science fiction, you'll get a kick out of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I realize that it being the year 2011 and having never read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes me a bit of an anomaly in the matrix. I saw the movie and thought it was mediocre and I just assumed that the book would be likewise. After being urged by a friend to give this book a shot, I finally did and here I am finally reviewing this book which turned out to be a pleasant surprise.By now, most of mankind knows the plot [(although the amusing thing is, there really isn't one :)]. Seconds before the Earth is destroyed, a human named Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect. As it turns out, Prefect has been stranded on Earth for over 15 years, posing as an out-of-work actor while doing research for the revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Dent and Prefect leave earth and begin to go on a intergalactic journey full of twists and turns while being picked up by the Heart of Gold, a ship which houses the might Improbability Drive that naturally helps transport them across galaxies faster than the speed of light. The rest of the characters include a two-headed, three-armed hippie who happens to be the president of the galaxy; Trillian, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a Earth cocktail party; and Marvin, a weary, depressed and highly intelligent robot.As I mentioned earlier, there isn't a particularly deep plot to this book which is what makes it such a unique blend of sci-fi, comedy, and philosophy. Douglas Adams spares no expense in poking fun at science fiction and some of it's clich&eacute;s such as asking the menacing guards on alien ships if they are truly happy with their jobs and if not why don't they just quit and find another profession? Of course, the deep philosophical questions of our existence are not spared by Adams either. Deep Thinker, a supercomputer that takes a total of 7.5 million years to answer Life's greatest questions and then another 2.5 million years for its successor to come up with a question to the original answer, lol.As others have said, you don't even have to be a science-fiction fan to really appreciate this book.

The book only seemed palatable to those who loved sci-fi, or belonged to an older generation. While both of those groups may certainly well like the book, I now realize that my scope was far too narrow, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and regret not having read it sooner.The story follows London native Arthur Dent, a sort of hapless \\"any-man,\\" who, with the help his good friend Ford Prefect, is whisked into space seconds before the demise of planet Earth. Dent and Prefect are taken on a galactic journey across the universe, as life's biggest questions are attempted to be answered.The writing is very witty, with sharp, clever dialog, and fun, well-developed characters. But even more memorable than the book's humor is the prevalent, if not overt, social, political, and religious commentary throughout. It becomes clear Adams has written this novel as a means of showing us ourselves, so as we laugh at the silliness of the plot and characters, the joke is truly on us.Now I will fearlessly delve into the next book of this series, excited to see where the story continues. And maybe I'll declare my joy of sci-fi after all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A most remarkable book, full of humour and wisdom not found in current sci fi novels.I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The \\"fight scenes\\" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. \\"We don't want to shoot you!\\" \\"Well, that suits me just fine!\\" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?). The chapter on the philosophers literally had me laughing out loud.

It goes to show that maybe your planet blowing up isn't so bad after all! Throughout the story I laughed out loud multiple times. It has many hilarious quotes throughout the book but my personal favorite is \\"It says that the effect of drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\\" I would recommend this to many people, but if you are very religious, some things might offend you.

In the beginning, Arthur loses his house and his world in the same day. The Earth is destroyed by a fleet of bureaucratic Vogons, making way for a galactic freeway. Fortunately for him, Arthur is rescued by his alien friend, Ford Prefect. The two of them then fall into a variety of improbable situations, eventually learning the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.This book is really short and should take no time for someone to buzz through. The storytelling was vivid, unique, and downright hilarious at times. The manner in which the author narrates is generally when the book is at its funniest, so I now find it odd that they tried to make a movie out of this. People should be aware that the humor is most definitely British.My biggest complaint with the novel is the overabundance of the weird hard-to-pronounce names and the mind-numbing technical jargon (which really isn't technical). Sometimes it appears the author is having so much fun with a particular joke that he forgets to let the audience in on it.All in all, Hitchhiker's Guide was a fun little read.

Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, has still bigger concerns. Unbeknownst to Arthur or anyone else, Ford is actually an alien (albeit a humanoid one) who has been basically stranded on Earth for the last 15 years. Ford's original aim was to spend a couple of weeks gathering information about Earth in order to update the book for which he is a roving researcher. The book in question is, of course, \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, the time for leaving is well-nigh and Ford takes Arthur along thereby saving him from a fate worse than domicile demolition.As they travel throughout space, the duo meets several interesting life forms and learns a variety of shocking facts. For example, Arthur learns that humans were only the third most intelligent form of life on Earth. Eventually, they even learn the answer to the \\"Great question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\\"I had some initial trepidation about reading this novel since its reputation has most certainly preceded it. I find that it's often easy to be disappointed by \\"cult classics.\\" However, this story has reached such a wide audience, that it can no longer really be considered \\"cult.\\" There is indeed a Vonnegut-like quality to much of this novel. Anyone who has read \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" will certainly recognize a stylistic similarity. Early in the book we are introduced to an alien race called the Vogons. We are told that on their planet \\"elegant gazellelike\\" creatures existed that the Vogons would catch and sit upon. It is then explained that \\"They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons would sit on them anyway.\\" Aside from some dated cracks about digital watches, this book is leavened with humor that generally stands the test of time.

The theme is probablyjustice, because Trillian, Zaphod, Ford, Marvin, andespecially Arthur face injustice, and go against it. Iloved the story; my only complaint is that a third ofthe book is a making of the movie section and is notworth reading unless you loved the movie. Prepare forplot twists, cliffhangers, and laughter!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a truly remarkable book.\\" This is a statement repeated many times throughout the book. No, Douglas Adams wasn't commenting on his novel, but the \\"standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom\\" that exists within it. It contains everything from how to mix your own Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, a popular alcoholic drink that gives you the feeling that you're, \\"having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick,\\" to explaining just how useful a towel is to the average hitchhiker. All of this exists within Douglas Adams's The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, an even more remarkable book which is clever, hilarious, and will keep anyone amused for hours.The story unfolded very quickly when it zoomed in on Arthur Dent, a very ordinary man, as he was told by his friend Ford Prefect-who he just found out was an alien-that the world was going to be demolished in roughly twelve minutes. It just keeps getting better from there.Adams created a wide variety of personalities for his characters. Arthur Dent was a normal man that was quite happy with his dull, quiet life on Earth. He never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. Zaphod Beeblebrox, an alien, however, was the joking, impulsive President of the Imperial Galactic Government. He was rather full of himself and didn't tend to worry. To illustrate yet another personality, there is Marvin, the depressed robot. Marvin never had a positive outlook on anything. Ford Prefect was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just guy who liked to \\"go with the flow.\\" These are just a few example of Adams's genius when it comes to creating characters.Douglas Adams had a brilliant imagination. One example of his creativity was in his description of the Vogon poetry. It was the third worst that ever existed, barely passed up by Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent whose poem was entitled, \\"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning.\\" I can't think of many authors that published something like that.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone. Most of the humor is easy to understand, and everything is appropriate for people of all ages. Even younger children could appreciate the humor and the interesting characters. The novel is great for people with strong imaginations as well. Having an open mind is rather important while reading it, however, since it could be described as strange. It seems to appeal more to \\"geeky\\" people. Despite this, I thought it was a great book; everyone that I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did.Overall, Adams was remarkably successful with his The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters; the storyline was unpredictable and I was constantly being surprised. I savored every minute I spent reading this novel.

The characters are interesting, can be related to and, despite the comedic tone, stick with you like the best characters do. The adventures are ridiculous and riotous, but good clean fun.If you want spaceships that are dank and furnished with old mattresses, or space captains that have baths on the bridge, or aliens that have all the sex appeal of a road accident, this is the book for you. If not, give it a miss, and you're poorer thereby, but it's your life. And above all, of course, don't panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It really depends on who you are whether you would want to panic or not.Hitchhikers, starts off confusing because Adams' writing is , how to put it , insane, to a first time reader, But thats not necessarily a bad thing. You have to keep an open mind about this book, because its not your natural Sci-Fi story.I'll keep it short in saying Hitchhikers is fun, sarcastic,hilarious and astonishing. Its a quick read you'll be sure to read the next four books in this Trilogy of Five(or is it six) and you'll get the ans...err..the question to the Ultimate answer..is....I cant tell you.......Just read the book and see...."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Those of you who have visited Alta Vista's \\"Babel Fish\\" website and wondered \\"what's a Babel Fish?\\" will find the answer in these pages. It's a super mini-translator and a devourer of brain waves. Everyone who roams the universe needs a Babel Fish swimming in their ear. How else can one understand Vogon poetry? Don't break the stratosphere without one.This book is loads of fun. Besides a quick read, it contains some now famous scenes (almost ubiquitous depending on the circles one runs in). The super computer \\"Deep Thought\\" (a tongue in cheek reference if ever one existed) gives its infamous answer to the \\"ultimate question\\" of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\". Earth gets marked for destruction to clear the way for a \\"hyperspatial express route\\" (but not everyone inhabiting earth comes from earth, or are what they seem). The universe has an irresponsible meglomaniac amoral president (Zaphod Beeblebrox). A man named Slatibartfast gets rebuked for creating fjords in the new Africa. A depressed robot lays facedown in the mud dejected after causing a spaceship to commit suicide. A whale spends its final moments before meteoring onto the surface of the legendary planet of Magrathea. The Improbability Drive of a super space ship creates... well... the improbable. And of course the core of the story involves the great \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\"; an intergalactic tour guide, survival text, and social commentary. A \\"Hitchhiker\\" is the equivalent of an interstellar train jumper. Ford Prefect fits this job description perfectly. He found himself stranded on earth as a result of his hitchhiking. Here he meets Arthur Dent, a seemingly average inhabitant of planet earth. Arthur's house stands in the path of a hungry bulldozer, but Ford Prefect tells him not to worry because \\"the world is ending\\" in about twelve minutes. Great characters, scenes, and ingenious plot devices abound as the pages rapidly turn.The book also has a philosophical dimension. It makes our planet seem like a small, insignificant speck in a manner similar to Voltaire's \\"Micromegas\\". Consequently, it also makes the universe seem like a vast, enormous, incomprehensible mass (which it is). Human insignifigance gets handled, as it should be handled, with humor. This probably explains why the book gets quoted in many philosophical texts: these passages can take some of the edge off of a bare examination of the human condition. So all those struggling with the absurdity of it all should look here for solace and a good laugh. Even those seeking just a good laugh should look here. Just read it already!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found myself smirking and nodding knowingly a lot more than laughing out loud as I read this book. It is in no way an out-and-out humorous story. Instead, Douglas Adams has found himself a solid science-fiction platform from which to write a witty and surprisingly insightful social commentary.You'll recognize all sorts of people from your life in the characters in this book.

It must have the type of humor that fills your stomach and makes your body shake. It must bite of spicy satire along with an aftertaste of irony. It must be refreshingly original. Up until this point, I have been tempted by Vonnegut, inhebriated by T. Robbins, shocked by H Thompson, humbled by J Carroll, spiritually lifted by Pirsig, and tricked by Faulkner. The one who combined most of these qualities in my inflated opinion is Douglas Adams. He will sorely be missed."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have also been compelled to write a review of this masterpiece of a book with Douglas Adams' passing. It is a true shame.But on to happier topics: the book! It is fantastic! I don't know how many times I have read and reread that book. And the best part about it, is that one never gets tired of it. His jokes are always hilarious and original, no matter how many times you've read it. I love Marvin and the elevators that can see into the future!Fantastic read, I recommend it to everyone!

The hilarous situation and comedic dialogue (sharpened by Adams' ever-present wit) are massively entertaining and serve to make the book a quick, enjoyable romp. You can read this in a day because you won't want to put it down. As light-hearted and funny as it is however, it also has some serious undertones. Some of Adams' comments on the human condition have a dead-on accuracy that shine through the thinly-veiled comedic pretentions. This book is a must-read for all of these reasons. And besides, where else can you find the meaning to Life, The Universe, and Everything?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Being a voracious reader, I can honestly say that is one of the best pieces of work that I have ever read.

Original, Funny, you will find yourself caught on an exhilirating ride through the cosmos, just don't forget your towel . . ."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A book I have read more times than I can imagine, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that would probably be considered one of the best American novels ever written if it wasn't for the fact Adams is British. I first read this book sometime in the '80's and every time I reread it I uncover new jewels from the prose.The language is expressive in a way most contemporary fiction simply isn't. The analogies are strange and surprising and wonderful. Instead of merely being words on a page, this book has a such a distinctive, lighthearted voice that it allows a person to almost hear the author speak.To be sure, this is not a science fiction novel in the normal sense. The reader is not expected to wonder at the majesty of fantastic cities reaching to the skies where, within, the reader is fascinated by all manner of wonderful inventions. This is a book of everyday life extrapolated to an entire galaxy. Yes, there are interesting doodads interspersed, but they do not serve the &quot;Wowwee&quot; factor so much as the idea of &quot;Yep, that's what a large corporation would make, all right.&quot; For people who like to believe in benevolent galactic empires and the eventual triumph of logic in all endeavors, the mishmash conglomeration of nonsensical entities and the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense will frustrate their idea of what science fiction is supposed to be. This ain't the Foundation Series.Yes, it is silly, strange, and seemingly inane, but everything follows its own bizarrely congruous logic that allows the reader to suspend their disbelief and enjoyably follow along in a world that makes it own nonsensical sense.I suppose the humor could be called Pythonesque since I have to guess that anybody who does not enjoy Monty Python would not enjoy this book. However, for people who enjoy vivid language, entertaining characters, quick and witty humor and a plot that is truly original, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't know what to say about Douglas Adams except; that cat really knows where his towel is. This book is just plain funny, and it will soothe your science fiction needs as well. After reading so many science fiction stories about what alien life might be like, here is a universe which is not only teaming with alien life, but it turns out that most of that life is every bit as flawed, and often ridiculous, as life here on Earth. Which in a strange way makes you feel OK about the whole thing. In an infinite universe anything is possible; it takes an author like Adams to suggest (as he does in one of the stories) that the natural wind patterns of one planet results in the landscape being eroded over time into nothing but expensive hotels and casinos. ANYthing can happen, not any plausible thing - even if you aren't a science fiction fan, I think you'll still enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for people who not only like science fiction, but like humorous novels too. Douglas Adams throws in a mix of humor and irony in a science fiction setting,and that's what I personally like about the book. For example, you have to laugh at Arthur Dent who is upset that his house is being demolished, when little does he know that his planet will be demolished shortly afterward. The Hitchhiker's Guide also makes comments about the human race that aren't just funny, but also make you think as well. My favorite quote from this book is, &quot;This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.&quot; I've read it 3 or 4 times this year since I bought it. This book is a definite must read! If you like the Hitchhiker's Guide then I recommend you read the sequels too because the story doesn't end when you finish the book. When I finished the Hitchhiker's Guide for the first time, I had to run out to the book store and buy the next book. Now I'd have to say that that Douglas Adams is my favorite author and I hope other people become fans too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're looking for a book with a deep and meaningful plot, lengthy setting or description, or in fact much logic to it at all, keep going. This is not the cult classic that you're looking for.If you're instead in search of incredible humor, a dash of surrealism, characters you'll never forget, and lines that it seems half the country can quote by heart, then you're in the right place. Congratulations. Pull up a chair and down these three pints of bitter quickly, before the world can end.HGTTG does have meaning; it does have messages--but no, the plot isn't really the point. This is a story that starts off strange and stays that way. It's hilariously funny, and its satirical elements are sharply intelligent. It may very well make points that will stay with you. But the reason, I think, that many people read it and like it is that it is simply hysterical in much the same way that Monty Python is hysterical. Adams can't lose as long as he keeps pulling out one zany and unexpected surprise after another... and he does just that throughout.This isn't a book that takes days to read, so I'd recommend that anyone who's in the mood for something off-the-wall and humorous give it a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll join the ranks of those who know just what's so unpleasant about being drunk, what the secret to flying is, and the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Greetings hoopy froods from America-landJust a short correction for you.

I just have to say this -- as hilarious as these books are, I think Douglas Adams is basically a very serious man with important things to say. In his later books, my guess is that he was a little bothered by the way everyone just raves about how funny his stuff is, without talking about the troublesome nature of the very real issues he raises. This stuff is absurd, and is deadly serious, at the same time. You should try to be aware of that, and of the tightrope Douglas Adams was walking here.Also, I personally know one woman who chose to make her life's work one of helping animals, and actually became a veterinarian (which required YEARS, YEARS, YYYEEEAAARRRSSS of poverty and going to school to become one) because of Douglas Adams' book &quot;Last Chance to See&quot;, which is about endangered species.I think Douglas Adams is a good and great man, a really warm philosopher, and it seriously wouldn't surprise me if he was remembered and talked about in pubs long after, say, Bertrand Russell or Alfred North Whitehead are just footnotes in dusty thesises in library archives."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This the best book ever written.I acutally think this is as many stars possible,this rating just makes people look,especcialy stuffy people who think all humor should consist of ''Why did the elphant cross the road?The chicken was on vacation.''Deep.So what if all these stuffy women with the sense of humor of a charging hippopotmaus say i'ts childish. this is the funniest scinence ficton.This kind of humor is my favorite.Gods final message to creation:''Sorry for the mess.''

To start with, the Kindle version seemed to have a few conversion mistakes in it. When there was text in italics, which happens a lot in this book, two words were sometimes joined together. It's like the space would be missing between them. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying when reading.The story was fantastic. I thought it was really funny at points. I don't think I've read a book before that had as many funny moments as this. I enjoyed the book far more than the movie which I had seen a couple years ago.The story did wrap up very quickly, though, and seems to continue into another book which I haven't read yet. I was expecting the story to continue on, and then it just ended.The end of the book contains a long look at the making of the movie.

It is also one of the easier reads I have read, however it being easy to read doesn't take away from the plot and the overall randomness of the \\"Hitchhiker\\" books (which I strongly recommend you read all of). Douglas Adams has created a masterpiece which will captivate even beginning readers will want to read this book because of the lack of hard words and fast paced plot line full of action and oddities. Here is a brief summary of what the book is about. However, don't be discouraged from reading the book because you think you know all that happened, the summary doesn't give more away then what you learn in the first few chapters.This book depicts Arthur Dent -a normal earthling- going about his morning when he notices a bulldozer in front of his house and lies down in the mud in front of it so it won't demolish his house. Then his friend Ford Prefect -an alien from the Betelgeuse star system- wisks him away from earth (about to be destroyed by the Vogons) by hitchhiking on a Vogon ship. Then he and Arthur travel all around the universe in search of the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything. On the way he meets Zaphod Beeblebrox -the crazy president of the galaxy- and Trillian -Zaphod's girlfriend from earth- who join Ford and Arthur in their quest to find the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything.If you are intrigued by the brief summary I have just given you, then this book is for you, and if you were not, well then just read it anyway and you will probably find something to laugh at and enjoy. REMEMBER, DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT BEING TOO HARD the words are simple and you should understand all or most of them. So for all of you who like a nice easy read go ahead and dive into the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. For those more sophisticated readers out there you will love the complex themes Douglas Adams weaves into his book (but you beginning readers can just ignore them and still pretty much get what the book is talking about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was inspired to read the book when I saw the movie. I have not read the book since I was in high school, so I was very interested in seeing what would seem different. I was very, very surprised at the difference. What had been an amusing, but hardly nerve-shatteringly funny, was transformed into a very funny book indeed.The success in Adam's skills in seeing completely normal human life from a totally alien perspective is amazing. It is something that has been exceptionally noticeable the second time around. For example, the way in which mice were conducting experiments on humans and Slartibartfast marvelling at their genius in doing so.The book also takes a keen stab at human nature and our foibles in more than one way. From God \\"vanishing in a puff of logic\\" to \\"pan-dimensional beings\\" trying to find the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then finding that they needed to work out the question to the answer. Confused? So were the \\"pan-dimensional beings\\".All in all, \\"The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a genius in comic, Monty-Pythonesque humour mixed with healthy doses of sci-fi. Even if you have read it before, it will entertain you for another run through it. I loved every part of it, and don't wonder that it is a classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchiker's Guide is hands down the funniest book ever written by an Englishman with the last name of Adams. It is also the most hilarious book I have ever read. I would even go so far to say that it is the most ridiculous book ever to stress the importence of towels. It's wonderful. Read it and see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This, the most famous book of the late Douglas Adams, is the first book in the five volume Hitchhiker's Trilogy. It is quite possibly among the funniest books ever written.Arthur Dent wakes up one morning to the sound of a bulldozer outside of his residence. His house is to be demolished to make way for a bypass. After a series of events he goes to a bar with his friend Ford Prefect--who reveals that he himself is not human. Ford tells Arthur that he is leaving Earth in order to escape its destruction (it is being destroyed in order to pave the way for an interstellar bypass).So begins the epic that is Adams' magnum opus.One reason I love The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and the rest of the trilogy) is that it explores the theme of life as a journey towards hidden purposes. At the same time, it manages to show all the chaos along the way.It is within the pages that we first encounter the answer to the meaning of life, the universe and everything--namely 42. The search for the question to the answer is preoccupies much of the trilogy's later stories.After several readings of this first volume, the scene that sticks most in my mind is the internal conflicts that take place within the soul of the English bureaucrat (a direct male-line descendant of Ghengis Khan) sent to destroy Arthur's home. There are few scenes more hilarious in the rest of the series.I give the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,' by Douglas Adams, is a spontaneous comic adventure. To bring out the humorous characters and events, Douglas Adams uses a lot of satire to attract the reader's attention. A scene that brings out much of the satire is at the beginning of the book. Arthur Ford lies in front of bulldozer to stop the demolition of his house so the city can build a bypass. Arthur, having just found out the day before, is annoyed because the plans were buried from the public. To emphasize the satire, Adams destroys Earth to build an intergalactic bypass whose plans were also buried. This is all going on while the construction workers are trying to find a way to get more money out of their union for working with insane people. Adam uses this satire throughout the entire book to give it an added flavor and to persuade changes on earth with certain situations. As Arthur and Ford start hitchhiking their way around the galaxy to find the ultimate answers to life and the universe, they encounter worlds full of trouble.The story starts out with Arthur Dent protesting his house from being torn down for a bypass, when his friend Ford Perfect, an alien who has been posing as an out-of-work actor on earth for the past fifteen years, drags Arthur away to tell him the world is going to be destroyed. He warns his disbelieving friend Arthur that the planet is soon to blow up, and rescues both of them seconds before its destruction by hitching a ride from the Vogons. After Ford and Arthur are tortured by hideous poetry, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, and Trillia, the only other surviving human being, save them. Together they travel the galaxy to lead to the ultimate answers to life.I would say this book is Random. Sinister. Funny. 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' covers everything from galactic space monsters to far-off planets no one has ever of.

This reading would serve as inspiration. Since the last time I read this series was in my teens, I thought it merited a second look.The teenage me loved this series, finding the tone and unfolding of events to be arch and wonky.The older me, well, I can see through some of the narrative tricks and the book sags in places. Now, it's still just such a fine piece of fiction with its humor veering from peacock-strut to ninja-stealth. Adams knows how to turn a phrase and the banter is just so gregarious and winsome.But he is sometimes too hot for tangents. Yes, I know most of the tangents pay off later, but the narrative coherency takes a beating here and there.With the book I'm writing, I want to make sure the main character is not lost in the spectacle of the wit and cosmic nature of the book's trappings. Arthur, sadly doesn't fair so well. He is bland and fades into the background for most of the novel. Yes, I realize the series will eventually evolve him, but it's still disappointing to see such a skeletal character as mere placeholder in such a lofty book.Quick Observations:Including additional information as footnotes is distracting and all could be eliminated without any enjoyment being robbed from the telling.The author really dislikes cheery futuristic doors that whish open and close.A paranoid and depressing robot-golden! More scenes, please!Mice could never be more menacing than here.Button-pushing cracked me up in this tale.For a book about hitchhiking through the interstellar vastness, there was a lack of wonder or variety in the settings. If one is thumbing through the cosmos, I'd expect a space bar, exotic alien jungle, lavishly expensive sets, but this one felt sparse.As I raced to the end, the humor flowed consistently throughout. I struggle with this in my own work as it seems my humor cuts out whenever I approach the climax.As if the apex of the story needs to be all serious and such. Well, this book reminded me that should be an area to focus on.The book did what it was supposed to do, it invigorated my desire to write funny. It also made me wonder what a space opera might read like if I ever stopped writing fantasies and took the interstellar plunge.I can guarantee one thing--it sure as Jupiter would feature a space bar. Maybe even in its opening scene."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think I would have found this wildly funny in college, but reading it at this stage in my life, I found it mostly pointless and silly, with moments of humor.

Douglas Adams managed to create a brilliant science fiction parody of life that will have you laughing whether you comprehend the scientific aspects or not.The basic storyline is that while Arthur Dent is trying to save his house from being demolished to make way for a new bypass, Ford Prefect is trying to save himself and his friend Arthur from being killed while the alien species, Vogons, demolish the Earth to create their own hyperspace bypass. Coincidence? In this case, probably. Ironic? Oh, most definitely.Arthur and Ford hitch a ride aboard the Vogon space cruiser, and from there on, begins their incredible, baffling journey in space.Adams writes this story in a way that brilliantly showcases his wit and sarcasm, while simultaneously coating it with underlying somber messages about the human race and life. It seems impossible and chaotic at time, but therein lies its charm. I believe this is one of the reasons the book is still as successful and popular as it is today. Despite the science fiction aspect of it, people get it, they relate to it, and they even find that they can laugh at themselves.The nonsensical situations and coincidences are so extraordinary, that one cannot help but be entertained. This is of course later on explained in the book through the Infinite Improbability Drive. The most compelling method of presenting wacky ideas is without embellishment because only then is the reader hit with the full impact of absurdity. Through a comical story and simplistic writing style, Douglas Adams creates a novel that will coax laughs out of everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhikers Guide, as well as all the other books by Douglas Adams years ago. Now I get to share that special Douglas Adams wit and complexity with my son. It's a great time for us both, and I get to live the adventure all over again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It has been a while since I have read this. I am happy to say that I still found it to be very amusing.It had an amazing impact when I first read it. Obviously it didn't have the same impact but I was aware of just how influential it has been.This is a very witty, amusing and often laugh out loud funny book. It is pretty short and it never outstays its welcome.It is very original and there is very little filler in it. The inventiveness of it all is astounding.There are some cracking characters in it and Marvin must be the greatest fictional Robot ever!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The title of this review is the next example of Gonzolit. It's perfect. Douglas Adams turns the English language into either the rantings of an existential crackpot -- or pure upside-down damn-the-rules poetry, the kind you find in Kids Say the Darndest Things, or Emma Donoghue's brilliant novel, Room.The only reason this book won't stand the test of time is if our species gets rid of all the digital watches.Okay. So what can be said about a book with 685 five-star reviews?And why would anyone review it now?Reviewers who wish to be seen hovering above the mass of grocery store lit are always peering into the higher shelves in search of something that challenges the general mediocrity of our fiction, a plot that explodes the senses, or a character sufficiently outrageous that the mind reels trying to grasp the nuances and diagnose the sickness of the author.Such a book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not.Well, all right, the spacy berserkitude of The Guide challenges mediocrity. One might make a case that Adams is an embarrassment to the 21st Century dumbing-down of the imagination. And what this book also does, or did in 1979, was to raise the bar for the acceptably weird. There was a time when weird was Last Exit to Brooklyn, or Ulysses, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or going way back, Walt Whitman's magnificent and unpublishable Leaves of Grass. These books of course are literature. Douglas Adams would be the first to admit he did not create any literature. But what he did create was altogether nuts.Let's see... somewhere in the Galaxy, people are running a 10-million-year-long experiment in which the Earth is actually a giant computer. Five minutes before the experiment concludes, Vogons blow up the planet because it's in the path of a hyperspace by-pass and must be eliminated. Within days it is revealed that a new technology has superseded the need for the hyperspace by-pass! Wow! You gotta love it!This is my personal literary grail, devoutly to be sought: No Rules. No disbelief to suspend. No irony left unsmelted, no buckle left unswashed. Characters marching mindlessly through the narrative with or without balls or cause. And most crucial to Gonzolit, a sense of the absurd so delicious that no discerning reader can fail to appreciate it.That is why God gave us Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great dealer, great service: fast shiping and the book is in very good condition.

If there's one set of comic-themed scifi books that you ever get a chance to read, it should be this series. The one and only reason why I have rated this Kindle edition of the book so poorly is because they have disabled Text to Speech.I can understand audiobook companies weariness of highly intelligent, well designed text to speech software, but it doesn't excuse their actions. By disabling this software, (audio)book companies are only hurting their fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i really enjoyed this book. the movie was good so i read the book and i am pleasantly surprised that the book was a good laugh. i love dry humor so this is perfect for me. highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can one say about the greatest science fiction comedy ever written, Richard Cowper had a go but this is just ... well ... the Hitchhikers Guide, what can you say. This book so full of creativity is a phenomenon, this book flies &quot;like bricks don't&quot; as Dougkas Adams has been known to say. Such wit and of course the very English sarcasm.The story of Arthur Dent a rather pathetic figure whose house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a new highway bypass and is then rescued by his friend Ford Prefect (named after a car) and then attempts to halt the destruction by lying in the squelching mud in front of the bulldozers, is helped all the way by the bumbling foreman Mr Prosser who is, remarkably enough, a long distant descendant of Ghengis Khan and has a prediliction for litte furry hats and axes over his doorway, although the bravery of the great Khan has not been transmitted. This is how the story starts instantly enveloping the reader in a world of comedic joy with amazing creativity without becoming weak or slapstick in any way. The characters involved vary from the aforementioned Arthur, to Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the erstwhile president of the galaxy a position of no power at all, Marvin the paranoid android a product of the hopeless Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose largest department, which occupies the major portion of an entire planet, is its complaints division, the Vogons who like to spout shockingly bad poetry (the 3rd worst in existence) are callous and cruel and a host of other amazing creatures.Not only are the characters fascinating but the situations they get into are as well, eg the rescue of Arthur as Earth is being destroyed by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass is miraculous because it happens as they are dumped unceremoniously by a Vogon guard through the airlock and wisked out of the vacuum by the Improbability drive ship stolen by Zaphod.Only an Englishman could come up with this sort of comedic treasure. Maybe something to do with the stiff upper lip and all that.A book read again and again and again and again ......"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With a whole galaxy to choose from, 5 stars seems too limited!

It has the same kind of strange, warped humor! If you enjoy that kind of humor you will get a kick out of this series.This is a fun, mindless ride. If you expect something halfway serious you will be disappointed, but if you are willing just to be taken on a entertaining ride - hop aboard!The basic storyline is this: Arthur Dent is told by his friend Ford Prefect that he is actually an alien, and that Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a glactic overpass. Ford Perfect offers Arthur Dent the opportunity to come with him and be safe. Arthur has a hard time believing this but comes along. He discovers that Ford Perfect is an alien and a field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Things get really strange and hillarious from there!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read in my entire life.This book contains some of the most entertaining dialogue and gags in a sci-fi book.

This loony masterpiece has made for a name for itself in everyway the previously defined book has not, and then some.Though a valid portrayal of the book would tell of an earthman jarred from his home to discover the mysteries of the galaxy, this hardly describes the novel for what it really is. With its chaotic plot and illogical meanderings, you can't help but get addicted to the totally unorthodox writing style of Douglass Adams. As the storyline shifts endlessly, there are innumerable investigations into the underlying truths of our home planet. Things like the fact that dolphins have been warning us of the end of the world for years are common throughout the novel. And with off the wall style comes off the wall humor in a book that will keep you laughing from cover to cover. If you've ever enjoyed a Daniel Pinkwater book you'll fall in love with the Hitchhiker's Guide.On a scale from 1-10, Douglas Adams' inane writing fashion gets a 10 from me. And if you've ever wondered if it's really the lab mice that are performing the experiments or that the answer to the question of life is 42 for some reason, then The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just finished reading this book after hearing much about it and I think it was fantastic and can't wait to read the sequals. This is a great science fiction novel for any sci-fi fan but is also a good book for any reader, even one that does not enjoy sci-fi. I thought it was hilarious and very quirky and was an overall great book. When I first finished it I was very disappointed by the ending which leaves many points unresolved until I had a friend explain to me that this is all covered in the sequals and that it wasn't just a horribly bad ending :). Apparently all of the sequals (or at least the next couple) were originally sold all together with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in one big book.

Dialogs are funny, descriptions are comic and the argument is hilarius. Most of all, this is a smart novel where the casuality is masterly managed.

These very improbable events produce a world where, for example, humans are only part of a ten million years long experiment done by the most intelligent species in the universe: mice, of course.I'm looking forward to read the other two parts of the &quot;incresingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...but I thought this book was terrible.

The book shows how far the author can expand his realm of wittiness about aliens and outter space but one couldn't fail to notice the disorientation caused in the process. The invention of odd words, pronouns, and situations only makes it far from intriguing unlike it was intended to be. Not worth the hype given to it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is marginally funny, at best. At its worst, it's just plain boring. I bought this book because I heard it was on the same level as Monty Python, nothing could be further from the truth, Monty Python has jokes, funny ones, this book relies on lame puns. Most of the time the book is just plain weird, some of it doesn't make a lick of sense, a hippie with three arms is president, people can understand any language in the universe by holding a fish to their ear, the meaning of life is 42, what the hell is that all about?

In the end, I was truly disappointed. In no way did i find that this book was good. It attempts to make fun of the creation of Earth, praises the \\"intelligent\\" mice and most shockingly, pokes fun at the High and Almighty God. In the end, of course, the author, Douglas Adams fails miserably...except for the part where he worships the lowly mice. In no apparent way is this \\"wholly remarkable book\\" remarkable, or even close to being satisfactory. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is an absolute failure as a satire piece, and could not have been any worse as a sci-fi novel. How do you save yourself from something that is utterly boring - and miserably disgraceful?The plot is pointless, the characters aren't developed, and the setting...the setting is just messed up. There is no theme, no meaning for this book.

He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity. If you want a laugh that will make you wiser, read Mark Twain or Joseph Heller. If you want a good story, read Chehov or Tolstoy. They won't make a fool of you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and, being an avid SciFi reader, I followed her advice. I eagerly read and re-read the back of the book, thinking that I was in for a real treat. I was wrong.It is hard to tell whether the author was intending the book to be science fiction or comedy. After re-reading passages several times that (supposedly) explain some of the 'scientific' elements of this book, some shreds of logic are able to be discerned, though this can prove difficult at times. While a few parts were admittedly funny, there wasn't nearly as many as I would have expected from all the hype.The characters were underdeveloped, and the plot nearly non-existent. You go through the book in a total state of confusion, and just when the plot looks starts to make sense, it falls apart again.I have a feeling that if you were to get a writer from Looney Tunes to create a SciFi book, this would be the result.Besides the major literary flaws, this book struck a nerve for me too. I get the impression that the author does not have a high opinion of Earth or the human race in general. It was Roddenberry's belief (the creator of Star Trek) that humans were the most remarkable species in the galaxy. While I realize that it would be arrogant and ridiculous for every SciFi work to hold this sentiment, in most we at least have a shred of respect.In The Hitchhiker's Guide, however, humans are dull (and if you're using Arthur Dent as a reference, I can see how you would come to this conclusion) and the only recognition Earth has are the words \\"Mostly Harmless.\\" \\"Mostly Harmless?\\" If they had given us just a few hundred more years to develop interstellar travel, we would have shown them \\"mostly harmless.\\"All in all, I would say that if you want a good SciFi read, with understandable plots, excellent character development, and plenty of laughs to go around, check out Animorphs (by KA Applegate). Leave The Hitchhiker's Guide for fans of Monty Python and Bugs Bunny."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Total garbage. It didn't make any sense at all.

If you want to read quality science fiction books read early Heinlein."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let me say that much of the so-called \\"story\\" in this supposed \\"book\\" is nothing but lies and weirdness. Some of it even defies all belief! If you like books about crazy aliens who act like they are out of their gord, well maybe this book is up your alley. I'm worried that if you let your children read this, it will make them think the world really works like this, and that you can talk to mice like they are people (no kidding -- it says that). Good luck teaching kids right from wrong after they've had their brains scrambled by this rubbish. At times I could not tell if Mr. Adams was trying to be funny or if he really thinks this way. I suspect maybe he needs professional help or something. I shudder at the thought of encouraging people to publish this sort of insane rambling as if it were a travel guide to outer space. I certainly didn't get any good, practical travel advice from this book.

His home is demolished to make way for a bypass; his best friend turns out to be an alien; the earth is destroyed to make way for an interstellar highway; he is thrown out of an extraterrestrial spacecraft into deep space only to be rescued by a criminal politician, who once lured away Arthur's dream girl with the unlikely line, \\"I have my own spaceship.\\" And that's just the beginning.Armed with nothing more than The Hitchhiker's Guide and bath towels, the homeless Arthur and his friend Ford travel the wild universe of Adam's imagination cheating death time and again.Monty Python lovers will surely appreciate Douglas Adams' satirical take the galaxy, where poetry kills, the thugs are bureaucrats and a smart hitchhiker always knows where his towel is.Quick comic prose and quotable one-liners will keep you listening as Adams delightfully skewers politics, religion and the quest for enlightenment.Narrated to hilarious perfection by British actor Stephen Fry, this is a fast fun book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This story of an ordinary earthman and his adventures through the universe with some colorful space guys will have you rolling on the floor laughing, shaking your head in amazement, and flipping pages like there's no tomorrow.

Read it again and again"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent, an Earthman, is saved by Ford Prefect right before the earth is destroyed to make way for the Vogon highway. This isn't the end it is the beginning. Don't panic!It is science fiction as parody as science fiction. Although social commentary in science fiction is not new (indeed in my opinion one finds some of our best social critics to be writers of science fiction) Adams has a way of not only making it fun but creating one layer on top of another and the philosophies and barbs become as absurd as some of the polymorphous characters. The book presents a panorama of absurdity.This is book that could have only been written after the whiff of the 60s was still in the air but was not just for aging hippies. Some of it is indeed very silly and some of it bordering on the profound. Sometimes in reading this I was reminded of Lewis Carroll, not so much the Lewis Carroll of Alice in Wonderland but of Jabberwocky as the names and forms of some of the characters are very, well very \\"Jabberwocky\\" ( yes there is even a character in the book named \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\\").Throughout Dent's travels, which read very much like comedy skits, the author sometimes steps back and explains bit of arcana of the universe which always has some sort of off beat dead pan joke behind it. When this book first came out I remember many of the catch phrases like \\"Don't panic\\" on everyone's lips.You will find Adams to be a great humorist. Even now as I refresh my memory by going over the book I read about 25 years ago I am laughing to myself. Adams is an original. At the time when I first read the book it sometimes seemed so breezy and its catch phrases so easily absorbed by the popular culture I wondered if it was just somewhat of a fad, something that struck a cord in a generation (and only for that generation). My doubts were unfounded.In my opinion the work has stood the test of time. It sounds like hyperbole but who knows it a hundred years this book might be considered a true classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Written by Douglas Adams, \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" was first published in 1979 and is the first instalment of his legendary five-part trilogy. (Adams apparently attributed this to a poor grasp of arithmetic). The series started life as a radio show, before becoming a book, a television series, a play and a bath towel. After years of trying, it was finally adapted for the big screen in 2005. Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and died in May 2001, while working on the film's screenplay.Arthur Dent wakes up on a Thursday morning with a raging hangover. Having left London about three years before the book opens, he now lives in England's West Country. That, however, is about to change : the local council has decided to knock down his house to make way for a bypass. Although their plans had officially been place for around nine months, they had somehow 'forgotten' to mention it to Arthur until the previous day - hence, the raging hangover. In a very bad start to the day, his hangover is interrupted by a bulldozer trundling up the garden path.Things aren't about to get any better, either. Arthur's one-man protest is disturbed by Ford Prefect - a very good friend who drags him off to \\"The Horse and Groom\\", with the express intention of drinking several pints of bitter. The pair have been friends for around five or six years. So far as Arthur knows, Ford is an out-of-work actor from Guildford. In fact, he comes from a small planet near Betelgeuse, is a roving reporter from \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" (imagine an interstellar Rough Guide) and has been marooned on Earth for about fifteen years. Unfortunately, it's come to his attention that the world is about to end : the Vogons, on behalf of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, need to demolish Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Fortunately, Ford has a way out and he plans to bring Arthur with him.After surviving the demolition and some Vogon poetry, the pair are picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox - the two-headed, three-armed, renegade President of the Imperial Galactic Government and an old friend of Ford's. Beeblebrox has managed to 'acquire' a very stylish spaceship called 'The Heart of Gold' - a ship with a very improbable fuel source. The ship's crew is completed by Trillian, a human female, and Marvin, a paranoid android.This is an exceptionally enjoyable, extremely funny and very easily read book - Terry Pratchett fans, in particular, should enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Imagine that one day you wake up hung over from the night before and learn the earth, the earth you've lived on for all of your life, is going to be demolished to make way for a new hyperspatial express route for traveling throughout the galaxy. In fact, this is exactly what Arthur Dent, the main character of this book, wakes up and finds out. Along with other characters, Arthur travels, or hitchhikes rather, around the galaxy and encounters numerous obstacles along the way. Most importantly though, not without knowledge from the revised version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to aide him.This book is an excellent read for anybody into science fiction, or even somebody who is not but enjoys humor, because this book is a wonderful, funny, quick read you will never want to put down. Douglas Adams is a terrific writer and his comedy is pure genius. So stop reading reviews of this book and go on a journey hitchhiking through the universe with Arthur and his companions."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I wanted to re-read this before the movie comes out, so I picked it up at the library.

A cast of improbable, but great characters, a wonderfully epic plot somehow crammed into a very short book, and lots of laughs along the way. I'll be re-reading the other books in the series shortly, and I look forward to that even more after reading this one again.If you haven't read this, you really should, at least so you will know why people answer 42 to any number of questions that come up. And if you have read it, you probably don't need me to tell you that you should read it again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I saw the previews for the upcoming movie, and I thought I would read the book first. I am so glad I did! I laughed and was swept away by this extremely funny book. Some parts of it, when they get into all the \\"space talk,\\" were less enjoyable, but not really central to the plot, so its OK if you just skip over some of the made up words. I am so glad I read this book, and I am looking forward to finishing the whole series. It is sort of like Harry Potter for grown ups, a bit spoofy, and magical with a sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious take on popular science fiction, but don't expect much about Earth, as it is destroyed within the first three chapters. This sets the stage for an exciting adventure on a galactic scale. It has a wide and diverse range of imaginative characters ranging from the clueless human Arthur Dent, to the sulking depressed android Marvin. Douglas Adams has a very peculiar style of humor that guarantees a laugh on every page. Science fiction fans that are not afraid to laugh at some common clich&eacute;s will enjoy this book as it takes plenty of jabs at popular Sci-Fi series such as Star Trek and Star Wars. The plot revolves around the misguided adventures of Arthur Dent, who has his house demolished, his planet blown up, and is cast out into deep space all on the same day. Then he takes off with the two-headed president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, to find a long-lost \\"planet\\" that makes customized planets for wealthy clients. There is a dry sense of humor running through the book that relies very heavily on irony to show just how nonsensical science fiction is. Adams has shown here that Science Fiction doesn't always have to take itself seriously, and does it beautifully. This book has spawned almost 6 other books, all with the same characters, but still just as entertaining. I believe the argument of the book is that we should embrace our diversity while noticing each others quirks and habits. Adams shows this throughout the book with his funny descriptions of each characters personality. He is very good at making me laugh, and I recommend this book to humor and science-fiction fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Want to know the secrets of the universe? Then stick out your thumb and hitch a ride with Arthur Dent and his friends: Trillian a fellow human, Ford Prefect an extraterrestrial Hitchhiker, and Zaphod the former president of the Galaxy in the novel \\"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\"!You'll laugh your socks of as you travel to beyond the bounds of impossibility and beyond in this amazing combination of science fiction and comedy! Arthur Dent is an every day kind of guy; that is until he is saved from earth's demolition and he embarks on the greatest (and probably first) adventure of his life as he hitchhikes across the galaxy. Watch as he learns the Ultimate answer, the meaning of life on Earth, and have some laughs. \\"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is part of a trilogy so you can have even more fun reading its sequels. This book is well written and doesn't go two paragraphs without a punch line! I thoroughly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Every field of cultural endeavor has its own mischievous sprites: Ogden Nash in poetry, Andy Warhol in art, Alan Sherman and Randy Newman in pop music, Blake Edwards and the Farrelly brothers in cinema. Douglas Adams, whose improbable initials were DNA, would have to be regarded as one literature's mischief-makers, and his escapades begin with THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, a classic that's as much about humor as science fiction.Consider the underlying plot circumstances: the world's most powerful computer has spent seven and a half years determining that The Answer to the great question of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is 42, but that same computer admits it cannot determine what the question is. The planet architects of Magrathea are enlisted to design a planet, Earth, that will become the centerpiece of a 10 million year experiment to find the question. Unfortunately, five minutes before the experiment is completed (and the question found by a girl sitting alone in a small caf&eacute; in Rickmansworth), the Vogons demolish the planet Earth (unnecessarily, as it turns out) to clear a path for the hyperspatial express route through the outer reaches of the galaxy.Thus begins the adventures of one Arthur Dent - a perfectly ordinary Earthman and the sole human survivor of the demolition - and his friend Ford Prefect (named after a late 1940's Ford automobile), who turns out to be a field researcher for the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Along the way, they meet one Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy who has just become a hunted thief for stealing the Heart of Gold, the most improbably remarkable car in the galaxy powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Of course, all this science fiction foolishness is just a cover for Adams's real purpose, to satirize every sacred cow in our culture from religion and philosophy to evolution and technology. Nearly every page contains a droll comment, a cutting remark, or just an offbeat observation about the inherent oddity of life. Most of them will make you smile, and some may even make you laugh. Added to all this, Adams gives us talking white mice, a terminally depressive android named Marvin, a universal language translator in the form of a Babel fish, and a planet builder named Slartibartfast who specializes in fjords and got an award for designing Norway.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is great fun, sort of a reader's Monty Python. It's a bit like reading a comic book without the pictures, a guilty pleasure that's difficult not to enjoy as a break from more serious work. Then again, Doug Adams's greatest accomplishment may have been being serious without seeming to be, telling us not to take ourselves so seriously. Who else could have had the Earth's population of dolphins escaping the planet just before its destruction, saying goodbye to humanity with the message, \\"Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish.\\"Buy a copy, bring a towel, and \\"Don't Panic!\\" Just like Earth, it's \\"mostly harmless.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read this book and various portions of it countless times since i've picked it up five years ago. I've subsequently read all of DNA's books, Bought the radio show, beat the computer game, saw the T.V show and even joined zz9 the great fan club. Needless to say I recomend this book to anyone who wishes to escape this world and join Arthur Dent on his pan-galactic journey through space, time, and morality. The best part of this book (which is the best in the series by the way) is the way DNA can throw out a million ideas and situations and in the end bring it all together in one comic tour-de-force. Simply remarkable"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams sure knows how to make you laugh. With this book its just one adventure after another and pretty soon you start to become Arthur Dent yourself! You know which way to go, but of course you know which way Adams makes Arthur go and the conclusion to it is something pulled out of everyday life and put into a pickle jar(its that funny).Douglas Adams is one of those authors who plays with your mind and makes you think things and makes you see things. He paints such vivid pictures its amazing.While reading his other books in the series he always finds a way to bring in an inside joke that you'd only know if you've read the previous book.So hold onto your hats, cause you're in for a while ride when you read this one!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read, read it!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very interesting book about Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. They hitch a ride on a spaceship before earth is destroyed. Rhern they learn many things that the people of earth never knew.

It brought some far-out thoughts to my mind, and things I couldn\`t even imagine. Like how big the galaxy is and how much there is in it.I recommend it to anyone interested in reading about very funny and different things. It has plenty of action that keeps you stuck in the book.

I definately recomend it to anybody who wants a hysterically funny adventure book you can't put down!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't even know where to begin. Saying that this was my favorite book ever doesn't really tell you anything unless you know my literary history. I read a lot. I have read most of the classics(I own the easton press library's &quot;100 greatest books ever written&quot; and have read 75% of them) , dozens of sci fi books, every scherlock holmes story ever, mystery novels, detective stories, tragedies comedies, adventure novels... you name it, I have probably read it. But few books have ever motivated me to read them for a second time, even fewer for a third, and the only books I have read 4 times or more are books by Mr. Douglas Adams. In particular the Hitch Hicker's trilogy (all 5 of them). I bought the books on tape, and heve literaly listened to one side of each tape nearly every night for the last 5 years. You may call it sick, I may call it love for the greatest book ever writen (or just the best insomnia cure I have found to date). Whatever it is there is something special about this book. &quot;more popular than the 'celestial homecare omnibus', better selling then ' 53 more things to do in zero gravity', and more contriversial then Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philisophical blockbusters, 'where God went wrong', 'some more of God's greatest mistakes', and 'who is this God person anyways?'. For one of the funniest, smartest, most imaginative books ever written,whith unforgetable characters like Marvin:&quot; a depressed robot with an exeptionaly large mind 'sort of an electronic sulking machine'&quot;; Zaphhod Beeblebrox: &quot;President of the imperial galactic government, who is also adventurer, ex-hippie, good-timer, and, quite possibly, crook&quot;; and of course thhe seris's star Aurther Dent: &quot;for whom the adventure begins on a terrible thursday with the destruction of his house&quot; read &quot;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;!

Arthur Dent, your average ignorant human being, is lucky enough to hitch a ride with his alien buddy on a passing spaceship just moments before Earth is destroyed. Now I like a good laugh, but some of the humor in this book is just stupid. When Arthur convinces the man who is trying to demolish his house to actually protect it while Arthur leaves, I knew early on what kind of nonsense I was getting into. Some people like that kind of humor, but I find tiresome. You really have to appreciate British humor to like a book like this. On the positive side, it's a quick read (I finished it in 2 days) and does present some interesting and funny ideas about the origins of Earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I recently purchased this book and read it..

I found this one harder to grasp at time then say a Terry Pratchett novel.The stuff I found funny was the stuff that I already knew the punchline like the meaning of life answer. When I think about this book now there really isn't much I like about it. The voices of the character in my head feel kinda of annoying.I guess I am just not a fan of British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams wasn't the best book I've read. This book was very confusing in many ways. Things happen a little to fast and then it gets confusing. Like when all of the sudden the earth blows up. It doesn't really explain why. Also, it has a lot of bizarre names and characters. If you're a person who likes nice simple books that puts everything out for you this isn't the book for you. A lot of things didn't make any sense. There were some real names of things such as McDonald's and London etc. Mostly made up like the Infinite Improbability Drive and the species in the galaxy.The Basic summary of the book is a person from Earth named Arthur Dent is rescued by a weird alien named Ford Prefect. He is rescued because Earth is disinagrating or overheating. They escape on a Vogon ship which they get shot out of an airlock into space. Then the President of the galaxy named Zaphod Beeblebrox, ship rescues them, and the they meet a very depressed robot named Martin. The title comes from a book in the story called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It basically gives them tips along the way. There is some humor in this book. Mostly in the guide. Like Ford has a towel in his satchel all the time for various things. It says it in the guide too.This book wasn't the greatest thing I've read, I give it two stars. I am being a little generous. I am mostly giving this rating because it was confusing, not very exciting, didn't grab my attention, and it wasn't very clear on things. I liked it for the two stars because it kinda reminded me of Star Wars. I don't know why but it did. It was a sci-fi book that's probably why. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before his death, Doug Adams gave an interview in which, among other things, he mentioned that he was surprised that people wanted more of the hitchhiker stuff because as far as he was concerned it was old hat and not funny. With him I have to agree and one has to be puzzled why people would read such drivel as this. The characters, the plot, the story, the background, the atmosphere, the landscape, the tone etc. is just awful, with little or no redeeming social or artistic value. Doug said as much in the interview, but indicated that he hated the idea of writing more of this stuff, but he needed the money. You'll save your eyes and your time and get more benefits by sleeping than by reading this book-like-object."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the story of Arthur Dent, an man who survives the destruction of the Earth by hitchhiking with his friend Ford Prefect (who turns out to be an alien) onto the spaceship Heart of Gold, which is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Spoilers ahead.The disconnect between the quality of the book and the rave reviews it has on Amazon is bewildering. I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes--it's so hyped that people are afraid to not like it. In reality, it's trite and unfunny, and the author's ego radiates off of every page. The random details that Adams inserts, from the stream of consciousness from the sperm whale to Deep Thought's answer to the question of the meaning of life, remind me of a third-grader writing their first short story and reveling in how how awesomely ~random they are.Douglas Adams tries way, way too hard to come off as nonchalant, pithy and oh-so-subtly thought-provoking. I'm not sure why the 651 reviewers who gave this book five stars can't see how transparent those efforts are. In the end, it's a collection of random thoughts with no greater meaning--and no, I don't think it even points to how meaningless life really is, and how we should live in the moment, etc. I think it points to how meaningful Douglas Adams thinks this book is.The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book for lazy readers. It's easy to swallow and offers a seemingly deep conclusion. If you're interested in psuedo-enlightened theories and don't want to put in more than nominal effort, this is the book for you. If not, try an author like Haruki Murakami, who captures some of the same elements of meaninglessness and consciousness in a much more real way.Enjoying this book isn't a sign of your enlightened open-mindedness and intellectual superiority over others. It's a sign that you're not thinking for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided to read this novel because it is widely acclaimed as a contemporary science fiction classic. Douglas Adams' description of Arthur Dent, who is the lone man to survive the destruction of the planet earth, is consistently humorous and entertaining. Dent is set loose to roam the galaxy, accompanied with an alien friend who is thankfully equipped with the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As the novel progresses, it becomes evident that despite the superficial whimsical tone, Adams is dealing with deeper themes relating to the meaning and existence of human life. The absurdity created by his imagination is not just a matter of light-hearted sci-fi entertainment, but is a cloak which Adams uses to convey his philosophy of human life and his personal worldview.One needs to recall that this novel was born in the late 1970s, in the hey-day of technology and space travel, a time when there was a great deal of optimism and faith in science as the saviour of mankind. Adams mocks this human arrogance. The arrogance of Bent's fellow-humans in destroying his home, becomes a microcosm for the arrogance of humankind, and when it is applied to man's own home earth, results in man's own destruction. Adams' scorn for scientific arrogance is especially manifest when it appears that the rulers of earth are not scientists, but their own laboratory mice, who were secretly conducting large-scale experiments on their captors all along.Yet this novel achieves much more than a scoffing of scientific arrogance. It becomes painfully evident that something essential is missing from the universe described in the Hitchhiker's Guide: God. When questioned by man about his existence, God &quot;promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.&quot; God's absence from Adams' fictional universe corresponds to God's absence in Adams' personal worldview. The worldview which Adams believes in and portrays is a galaxy without a Creator. Adams is in fact a self-confessed &quot;radical atheist&quot;, and holds this position very seriously.But if Adam's universe is a world without God, this leads to an inevitable question: In such a universe, what is the meaning and purpose of life? Adams toys with this question when he describes the &quot;The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot; After seven and a half million years of calculation, the super computer &quot;Deep Thought&quot; announces that the answer is &quot;Forty-two.&quot; This meaningless answer is incomprehensible, and is apparently so because we don't understand the question properly! Here Adams whimsically propounds his purpose for planet earth: earth is a gigantic experiment, because it is on earth that the question about the meaning and purpose of life is voiced, but never answered! The purpose of earth is to raise the question about its purpose.In Adams' atheistic worldview, the question about the purpose of life cannot be answered, because the existence of the very creator of the universe is denied. Such a question can only be asked, answered, and understood in a Christian worldview where the existence of the Creator is maintained, because apart from Him, creation is indeed purposeless. In this respect, the message of Adams' classic is the same as that of the Bible book of Ecclesiastes: there is no purpose and meaning in a world that rejects God. However, it is eternally unfortunate that Adams does not have the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes, where the premise of practical atheism is reversed, God's existence once again affirmed, and purpose discovered by serving and obeying God the Creator. Present day adherents of practical atheism who share Adams' empty worldview will discover that they will spend their life in the same way as Adams - in life whimsically hitchhiking an empty earth without God, and in death discovering that that God was always there, but that by their rejection of Him in the past, they will spend eternity without Him in the future. But then it will be too late. Because unlike the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eternity without God has no room for frivolous laughter, but only for sorrow and regret.In portraying the emptiness of an atheistic worldview, Adams is outstanding. In endorsing this worldview, Adams is to be most pitied. May God spare us from echoing his endorsement."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What a huge dissappointment! I found the book extremely boring. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent fantasy/sf I've been reading, but I found the plot very slow moving, and generally uninteresting and uninvolving. I also disliked the extreme amount of humor and satire in this book. I prefer my novels to be more realistic. I like adult situations (complex relationships, betrayal, violence, etc), and I couldn't find any here. It felt as if I was watching one LONG episode of Futurama.There were good things, however. The book was extremely short. I got through it in one sitting (about three hours), and I don't think I've ever done that before. Also, I found the book slightly humorous in parts, which served to barely keep my interest for that 3-hour reading stretch."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think that this book was one of the oddest I have ever read.

I first tried to read this book many years ago, soon after it was initially released. I managed to get past the first few chapters before tossing the book aside in disgust. I tried again a few years later with the same result. Finally, I thought to myself, \\"Self -- why not force yourself to read it through so you can properly evaluate it.\\" After all, a lot of people like it. And many of them think it's really funny.So that's what I did. I forced myself to read every last chapter of this -- this -- thing. And you know what. It is just as big an abomination as I remembered it to be. It has no proper story line that one can follow and no character development. On top of that, it uses meaningless sentences and meaningless words to create an assault on the human brain and on the ability of humans to \\"reason\\" their way through a problem, all of which that makes me think the author must have been on a very bad acid trip when he wrote this piece of garbage. As for humor, well, in the whole book, I found only two lines that made me laugh. The rest of it made me want to puke. On the more positive side, the chapters are mercifully short, giving the reader many breaks between said assaults.If you like slapstick comedy that has no purpose, you may like this book, but count me out.

I started laughing on the first sentence and didn't stop till I'd finished the book.

Arthur Dent is an earthling who has had everything go wrong with him. His house is about to get torn down when he sees his old friend Ford Prefect, an alien that has lived on earth for fifteen years doing research on his revised Hitchikers Guide. Prefect comes at no better time because the world is about to end in eleven minutes. Just before the world comes to total anialation, the are picked up and travel around the universe. They arrive in Magrathea, which is just a factory planet for building planets for rich people. The people of Magrathea were woken up to build another earth because the previous earth, our earth, was a giant computer that's program was to find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everthing. Magrathea was going to build another earth because our earth was destroyed just minutes before the answer was questioned. Since everyone wanted to know the question, they decided to re-build another earth to find it out. Once the mice, the secret rulers of earth, find out that there is an earthling alive, they wanted his brain. Arthur runs away and the mice are stuck with nothing. They make up a question and everybody is happy, or are they? This book opens your thoughts to many different questions we have about the universe and that we would like to know. If you want to broaden your horizons and open your mind, then read this book to be thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams, the funniest author ever to put pen (typewriter, computer, whatever) to paper, begins his hilarious and misnamed trilogy, chronicaling the adventures and misadventures of the tea-drinking, &quot;what?&quot;-saying Arthur Dent and an assortment of supporting characters which must be read to be believed. Does the local planning council have a leg to stand on when it tries to demolish his house? Given the ensuing events, does it matter whether they have a leg to stand on or not? If you're looking for a thoughtful book with a sensible plot, a believable storyline and a fitting moral, you've got the wrong book. If you're looking for the best read since the grafiti on the office bathroom wall, you've got it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was so funny that, though it isn't very long, it took me forever to read; every time I laughed so hard I cried, I had to put the book down. It's quirky, it takes unexpected turns, the characters are laws unto themselves, and it makes you start to wonder just what all of this is about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I recommend the first and second books in this series. After that, I lost interest. Maybe it's just me. Anyway, it's a pleasure to read so long as said reader isn't dependent on plots, development, meaning, or other pretentious, out dated literary cliches. Just read it already. For something in the same vein, but with a message, i suggest 'The Sirens of Titan' By Vonnegut; a funny book that makes you THINK."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book in the early 80's when I was in middle school. I just picked it up again for the second time in Jan 1999. I think I even enjoyed it better the 2nd time. This is the Monty Python for galactic travelers. Three things I've learned from this book: 1. A towel is quite a useful tool 2. In the scheme of things, digital watches are NOT that big a deal 3. Have faith. Don't Panic! This book is such a fun and light escape from reality, as are the rest of Douglas Adam's books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A brilliant piece of storytelling, Adams weaves his tale with ease...considering the fact that the book spills over to a complete trilogy (in four parts!). The brickbats, couched in the form of seemingly improbable events, are aimed at those of us who take Life a trifle seriously. The conclusion especially is marvellous!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never in our time has a book of such caliber been written... and sustained such a following. The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy should be required literature class reading, as it is one of the greatest books of the 20th century. This is one book that noone should overlook."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first thing Arthur Dent sees as he opens his eyes one morning is a bulldozer heading staight for his home. Of course, the destruction of his house becomes less of a worry to him as the day goes on. When you find out your best friend is from another planet, and Earth is about to be destroyed in order to make room for a hyperspace bypass, one tends to stop thinking about their destroyed dwelling. This book is histerical from start to finish. So grab your towel, sit back and start reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As anyone can tell from looking at the other 500 some reviews here, this is a masterpiece of modern American Literature. Even though it's British. However, there are a few small problems I have wih this edition. Firstly, where's the green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker that adorned the covers of all previous editions? Secondly: well, acutally that's my only comment. However, just this book will leave you wanting more. I suggest the &quot;Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; which is all 5 in the increasingly inaccurately named &quot;Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot; in one neat little package, complete with green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book two years ago and it's been my favorite ever since. It is absolutely the most hilarious thing you will ever read. I pick it up every time I need a good laugh and get something different from it every time. You'll never get tired of it, trust me."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My mom read this book to me last year, when I was in 2d grade. I loved the great ideas--Like when the British hero's home is under siege by bulldozers and the buraucracy AT THE VERY SAME TIME the entire Earth is slated for destruct because its in the way of the Aliens.--by Cullen."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"After reading this book, I began carying around a towel and glancing at the sky ever afterwards, to put it mildly. It was a wounderful wimsicle adventure with a suprise arond every turn."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Do you LOVE British humor, like Monty Python or Black Adder? There is a lot of dry humor in this book, so be prepared. Me personally, I loved reading this again. And because of it's portable size, it's easy to take anywhere, which means if you're afraid of people hearing you laugh hysterically from the bathroom, then don't take it in there. Be sure to look up Ford Prefect on Wikipedia if you don't know what one is. Neologisms abound in this culture-impacting, geek-required, hysterical masterpiece. The movie barely follows this story, and when you read the book, you'll discover just how challenging it would be to make a film as funny as the book and be the same story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I liked this book -- maybe not as much as I thought I would, but still not bad. It felt like a book your strange friend from high school wrote -- the kid on the stage crew who would never miss an episode of Star Trek and who was designing web pages before most people had e-mail. The funny thing is that Hitchhiker's Guide was one of the first of its kind and had many imitators (like my strange friend).I was actually belly-laughing at some parts -- Adams is very good with humor. How else could you laugh at a book that begins with the needless destruction of planet Earth?!?For all super-intelligent shades of the color blue out there, this book's for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"By the strangest coincidence I left this classic at the office and was stuck at home reading Hemingway short stories. Hemingway writes about drink, and war, and illness. Adams, on the other hand, writes about drink, and war, and illness. One thing's for sure: Hitchhiker's Guide is not science fiction. It is also not science. Probably not fiction either. What it is is really weird, like the front page of the daily newspaper, only more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It has been said that Adams writes in one-liners. This is an unfair criticism (there are, in fact, hardly any one-liners here), but there is an element of truth to it: his writing is rather episodic. He tends to write scenes in not because they logically advance the plot or fit into the story, but simply to harp on some issue. He can also be fairly redundant. A good example of both these points is the unjustifiably lengthy scene with the cops--we get it, Adams, cops are dumb!All of these problems, however, improve significantly in later books in the series. And this book has great virtues also. Adams has a brilliant wit, and his dialogue is particularly excellent. His use of science in the book has been justly praised, though the line is blurry between when he's satirizing the more bizarre theories of science, or when he actually accepts them and just thinks they make for amusing situations.Personally, I actually thought the recent movie version was better than the book, as it preserved its virtues (the witty dialogue, etc.) and strengthened some of its weaker areas (the sketchy plotting, etc.). I know some purists who've been fans of the book for years will think this is blasphemy, and I can understand that, but it's kind of a silly objection for a story that's been through so many permutations in so many different media already."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVED the movie. Usually, when you enjoy a movie you are bound to hold to the old cliche \\"the movie was good but the book was better\\". In this case, although the book was okay, I thought the movie was much better.The book was funny in parts and obviously was the inspiration for a hilarious movie, but on the whole, I was disappointed with the book. If you enjoyed the movie, I would recommend the book just for a different slant on the story.Apparently, people have been talking about this book for years. I guess I just don't understand how the book falls so flat with such a great writer. The story, the characters, the imagaination, all was well done, but at the end of the book, I was just left feeling empty. I couldn't believe it. The book just ended abruptly. There was no real climax and no resolution. Maybe you have to read the other \\"Hitchhikers\\" books to get the whole story. I don't know if I will take the time.So, just an average read that was made in to a fantastic movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This has to be one of the funniest books ever written. Why? Because it's filled with absolutely wonderful stream-of-consciousness style humor. And I mean humor! The kind that is legitimately funny. This will make you smile, even laugh. If you like wacky, off-beat, often surreal gags, you have to buy this book.Okay, so if it's so good, why not 5 stars? Why only 4? Because, truth to be told, there isn't that much of a story. It's kind of like a sitcom - the characters are so wonderful and throw out such gloriously funny lines, you barely notice that there's very little actually happening and you don't really care that much. Well, this book is like that. A series of 'incidents' that are really neither here nor there, but presented with a sharp, surreal wit, not least in the narrative, let alone the dialogue. Okay, everthing eventually ties in, but the joy in reading this is not in the world-building and grand storytelling scale of the likes of Lord of the Rings, but in the sheer delight of it's comedic value.It's an old book now, probably given a new boost of life by the recent movie (unfortunately, not that good an adaptation). If you enjoy wacky humor, you won't be disappointed here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books! It's just so well written and so funny. Great for \\"getaway\\" summer reading!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Many people who haven't yet discovered Douglas Adams' science-fiction comedy series are probably feverishly racing to finish this first novel in time for the movie's opening (as I did). This book has been on my reading list for a long time, and I'm grateful to the movie for giving me a kick in the butt and finally getting me to sit down and read it (which I did in about three days---it's a remarkably fast read). I can't imagine how they're going to adapt it to the screen, as the book is a goofy, surrealist jokefest that never once takes itself at all seriously. You can tell Douglas Adams was making things up as he went along, not pausing along the way to make sure anything makes a whole lot of sense. The story--or at least the book's main premise--is probably familiar to anyone who's reading this comment, so I won't bother with a summary (which I'm not sure I could do anyway). If you sat Woody Allen down and asked him to write a season of Dr. Who, \\"Hitchhiker\\" is what you'd get. I really enjoyed it without really loving it. I'll probably go on to read the other stories, but these books serve the same purpose for me as do P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves\\" series. They're the literary equivalent of junk food---they satisy a craving, but leave me wanting to move on to something a little more substantial."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide was a novel unlike most i have read before. Along with intellectual inferences, came a light mood and un-used setting. How often do you read a comical story that deals with outer space, and the life that may exist out there? Douglas Adams knows his audience, and can appeal to everyone that is able to read. Being older, a reader may have more understanding of the scientific inferences, like the improbability drive for example. However, no matter how old the reader is, anyone can feel relieved when a missile is turned into a whale while in midair. This novel may have been humorous, but at the same time, a more educated reader can come away questioning all the universe really has to offer. Is there more out there? Adams writes this novel as a way to get across his ideas about the universe, and changes it from a science fiction, into a comical, yet throught-provoking literary work. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There is one, and only one, word to describe this book and that is insane, beyond all reason I might add. I have just got done reading angels and demons and two of the books in the dune series and this was a nice break. It was a rollercoaster that throws your head into an intoxicated spin of laughter and pure ludicrous adventure, but without the glare of the sun and the long lines. I highly suggest this book for anyone with a few hours to spare, since once you pick this book up you can not stop reading it. For all of you that wish for supposedly \\"cultured\\" and \\"intellectual\\" reading don't read this book please and give an abhorring review as some have done. If you want a book that is \\"intellectual\\" and up to your standards, then I would suggest Niccolo Machiavelli's The Prince."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No, fifteen stars, and an aditional two-thumbs-up for extra humor. The other ones by Douglas Adams are great too, just not quite as funny. My E-mail is Soap90@aol.com, I want your opinion!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hi, this is Guy Buick, fellow hitchhiker of the galaxy. I can't believe how accuratey Mr. Adams described the world of a hitchhiker. Ford Prefect and I, yes, Ford is real, thoroughly enjoyed this enlightening tale of the galaxy. So grab a towel, grab a copy, stick out your thumb, and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Try this. Read the reviews by people who rated this book only one or two stars. If your impression of those people isn't that you'd rather kill yourself than sit next to them on a plane, don't read this book. Otherwise, pick up the Guide and find yourself back here and giving it five stars within a week."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It didn't suck, it wasn't in the least bit boring, ball point pens ARE funny, and you're an idiot."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of the books you'll never forget you've read. Whether you like it or hate it, you'll be reminded of it everytime you hear about a vogon, or why people on earth think that a digital wrist watch is something to be proud of. The Guide will give its reader a new perspective on a bunch of things. Being a science fiction story, it's as much a scietific story.In the book, we meet Arthur Dent. Arthur is a completely normal Brit living an hour outside London. His life is turned upside down the day when he finds out his beloved earth, his house, the pub is right in the way of the new intergalactic highway. We get to meet Ford Prefect, Arthurs friend since 15 years, who turns out to be much more than just a human being.The Hitchhikers Guide will test your nerves. Douglas Adams seems to be amused of the details surrounding life. I often found myself laughing at things I do everyday but never thought of before. I would say the book degrades mankind a little bit. But I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Overall, an interesting book, especially if you're into dry British humour, science fiction, things which happen for No Obvious Reason, inside jokes, et cetera. But as a story itself, the book gets average reviews...it was originally a radio serial program, and it sometimes shows. Worth a look, though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There is not much left to say about the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - just to thank Douglas Adams for having such a piercing wit and being able to make us laugh at ourselves and everything around us.

At first I was skeptical because I'm not really into Sci Fi, But I was hooked from page one. Totally Awesome."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that has everything! A wonderful sence of humour, explanations to the big questions of life and action, but the best of all is that you can reflect on both details and important parts of the story and look upon yourself, your friends, strangers, politicians, society - the whole world with another pair of eyes. The eyes of a Douglas Adams fan. And remember that the so called 'laws of nature' only are descriptions, and only apply for what we know of. The rest is unexplored and not impossible even though very improbable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A highly entertaining novel. Extremely original and probably the funniest book I've ever read. I love British humour. I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I'm not exactly sure if this qualifies for that genre. If you don't think it's funny, then you just don't get it. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Now, I won't go into detail, but I will say this: This. Is. The. Best. Book. Ever. Written. It's totally original, but mostly funny. Yeah, the humor is definitely there, with tons of cultural refrences. You do have to be smart enough to understand the jokes, though (like the Ford Prefect joke, which most Americans don't get). Well anyway, there's my rant. Hope it inspired you to read this, or at least think about it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about an Earthman named Auther Dent.

The plotline of space travel is unique and fascinating. Tis book also tries to answer life's big questions in a very humorous, light-hearted fashion. One big problem I had with the book was the very abrupt ending that not only caught me by surprise, but was very anti-climatic. Also, there were some fascinating characters that we were superically introduced to that I wish the author had explored a little more. Overall a very enjoyable read, yet had some key elements missing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I only give it less than four stars because it's so short and a bit disjointed. A throughly funny read, however, and well worth picking up, it should be rated four and three quarters or so.I read it again so I could go see the movie with the novel freshly on my mind. The last time I read the story was many years ago, and I have heard it as a book on tape (which was really good too).The humor is definately more clear as an older adult, if you read this book back in the eighties, like I did, and haven't read it since, it's time to pick it up again. It's not long and can be read in a few hours, it's worth a few laughs and at the very least will prepare you to see the movie that just came out.Cheers, and thanks for all the fish."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a very exciting novel about an ordinary man named Arthur Dent who is rescued by his best friend Ford Prefect before Earth is destroyed by the Vogons. Ford Prefect reveals one of his biggest secrets that he is an alien who is from a planet called Betelgeuse. Arthur and Ford then go on an extraordinary adventure in space with their companions Zaphod Beebelbroxe, Trillian, and Marvin. Zaphod is te ignorant president of the Galaxy with a second head and third arm. After stealing the Heart of Gold space ship, he is now a criminal. Trillian is a girl who Arthur once met and fell in love with but ran away with Zaphod. Marvin is a depressed robot with a brain the size of a planet. As you can see, Douglas Adams is very creative in this book and also has a sense of humor. The satire in this book is great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Interesting,enjoyable book. I found it to be quite funny most of the time. It was hard to put it down once I started reading it. I have always enjoyed the \\"Man's sense of anomie, one person trying to fit into the culture of others\\" kind of scenario whether it be in books or movies.Dent is clearly that kind of person in this book. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. The pictures he paints are vivid. The stories are implausible yet enjoyable. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way.To sum up: The book holds your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not formulaic,the story was fresh,and the visuals that he painted were good. All in all a good experience"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the most hilarious book I have ever read. It is a perfect sample of the genius of Douglas Adams, and his intense wit. A must own for lovers of sophisticated humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"You must understand me. I can't stand reading more than one book twice. Something about how the plot is given away; there is no surprise. Douglas Adam's Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one execption to this rule of mine. I must have read this book 20 times, and delight in reading it yet again. There is something about the wit put into it, the way the words are set up... This irresistable book is certainly one that I can't put down again and again.All of his books are full of orginality and humour like no other. The literature captures my attention and never lets it go, something that is truly remarkable. The detail emitted into each page is brilliant. The way that this author could add random stories about creatures of the galaxy, add different quite random items to the plot, and still have it make sense is a pure mystery to me. The characters are relateable, the plot is capturing, and the end leaves you craving for more.This book is good for all ages by me. I am 13, and recommend it for anybody looking for a good read, though the vocabulary might be a strech for anybody under the age of 12.I applaud Douglas Adams for his work of masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Poor, poor Arthur Dent. One day, the man is leading a so-called &quot;normal&quot; life, working, drinking, and just generally minding his own business. Then one moment later, everything he has known to be true no longer is so. He discovers that his best friend, Ford Prefect, is even stranger than he previously thought. The hitchhiking alien is about to take Arthur on the most amazing, not to mention life-saving, journey of his life through space and time. All this trouble is because some Vogons had been assigned to demolish planet Earth, which coincidentally, was also simply minding its own business.Genius Douglas Adams tells of Arthur's travels with a &quot;cast&quot; of hilariously absurd characters, like Marvin, the paranoid android, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president/most-wanted fugitive of the galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For those of you that are core sci-fi fans, you won't find what you want here. For those of you that enjoy sci-fi and enjoy humor, this is for you. With the brilliance of any man alive, Douglas Adams combines characters with words and creates the funiest sci-fi related series of books known this side of the galaxy. This, of course, is the grand-daddy of them all. It's easy to read, and will make you popular -- just like that froody Zaphod Beeblebox"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Memorizing the entire text of this book is thesurest path to enlightment, the easiest way tobecome a life guru, and the fastest way to payyour rent at any asylum in America.

All of them were great.Arthur Dent had just got up in the morning to see a big yellow bulldozer in his front yard. He then went to go lie in front of it. His friend Ford Prefect showed up and convinced Arthur that they had to talk and that it was more urgent then the matter at hand.

Besides the strange plot about a man who is taken from the earth seconds before it is destroyed to built a intergalatic highway. By his friend from another planet in another universe (betleguse) and then searching for a planet that makes other planets (one of them being earth) and then going to the cafe at the end of the universe. It really is the end as in the big collapse. There are also great charectors.

It still makes me laugh and other books pale in comparison. The great names, the references, dialogue, everything makes this book loved by almost anyone who reads it. Quit reading this and go get a copy. Otherwise life might have no meaning. I'll give it away now though. It's 42"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ever since they were born, I have been reading to my two kids at night. Well, I no longer read to my 15 year-old, but continue to read to my 13 year-old. He and I both still enjoy the time together. Currently, we are starting on the 4th of Douglas Adams' triology, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I read the series and all of the other Adams books I could find years ago, completed the 5 part triology with my older son three years ago and am thoroughly enjoying reading the books out loud for the 3rd time. While the books are so comic as to send us into hysterics routinely, the great humor is built upon real human problems and ideas which are important for family discussion. I find that I can discuss things such as the ultimate meaninglessness of money and digital watches to the depth that my children wish to take the discussion. There is nothing in the books to upset them or me. Adams even has the decency to warn his readers when in the 4th book, a particularly mushy part comes up. In short, they are a great read for the family"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Unless, of course, you read the other books in Adams' Hitchhiker series, which you will not be able to avoid once you read this one. Not just one of the funniest books ever written, THGG is also full of bits applicable to everyday life (at least if your life is like mine). You will get a new perspective on everything after reading this one - or you may find your perspective perfectly suited to being transported on board a passing spaceship just seconds before your planet is demolished for a hyperspace bypass (and that's just the first 36 pages!). Just as enjoyable in a parallel way are &quot;The Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts&quot; from the original BBC Radio series (ISBN 0-517-55950-1, Harmony Books 1985, may be out of print) and the 6 episodes of the BBC TV adaptation of THGG, which is still great even though it was made in 1981 (available from CBS/FOX Video in a boxed set with the paperback and two VHS tapes, ISBN 0-7939-5767-2). Try these if you've been through the series 20 times, like I have. If you're new to Adams' world, try the book - and don't forget your towel"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is hard to discribe this book without giving away some of it's parts, so I will discribe in the best way I can. The book gives you a view of the galaxy you wouldn't think of in your wildest dreams. Sometimes it's funny, but it's mostly all out wierd. Unless you don't have a since of humor you'll love this book"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Above is a quote directly from the novel. The book follows Arthur Dent, an Englishman, or former Englishman I should say as the Earth has just been destroyed to create a galactic bypass, and his Betlegeuseian friend Ford Prefect as they traverse the galaxy with their supplies: a towel(the most widely useful object ever to be invented) and of course the fabulous Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, a book in the form of a computer because if it were in regular page form, the carrier would have to lug around seven inconveniently sized buildings full of paper. The pair meet wierd aliens, robots, and other creatures. Don't be confused at first with the names: Zaphod Beeblebrox, for example, is a main character who's name you'll easily catch on to. This book is just flat out hilarious. It's Brazil (the 1984 spoof, not the country) meets Star Wars. Douglas Adams is more or less the master of confusing but hilarious plot as well as dialouge. Now, I'm not just writing this review because I love all sci-fi books. In fact, I read very few, about 20%, sci-fi books, although I still like the genre. So you can see I'm not a Die Hard sci-fi comedy fan. This book is extremely funny. Adults as well as children (teenagers really) will find the material and dialouge side splitting."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams prooves, Mathematically, that NOTHING exists. Any man that can accomplish this is a genius. I tested his math and it works out. Also the book provides many other interesting ideas to bounce around. NOT TO MENTION IT IS THE SECOND FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, SECOND ONLY TO MONTY PYTHON."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I, personally, am in a constant search for intriguing books, and the Hitchhikers guide series was truly one of the most enjoyable and addictive I have ever read. Douglas Adams does an encredible job of combining off-the-wall science-ficton with an amazing sense of humor. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with. The Hitchhiker's Guide series begins with an amazing twist. The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads. If you are looking for an amazing series that keeps you entranced, then this is without doubt the series for you. Once you start reading the first book, you've got to read them all!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but this was a recommendation of a friend (plus I saw the movie). What a fantastic book! It's cleverly written with hysterical commentary on human (and alien) life. Many sci-fi books are written with technical jargon, using words only the most geeky of geeks could understand. Instead, this is written with an everyday tone so even the common man can stowaway for the adventure."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, without a doubt, one of the funniest books I have ever read. Adams' science fiction-humor masterpiece is as imaginitive as it is hilarious. The story begins on the worst Thursday ever as Arthur Dent awakens to find a wrecking crew about to demolish his home in order to make way for a bypass. Arthur is approached by his longtime friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien field researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Ford tells Arthur that the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The two hitch a lift aboard a Vogon spacecraft, and there the fun begins. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of five hilarious novels (and one short story) in Douglas Adams highly acclaimed Hitchhiker's series, and it is also the best. I've enjoyed H2G2 in all of its forms so far (books, TV & radio versions, etc.), and I look forward to the Hitchhiker's Guide movie which opens in theaters April 29th. Read the book and laugh your butt off, then go and enjoy the movie!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a unique book all in itself. It is hard to compare it with any other book because there is nothing like it! It is the tale of Arthur Dent as he escapes Earth's destruction with his friend, Ford Prefect. This would not be possible if Ford himself had been born on Earth; he was from somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice. They manage to get on board one of the construction ships that is destroying Earth to make room for an intergalactic superhighway. From there, the adventure just gets more intersting in later books, traveling through time as well as space, from the dawn of man to the end of the universe in a five star resteraunt. Douglas Adams describes every little thing to great detail, making every little oddity worth reading. This first book of the series is in every way one of the best books I have ever read. It even brings about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything; 42. But what is the question? Read the book to find out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is Douglas Adams' best ever. Here is his true wit, his British humor, his, well, hoopiness! The book picks you up, drives you to the movies, and never lets you go! Ford is hilarious with his insane logic. Trillian is a wonderful as the only really sane one on board the Heart of Gold. Marvin is so pathetic that he makes you cry every time you read the book. And through it all, the hapless Arthur Dent just tries to understand what is happening. The plot involves the earth being blow up to make a hyperspace bypass, which everyone should have known about if they had checked the record hall in Alpha Centauri. The plans had been on display for fifty years. Can't complain about it now, can you? Anyway, throw in an ancient race of planet builders, some towels, a stolen space ship, and a restaurant at the end of the universe, and you get the first novel in one of the best sci-fi series ever. A must read for any science fiction fan or fans of British comedy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This little treasure is probably one of the most outrageous and ridiculously hilarious books ever written. With a flawless knack for humor, Douglas Adams brings to life his satire of our own universe, devilishly illustrating how much nonsense we're really surrounded by. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy takes us on a wild ride through the four corners of the final frontier, introducing us to dozens of one-of-a-kind personalities. Among them are Earth civilian Arthur Dent and galactic hitchhiker Ford Prefect, two of the most colorful characters one could ever hope to meet. You'll never forget the time you spend with these guys; it may even bring a tear to your eye to turn that very last page (thank GOD for sequels!). But the experience is worth it. Just be prepared to finish up with a lot of unanswered questions crowding your mind, and don't count on any guarantees that you'll be able to restrain yourself from reading the rest of the saga! Yes, although a very light read, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy boasts a kind of zany &quot;philosophy&quot; that'll keep you perplexed and intrigued and -- more than anything -- totally addicted. I'm telling you I can't wait to get started with the next one! If you think you're finally ready to learn the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, don't hesitate. $5.59 is a petty price to pay for such gleeful enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first pages of this book were pretty stupid, but Adams seems to have the same problem as I do--a little bit of trouble beginning stories. Once it's in full swing, you'll love it. This is one of the few books that I literally didn't want to put down until it was finished. I tore through it in two days--thank goodness for sequels. NOTE: If you aren't a fan of silly humor, you might not like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've read many books in my day, mostly for my own pleasure but never until now have I read a book that made me laugh out loud. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is a story about Arthur Dent, his friend Ford Prefect, and their adventures in outer space. Ford Prefect, an alien from the planet Betelgeuse V was on earth, in disguise to complete research. Ford is a reporter for the encyclopedia known as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This guide is a giant encyclopedia stored in a small computer that contains important information for intergalactic hitchhikers. When Ford discovers that the Earth will soon be destroyed, he alerts his friend Arthur Dent. Ford urges Arthur to leave Earth with him and they soon hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship. But as Arthur soon finds out, Vogon's aren't friendly beings, and the captain of the ship wasn't to happy they came aboard. The Vogons tortured the two with horrible poetry and then dumped them into space. Now according to the Hitchhiker's Guide, a person can hold his breath in space for 30 seconds before he dies. 29 seconds later Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent were recued from space. They now found themselves on a ship called the Heart of Gold with the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his friend Trillian. Douglas Adams is a comedic genius and does a wonderful job of satirizing the human race. Humans are considered to be primitive, the third smartest species on Earth, and Earth is considered &quot;mostly harmless\\". Unlike many books I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy kept me interested and wanting to read more. I definitely recommend this book and I will most likely begin reading the other books in this series. If you enjoy science fiction books and have a good sense of humor, you would definitely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of those rare books that actually made me laugh aloud. If you want to have fun reading a book, this is the book to get."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is brilliant! This book is pure escapism in the most positive sense. Read it even though a movie is already out. Much of the witty writing did not carry over into the film. I cannot recommend the books that followed the series though (namely \\"Life, the Universe and Everything, \\"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\"). It fell short of being as captivating and intelligent as this one. Watch out for the Vogons!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and since it is the first of a quartet, I'm planning to read ALL of the next books!Basically it's the end of the planet Earth, or should I say what we thought was a planet.Because of a stranded alien who just so happens to work for \\"The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", one man named Arthur Dent survives the Earth's annihilation.The improbability of this is massive, but through this book it seems that improbability is on their side.Then alien and human find that they have been transported to a runaway ship where they meet the president of the galaxy, the improbability of which is so high that if it was not for the most advanced spaceship in history, they'd be dead!This is a hilarious book of aliens, the galaxy, and the inferiority of humans. I was hooked from the start and LOVED it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Over the Memorial Day weekend, I had the good fortune to be invited to Maine to see the fabulous tree house that is the subject of The Treehouse Chronicles. I decided this would be a good chance to listen to a recording of an old favorite that I've never heard in audio form before. Browsing through the library, it was an easy decision to pick this new recording of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Within minutes, I could tell that I'd made a winning choice as I listened to Stephen Fry brilliantly share his voice to add texture to this intriguing story. Between the accents and the humorous references to irony, I was enthralled. I found myself wishing that the recording was a longer one.When you read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it can come across a little simplistically in places. Those spots work much smoother in this audio version.In fact, if you haven't read the book, I recommend that you listen to this recording instead. I think you'll enjoy and appreciate the book more in its more dramatic version here.If you don't know the story, Arthur Dent finds himself awakening with a hangover determined to save his home. Only problem is, while the demolition crew looms, he's also about to lose his other home, the Earth. Aided by his alien friend, Ford Prefect, Arthur is soon off hitchhiking his way through the galaxy in a most improbable set of circumstances that will amuse and delight you. You'll meet Zaphod Beeblebrox, one of the most memorable aliens in anyone's fiction. Along the way, you'll learn more speculation about wearing digital watches and finding lost ballpoint pens than you ever expected to know.Bravo, Stephen Fry and Douglas Adams!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"By Joe AntonucciDouglas Adams called the book that I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy. This book was about a guy named Arthur and his friend Ford. Arthur was a normal guy, with a normal job, and a normal life. He lived in London in a pretty small house. One of his bosses was trying to bulldoze his house but Arthur staked out in front of his house, to save his home. When Arthur was just sitting there, Ford came up and said that they really needed to talk. Ford made him come to their local pub. When they arrived to the pub, Ford told Arthur that the end of the world was coming. At first Arthur did not believe him, but then he knew that Ford was serious. He got all the stuff that Ford made him bring. Then a giant space ship came and told every one what was happing. People were in chaos and then a beam came. Just before the bean hit, Ford grabbed Arthur and they teleported to a different space ship, that was close to earth. Earth was destroyed. What happened to Ford and Arthur on board this new ship? Will Arthur ever see his family and friends again? Is Ford really an alien? These are some questions that you could only get the answers by reading the book.I really liked this book. I thought this book was very exiting and very funny. I thought it was exiting because with all the conflicts, like almost getting hit by nuclear missiles, keeps you on your toes. I also thought this book was hilarious because Arthur and Ford always had really funny and random conversations. I was able to feel like I was in the book, because the author, Douglas Adams, always showed the characters emotions very easily. He also described the settings very vividly. I thought there really wasn't a main conflict, but there were lots of mini conflicts. I liked the book better with lots of conflicts then just having one main one. It made the book not at all boring. I could never put the book down, because it was so interesting! I thought that Arthur was a very realistic character because he was just a normal guy from London, who just happened to be the only survivor of the destruction of the planet Earth. I thought the books' ending was really good. It left of at a strange place, but Douglas Adams did a really good job of wanting you to read his next book.Douglas Adams hade a happier, more energetic voice through out the book. He always had funny stuff to say, witch made the book really interesting. I thought the author used a pretty large verity of vocabulary. He did not use a lot of super hard words, but he used some words that I have never heard before. I thought he used the right amount of vocabulary words in his writing. I thought the author had a very unique style of writing. His style was a lot more comic and had a lot more humor in his writing. I thought this made the book more interesting and not at all boring. I thought the author used a great amount of dialogue and the perfect amount of description. I liked it how there were more conversations in it, and how the book just doesn't describe the setting for hours and hours on end. I also thought he had the perfect tone through out the book. The author always had a positive attitude about stuff and he never made it ever seem droll and boring. I cannot think of anything this author needs to add to his book, I like it so much that I could not find anything wrong with it! I think this is probably the best book I have ever read!I believe that this was one of my best books, or even the best book I have ever read. It was filled with excitement and it had a lot of funny stuff in it. I believe this book deserves a 10 out of 10 because of how awesome it was. I think that his other books will be just as good, or maybe even better! I think this book is good for both boys and girls, but I think only people who are older then 11 or 12 should read this book, because it could be hard to understand for little kids. I think this is a great book and that every one should read it. If you like funny books and excitement, then this is a good book for you to read!I believe that The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy was a great book. I truly believe that Douglas Adams did a phenomenal job on this book. I think this book deserves 10 out of 10 stars. There was never a dull moment in the book. It all ways kept you on ur toes at some parts, and at other parts it made you want to laugh out loud! I absolutely, truly believe that this was one of the greatest books I have ever read in my entire life!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When books are made into movies that means, the book is first-rate. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is no exception. The Hitchhikers Guide starts as Arthur Dent is saved from the destruction of earth by his alien friend posing as an out of work actor. The book really takes off when they are picked up by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The main idea of the story is to find the ultimate answer to the ultimate question. The book does not really have a solid theme that can be identified, it is mostly random facts from the guide that ties into the story, and sometimes not at all. For science fiction fans/Monty Python fans this book is a must read, it is witty and interesting. The only downside of the book is that it is too short but luckily Douglas Adams wrote a series of Hitchhiker books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. One it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it has the words'Don't Panic' written in bold letters on the cover. The story of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of Betelgeuse. They are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the Heart of Gold using the Infinate Improbability Drive. Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.I loved this book for many reasons. One reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor. Another is that it gives a good spin on life. I could always count on this book to cheer me up. Don't just stop with this book there are many others in this series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"From the first page to the last this books sucks you into its strange locales and story. Each character is charming and funny in there own way. Such as Marvin the severly depressed android who is constanly complaining and yet is one of the most memorable charecters in recent memory. This book cannot be described in a review. Buy it, Read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In this introduction to Douglas Adam's unique wit and satire, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, sets off on a rampaging Alice in Wonderland like journey through outer space. Through it all he encounters very strange and farcical creatures and events that reveal the jukebox of the universe, the ebb and flow satire that is life in all its monumental and diminutive creations. A great adventure to the nether regions of outer space."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the first I read that had the edgy, random quality which has become more prevalent in contemporary fiction. Space ships, galaxies, worlds constructed by large companies, petty government officials, petty ALIEN government officials all play their role.As a writer, and an older one at that, I am accustomed to books with a beginning, middle and end. I like to look at character development, story arc, and so on. This book has not so much a story arc as a story serpentine.I thought I might try out this random style of writing and found it is very difficult to achieve. People of my generation seem to want to make order out of chaos. However, chaos is what we have. And, one should at least consider writing about the world one has than about the world one would like.Adams is, I think, a pioneer of this random style.The book is very difficult to put down, once you start reading. It is entirely unpredictable. Yet the writing is polished, the text is well-proofed, and it is all perfectly clear.Now, what are the chances of it becoming the best-seller it became? Slim to none. I'd like to know how that was done."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a book you should read unless you need a well defined plot and no laughs. The plot is well hidden by the randomness, a description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, an alcoholic drink that it seems the author had the first of on Earth before writing it, the introduction of the Hitchhiker's Guide that begins &quot;Space is big. Very big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind boggling big it is.&quot;, and the theory of where all the ball point pens go. There is also a part where a character turns into a penguin. There is some plot but more randomness. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor. If you are someone who is ready for a laugh grab a towel and get ready for a story that is out of this world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The random details that are found on every page of this book are really what make it THE BEST BOOK EVER!There is a story behind every little detail- and always a funny one. At first, with all of the jumping from galaxy to galaxy, it is hard to follow, but after a while you learn which details you should remember and which are just funny little things you can laugh at and then forget. This is definately the best sci fi book I have ever read! I found it interesting that some of the events made me kind of protective toward the earth, like how you feel patriotic on July 4, but this was pride for the whole planet. Almost every book anyone has ever reccomended to me I've thought was boring, slow, etc... but this one hit the jackpot. I wish somebody had told me about it sooner!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that I believe the reader will enjoy thoroughly. Douglas Adams wrote this book and it contains a sense humor that only Douglas Adams could bring. The humor in this book is somewhat random, yet is highly entertaining. The book has a somewhat hidden plot, but I believe that the theme is: \\"What if it were like this?\\" But even though an ironic book it is, it still keeps the reader turning the pages until it's finished. If you like this book, then read all of the books in the series, except the third one. I did not enjoy the third one as many people have, but found its humor old and boring. But I can tell you now The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I was informed that it was a laugh-out-loud funny book, which would be impossible to put down. Some of those who recommended it to me said this book was the funniest piece of literature that they ever read. With a report such as this, how could I resist reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when opportunity stuck. And I was disappointed after opening the first page. The book just was not as incredibly funny as I had heard, and could not draw a chuckle. Now, I am not saying that it was not a good book, the satirical elements, while once again, not laugh out loud funny, did portray the ups and downs of human life with impeccable accuracy.The satirical portion of this book made me enjoy it as a discussion of the human condition. In the beginning of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the earth is destroyed to make room for a galactic highway, just as our the protagonist's house on earth is destroyed to make room for a terrestrial highway. After the protagonist leaves earth with a n extra-terrestrial friend, the reader discovers that the universe is a micro, well, macro-chasm for their planet. and thus the satire takes off. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy serves to ridicule everything from the political system on the earth, to natural history, monetary exchange, and the intellectual supremacy of humans in its short two-hundred sixteen pages, while the main characters zip around the galaxy in a starship powered by an \\"infinite probabilities drive.\\" And the action really takes off when our heroes land on the richest planet in the universe, a planet so rich that it would make planets out of pure gold and silver for clients who were wealthy enough. But don't expect me to tell you what happens therecyou'll have to read this book yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the absolute funniest book that has ever been written. From start to finish, it keeps you laughing. Douglas Adams is an absolute genius for all the hilarious and creative plot lines and scenes that he has written in this satirical novel. Being a high school student, reading is not usually the thing that gets me excited or keeps me entranced, but the sense of humor in this book kept me glued to every word. The fact that the one piece of suspense left in the entire book was whose shoulder was hurt when a missile crashed with a space ship, but all the other events of the book are revealed, is miraculous. Why would anyone ever want to write about what a flower pot was thinking when it was falling from a space ship to the ground? And also why would anyone want to read about it? But the fact that Adams could think of and write about such a random thing is amazing and, oddly enough, hysterical. It's so refreshing to read a book that goes into space and could potentially be complete sci-fi, but is actually pages filled with jokes. It takes your mind off the real world and brings you into the unknown; where Adams completely writes like an insane man, but comes off as a genius. There's no need to look deeper into the satirical writing. You can just take the jokes as they come and literally laugh out loud after every page. The only problem with this book is that it ends. After 200 pages of laughing out loud, the book abruptly ends, but the good news is that it's part of a trilogy and you can continue with the next book, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Adams keeps you wanting more by ending the book so suddenly. But don't let that stop you. If you haven't had a chance to read this book yet, run to the nearest book store and buy it. Actually, buy all three books in the trilogy! Because you definitely won't want to stop after the first."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I absolutely loved this book from the moment I read the first page. Perfect for rainy days or when you are just feeling down. Definately a must read! Probably what I liked the most about it was that it was fun and enjoyable to read, and was not at all a heavy or hard book to read, unlike some other sci-fi books I have read. The characters and the plots are also very funny, and my personal favourite character is definately Ford Prefect. All of the characters are loveable in their own sense. You do not really dislike any of the characters that much, which is, in its own sense, pretty refreshing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something humourous, refreshing, and fun. Though if you are looking for a serious, hard core, sci-fi book this is not for you. Recommended for Monty Python fans (as I am one)! Terry Jones from Monty Python actually wrote a book based on this, called: &quot;Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic&quot; which is another good read as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If, like Douglas Adams, you happen to adamantly disbelieve in God, and if you spend your days and nights brooding on the absurdity of the universe, I suggest that you run immediately to the nearest bookstore and grab a copy of the The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy!! This book is a rarity because it talks about the nature of existence without ever being a slow or depressing read. The very opposite in fact...the Hitchhiker's Guide is a BIG FAT FARCE, a satirical and completely twisted comedy about \\"life, the universe and everything.\\" I am amazed at the extent of Adam's talent...he has a flair for the insane and his entire book is a series of ridiculously whacko adventures in space...a totally nutty must-read!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is definatly one of the best ever written. But the thing about it is, you have to be a certain type of reader to get this book. You have to be the type that accepts things without understanding them, and just go with the flow. A lot of people gave this book a bad review, and I am warning you now: this book makes NO sense, so if you're the type of person that needs EVERYTHING spelled out for them and EVERYTHING written in black and white, do us all a favor and forget about it! But I loved it! Where do ballpoint pens go when we lose them? Are we truly the most intelligent species on Earth? What would a bowl of petunias think if it was falling out of the sky and about to go splat? These questions and more are answered in The Hitchiker's Guide to the Universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the first book in the inaccurately named hitchhiker trilogy, is a humorous story about the worst Thursday in the history of the world and the repercussions of that horrible day. But more than that, it is a story about a human being, stranded in the middle of the galaxy, on the most technologically advanced alien starship of the time, The Heart of Gold.Arthur Dent is that human of the Heart of Gold, along with Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the ex-president of the galaxy, and the only other survivor of earth, Tricia McMillian. Nobody on the ship knows where they are headed, except for the most incompetent of them all, Zaphod. Even then, he still has no idea why he is heading there, until he subjects himself to a self administered brain scan, which reveals that there are two initials burned in to his brain, but whose are they? Meanwhile, Arthur Dent is trying to cope with the fact that his planet was blown up by a group of blood thirsty aliens to make way for a hyperspace bypass. But the biggest shocks of them all to Arthur, comes when Ford Prefect reveals that he is not from a city on the outskirts of London, as he once said, but is a field researcher for \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" and is the cousin of Zaphod Beeblebrox, and that Zaphod was the person who flew off with Tricia McMillian at a party in London. Apparently it is a small UNIVERSE after all. But when The Heart of Gold reaches its destination, nobody seems to believe him that it is the legendary planet of Margarathea in which half of the wealth of the universe is supposed to be buried in the underground tunnels of the legendary planed surrounded in myth. But will an ancient defense system keep them from reaching their goal?Everybody on the ship is there for some reason or another. For Arthur, it is the fact that him and Ford hitchhiked onto the alien ship that blew up Earth. For Ford, it is the same reason, but he is enjoying the thrill of being \\"on the road again\\" as he said it. In the case of Trillian (Tricia McMillian), it is the fact that she left the planet a few months earlier with Zaphod at the fancy dress party in London that he crashed. And finally for Zaphod, it was the mysterious orders that were what was burned in his brain to allow him to become president of the galaxy, and steal The Heart of Gold so that Zaphod can fulfill the requirements of the directions that continually pester him.The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, has a very complex plot, in which every lady, gentlemen, and its, make a difference in this story. It provides a good base for the next four books, and is a very entertaining first book in a series. The series has many unique characters that may go away for a while, but always come back in a later book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a book you should read unless you need a well defined plot and no laughs. The plot is well hidden by the randomness, a description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, an alcoholic drink that it seems the author had the first of on Earth before writing it, the introduction of the Hitchhiker's Guide that begins \\"Space is big. Very big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind boggling big it is.\\", and the theory of where all the ball point pens go. There is also a part where a character turns into a penguin. There is some plot but more randomness. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor. If you are someone who is ready for a laugh grab a towel and get ready for a story that is out of this world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all time favorites books. I was lucky enough to see Douglas Adams speak right before he died. Some SF authors are great speakers, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke come to mind. Barry Maher, the guy who wrote Legend, is an outstanding speaker. Writers like these can really wow an audience in person. Douglas Adams certainly couldn't. He was clearly uncomfortable on stage. For the first 15 minutes, he was one of the worst speakers I've seen. Then he relaxed and inspite of being uncomfortable, his humanity, his weird perspective and his humor took over. It became a wonderful session. Almost as wonderful as the Hitchhiker books. Don't see the movie until you're read the books, all the books. You don't even have to see the movie then."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is brilliant. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy \\"trilogy\\" is Adams' gift to sci-fi fans of all ages and backgrounds. Though not necessarily a direct spoof of any particular sci-fi book or film, this books pokes fun at the many hackneyed cliches of the genre, yet somehow creates something altogehter original AND funny. The brilliance comes from the fact that you do not need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy the story and comedy. This is one of the few books that deserves to be read multiple times--and no matter how many times you read it, you will find yourself laughing out loud. If you enjoyed this book, you must read the rest of the \\"trilogy.\\" My personal favorite is So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, though hard-core Guide fans may tell you it is the weakest of the five book. Though not as funny as the others, it has the best story and character development. So, if you happen to find yourself actually caring about Arthur Dent by the end of this book, you must read So Long... If you like Adams, I also recommend The Great American Novel; Or Random Start, by Eliot Stafford--it's not sci-fi, but displays a similar sense of humor and will keep you laughing for days."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was walking down the hall, being perfectly innocent, when a friend of mine shoved a book in my hands with an exclamation of, \\"You have got to read this!\\" It was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I was skeptical at first, because I had never been much of a science fiction fan, but by the time I had finished the first chapter, it had become my favorite book of all time. The rest of my week was spent following Ford Prefect, a field researcher from Betelgeuse Five, who accidentally got stuck on Earth for fifteen years, and his friend Arthur Dent, an advertising executive from Islington, as they escape the end of the world by jumping aboard the most highly sophisticated spacecraft ever made, which just so happens to have been stolen by Ford's step-cousin, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his girlfriend Trillian, who Arthur once met at a party.During their travels, these humorous characters must battle evil aliens, interstellar police, and white mice to find out the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. This truly insane tale could only have been thought up by the truly insane Douglas Adams, who came up with the idea while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Spain. Through his eyes, readers are able to laugh at all the things they know are wrong with the world, rather than feel depressed about not being able to fix them. This really is a wonderfully enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to all who enjoy quality entertainment and a touch of wackiness."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A while back I decided I didn't like parody. This was after being disappointed by \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I choose, in fact, not to review that book because I felt that I was simply missing the whole point, and wasn't qualified to have an opinion.However, when I found out Douglas Adam's work was being made into a movie, I decided to try it. I was quickly enthralled. It works in many ways \\"The Color of Magic\\" didn't. For one thing it's one story, not a group of related short-stories about the same characters. For another reason, things are there for a reason. It's true the characters are silly, and unrealistic, but they're humorous characters, not humorous plot devices. All the jokes actally factor in to what's going on, rather than just being there to be funny. When the missiles were being fired at the Heart of Gold it actually managed to produce both humor, and drama, and the thoughts of the whale and bowl of petunias, since they were a way to resolve the problem, were certainly acceptable.Overall, I guess it's just that the jokes worked for me, more than \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I found this book very funny, and am looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just needed to leave a review, despite the fact that there are, what, 400 others? I haven't read any of them, but I just need to share my input on the book or I'll explode.This is definately a class in the Science-Fiction genre. There's sarcasm, humor, wit, and everything in life I love and cherish--well, pretty much. I thought it was hilarious."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With Douglas Adams it really doesn't matter if your a miserable old bat who hates fiction or a fun loving freak who loves it; his books can appeal to all. They have a bit of everything in them, a bit of sci-fi, a bit of nature conservation, a little bit of adventure and LOTS of humor. They even have the nice little moral at the end to boost up your spirits when you finish the book.I first found this book years ago and I'm still unable to figure out how i lived without it. the seqeuls and other books that come next in the series are just as fun and Adams has managed to spread his wit evenly out throughout the whole series. any other author would've given up and returned, mentally exhausted, to dry writing after the first page.The characters are original and fun, the scenery and setting ever-changing, the plot dances around and the dialogue will leave you in tears. Marvin the Paranoid Android ended up being one of my favoirte characters, as did the Vogons and psycologists, and their unique outlooks on life and 42 are new.There are only a few things readers attempting to read this book must have:-a sense, however lame it might be, of humor-a large mug of really hot tea-a few packets of peanuts-and, finally, a really comfortable sofa"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitch Hikers Guide is an amazing book; it ensnares the mind and doesn't let go. The book takes you all the way from the last seconds of earth to the end of the universe, and all in a strange and humors way. The book uses backwards logic and at some points makes so little sense that it makes perfect sense. I loved the variety of characters, the detail, and the abstract thoughts. The book takes and explains the secrets of the universe and even better how to travel it. In this book you will find the answer to the meaning of life, how to get a lift from a space ship, and why no hitchhiker should ever be without a towel.I recommend this book to anyone who thinks of the abstract or abnormal, or for that matter anyone who has an inkling of creativity in their minds. Recommended to ages 15 and up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The planet Earth is destroyed by an evil alien race called the Vogons in order to make way for a hyperspacial bypass. Fortunately, one bewildered Earthman named Arthur Dent is rescued from the Earth's destruction at the last possible moment by his friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien from the planet Betelgeuse. They stow away on a Vogon freighter, and are eventually rescued by the whacked-out Zaphod Beeblebrox &amp; his Earthwoman companion, Trillian, in their absolutely fantastic ship, the Heart Of Gold. From here on out, it's outrageous shenanigans in space, as Arthur and friends discover what the true purpose of the planet Earth was for, that it's always important to know where your towel is, and that the answer to Life, The Universe &amp; Everything is &quot;forty-two&quot;.... It began life as a BBC radio play, and then it spun off into something much bigger, including comedy albums, a TV miniseries, and, of course, the books. &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,&quot; by the late, absolutely great Douglas Adams, is a true comedy classic of the literary world, and is a must-read for all fans of not only science fiction, but off-the-wall British comedy, which Adams gleefully, and cleverly, blends into one. I first read the books as a young teenager some twenty odd years ago, and, re-reading them now, they still make me laugh just as uproariously as they did back then. This book, Part One in the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; saga (five books in all), gets things off to a flying start, with many great, hilarious chapters &amp; characters, not only Arthur, Ford, Zaphod &amp; Trillian but also Marvin the paranoid android, and the old wise man, Slartibartfast. Douglas Adams was a comic genius, gifted with a tremendously clever wit &amp; sharp writing style, which he worked to maximum effect with the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; books. His wonderful observations &amp; short stories sprinkled throughout about Life in the Universe are also a great treat to read. There's more intergalactic misadventures for Arthur &amp; the gang in Book Two, &quot;The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe,&quot; but &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; is a marvelous opening book to this legendary sci-fi comedy saga. It is extremely funny, extremely clever, and extremely classic. God bless you, Douglas Adams, wherever you are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the greatest books to me. It starts serious, you can just imagine someone reading aloud, then you get to this sudden, simple line, and you are rolling on the ground. One of the things that really got to me was that I thought of someone reading very well, completely serious, and all the jokes and simple one liners seem like they are completely normal in their world (universe), but they really stick out. It is brilliantly written, and though when you get into the series it is a bit hard to follow, it's worth reading multiple times. It kinda makes you realize that our simple lives could easily get so complicated, or just stop, and you think &quot;God am I glad I'm not him, but that would be so fun&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There's not a lot you can't say about the series of science-fiction/comedy books [and the miniseries] left by the late, great Douglas N. Adams. I think it's this book that really makes me laugh still, the most. The others in the series are fantastic in their own rights, but this book is the one I can go back to, any time, and still laugh at. It's just so absurd that you never get used to it the way you can with some other books in the genre.For example in the Red Dwarf books, you begin to accept the quirks of Lister and Rimmer and the crew, but you really start to laugh at them because it's just SO Rimmer to do whatever or say whatever. It begins to get, in all fairness, a little less funny, and a little old. But DNA's silliness never seems to lose its sharp cutting edge. The characters, too, always feel new, though eventually you start to see all of them, even Vogons, as friends in a way, like you know them a lot, and you like them.This is a book that changed my life, in a number of ways, and has kept me laughing for many years."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say? Just read the book.This book is mandatory re-reading every few years (at least). I have no idea how many times I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I can tell you, however, that each and every time it is as funny, witty and cathartic as the first time. I constantly discover new things about it as I age, and I never lose interest.Since its initial launch as a radio show on the BBC in 1978, this creation by Douglas Adams has been an instant classic. In the course of its evolution, HGTTG has been a television show, a series of books, a film and a stage play. I like the book the best (with the original radio show a close second) and would recommend it to nearly everybody.This book is a must-read for virtually everyone. Don't forget your towel, and don't forget to read it either."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not often that a book begins with the destruction of this planet we call home, but in this case it's the perfect introduction. It serves to illustrate that we Earthlings have been looking at the universe much too narrowly, and that its quite apparent that we are not the only living beings in the universe, or even the most intelligent.The story begins with the tale of Arthur Dent, a Briton and the only surviving remnant of human life on Earth. He was saved from termination by his old friend Ford Prefect, actually an undercover alien reporter so to speak, who he had always found to be a bit odd. The two find themselves in the bowels of a giant Vogon destroyer once they depart from Earth. As it turns out the Vogons we merely destroying Earth to accommodate the new intergalactic highway they were building. The papers were even filed at town halls if anyone cared to read them. From here it is one harrowing experience to the next with only one most important book as their guide, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.I really enjoyed this novel for its creativity and outlandishness. Some of the ideas are extremely surreal, and it keeps itself from becoming a cheap sci-fi story by incorporating scientific fact and semi-plausible physics."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I bought it as a gift and my 17 year old son loved it and wanted to give it to his friends."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is humorous and a bit advanturous. I can't say anything in comparison to the movie as I never saw it, but the book is nice. If you look you'll see that this author wrote other books, this one is just the first one of many."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Famous fiction books have traditionally contained certain elements; such as underlying meanings, morals, heroes and villians, allusions to previous works, parallels to situations in the world at large, etc, etc... This is even true for many of the early famous science fiction works such as those by Jules Verne, Isaac Isamov, and H. G. Wells. And then we have this book by Douglas Adams. Probably the most famous science fiction book in recent memory, it contains none of these elements. There are main characters, but one really can not categorize them as heroes and villains. There are conflicts, but not like those we think of that deal with the themes of greed, honesty, honor, loyalty, etc... And there are parallels to events that really occur, but they tend to be too obvious for anyone to miss. It is one of these parallels that begin the book; Arthur wakes up to find that his house has been scheduled to be demolished to make room for a new freeway. Before noon, he and the world discover that Earth is about to be demolished to make room for an interstellar highway. From there the story only gets more interesting and nonsensical. The \\"bad guys\\" are more laughable than scary, such as the poetry-reading Vorgons. The \\"heroes\\" Arthur and his Prefect friend are more \\"going along for the ride\\" than really fighting against or for something. And no-one really gets hurt in the story. The overall theme of the book is anyone's guess, though my guess is that there is no theme, much like life in the modern, industrialized world. The book itself is quite funny to read; any tears shed by the reader are those due to laughter. The best way to describe it is a marriage of dry English humor with science fiction and travel writing. Overall, I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book \\"The Hithhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", by the imaginative Douglas Adams, is one of the most famous science-fiction pieces of modern literature. It tells the hilarious and ironic story of the destruction of the Earth, and the cosmic adventure of its only survivor, a regular British man named Arthur Dent, to the dead planet of Magrathea.Arthur escapes the total destruction of his planet, by a fleet of alien spaceships who intended to build a hiper road, thanks to his friend, Ford Prefect, a friendly alien disguised as an unemployed actor on Earth who's acutally a writer for the new edition of the \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". After that, they go through the most improbable things that could ever happen in the whole galaxy, and, most improbably, get out of them alive.That's the strongest aspect of the book: the improbability. Douglas Adams catches the reader through the most absurd scenes, and makes the passage between those scenes very quickly, what makes the plot sound even more absurd. But that's not a bad thing, it makes the reader unable to stop reading the book, always anxious to know what could happen next, and it also adds a lot of humor, which is also very strong (and effective) in the book.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thrillig , exciting and hilarious book, but it is also full os reflections about the meaning of existence, and can really make the reader think. A must have to all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' first masterpiece, first conceived while he was drunk, forgotten for six years, and then remembered again, broadcast as a radio show, and finally published.Online satire MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing has quite a few references to this hilarious book, such as the \\"awful poetry journal,\\" and using it will cause a reference to the terrible poetry of the Vogons. It goes something like this: \\"You read the awful poetry journal. In a desperate attempt to save humanity, your large intestine attempts to strangle you from inside. You lose 20-24 hit points.\\" It was a funny reference to an already funny Hitchhiker's Guide tidbit. And inside a probably random room of improbability, you just might see a whale and a bowl of petunias. Although having no reference to the number 42 that I have noticed, still it has many more satirical references to satire itself.Arthur Dent is the main character in this story, and his friend Ford Prefect (a humorous reference to a Ford car that many thought was a misspelling of Perfect) warns him of *gasp* impending doom. The Earth is about to be destroyed, so they hitch a ride on a Vogon spacecraft, (thanks to the Dentrassi cooks, the Vogons don't allow any hitchhikers on) but are immediately chucked off by the Vogons after going through hyperspace and listening to \\"An Ode to a Turgid Bee.\\" At least I think that's what it was.Floating in space for 29 seconds, they are \\"improbably\\" rescued by The Heart of Gold, a spaceship recently stolen by Ford Prefect's two-headed friend, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Having many mini-escapades, such as discovering the \\"meaning of live, the universe, and everything,\\" or just trying to find a place to eat, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great, indispensable book that people from age 10 to 100 will like to read.

The only problem I had was that at the beginning of the book I kept trying to follow and understand every little detail...which is difficult (if not impossible!). I read the first few pages over and over again trying to figure out what the heck was going on; it was very confusing. For people who are very detail-oriented and get frustrated easily, this is not the book for you. But, if you allow yourself to get lost in Adam's world you will throughly enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's president on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice, and fly at the very dangerous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young reader, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. I know that when I read this book, I didn't even realize some advanced jokes, but sometimes I had to think about some of the wording and was forced to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themsleves on The Heart of Gold when the ship's improbability drive is on. Everything is random as I found out when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This saying was troubling me until I found that it came from a saying stating that if 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet. This story may be hilarious, but sometimes Douglas Adams terminology goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at level too high for most Junior High/ High School Students, but for me, the laughs in this book far out weighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less- savvy reader like myself. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece.I reccomend this book to less-skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seearching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they're young, but it'll take an older advanced reader to fully taken in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With characters like the liberal cops, the sperm whale, deep thought, the Vogons, the improbability drive and especially Marvin, how can a book go wrong? I have nothing negative to say about this book- it was pure, knee-slapping, laugh-like-a-toddler-being-tickled entertainment. I am not well read by any means, but Douglas Adam's books have made me laugh more than any other book (Joseph Heller's Catch 22 is the only thing I've read that comes close). The comedy genre is a difficult one to be successful in, but this author is clearly talented at using the pen to make people laugh. This book is the first in a series of five, and by far this book is the better of the bunch.I include my review of movie free of charge. It was horrible. Not only did it deviate far from the book (which isn't necessarily bad). But the plot, character development, attempt at humor and acting were terrible.

This satirical and humorous book is perfect for light-hearted entertainment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is great, and it was in wonderful shape. There were no real scrapes or dings on the cover, and no torn pages. It's an older copy, but that's fine-it still reads just like a newer one would. As for the story, well, it's FANTASTIC! Any sci-fi reader should definitely invest in this product."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love the Hitchhicker's guide to the Galxey - the peniultimate classic of science fiction, the humourous stuff at least - and have read and reread it many a time. However, unable to fall asleep one day, I put this in and listened to it on my sleepless nights. In no way did it help me to fall alseep, but I loved the story, loved the reader's wonderful voices, and didn't worry about anything in my quest to sleep.The story is this, for those unfamiliar: Arthur Dent is an ape-decended mammal from the planet earth who's house is about to get demolished for a bypass to, well, pass through. Shortly after this but before the earth itself is demolished for an intersteller bypass, he unwittingly is hitch-hiked off the planet by one of his friends, who happens to be a roving research for the wholy remarkable book, The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galexy, from the vacinity of Betelguse.Thus begins Arthur's journey across time and space, with the aide of a wholey remarkable guide. Buy the book, buy the audio book, buy it in some form (other than the movie) but its well worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Dig that Ford Prefect. He's one froopy drood who knows where his towel is at.This audiobook arrived new in the box, and is great!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the funniest series ever written that also happens to be a work of genius. The way the story winds back on itself leaves one giggling to one's self.A great read, time after time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love the way that Adams plays with language. Often time I find myself re-reading a passage just to play the words over again in my head. And just as interesting are the IDEAS in this series: planets where mattresses grow, cows that are raised to want to be eaten, poetry so horrible is can kill you, entire alien invasion forces eaten by small dogs, etc. I always read the entire series at once and I do so at least once a year!If you've never read this book do so NOW. In fact, read the entire series. Everyone should as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Really enjoyed the book. Got this one for a birthday gift and the young person was elated!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Being a reader who\`s read a lot of thrillers lately, I have spent some time looking for something different. I have found that in this book. This masterpiece of a book has Good descriptions, funny jokes, tension, interesting characters, memorable places, and the most thought-provoking story of all time. And what more could you possibly want from a book?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided to go back an read this series of books now that I am a little older and wiser (maybe); and I can not remember anything about them as it has been 20+ years since I last read them. It definitely consists of that type of weird British humor (e.g. Monty Python, etc.) that I have always been attracted to. It's a great combination of science fiction and dry humor that makes for a very entertaining read. It's also nice to know that the answer to the universal question of Life, The Universe and Everything is...42. Unfortunately, nobody remembers what the question is. This book is a fast and often hilarious trip across the galaxy. So grab your towel and remember...Dont Panic!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The best piece of pop culture of our century. A mix of sci-fi, Monty Python, irony and non-sense. Douglas Adams mixes everything in a way that the result is nothing but a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is one of the funniest, most joyously quirky, quotable novels I've ever read. This dizzying satire takes place just after some outer space bureaucrats seize the Earth through eminent domain and blow it up to make room for an interstellar highway. Two humans survive the wreckage and travel through a Wonderland-like vision of the universe.The characters, situations, dialog and bizarre turns of phrase are all brilliant. I've read it a half-dozen times over the last 30 years and it cracks me up every time.The first two books of the series (\\"Hitchhiker's Guide...\\" and \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\") are by far the strongest. I also highly recommend the original BBC radio series from the 1970s that started it all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece of science fiction, fantasy, humor, and just plain brilliance? Not much but I can say that this book will never grow old for me. I've read it countless times, listen to the audio book read by Stephen Fry over and over, and laugh every time at the appropriate parts, and at some of the inappropriate ones. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book that fans of fiction in general should at least try. I'm sure it's not for everyone though. There are several sections of the book that are confusing to say the least but I love that about this book and the entire series. It is one of my top ten favorite books and I am sure it will always remain there. If you read this and don't like it, at least you can go away with a few interesting facts such as how useful a towel is, how to hitchhike the galaxy for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day, who the smartest beings on Earth actually are, the purpose of Earth, and the answer to life, the universe, and everything. And let's not forget Vogon poetry, the Infinite Improbability Drive, Marvin, Arthur, Ford Prefect, and Thursdays. Just read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I usually don't fall in love with a book so quickly, but this one stole my heart and captured my attention right from the off. Its zany humour and imaginative characters really won me over, so much so that I intend to buy the entire series as soon as I possibly can. I borrowed this one from the library.)Arthur Dent is just your average man living on Earth whose house is about to be demolished. Naturally, he's very upset about this, so his friend Ford Prefect takes him down to the pub to converse and try to cheer him up. Oh, and also to tell him the entire Earth is about to be demolished, so his house is really nothing to worry about.The story then quickly moves into the far reaches of space with Arthur and Ford meeting many delightfully quirky characters when travelling throughout the universe. To name a few, there's Zaphod Beeblebrox, an ex-galactic president with two heads and three arms; Trillian Astra, a human who is well-versed in mathematics and astrophysics; Marvin, a manic-depressive robot; and Slartibartfast, an elderly alien from the planet Magrathea.Interspersed within the chapters are excerpts from the actual 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', which aims to help wandering intergalactic hitchhiker's with certain rules and tips. These are just as wonderful and hilarious to read as the main story and it never feels as though the focus is being torn away.The pacing of this story is wonderful; it's always exciting and never boring, and if you're anything like me, you'll become so heavily involved in it that you'll find it hard to ever put it down.The only downside is that at just 220 pages, it's rather short, and the story does end rather suddenly -- which is why I'm anxious to get my hands on the next books to finish off the tale.In the end, if those are the only two negative things I can think of, 'Hitchhiker' is easily one of the best novels I've read.*****/*****"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It was one of the most brilliant books I've read, but I wish one more person could give it 1 star! Then guess how mny one star ratings it would achive...

It would affect how I looked at writing for the next 22 years and will probably continue to do so for the rest of my life. The book was incredibly funny, the dialogue was great and it was all absolutely ridiculous. However, it was never a parody of itself and Adams made sure you cared about what happened to the characters and the story.Great book. A must-read for any sci-fi fan.Oh, and the rest of the books are pretty darn excellent, as well. :)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I simply love this book. I had no idea there were more books. I had such a wonderful time staying up late at night laughing. Never again will there be anyone like Douglas Adams. His ingenious scence of humor can never be replicated. This book will no doubt be a timeless classic for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I can't believe I put off reading this for so long! Think with all the hype I just didn't want to be disappointed when I actually got to it, but I was surprised to find that it was even better than what I'd heard. It's kind of hard to describe what exactly The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is. I tend to agree with some of the criticisms that there's not very much focus on plot development or story here and that mostly it's a collection of really witty, punny, and sarcastic observations about humanity and the universe, but that doesn't really detract anything from how clever it is. Adams wrote this at a time when really there was nothing comparable. It's hard to describe the exact flavor of Adams work, it's certainly unique, but it does echo a lot of things that modern readers should be familiar with. Imagine, if you will, throwing Monty Python, Kurt Vonnegut (specifically Slaughterhouse V), and Chuck Palahniuk in a blender - and that about captures it. In short, by the end, I found myself reading not to find out what happens, but just for the sheer pleasure of listening to Adams.HItchhiker's is funny, light-hearted in spite of the backdrop of the story being the destruction of the Earth, and extremely well-crafted. Adams uses language masterfully, examining nuances and the connotation of words and facts about us that seems like an insanely chaotic metacognitive philosophical treatise with a thread of humor all the way through. To be sure, this book is nerdy and geeky in the extreme - I think a basic knowledge of physics is definitely required to fully appreciate all of the humor in here - even to appreciate all of the scientific creativity. Reading this as late as I have, I was astonished to see just how much of a cultural impact the book has had, from Babel fish to Deep Thought.Will definitely read again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It is an extensive exercise in illogic. This book takes you on a romp through the universe with five hilarious characters. If you don't have a stick up your behind and an absence of logic doesn't bother you (indeed if you prefer illogic) then this is the book for you. (Not recommended for government officials, especially not the FBI, CIA, etc.) However if you like a side splitting laugh and wonder what the most useful thing in the universe is, this book is a must read for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"brilliantly written and very funny indee"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book in about a day because I could not put it down.

It is downright, honest-to-God, laugh-out-loud hilarious, but also thought-provoking in the universe it creates and the aspects of the world it subtly questions.

With Earth being blasted into a file folder under a stack of other file folders (or being blown-up) at the Guide offices to the creatoin of a Sperm Whale that crashes into a planet with a bowl of Patunias which developes into an interesting thing for Aurthor in later books, I loved this book.

The Hitchhiker's Guide is a classic sci-fi book. It is hilarious. The neat thing is that nothing occurs like you thought it would. For all of you who think it has no real plot, I think it shows how small we are in this great big universe, while at the same time it says that we shouldn't spend all of our time trying to figure out &quot;Why?&quot; so much. Maybe there isn't a real answer. It also shows how maybe we aren't the top species on this planet. You must read this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A marvolouse book. Very suspencefull, but a bit open ended, which is O.K. I supose if you like that sort of thing, or are a witty author with a large series to sell.

Douglas Adams does an encredible job of combining off-the-wall science-ficton with an amazing sense of humor. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with. The Hitchhiker's Guide series begins with an amazing twist. The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads. If you are looking for an amazing series that keeps you entranced, then this is without doubt the series for you.

Adams grabs your attention in all his books, and you'd be so engrossed, you wouldn't know it if Thor smashed your cranium in with his hammer. If you didn't find his books funny, you probably have a very wet towel over your head. Get rid of it. A great read... and a great laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A must-read for any sci-fi fan. Adams is a master with the humor.

I was sitting here reading the reviews and I decided to write my own review of the book. I think people who said it was too confusing had good reasons for saying it, but I think the confusion is the whole point of the book. Life is confusing, and this book is just a twisted version of life. I think people who said it was &quot;juvenile&quot; didn't really get the book. The point is that the whole world is &quot;juvenile&quot; and insane. Adults in the world don't always behave like sophisticated mature people, some of them behave like little kids or just generally act like idiots. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is just a version of the way Douglas Adams sees the world- an insane, messed up place where you never know what will happen next.I'm not saying The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is deep reading, but people don't need to read deep, thought-provoking books ALL the time. Last year I went on a seven-week trip and The Hitchhiker's &quot;Trilogy&quot; (all five of them) were the only books I brought that weren't &quot;deep&quot;. I don't know why I said that.I can't really judge how good it is as a sci-fi book. It probably isn't the best, but I've hardly read any other sci-fi books so I can't really tell. Will you please recommend some to me if anyone is bored enough to read my review? Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The trilogy(even though there is five)made me laugh half way to my demise. Only Douglas Adams could make me laugh at astrophysical jokes and satire. His vision is spastic, ridiculous, and fantasticly clever. In this book...the earth is destroyed within the first three chapters to clear a way for an intergallactic space highway that never even ends up happening. One of the last of the two remaining humans happens to hitch a ride on a vogon space ship(the vogans destroyed the earth). It turns out the earth is just a crazy experiment that is meant to find out the question to the ultimate answer which is 42. This book is insane and marvelous. Read this no matter what you like. It is worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy off of a list of classic novels or something like that, having no idea who Douglas Adams was or how significant the book was. I was pleasantly surprised, and now know where several popular phrases originated.The book begins with humanoid Arthur Dent waking up and finding a bulldozer in his yard about to demolish his house to make room for a highway. Arthur is understandably upset, but this doesn't really matter considering the fact that unbeknownst to the human race, earth is about to be destroyed to make room for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur is rescued from the fate of earth by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out is an alien who knows how to hitch rides on spaceships. With their jump into space, Arthur and Ford are launched into a round of interstellar escapades, accompanied by the egotistical but lovable Zaphod Beeblebrox, his girlfriend Trillian (who happened to have come from earth), and Marvin, the perpetually dismal android with a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot;.A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes an interesting combination of two genres- science fiction and comedy- and it works marvelously. The plots moves along quickly, making it an easy read, and also providing opportunities for multiple readings to catch all the humor. A Hitchhiker's Guide is imaginative, witty, and in places downright hilarious. In addition to this, the writing is very intelligent without being overbearing; the book gently prods at several of our own silly social conventions in a comical and lighthearted way. A Hitchhiker's Guide was a delightful read, and I heartily recommend it- to sci-fi lovers and non.One word of advice; don't waste precious mental energy trying to understand how an Infinite Improbabily Drive works, or any of the many other gadgets in the book, because this isn't the sort of book where it matters whether you understand how things work or not. I realized about a quarter of the way through the book that I was taking things much too seriously and that the ludicrous descriptions were placed there mostly for comic effect."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is the first in a five-book trilogy. (Yes, a five book trilogy.) In this book, an average Englishman named Arthur Dent learns of a plan to blow up the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass. His friend, who is from Betelgeuse Seven (and not Guildford as he claimed) helps him hitchhike off to the spaceships that destroy Earth. He then goes on a wild series of adventures, which are chronicled in this book.I like this book because it has a very strange sense of humor, and yet it has its own logic, which can be understood if one tries hard enough. It also has a cast of unique and semi-realistic characters. I also like how Adams uses some very strange analogies, such as \\"he felt like a man getting mugged in a meadow.\\" These analogies are not only comical and awkward; they also fit perfectly into the moment. They also perfectly convey the meanings. This book, in conclusion, is a very interesting read for anyone who likes anything related to hitchhiking, space, or any form of comedy whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams is perhaps one of the most indescribable books that I've come across in my readings. Douglas Adams in decidedly brilliant. His droll wit and sense of humor will definitely put a smile on your face.The story is somewhat complex. Without giving much away, human Arthur Dent is rescued from Earth just minutes before it's destruction by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien from somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse VI. Arthur and Ford (after some very funny encounters) come across Zaphod Beeblebrox (the two headed, three armed President of the Galaxy) and Trillian (aka Trisha McMillian, Zaphod's human girlfriend and a girl who Arthur had tried to pick her up at a party on Earth) and Marvin, a manically depressed robot.Adams' humor is more of the ironic sort then the laugh out loud type. Adams will give you a seemingly random excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the encyclopedia which, in the novel, is a central component) or a very detailed description of the thoughts of, say, a potted plant, which has seemingly no relevance to the story. But never fear, Adams brings everything together in an exciting and funny climax to the first novel of his increasingly inaccurately named series.From an analytical standpoint, the novel is a satire on the sterotypical british character - dull, complacent, emotionless. Arthur Dent can be classified as any of those. His only true emotional outbreaks come when his life is endanger (which it quite often is). The reader will enjoy watching Arthur's character grow and change. Fortunately, his character does not change too much over the course of the novel (his character is still the well-meaning but accident prone, unemotional hero that you will come to know and love).Again though, it's hard to describe The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As is said in the book, space is big. Like really big. Like really really mind boggingly big. It's like so big that it's just unimaginable. And so is Douglas Adams novel.I would like to take this moment to thank Douglas Adams for his work and to say &quot;God rest his soul.&quot; We will miss you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I thought it was hilarious. The Guide uses a genius blend of comedy and action to create a great flow of a story. Douglas Adams uses many large and complicated words so the reader has to figure out what these funny words say. When Earth is destroyed, the two friends Ford and Arthur must hitchhike throught the galaxy. The story follows these two friends and the hardships thay endure in there journey through the galaxy. I liked this book was very good and I recomend it for all who love a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Adams exposes the truth: &quot;In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry, and has been widely regarded as a bad idea.&quot;What else matters after this revelation?The incomprehensible world makes perfect sense as you follow Arthur Dent around the galaxy, just a step ahead of becoming galatic roadkill in a sidesplitting tour de force!Grab your Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, strap yourself in, and enjoy the ride... Oh, and don't forget to bring a towel!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams did a stunning job writing a sci-fi humor for radio production.I recommend buying the individual paperbacks instead of the compendiums for a variety of reasons.

Like a good movie, you can read it again and again and find something new to love about it every time. Be careful reading this in public.

I'm sure you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is amazing! Douglas Adams is an amazing writer. It's funny and intelligent at the same time. I've never laughed out loud while reading before this book. I recomend this book to anyone that enjoys a good laugh. It gets confusing at times with the whole concept of space travel, but stick with it and it's worth it. It really makes you think and there are few books that can be funny at the same time. And if you like this one, you'll love the other sequels even more. The books get funnier as you go too. Everything about this book is great. Especially the manic depressive robot, Marvin. To give a glimpse into the amusing nature of this trilogy, the man that really rules the universe says, &quot;I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A colleague had a line from the movie made from this book in his signature block at work.

He asked me if I had read the 5 books in this trilogy, and when I said no, he said I had to put that at the top of my &quot;to do&quot; list.I ordered the books, and when they arrived I started reading. I enjoyed every page. Douglas Adams took what we know as life, subjected it to his sense of humor, applied it to space travel and life. What resulted was one of the funniest and at times, thought provoking books I have ever read. By letting us see ourselves through Ford's eyes we can see some of the bizarre parts of our lives here on Earth.I would highly recommend this book, and the rest of the series to anyone who enjoys reading. They are sci-fi (which I don't like at all), but that is a very small part of the storyline. If you wished, you could imagine the travelers traveling from country to country on Earth, with a few minor exceptions.The next time I talk to my friend who recommended these books, I will have to thank him very gratefully."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It all started off so innocently when Arthur Dent woke up that Thursday morning in his home near London, England. everything seemed so ordinary, and then, the earth blew up. The same thing happned to me when I read this book. At first, when I picked it up, I wasn't sure that I would like it. As the book progressed farther and farther on, the better it got. And although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I could barely put Down The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This book was funny, clever, and had some really memorable characters such as Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Ford Prefect. I personally liked when they met Benjy and Frankie Mouse and how mice were said to be the smartest creatures on earth. I also thought it was a great idea of the author to use passages from the supposed original copy of this book. A must read.

I would never have believed that a book of this genre could be so funny. The book features a severely depressed robot with an inferiority complex, two brilliant lab mice named Benjy and Frankie, a computer that has the ability to find the answer to the meaning of life but will take millions of years to do so (never mind its finding the question) and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the figurehead President of the Galaxy, who only wanted that illustrious title to steal a starship. The hero, Earthling Arthur Dent, is rescued by researcher Ford Prefect, just before Earth is blown up to make way for the building of an intra-galactic superhighway. No matter that the myriad forewarnings were placed in a location absolutely no one on Earth ever heard about.

It doesn't have the greatest plot or the coolest characters, and it isn't a \\"I can't put it down\\" type of exciting novel, but it will help you relax and think about life and the world in a new way. It's also easy to read so that you won't feel like you've wasted too much time after you've finished.This is really a funny book and throughout the whole thing you really can't know what the expect next because everything is so crazy as the be totally unpredictable... At some points though I think that Adams tried a little bit too hard to be witty, ending up with some points in the book that are so ridiculous as to be sickening.

Together they encounter many improbable events and meet people like a depressed robot. This is one of the greatest books because it contains a lot of humor and it is a page-turner. The jokes are very humorous and make fun at things like poetry and pessimistic behavior. I like the humor even more because Douglas Adams puts it in when Ford and Arthur are in a perilous situation. Even if the humor were taken out, it would still be a good book. There is a lot of adventure that Ford and Arthur endure. All in all it is one of the books that I have actually liked. You will really like it if you read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a mix between adventure, comedy, and science fiction. Throughout this book, Adams makes fun of many things.

The main character,Arthur Dent , and his friend, Ford Perfect, meet a lot of people in space and even some old friends. This book does not have a single boring part. It will keep you excited and laughing frow the first sentence to the last. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided that my mind needed a brake from any type of serious reading. Just say no to thought-provoking books, strangely yet deserving so, was my (er) thought. :) Well, did I ever pick the wrong book. Not only can this book be \`laugh out loud\` funny, but its thought-provoking scenarios and intelligent satire will not oblige you to feel the guilt of wasting time in a silly read.People that take themselves too seriously or do not appreciate extraterrestial satire may not enjoy it as much.

Not having a lot of time on my hands to read (although I enjoy reading very much), I am rather selective about what I do read. I have found it very difficult to put this book down. I read it in bits and pieces throughout the day, taking it with me wherever I go. I've read it at home, in the Doctor's office, sitting in my car while waiting to go into a company for a job interview, and just about anywhere else. This book is very funny, it's zany, it's extremely creative and rather visionary at points given its original publication date! I am more than half way through it already, and I just love it.

You're having a bad day - and it's going to get worse.As you lay in front of the bulldozer trying to block its path, your best friend, Ford Prefect, who you always thought was an out-of-work actor, pops up and reveals that he really is an undercover alien from the star Betelgeuse. But wait -- things are going to get even worse.Ford tells you that a rocketship conducted by evil aliens called Vorgans are going to blow up Planet Earth in five minutes to make way for a galactic freeway.That's how one terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad Thursday begins for chronic worrier Arthur Dent, a 30-year-old Brit bored with his job at a local radio station. When we meet him in the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Arthur Dent suddenly has no reason for boredom and every reason to worry.So what does he do? Following the advice of his friend the undercover alien, he sticks his thumb up to hitchhike aboard the spaceship that belongs to the evil, nasty Vorgans. Arthur and Ford are smuggled in by the Vorgans' servants -- but the Vorgans, who hate hitchhikers, find them and throw them off the ship and into probable death in outer space.The two happen to be carrying a copy of a book called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which warns them that life can only survive 30 seconds in space without air. On the 29th second, they are picked up by another ship -- and there's something special about this ship. It has the magical ability to change your atmosphere, turning illusions into reality - for example, transforming two missiles into daisies.This ship is named The Heart of Gold, and it's been stolen by ex-hippie Zaphod Beeblebrox, who was born on the Star Betelgeuse. He has three arms and two heads and is the spacey president of the galaxy. Also on the ship are his girlfriend Trillian and a chronically depressed robot named Marvin.The ship sails to Planet Magrathea. The planet that created all other planets. There they go through many illusions, being knocked out by walls closing in, jetting at the speed of light down narrow hallways in mini-spaceships, and many other exciting adventures.At the end we find out that mice have run Earth for an experiment and are about to steal Arthur's brain, but they soon defeat them.This book is a cliffhanger that leaves its characters stranded on Planet Magrathea. - a sure way to make readers want to continue reading the sequels in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyI got this book a few weeks ago from my school library and finished the book in about a fortnight around all my school work and playing football, that just shows you how much I loved this book.

In the book you go around the Galaxy with Ford Prefect, an alien in human form, and Arthur Dent, a human man and Ford's good Friend. In the book Ford and Arthur are picked up and dropped from ship to ship around the galaxy onto planets they thought were uninhabited!

It's funnier than 'The Scarlet Letter'! It's longer than 'Chicken Little'! It's less poetic than 'Green Eggs and Ham'! And above all, it doesn't have near as many Greeks in it, well, anything by Homer, for instance. It is an incredible book.

What is funny to one person isn't necessarily funny to the next. For example - I think Dave Barry is hilarious, and I think his first novel \\"Big Trouble\\" is a laugh riot - but I found the movie \\"Big Trouble\\" pretty tedious, and not very funny.A friend turned me onto the Hitchhiker's Guide 20 years ago, and I laughed until I cried, and couldn't wait to move on to the next book, \\"The Restaurant At The End of the Universe\\".I see LOTS of reviews of this book trying lamely to describe the \\"plot\\" of the story, which would give a reader as much reason to read the book as it would to give a potential movie-goer the \\"plot\\" of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\". The story isn't the point. The enchantment lies within Adams' incredibly witty descriptions of the mundane and the extraordinary.----------------------------------------------------------Here is an early passage where our hero discovers that his friend is not English at all:\\"Alright,\\" said Ford. \\"How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?\\"Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way.\\"I don't know,\\" he said, taking a pull of beer. \\"Why - do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?\\"---------------------------------------------------Consider this exchange a few chapters later when space traveling Ford prepares earthling Arthur for his first travel in hyperspace:\\"You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace.

Some pages are so nutty/funny I'd be left gasping for air after each paragraph trying to smother uncontrollable laughter. Other pages, whilst not as funny, were so absurdly pedantic that you were left adrift in amazement. One of the most successful literary attempts at psychedelic writing in my 40+ years of reading. The book is miraculously manic; I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' book begins with our protagonist, Arthur Dent, facing the destruction of his house to make room for a new highway. This is all well and good until Arthur's friend of many years and closet alien, Ford Prefect, tells Arthur that their life on Earth is about to end, because an alien race wishes to make an intergalactic highway and Earth is in it's way. This is just the beginning of Adams' satire. He shows us that most of our problems are small and petty once put in comparison with something more substantial. The story continues with the President of the Galaxy, Ford's friend from his alien home planet, steals the most powerful ship in the galaxy, the one sporting the Improbability Drive, and takes it for a joy ride. Adams keeps the reader interested throughout the course of the book, giving the answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything, reasons why towels are a hitchhiker's best friend, and reveals the fact that Humans were only the third smartest animals on Earth, next to dolphins and mice, which come from another dimension. This book grips the reader's attention from start to finish, sending him on the most exciting adventure through the galaxy that he has ever been on.

In short, Douglas Adams has created a literary masterpiece. Smart, funny as hell, and just insane. I've read it 3 times and I'm still not tired of it. The open-minded will appreciate this.

For some it's meaning, for others it's a place in the universe, and for the rest of us, it's a digital watch. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really illustrates that unsure feeling that we all have. Arthur Dent was lost enough on Earth, but after it's demolished, he in desperate need of finding a speck of understanding throughout the rest of the Galaxy. Good luck without your towel there, buddy boy.I really dug this book. It didn't take you straight from point A to point B, as some novels do. It had twisty unpredictable swerves that gave you a glimpse of points X, Q and H, along the way, even though Q and H had nothing to do with anything. They were there for appreciation. For example, a nuclear bomb makes a quick transformation to a sperm whale before any damage is done. The reader is fully exposed to the Sperm whales thoughts and inner ramblings... all thirty seconds of them. It's beautifully absurd, and I loved it.I fully enjoyed the nonsense and the silliness of the book. Little details, especially. An incredibly depressed robot, the hailing of digital watches, eager to please doors; all these things didn't necessarily prove incredibly important on the character's quest, but amusing, nonetheless. Without the silliness, this may have been another book about post-Earth days and the last thing we need is just another book about post-Earth days. Have no fear, this is not just another book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thrilling yet hilarious book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, includes an exciting plot, great characters, and very cool ways of looking at the galaxy, as a human named Arthur and an alien named Ford travel though space in search of adventure. Ford is sent to do research for the book Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an electronic book that tells information about the galaxy. Ford and Arthur sneak away on a passing space ship, just as Earth is destroyed. They attempt to hide from the captain of the ship, but fail and are jettisoned into deep space! Knowing that they only have 30 seconds left of air, they try to find some way to save themselves. Just as they are about to die a passing ship picks them up, but Arthur and Ford aren't ready for the adventures that are about to happen to them. One reason someone should read this book is because it is extremely funny. The book has very humorous ways of looking at earth and the galaxy from an alien's point of view. One example is in the beginning when the aliens describe earth as &quot; An utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;(1) Another example of humor is when the aliens are describing Jesus: &quot; One man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change&quot;(2) There are many more funny jokes and comments about people and things through out the book. Another reason to read this book is because the adventures that Ford and Arthur have are very exciting and action filled. One example is when Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillen, Veet, and the robot Marvin discover the lost planet, Magrathea, which is rumored to not exist. When they come closer to the planet they are shot down with missiles and crash into the planet, and discover strange creatures and buildings on the planet. Another example is when Arthur, Ford and the gang get into a shoot out with police when they get caught with a stolen ship. The adventures and jokes that Douglas Adams comes up with are so funny it makes you want to read this book again. One reason why someone might not like to read this book is because if one reads the book too fast you might miss a transaction and be confused. The book as weird ways of saying things you might skim one thing and think it means something different then it really means, so you must read kind of carefully. This reason is not a good reason to not read the book because is a great book. All one need to do is read a little carefully and the only problem with the book is gone. If one does not read this book this will be missing out of all the funny adventures that Ford and Arthur go on.

This is the kind of book you could read at the airport while waiting for your plane or in an afternoon at the beach, if you aren't too afraid of people judging you harshly for reading a sci-fi book on the beach.Anyway, a concern of mine was that this book would turn out to be too British. By that I mean British humor is often so dry and strange that it's hard for people from other countries to understand it, like when I recently watched \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and it just didn't seem that funny to me. I have to say there probably is some of that stuff I just didn't get, but there was also enough I did get for it to be a hilarious read.In the universe according to Adams, poetry can be used as a weapon, Earth is demolished to make room for a new galactic superhighway, and mankind is only the third most intelligent species behind dolphins and another species I can't reveal without giving too much away.As for the story, Arthur Dent is a typical suburban Britisher whose house is about to be torn down to make room for a new road. This parallels Earth's fate as a race of ugly bureaucratic aliens swoop down to announce Earth is to be demolished to make room for a new galactic highway. (The plans were available in Alpha Centauri for decades. Didn't we get the memo?) Arthur is narrowly saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an out-of-work actor who's actually an alien. At the same time, the president of the galaxy Beetlebrox and his lovely human companion Trillian steal a new ship that runs via the Improbability Drive, which seems to cause highly improbable things to happen whenever it's used. The two storylines become intertwined in the search for the Ultimate Question.The Improbability Drive was the one thing I really didn't fully grasp in this book. The rest of the sci-fi terminology was easy enough to understand if you've ever watched \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or anything like that. So it's not really a challenging read that way. The real challenged as I mentioned is picking up on the subtleties and nuances I'm sure are buried in there. Some scholars out there I'm sure have broken down all the novel's symbolic elements and all that.The only real problem I have with this book is that it's too short. I didn't feel like I got a good enough grasp of the main characters, their conflicts, and relationships. Because the book is only 215 pages it seemed like we only got an overview of Arthur, Ford, Beetlebrox, Trillian, and Marvin without delving any deeper. I suppose that will be for the sequels to delve into. At some point I'll have to read those as well. (I haven't seen the recent film version either because I was afraid it would spoil my eventual reading of the book.)Still, as mentioned this novel is a hilarious read and since it takes so little time to breeze through there's really no excuse to keep putting it off if it's been on your list.That is all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhiker's series for the first time when I was about 14 years old. I have re-read the entire series at least 3 times since. Simply put it is one of the most hilarious books ever written. It deals with life, love, philosophy, poetry, space travel, flying, robots, dolphins, the meaning of life.... pretty much everything.This book has been translated into more languages than the Bible, that should tell you something.Seriously this is one of those \\"must read\\" books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"You need an up to date travel guide, and a towel. A really cool spaceship can't hurt, either.Other things that you should take note of are carefully hidden planning documents.

Otherwise, you should ask for your money back.Some glue paper mouse traps work best, too, I think, from experience.Really bloody funny."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"So, let's see if I have this straight. For interstellar travel, the single most important thing for anyone to remember to pack is ... a towel?Yes, it's that kind of book. The amazing thing is, Douglas Adams can really make a case for the Towel Argument, and he does. THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is the funniest thing he--or most anyone else this past 100 years--ever wrote. It's highbrow, lowbrow, and ever-so-intellectual silliness that makes the book so entertaining. I'll never forget the dolphins evacuating Earth before its destruction (via a preconceived plan) and leaving behind the message to all the doomed humans: \\"So long, and thanks for all the fish!\\"GUIDE is also a textbook example of books that completely lose all of their power when adapted by high-budget, vacuous Hollywood movie churners.

Not because his verbal wit is matched only by his intelligence. Not because his characters are so oddly interesting. Douglas Adams is an incredible author because he takes abstract concepts of life and uses the science fiction genre to make them somehow understandable. I cannot count the number of times where I have been trying to describe an abstract concept usually relating to science or philosophy and I have used Adams' work as an explanation. Religion, space travel, time travel, the human body, and even tea have all been meticulously broken down by Adams razor-blade wit. The concepts that lie within are more than a story, they are a man's view of this world and the things in it. That man just happens to be a genius."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just reread this book after ten yesrs. The first time I read it was in the summer after 8th grade. I wanted to see if this was as good as I rememder it and I can honestly say that I was surprised that this book is just as funny to me now as it was then. I don't think a book exists with funnier asides and narration in the entire corpus of the written word. This book is not about characterization it--if you are looking for that go read Orson Scott Card. This book is about blatant and unabashed mind-boggling creativity that with amaze even the most creative among us. Adama is truly a master at taking seemingly minute and trivial plot details and workign them back into the novel in meaninful and hilarious ways. That is why i like this--it is random, but not for the sake of being random, something I overlooked when I first read it. He works all teh asides and funny Guide entries right back into the novel so that seemingly pointless details come back around to guide the entire course of the novel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is about a guy named aurthor dent who wakes up one morning to find that his house is being demolished and a road is being put in instead. Then, aurthors friend ford prefect comes over and takes aurthor to the pub where ford tells him that he is really from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betleguese and that the world is coming to an end. After that they leave the pub and and a giant fleet of vogons are coming to demolish the planet, but aurthor and his friend hich a ride on one of the ships and are saved from total annihilation, then their journey begins.My favorite part of the book is when aurthor wakes up in the morning and starts getting ready for the day, and in every mirror there is a bulldozer getting ready to demolish his house. When he finally notices it he is sitting down eating breakfast. Then the next thing you know he is outside lieing down in front of a bulldozer that is getting ready to totally demolish his house. And then he finds out that the world is coming to an end and his only means of surviveal are to hitch a ride on the very thing that is getting ready to totally annihilate the earth. I like this part because I find it really funny.I really really liked this book because I found it very funny, and most of the time it made no sence what so ever.But if you don't like or don't understand british humor you would not like this book. And if you do not like books that make absoulutely no sence what so ever this is not a book for you. But if you very much enjoy adventure, action, and things that don't make sence along with some british humor this is the book for you. Also this book is for the people who don't like to read very long books that take forever and a day to finish."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ditto the same raves in all the other reviews. I regret I waited so long to read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I really enjoyed this book.The story is very funny, and all comes together in a very interesting way. The reason that I gave it four stars is because it gets confusing and hard to follow at some points. The story starts whan Aurthur Dent learns that his house is being torn down to make room for a new freeway. His buddy Ford prefect, who he thought was human, but turns out to be an alien wisks him off of the earth just in time for an even worse termination. The hystarical things that happen as the two friends journey through space are worth reading over and over again. if you like humor, but don't mind reading something twice for it to make sense, you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an interesting book aboutthe adventures of a man named Arthur Dent, who is about thirty years old,lives in a small town in England, and is taken aboard an alien spaceship seconds before it destroys the Earth. The man who brought him there happens to be his friend, Ford Prefect, who happens to be an alien himself. Throughout the story he and Arthur travel the Milky Way having ridiculous and idiotic adventures with the President of the Galaxy, his girlfriend, and a depressed robot named Marvin.I found this book hilarious, and, though none of it made too much sense, that was precisely why it was funny. It had plenty of references to actual things, made fun of them, and actually made you think about what was happening to the human race,and that we really aren't quite as smart as we think we are. One of the key points of the book's plot is an amazing spaceship that belongs to the President of the Galaxy, called \\"The Heart of Gold\\". It actually zips around the galaxy using the prospect of \\"Infinite Improbability\\" in which strange and often ridiculous things happen, but return to normal once it's turned off. During one event in the book, The Heart of Gold is being tracked by two missiles, and seconds before impact, Arthur pushes the Infinite Improbability button without turning it off afterwards. The result is that one missile is turned into a sperm whale, the other is turned into a bowl of petunias, and the ship's interior becomes a garden, and is completely unharmed.Overall,I found this book, interesting, quite funny, and something that really makes you stop, look around an think to yourself, \\" What am I really doing here anyway?\\" I would really and truly reccomend this book to anyone who's seen Monty Python, called it stupid, and still laughed at it. I would definetly not reccomend this book to anyone who can't laugh at themself, or gets angry when they're confused. A word of warning to anyone thinking about reading this book: I had to read some parts of this book twice to really get what was going on, and despite this, I would really advise anyone resding the book to keep going if you get confused. The book usually explains what went on after it mentions it. Personally, I believe that if everyone who read this book and some of the ones after it got as much out of them as I did, they could at least be a little smarter about how they live, deal with the government, and think about the environment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy to me that's a long title for a short book of only around 200 pages. If you want a quick read that has comedy try reading this short novel by Douglas Adams.The book puts in the universe threw Douglas Adams imagination. He does this unique style of writing where he uses another books passages and tells them threw the reading. By doing this you start to understand everything going on while your reading.The time that this book was published makes it hard for me to understand some of the jokes. So readers that where around in the early 80's might enjoy the book more than I did. Don't think that every joke is out of date, while I was reading it I was laughing inside. Adams made things obvious seem hilarious!The Flow of the book starts off slow and gains pace which makes you want to read on and never put it down.My overall opinion to this novel is that: it's easy to read, very comical, short, full of excitement, and has a shocking ending! So try reading this book and if you like it theirs a whole series that follow after this one."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Silliness abounds in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which as it turns out is not a guide book for hitchhikers beyond the general advice and rational behind always bringing a towel. Frequently the silliness is true to life in that it is tied to burocracy (The sequel to the Hithchhiker's Guide computer game was titled Burocracy.) and the oddities in modern life. The story starts as Arthur Dent, a normal English man, wakes up one morning to find bulldozers outside his house. His house had been scheduled for demolition for several months and he hadn't realized since the plans were posted at the county office. A few chapters later we find that the entire Earth has similarly been scheduled for demolition by aliens who wish to install an interstellar expressway. So Arthur with no house and soon no planet is taken to outer space by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out was an alien. What follows is travel through outer space which turns out to be as absurd as earth. Irony abounds.The book was adapted from a radio show and this yields some awkward results. The pacing is very ADD. Seasons of radio went into the book, so originally this would have been spread out over a longer period of time. However the going stays coherent and jokes are fit to plot not the other way round as can happen.This is a book that you will love or hate. I loved it and I think it would be worth trying out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is one of the more odd but hilarious and intelligent books I've read. It makes you think about the way we live our lives and how we as people view everything. The book shows the importance of a towel and how the galaxy works in general and it was quite hard to put this book down. The majority of my time reading this book I was literally laughing out loud. The characters in this book are well thought up like the Earthling/main character Arthur Dent who just starts his day trying to save his house from being demolished so there can be a on-ramp built for a freeway. Also Ford Perfect, a researcher, who saves Arthur Dent from being blown up on Earth, since the Earth was in the way for an intergallatic freeway. The two characters go through amazing adventures in the galaxy and meet many other interesting characters such as the president of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin, a robot who is extremely depressed yet very intelligent. If you want a good book to read that won't bore you or waste your time, I highly suggest this book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Grab your towel, stick your Babel Fish in your ear, and set off with Arthur Dent on his tour of the galaxy. Still fun after all these years and the father of a million bad puns, this satirical sci-fi spoof is nothing but fun. A pity we've lost Douglas Adams, but his priceless sense of humor lives on. The man was as funny as his work - I had the privilege of meeting him at a convention where he was booed only once. He admitted to wearing a digital watch. Re-read this if you're a fan, and check it out if you haven't. Timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Some of the reviewers of this book obviously don't have a sense of humor.

If you are not much of a reader, this book will change that!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy is a hilariously comic novel about many scientific aspects of the universe and creation. Many objects that seem insignificant turn up later, revealing their significance in the big scheme of things. The story, although funny, isn't necessarily an easy read. It reveals many details relating to other points carrying on throughout the novel and the whole series of novels. Douglas Adams take his readers through his points of view about the universe, which often leaves the reader saying, \\"What the crap?\\" However one can't help laughing at how ridiculous the situation is. The book is definitely difficult to put down.All who like science fiction will love Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. One does need to keep an open mind while reading the novel because Adams makes fun of most aspects of the creation of the universe that are popular to most people. If in general you have no idea what you believe and you do get offended is your own damn problem. After all, it's just science fiction. It's not like he means it! In closing, \\"life, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The downside of any audio book is that it does not give you the chance to pause for reflection. However, I fully recommend this book for two reasons: First, you could not pause during the reading of this book if you wanted to; it's that good. Second, Douglas Adams has a wonderful voice. It's a rare treat to hear an author read his own material and it casts a different light on a book than you might get just from reading it. It is an even rarer treat when an author is doubly blessed with a talent for writing and oration. If you enjoy this audio book, consider &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; by David Sedaris, read by the author."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Suddenly a thousand gallon vat of custard upended itself upon them. This is just one of many unconceivable thoughts and events that occur during the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If improbable and uncanny is your type of book I have one right here that you will love.As the first book in a series of unbelievable futuristic books, you are taken on a wild ride as the Earth is destroyed. Just don't forget your towel. As it is stated in the Universal Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, \\"There is a man who really has his towel.\\" Because of this, a person is likely to give a hitchhiker anything you want or need. During this adventure Arthur Dent is an unexpected human who, by chance or luck, is saved just in the nick of time. During his adventures he is taken all over the galaxy and ends up on a planet unknown to everyone, on a ship that was stolen by the President of the Imperial Galactic Government. This man may be the most unintelligent being around. The planet Arthur Dent is on is the planet on which live the makers of extremely expensive private planets. The ending will blow you away.I like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because it is unpredictable. Just when you thought it was over something completely strange and unbelievable happens and changes the whole story. Douglas Adams is constantly throwing curveballs at me. Strange as this book is, it presents a lot of problems that a person faces in life.If you like entertainment, this book is for you. The wild adventures and the inconceivable events continue to pile up, but don't stop there. As you read you begin to get a feeling of what Arthur Dent is going through. You become entangled with the characters and the plot. You are swept away with the mind-boggling chance occurrences that continue to pop up suddenly as though they were lurking in the dark waiting to pounce.Douglas AdamsThe erratic nature of this book, the immense entertainment value, and the qualifications of the author are my reasons for you to read this book. If that isn't enough, just think of the unbelievable quotes that you can rattle off while walking down the hall. If people didn't already think you were crazy they will now. So I leave you with a question to ponder; when faced with the dilemma of what to do when earth is destroyed, will you have your towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all-time favorites. Douglas Adams' irreverence makes this whimsical stuff a kind of profound Pythonism (not that the Pythons themselves weren't profound). Pretty much all the books in the expanded \\"trilogy\\" are terrific, but maybe because this was the first, and because I heard it in its original incarnation as a radio broadcast before ever cracking open the book, it remains the ultimate classic of the group, the one where it all began, as we so like to say. From the splendid monologues about things like probability drives to the coolest guy in the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox, this book and its offspring will stand tall for the next hundred years--as an Alice in Wonderland for the Space Age."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the very first Kindle book I downloaded, because it only seemed fitting. The Kindle is the ultimate incarnation of the Hitchhiker's Guide. The story is very tongue-in-cheek British humor which has developed a cult following since it came out in the mid-1980's. It is too difficult to try and explain here, but to give you an idea of the humor, this is the first book in a trilogy of five (yes, 5!) books. The only explanation I can give is either you get it or you don't.The Kindle version is easy to read: no gaps in the text, no obvious spelling mistakes and no pictures that appear only in greyscale. My only wish is that someone would contact Douglas Adam's estate and get a skin or cover to make Kindle look like the HHGG (large, friendly letters on the cover spelling out, \\"Don't Panic!\\") That would be perfect (or Prefect, depending oh how your Babel fish translates it). Now, where did I leave my towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can you say about an author who wrote a 5 book trilogy? One hilarious read, for one thing. I'd read Adams many years ago and wanted to return to read him again only this time a little more critically to see if the material still worked for me. It did.Douglas Adams really started something when he wrote this parody of one genre, and in so-doing he started his own genre and others have followed in his footsteps such as Robert Aspirin, Terry Pratchett and even Piers Anthony could be counted among those who have emulated this tongue in cheek, irreverent treatment of what had in the past come to be a science fiction genre that took itself very seriously indeed. It's not hard to see in Adams' acerbic and dry English sense of humor strong ties to the style of humor made so famous by the Monty Python crew of the late 60s and early 70s.Reading this the second time in the Kindle version, I found that it didn't lose anything for the change in medium. It really is a remarkably short little book for the impact it had. This kindle version included an addendum that provides the background to the production of the movie by the same name that was finally produced following Adams death in 2001. This addendum is fully one third of the length of the actual novel. It didn't need to be in my opinion, but others might find it entertaining and informative.This is one of the standards in science fiction, fantasy and satirical writing and well worth the time and effort to procure and read. Beware though, once you've finished it you'll want to go on and read the remaining 4 volumes of this famous trilogy.5 stars.bart breen"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide explains that it is the exception which proves the rule. It goes on to give this example.Long ago, the Gloops of Alpha Nucleii, sited on the far side of the Galacticus Quadrant, were in thrall to the Thargs of the Grand Imperial Empire of Maxorphius. On the last evening of every bi-millennium cycle of the two Suns of Antiochus, which was, The Guide explained, the equivalent of two standard solar system weeks, Thargs from the Empire would arrive to tax the poor Gloops of all wealth produced since their last raid.This left the Gloops permanently overdrawn at Grimgolds, the Galactic Bank, and the Gloops were pretty fed up about it.\`What can we do?' wailed the Gloops to each other after the most recent raid. \`We have tried resistance, we have tried reason, we have tried running away, nothing works. \`The Thargs are a zillion times stronger than us, will no more listen to reason than the putrefying sponges of Planetoid Desolatoria, and win all the running Golds in the Pan Galactic Olympics. They can never be defeated. The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone. The Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'And so, the tyrannical reign of the Thargs continued.The Guide flicked to the next screen and continued the tale.Eventually, having exhausted all possible ideas for freeing themselves from the ravenous Thargs, the Gloops turned to the lawyers.\`You see,' explained the Gloops, \`the Thargs are all powerful and shall rule us and everyone for evermore. What can we do?'\`Pay us in advance,' the senior lawyer demanded. The Gloops were ready for this, and had booked their lawyers' appointment the day before the Thargs were due, so as to have the necessary legal fees. These, they handed over.The lawyers retired and deliberated. In due course they emerged from their chambers.\`Can you help us?' pleaded the Gloops. The lawyers turned to each other and nodded knowingly.\`Yes, we can.'The Gloops were overjoyed, but a little cautious, for the Thargs were all powerful.\`How can you help us? The Thargs rule us; the Thargs rule everyone, the Thargs shall rule us for evermore.'The lawyers looked down at the Gloops and explained.\`The Thargs rule, you say. They rule everyone. They are stronger, deafer and faster than you. It follows that if you refuse to be ruled by them you will be the exception.'\`Go on...' encouraged the Gloops.\`...And it is forewritten in all the Good Books that it is the exception which proves the rule.'\`...er...'\`So when the Thargs turn up tomorrow to tax your wealth once more, you must defy them.'The Gloops shivered.\`Defy them? They will turn on us with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters, and eviscerate us to extinction.'The lawyers smiled the smile of those who chose the right career.\`No they won't. You see, it is written that it is the exception which proves the rule, so by defying them as no one else would dare, you are the exception which proves they rule. If they continue to rule over you they will no have an exception to prove their rule, and will consequently no longer rule over anyone.' The lawyers beamed. \`You've got them, see?'The Gloops did not see, but they trusted the lawyers. Next day, when the Thargs arrived with their taxing ledgers, the Gloops defied them.\`We've got you,' the Gloops exulted. \`We are the exception which proves that you rule. If you attempt to rule us we will no longer be the exception and your rule will not be proven.'The Thargs turned on the Gloops with their all-powerful whirlyblaagblasters and eviscerated them.What the lawyers had forgotten, the Guide concluded, was that if it is the exception which proves the rule, there must be an exception to this.The only exception, states the Guide, to the rule that it is the exception which proves the rule, is that the lawyers always get their fees up front."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the finest books ever written!

This is a re-read for me, as it does start off my very favorite five-book trilogy. And contains my all-time favorite quote: \\"Ford, you're turning into a penguin - stop it!\\" Basically, the book begins with the destruction of the planet Earth and ends at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, with a lot of great adventure (and insight) in between.

While there is not much in the way of plot, that is, rising action, climax, and falling action, it is still worth it to buy and read many times over. The characters are memorable, each with their own unique personality and view of the world. My favorite is Marvin, the 'paranoid android.' He is a manic depressive, and has the best insight into everthing. The humor is intelligent, a kind that makes people think about what the joke is, not the kind of crass humor that is so popular today, like Austin Powers or Blue Collar TV stuff.

Douglas Adams uses his book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, to get you thinking about how small the Earth is compared to the size of the galaxy and universe. Upon comparing these sizes, it could be said that it would not make a major difference in the galaxy if the Earth was not there; however, nobody would say this if they thought that the Earth might not actually be there someday. In fact, most people would say that this would be impossible. In this book, Adams changed the life of Arthur Dent forever by performing this impossible act: vaporizing the Earth. Arthur woke up one morning worried about his house being destroyed; however, he later realized that this was the least of his worries when the planet he called home, Earth, was vaporized by a group of aliens called Vogons.

If you like these two genres then you are sure to love this book. I sure did."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hilarious and entertaining, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an enjoying read. Filled with irony and amusing parts, the book is good for relaxing and taking your mind out of reality.Some of the characters in the story are outrageously funny. I especially love the contrast between the average normal human, Arthur Dent, and the rest of the relaxed and carefree characters. Arthur Dent is your average, don't have any idea what in the world is going on type of guy. Then there's Zaphod Beeblebrox. I mean how cool is that name?! Although he is the type of person you want to knock out because he is so idiotic. Even compared to Arthur Dent who does not have a clue what is going on, Beeblebrox appears to be THE loser of the galaxy. Last but not least, there's Marvin- one of the best if not the best character in the book. He steals the whole show away with his depressed mood. The thing he says and does is so ridiculous that I am on the floor laughing half the time. I mean when he plugs himself into another computer and the computer commits suicide- now that is hilarious.Douglas Adams' style is very simple and direct. It is as if he is discussing the story with the reader. While using sarcasm and jokes to make statements about life in general, Adams keeps readers entertained with his simple straightforward language.Filled with dynamic and entertaining characters and species, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is easy to read and one of the funniest science fiction novels I have read in my entire life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide is indisputably one of the funniest if not the funniest books ever written. While still sticking by science fiction standards Douglas Adams creates scenes of hilarity not only to make us laugh but to give us different perspective about this silly thing we call life.Though the story line is a bit complicated the first time around, this provides for multiple readings of enjoyment. We start with our main character Arthur Dent, who is having his house demolished to make way for a bypass and is then suddenly saved as the world is about to end by his friend Ford Prefect. Sound simple so far, well it's not that simple, in fact it's quite complicated. It turns out that his planet is being destroyed by the poetry-telling Vogons and that his friend Ford Prefect is actually from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. From here Ford and Arthur are thrust into a world of obscurities and random events.With items such as the Babel fish, the Infinite Improbability Drive, and a spaceship named the Heart of Gold it's hard to go wrong. Adam's characters are especially unique. From the clueless Arthur Dent, who really just wants a nice cup of tea, to Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy who has three arms and two head, to Sartibartfast, the planet building man responsible for making the fjords on earth, Adam's presents an all-star lineup. One character not mentioned, but who deserves recognition is Marvin the Paranoid Android whose wholehearted depression makes the story even funnier.The whole story is not in complete narrative format, instead there are random moments in which Adams choose to insert random facts about universe as written in the Hitchhikers Guide, a wonderful book with the words Don't Panic written in nice friendly letters. Here Adam's true comedic genius shines and his style is evident through is humor. He uses short sentences to make understatements \\"space is really big\\" as well as long sentences to go off on tangents on topics such as Vogon poetry or the existence of Magreathea.In Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy not only will you find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything thing, but you might also find yourself rolling on the ground laughing. And who knows maybe one day you'll get to visit the restaurant at the end of the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is brilliantly witty at every turn. You just never know what to expect next but you know it will be funny. Adams is a master of the dry sense of humor and communicates it in such a way that you can't help but laugh out loud. There is just enough plot and character development to keep things moving, but the real lure here is Adams' sheer gift for humor. I recommend this book highly to all who refuse to take life (or themselves) too seriously--you will be delighted as you laugh your way through this one."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Read the series and then watch the original BBC broadcasts on DVD, or listen to a copy of the radio series. This book is a classic and I suspect that we will never see its like again. Even though the author was given credits in the latest movie of the same name (he died some time ago), I hope that you will see the humor that made this a classic.

It was great but the only bad thing was it was such a quick read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you have a sense of humor, this book is for you. The perfect mix of science fiction and humor, it cannot fail to throw you into pangs of laughter."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction novel by Douglas Adams. After Earth is destroyed, Arthur Dent finds himself on a space ship with his Alien friend Ford Prefect, the president of the Galaxy Zaphod Beezlebub, and former Earthling Trillian. They set out to find the mythical planet of Magrathea and have some fun adventures.This book is really amusing. There isn't really much of a plot, but the writing is very clever and humorous. As a science fiction nerd, I found a lot of it hilarious, and the characters are interesting and funny. The plot is interspersed with excerpts from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a literal how-to guide, which give the reader amusement and an idea of the universe they've been thrown in to. I think this is the first book of four, which explains why there isn't really any resolution and many questions are left unanswered.The book spends much of the time focusing on why the universe exists. The second smartest computer in the world decides the answer is 42, but what really is the question? Adams says that humans are actually the third smartest species on Earth, after mice and dolphins. The whole book seems to be saying that you have to find out your reason for existing yourself. Go out there and hitchhike and find something to do with your life. The answer isn't the problem, it's the question. You have to find the right question, and then the answer will make sense."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Because it makes so many \\"best of\\" SF lists, I read it. I actually got a bit more than I expected - Adams's writing is quite good, and I picked up on a number of modern cultural references derived from the book - but as far as humor goes it's a zero. Obviously I'm in the minority, but keep in mind thatThe Facts of Life: Season Fourgets a higher average rating by Amazon customers, so there's your yardstick."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one that I will likely take grief for, but I can't help it - I did not like it at all. I love the concept ofThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Deluxe 25th Anniversary Edition- quirky end-of-the-world-ness, random characters, coolly bizarre sci-fi bent. But the writing bored me, the characters were either whiny or self-indulgent or caricatures, and the \\"plot\\" felt flimsy. How on earth this became a cult classic with sequels is utterly beyond me..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm not usually into reading things that are just plain unbelievably silly, but not only did I read the book from beginning to end, then watch the movie, I even read the rest of the books in the series. I was amazed at how the randomness of the book just flowed together and not once did I ever read it and say, why is that even relevant or why did Adams write this? I just laughed my buns off. I probably won't ever read it again, but if you love things like Austin Powers, although less crude, this is a very humorous adventure and the characters are easy to fall in love with."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comical science fiction story starting with Arthur Dent protesting against his house being destroyed for a bypass. Ironically, the earth was about to be destroyed for a hyperspace express lane. But Ford Prefect, a friend and alien from Betelgeuse, gets Arthur out by hitchhiking a ship.They then travel the galaxy in the most improbable manner and become involved in the quest of vastly hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who seek answers to questions such as, \\"Why are people born? Why do they die? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work?\\"To review this book, I'll be answering the five following question: Is it entertaining? Is it educational or thought inspiring? Does it have an engaging literary style? What audiences is it or not recommended for? Would I read it again?Is it entertaining?This book is full of creative random, ironic, and cynical humor. If you looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy this book.Is it educational or thought inspiring?For a comedy, it is surprising how educational and thought inspiring it can be. I learned several new words that I had to look up in the dictionary. Douglas Adams humorously targets topics that typically matter to most people; challenging and giving new perspective that can cause one to ponder.Does it have an engaging literary style?Douglas Adams doesn't suspensefully catch attention of the readers where they feel like they can't put the book down. Nor does he go into imaginative detail. Each chapter are short and meant to humor the reader. Two reasons make this book engaging: humor and the easiness to pick up where you left off.What audiences is it or not recommended for?I would recommend this for all general audiences except two: Children, and those who cannot stomach cynical humor, especially with sensitive topics such as religion, which sensitivity is what gives me reason to drop this book to four stars.Would I read it again?Yes.I hope this review helped you, and if you ever want the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, read the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Stretches your imagination, but never loses its sense of humor. Fans of \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all-time favorite novels. Adams did some great editing work on early Dr. Who episodes before creating this masterpiece of science fiction humor. No one comes close to his quips! The characters from Zaphod to Marvin are hysterical. There really isn't any other author who even comes close to this style. Appropriate for all ages and a real page turner! This is one you will want to read more than once.NetherWorld"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a fantastic book for the teenage mind, especially if you have appreciation for mathematical or scientific concepts (but you don't need any background in either subject, just appreciation for it) -- and when your mind gets many years older, you will indubitably find yourself reading it again, as most of us have. This is the food your mind is craving, but didn't know what it was. It's not like other books you will find (unless you find a recent book that borrowed ideas and style from this). The style of reading is amazing, and the humor pops in at just the right (which is often unexpected) places. This was originaly a 4-book series, ending with So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, but if you get that far, you should also read the fifth book, Mostly Harmless. The second volume is my favorite, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which has the alternative meaning that you probably don't expect, and the fourth book, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, is definitely worth the read. The author's works outside of this Hitchhiker's series are considerably different in nature -- maybe you'll like them, maybe not, but it's worth knowing that they are not more of the same. You can see that I'm trying not to give away the content. If you find another Hitchhiker fan, just answer 42 when they ask you a question, tell them not to panic, or ask them why they left their towel at home, and they'll understand completely. This series is a great conversation piece among those who have read it, and they often like to challenge one another's Hitchhiker trivia. You know it's an exceptional book when you love discussing it for many years after you read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read in a while. If you like the movie, you will love this book. I spent a whole day reading it, it was that good! I went and bought his complete works, he is one of my favorite authors now."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've had friends and acquaintances recommending this book to me for years and I finally decided to read it before going off to see the movie version. Though the book might seem a bit disjointed, there is a plot to the events the occur. Arthur Dent is a typical middle-aged British male that awakes to find that his home is in the process of being destroyed to make room for a national interstate. Moments later, Arthur is saved from the planet Earth by his friend, Ford Prefect, just seconds before the planet is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic freeway. Talk about the irony.And that's pretty much how the whole book moves along. There are some wonderful witty lines spoken and keen observations stated about human nature. These are what make up the book's core. However, in all the witty nonsensicalness, don't loose sight of the plot: that this is a movie about a lost man trying to find his place in the universe. So, so long and thanks for all the fishes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide is surely one of those books best enjoyed between the ages of 15 and 20, but I still had a great time with it at 25. Douglas Adams' genius is in gently but decisively subverting a genre while staying true to its best and purest roots. Thus, he dispenses with the dorky obsessiveness to which sci-fi is susceptible, using humor and non-stop action,The Guide is a tribute to science fiction and a paean to its great patron saints. Exploring space and time travel in an infinite yet incomprehensible universe, Adams offers a view of the universe without the self-importance and Earth-centered myopia of the human race. Yet just when the Earth is detroyed, we take comfort in the realization that the rest of the galaxy turns out to be populated solely by other creatures very similar to ourselves. No stone is left unturned, no nasty trait of humankind is immune from Adams' sharp, yet not quite caustic, wit.At a rudimentary level, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy appeals to the fantasy-addicted, carefree spirit of our inner child--the mystery and wonder of space and time surrounding us without all the baggage of the adult who has ceased to dream and look into the stars, content to rest on his laurels and in his certainty of death and taxes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is quite a hilarious look at life, and if you haven't seen the movie yet I would advise you to read the book first - if not only to read the book and not see the movie, reason being that you will miss out on intricate details which are undoubtedly the best parts to the whole story ! If you dont have a good sense of humor, or understand why one would pass out if Mc Donalds was suddenly no more - this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit that I went about this backwards - I saw the recent movie before reading the book. Having done so, I think the movie did an admirable job in portraying the story at heart; but reading the book is an even more enjoyable experience. Douglas Adams' sci-fi satire is a blend of all the best of every world.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is the story of Arthur Dent, an earthman who discovers one Thursday (while trying to keep his house from being bulldozed) that his close friend, Ford Prefect, is from another planet, and that in a matter of minutes, Earth will be destroyed. The two hitchhike a ride on the Vogon ship that destroys Arthur's home planet just as said destruction is taking place. What follows afterwards is a wild ride through the universe with the President of the Imperial Galactic Government, Zaphod Beeblebrox, an earthgirl whom Arthur struck out with at a party, and the robot Marvin, who has been given a Genuine People Personality, and is therefore depressed by everything. Their travels bring them to find out who was behind the destruction of Earth, the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and just who happened to be the most intelligent being on Earth before it was destroyed.There's no doubt why Adams' classic satire has become such a classic. The story is witty, laugh-out-loud funny and, oddly enough, one that readers can identify with. I look forward to reading the books that follow for more instructions on how to not panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read! The humor and suspense are both very powerfull. It defineately makes you wonder. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Now I know that this book is supposed to be a \\"trilogy in five books\\" but I can't help but feel a little cheated by the way this one ends. There is little in the way of closure and all I got from the ending is speculation. This doesn't mean that I hated the book though. Far from it, I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Douglas Adams really has a knack for writing in a drool manner that I found to be very amusing. The humor is very good and, I suppose, very British. The story shouldn't be taken seriously, but I guess that's where appreciation ends and geekdom officially begins. All I'm saying though is that I didn't get everything I could possibly want in terms of story but that's okay. Because I can't wait to get my hands on the next couple of books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for all ages. Arthur Dent is about to get his house knocked down, which he is very mad about. Then his friend, Ford Perfect who is from a different planet, tells Arthur that the Earth is going to be destroyed, to make way for a space highway. Ford Perfect is a researcher for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and he wants to update the book to be more up-to-date. Arthur and Ford hitch a ride with the Vogons, rights before the world explodes, and are almost immediately thrown out. They hitch another ride, with the president of the galaxy, who stole the fastest space ship ever made, coincidentally, Arthur finds his friend Trillian aboard too, he had met her one day at a party. After that they go on many journeys and mishaps, which make the book incredibly funny. Every character in this book is great, and adds humor to every page, Arthur who is a regular human, Ford Perfect his friend, and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most interesting characters because he ahs 2 heads, and 3 arms. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book full of humor, and also a reader who enjoys reading science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is hilarious! It's about two people who live on Earth named Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, but Ford Prefect is from a distant planet. Moments before the Earth gets blown up to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur and Ford hitch a ride from some aliens and escape annihilation. When the aliens dump them into space, they get picked up by another spaceship. That spaceship was called the Heart Of Gold, the most technologically advanced spaceship in the universe. Before Arthur and Ford got pickied up by the Heart of Gold, the ship was stolen by the president of the galaxy who is a two headed, three armed ex-hippie named Zaphod Beeblebrox. On the ship there is a genius but clinically depressed android named Marvin. In my opinion he is the funniest and most memorable charactor in the book. Together, Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Marvin go on a hilarious adventure full of excitment, thrills, and laughter. The ending is something that you would never expect and you will have to read the book to now what it is. This is just the first book in the series of 13 books written by Douglas Addams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone of all ages. I thought this book was exciting and full of energy. I felt it was upbeat and amusing. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. Author Dent was a quiet and normal human living on earth. Author never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. He was satisfied with the way he existed on earth. Then there was Zaphod Beeblebrox. He was an alien that was a joking, reckless President of the Imperial Galactic Government. Zaphod was rather full of himself and never seemed to have a worry. Another character is Marvin. He is a depressed robot that never had a positive outlook on anything. Also there was Ford Perfect. He was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just a guy that went with the flow of things.It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. The pictures he painted were vivid and creative. The stories are unlikely yet extremely enjoyable. I loved the jokes about bureaucracy around the galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters. The storyline kept me guessing and I was always pleasantly surprised. It seems, to me, that it appeals to \\"nerdy\\" people. Besides that, I thought the book was outstanding. Everyone I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did. The book grabs on to your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not standard, the story was fresh and the visuals that he painted were superior."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Two weird things happened to me while reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 1) I was informed that the house I lived in was to be demolished. 2) Douglas Adams passed away.I could have looked beyond this and thought nothing of it. But a lot of weird coincidental things have happened in my life that has led on to both good and bad things to come. I have put some of these things into my own Sci-Fi Mystery Series, \\"Mammoth Towers Mysteries\\", because explaining them in real world terms didn't always make civilized sense.And that's what I got most out of Douglas Adams' words. In his willingness to be bigger than life with both his characters and plotting, he allows us to be smacked in the face by a subtext that mirrors our ridicules uncivilized real lives and not have our feelings hurt in the process, yet clears our thoughts and opens our minds to the probability of the truth that we are not really the highest form of life on this planet.At the time of my reading Adams' book I did not know a movie was in the works. But I do remember wondering how a film maker would turn this all into a Hollywood movie. After seeing the film, it improbability worked. And now as those images are beamed out into space, Douglas Adams will live on eternally in both space and Time as one of this galaxy's Infinite Improbability Driven Great Writers.

The last straw was when a visiting minister to our pulpit used this guide as a jumping of point to explaining the our religious practices to newcomers. So of to the on-line store and soon this nifty little volume was at my doorstep.What a blast! The antics of Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect are so zany that they have to make you chuckle if not laugh outright. And the perpetually sad robot, Marvin, infuriates the reader as quickly as the other characters in the book.

I'm glad I did. I laughed out loud a number of times. Each sentence has the reader wondering what the next sentence could possibly say. It has a Monty Pythonesque quality to it, and you can almost hear Eric Idle or John Cleese delivering the punchlines as you read.Arthur Dent's misadventures begin with a yellow bulldozer and don't stop until mice, monkeys, a depressed robot, the number forty-two, and language translating fish all come into play.I'd recommend this book, even if you don't happen to be a fan of science fiction.

From Arthur Dent's charcter to Ford Prefect's to Slartibartfast's to the WORSHIPED Marvin - I've never read such a clever , humoristic writing.

It includes action, mystery, and most of all, science fiction. Douglas Adams is a genius in the writing world. This book has astounded me and has tingled my intrest in science fiction novels. Adams has created a masterpiece, something that I would read over, and over again to myself and my children. It would intrest anyone. From grades four(kind of hard for them) to eigth. Anyone who has any kind of an intrest in science fiction, fantasy, or just regular fiction, would be very interested. It is short but sweet, it ends very quickly, but covers a giant time period. In such a short time, Adams has created one of the greatest books I have ever read. My favorite character s an alien from the Beltigeuse Galaxy, who had done a report on Earth. But as time went by, he got stranded on Earth. His Earthian name was Ford Prefect, and he plays a stupid alien( at times), and also a genius to the alien Galaxy. Aurter Dent is the main character, and he goes through a lot of difficulties in the giant Universe. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read, and if you like this book, you should read the whole trilogy by Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far the funniest book ever written. Between the action, the characters, and the dialogue, there is hardly a paragraph that dosen't get a laugh. With Ford Prefect (ha) and Arthur Dent in the main spots, a romp across the galaxy is a great form of entertainment. I don't want to give away too much of the rudimentary plot, seeing as there's not that much to give away in the first place, so I'll end the review here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you like science fiction-or even if you don't-you have to read this book.

The whole series is downright brilliant. Douglas Adams, tragically passed away earlier this year, was a fantastic writer, who could make you laugh, cry, wonder, etc. in just a few pages. The book is a combination of Science, Science Fiction, Humor, Romance and a bit of suspense. It tells the story about a guy, whose house will be destroyed, and at the same time, the Vogons are just above the earth, in order to destroy the earth. Both places must be destroyed, in order to make room for a highway.The choise of words, the similarities, everything gives you a feeling of recognition and believe in all the strange things that happens in the book.Specially for everyone in ICT, like myself: the whole series in mandatory literature !"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing and then some. Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, \`wow, that's big', time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here,\\" Douglas Adams writesThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, The Universe, and Everything by Douglas Adams are arranged respectively to create a continuous story about five randomly unique characters plus one more later in the first book, then leaves in the end of the First book, and finally joining again in the third. These novels are one constant adventure through the ENTIRE universe, except at times where there isn't any adventure, which is a very small amount (I'll get to the characters later). Adams creates random but not entirely unrelated thoughts from the ever-famous Hitchhiker's Guide - thoughts like: \\"the knack [of flying] lies learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\\" He creates theories, one that states \\"that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable\\" and \\"another theory which states that this has already happened.\\"Arthur Dent is Adam's central character; basically each novel revolves around his life. Arthur is an earthling who just barely escapes not only the demolition of his house but also the demolition of his planet, thanks to Ford Prefect and a few alcoholic beverages. Ford Prefect works as a \\"researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Just seconds before the earth is destroyed which happens immediately in the first novel, he saves Arthur from near death by hitching a ride on one of the ships that destroyed the earth. Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford Prefect's cousin. While he is president of the galaxy, he acquires the starship, Heart of Gold, which runs on pure improbability. Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, rides the Heart of Gold with Zaphod after she was plucked of the earth a few years prior to its destruction. Marvin is a persistently depressed robot with intelligence beyond any known race or any race mentioned in the trilogy. Slartibartfast joins the strange crew, then departs, then joins again. This man from planet Magrathea is in the planet making business, which all Magratheans are, or more accurately were. Slartibartfast is very fond of fjords.Together, this crew, equipped with the Heart of Gold, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and eventually the starship Bistromath, explore the Universe for \\"the Question,\\" \\"the Answer,\\" and everything in-between.Adams writes in a sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical manner, showing new ways to perceive concepts formerly thought of as dull. The most hysterical and repetitive example in the three novels is the extreme importance of tea. At one time in the continuous story known as \\"The Hitchhiker's Trilogy,\\" \\"Arthur blinked at the screens [of the Heart of Gold] and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. \`Is there any tea on this spaceship?' he asked.\\" If you've enjoyed the sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical writing of this review, you'll definitely LOVE \\"the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy boasts original characters (as well as original physiology), original ideas, plot twists, and fresh humor. Few science fiction novels can joke about themselves as this one does, and even fewer can do it so successfully. This book is recommendable to seasoned sci-fi readers and novices alike - as long as you can stomach the taste of humor that bombards this text, it will quickly become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Have you ever used a pancake flipper to turn a time axis over? By the time this little story is over, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, has probably not only flipped a time axis over, but has probably done so exactly at the moment the thing had the right number of pock marks/wormholes.This is the story of how an Anyman from England goes on a fantastic intergalatic voyage after bureaucratic, fascist-oid aliens commit wholesale planetcide against the Earth in the name of Progress, demolishing it to construct a hyperspace bypass moments before the Earth, one big organic computer, is to render the 10-million year Question. (Kinda makes Arthur's house demolition for similiar reasons at the beginning of the story look like wormmeal by comparison).By confronting robots and computers that should ge given frontal-circuit lobotomies, greedy mice that saw their 10-million year investment sour before it went boxoffice, and various and sundry &quot;whoops&quot; incidents in outerspace, Arthur becomes a Space Novitiate, ready for more space adventures in sequel books, and ready to turn that time axis over with a swift flick of his wrist, as soon as the stuff stops jiggling.Don't pass this book by if you think it is too Trekkie or Sci-Fi-ish from the title, especially if you do happen to like absurd/obscure British humor like Monty Python. As a matter of fact, I even found a refrence in the book to &quot;an elderberry bush full of kippers&quot; which vaguely reminded me of some M.P. skit about herrings and shrubberies."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No doubt that &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; is perhaps the most popular science fiction book ever. The reason escapes me. Ripe with throwaway absurdism and weak irony, this book made me wince more often than it made me laugh.

The general idea of this book is bizzar; mice are running the planet earth, aliens that can write poetry, and spaceships that commit suicide. I don't know where to begin. Well first, structurally the book is terrible. Adams jumps from character to character and finally by page 215 (out of 216 pages) it becomes apparent that this book is just going to end abruptly. (This may actually be the only good thing about the book, is that it is short, and a long ending that makes some sense would simply be tedious to read). Adams obviously wrote these 216 pages to make 5 jokes maybe 2 of which are truly funny. However, to hear these jokes are not worth sacrificing your time to read all the trash encompassing the random stabs at humor. In order to completely \\"understand\\" the complex world which Adams has created, you must read page long \\"history lessons\\" to get the background of different types of aliens, planets, and spaceships.I must admit I was misled from the beginning, I thought that this book was actually \\"The Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, I was disappointed to find that Adams's book is only referring to a made up book that explains useless knowledge to ficticious characters. Therefore making this book even more useless!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i was deeply disappointed with this book, it does not live up to all the hype i have read and heard about this book for years. i found it silly and contrived. not at all thought provoking as it is suggested. don't buy much less read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'd give this a NEGATIVE 5 star rating if I could.

It was an easy, quick read and was a good way to pass some time at my boring job. However, this book also had a lot of shortcomings. For one thing, the concept of literally Hitchhiking across the galaxy is cheesy, especially when the hitchhiker just uses a device to latch onto a passing spaceship. Also, the dialogue was terrible. The humor was nothing but bad British wit which the flimsily constructed character's angrily spewes at one another. However, the book was fun to read, so I won't be too harsh. There was more good than bad. I don't plan on reading the rest of the series though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I first set my sights on this book and after reading short synapses and positive reviews of what the book was mainly about, I thought it would seem interesting. This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time. And not to mention, a total waste of my 10, plus some dollars I used to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"yes sir, this is a jolly good read, from a very creative British mind, the one, the only Douglas Adams.Guaranteed to make you laugh, and also philosophize.

And of course Marvin the Robot is irresistible in his depressing way.

Made into a (now rarely broadcast) made-for-TV film in the '70s, and soon to be released on the big screen (think massive special effects blockbuster), Don't Panic!- you can still read these before you see it! Also produced as a very entertaining series of radio programs...or should that be 'programmes'?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a book I honestly never had thought about reading. I started reading it because of the movie coming out...which only when I was only five pages from the end did I realize wasn't even based on. BUT....I am glad I read this book...and although like someone else stated some of the parts I was like \\"huh\\" and other parts I was like why didn't they finish explaining. I enjoyed them. I laughed hard at the beginning and even though not the most exciting book I ever read there was a compassion factor that made me keep reading to find out what happened to Zaphod and Trillian and Ford and Arthur. I actually am starting to read the next book because I want to know what happens with the mice, with the number 42 and what happens to the main characters. It is a quick read I finished it within a week-with work and college and many other things going on. So it is great for that. I am not disappointed that I read it. I actually am glad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never had I read a book which made me laugh so. Friends, family, and co-workers all expressed concern for my mental health as I would giggle, quite beyond my ability to control, at random intervals and for painfully long periods of time.The humor in the book is the ultimate in satire, and nothing is spared, religion, history, sociology, psychology, philosophy . . . the list is expansive.The characters are interesting enough and fleshed out enough that the reader develops an interest in them and a slight concern for their well being, although from the moment we are introduced to seemingly any character we must question their sanity. The characters aren't enough to be loved, as that would cause for us to be far too concerned with their well being to the point that we would object to the abuses that they are put to. Think of jesters, give them names, faces, and imagine that they're distant associates, like loopy high school classmates.The galaxy itself is a satire of the galaxy as represented in almost any other popular science fiction. The Hitchhiker's Galaxy is crazy. Physics has apparently taken a rather long coffee break, and many of the characters that you meet will make the main characters appear quite sane. I have yet to identify anything in the galaxy that isn't a joke.The story reads quickly, an afternoon of reading and you should easily cruise through this book, yet you'll experience the pain in your gut from the laughing for days thereafter, or longer if you continue in the series.Great for those who are looking for gratuitous and plentiful humor. If you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for a meaningful and linear series to fall into, this is not the place to look. However, if you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for some lighter fare, you've found the right place."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first heard this story on the radio in England, bought the first two books and watched a cheesy fun BBC TV version. I laughed so hard I about peed my pants! Some of the humor is strictly British, and some of that dated to the late 70's early 80's, and some of it you have to have an understanding of some science to get the jokes. That doesn't matter though because if you read it you will still laugh, and that is the point. So get your towel, and a pack of peanuts, you can even put your head between your knees,(it won't help but you can do it if you like)And open this book and Restaurant at the end of the universe. You will be glad you did. Now the other books have some funny stuff too, but you have to read a lot of not so funny stuff to get to it. The new movie version comes out soon... I can't wait!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"All it was made out to be by reviews I read -- a very very amusing book. One of the few books I have read that made me laugh out loud. The book has the credibility to pick it up and read it without reading an intro/summary to see if you will like it (I thought it was much better reading it without knowing much/anything about it -- this is why I am refraining from saying any specifics).Bottomline, this book is humor at its best. Not a romance and will not cause the slightest amount of stress (it has suspense, but not the kind that stresses the reader). \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" was not written the way most stories are, which makes it so great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In a bizarre twisted universe, when one human escapes the planet, what does he do, he goes...... sight seeing. I thought that this book was funny, but odd.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book written by Douglas Adams. It is an excellent story if you like the book that \\"explains\\" why things happen in the universe. Arthur Dent was on earth within seconds before it was destroyed to make a galactic highway. His odd friend that is an alien, named Ford Perfect, mentors him about the universe.While this has happened, the president of the galaxy has just stolen the Heart of Gold, which is a ship with state-of-the-art technology. These two groups somehow intercepted and have a very funny adventure with each other.As I wonder what was going on inside Douglas Adams's head when he made this book I admit that it may be one of my favorites. Over all it is a hilarious book with a surprising and yet, strange, ending."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I originally picked this book up after seeing both my sister and father read it and constantly laughing at it. I can see why they were laughing. The way he makes fun of our normal ways of life, such as \\"the movement of tiny green pieces of paper\\" as he so well put, and he even makes fun of the intelligence of pretty much anybody and everything. Including sperm whales even.Overall i would say that The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy's concept is the funniest part of the book. Earth was destroyed in order to make a path for an intergalactic highway, the plans were in the Alpha Centurai hall for months. And all this happened just as the main character, Arthur Dent, faced a strikingly similar situation with his house.Douglas Adams's writing style and humor is a rarity among books, sometimes a chapter will be nothing more then a few words, or sometimes, only a page long. He will also go off explaining his galaxy through the use of \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" It contains knowledge of just about everything, from the incredible use of towels, to the discription of earth, \\"Mostly Harmless\\". Of course this is before earth is destroyed.All in all, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy remains as one of my favorite books of all time, and as hard as it is to believe, the series of 8 books, gets funnier and funnier as it goes on."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I really liked this book. It's tongue and cheek humor reminded me of Seinfeld, with \\"it's show about nothing attitude\\", except on a galactic scale. Author, Douglas Adams, really showed what day in the life of a universal hitchhiker would be like. Ford, Authur Dent, Zaphod, Trillian and Melvin are all lovably characters and I could relate to them. They reminded me of people I know or who I have met before. Who doesn't know someone who is cronically depressed. I truly wish that I could trade places with Arthur Dent and just spend one day in his shoes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I heard a lot about this book, though I never exactly knew what it was all about. After reading it, I am very satisfied. It contains a mix of humour and science fiction that I haven't encountered in past novels. It brought up several theories that made me think, including the impossible being the possible. This is a very entertaining book and easy to read. The plot is very easy to follow and the author wrote it in such a way that it is easy for an average joe to understand what is happening in the story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is still one of my favorites. I LOVE Douglas Adams. After I read this one I had to read all of the other ones in the series, and I wish there were more.

Bring your towel and travel with Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect when they have to hitch a ride with Volgans to get off of Earth before it is demolished for a galaxy bypass. This small Guide to the galaxy, wiht it's reassuring, Don't Panic, is so cool you want it. As you meet more characters like AWESOME Zaphod Beelbrox, Trillion (she's way cool), and Marvin (I think he's funny, no matter how annoying they find him) you become drawn into the story and have to finish the series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"At first it all makes sense, then it doesn't; after that it becomes adsurd; all the while maintaining your complete devotion.

The reader is a voyeur in their struggle to survive and beat the odds.Besides being very entertaining and compelling, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy also skews the lenses that you see life through. Among other things; rats, the earth, and dinosaurs are given new realities. Read this book, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love the sarcasim focused on our global society. Though this book is based on British standards, it hits spot on where ever you are. I could not put the book down. When I finished, and wanted more, there it was, book two. The whole series pokes fun at our society, and moral standards. I say keep it up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...about this book since I heard so much about it from other people. I finally got the time to read a novel, so I decided to give it a try, and it turns out that was a great decision. This may be the best piece of fiction I have ever read. The creativity was outstanding. I would not classify this book as humor, although there is quite a bit of it there. I think of the book as more of a mind stetch. The book is not to be taken seriously, and because of this and the humor contained, Adams is capable of creating text that is unlike any other I have read. This book is just pure enjoyment to read, like candy for the lighter side of the brain. I highly recommend starting with this book first, and then continue with the series (many people start with one of the later books). I doubt you will be disappointed (unless you dislike unusually creative fiction)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is incredible! I've read it (and the following books)over and over again for almost four years, and I just like it more. This absurd book is about Arthur Dent, a normal, thirty years old man who by mistake end up in a spaceship with a man (well, alien) named after a car and a cronically depressed robot. I really recommend this book, it's great!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent, a thirty years old man you'll find easy to identify with, gets bugged this Thursday morning by the council's willing to knock his house down to build a bypass. This is how the book starts. When it is about to end a mere hundred pages later, you find yourself having hitchhiked all around the fancy places of the galaxy, and discovered at just about the other end of it that you don't in fact belong to the most intelligent species on earth but ranks only third and that earth itself isn't just this charming little blue planet it wants to appear to be. It'll take seven and a half million years, but yeah, you'll eventually learn the meaning of life too, though you won't like it. This, of course, doesn't account for all the fun of the travel, say, in the improbability drive or at the place where they make planets.A fantastic journey in humour and the unforeseen. Now a classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book, and indeed all 5 books in the series, iswounderfull. I will accnolage that the final ook is not really up to the standerd of the others. These books will appeal to you if you like science fiction, comedy, or just good books. The charactors are funny, and the books full of odd humor. I should mention that of all the people I know who have read this ook, there has never been on who did no like it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was originally a radio program, or rather half of it -- &quot;Restaurant&quot; was the second half. The two really need to be read one immediately after the other to form the complete story.Science fiction doesn't get any funnier. Truly, the universe is far, far more bizarre than any man could imagine. Arthur's plight will reassure you that no matter how troublesome things may seem to you, there's always someone out there who's got it *lots* worse -- even if you think the improbability of it is infinite. :-)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a classic and hilarious book. My only complaints are that it is hard to get into in the beginning. Also, the end isn't that satisfying. I don't know why he didn't try to wrap up the ending a little more rather than making a sequal blindingly obvious. I can't wait to read the next as soon as I get some free time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book supplies the best usage of human thought that has ever been recorded on paper. Everyone I have ever recommended it to has loved it with a passion. Curious about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? Curious about why the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have is a towel? Well, READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"All of Douglas Adam's books are witty while maintaining a stoicism that can only be attributable to the alien characters peppering the plot (or humorous lack thereof). The Guide is only the beginning of a four part trilogy that delves deeper and deeper into the depths of what actually is so darn funny about anything and everything. It pokes fun at every civil service you can think of, and for those of us completely annoyed with red tape, it is so ludicrous its hysterical. I can never put it down once I pick it up!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This series is the most rereadable series ever (well ok maybe tied with some of RAH's books), i've read it five times and listened to the books on tape about 50 times (enough to wear out the tapes) every time i catch something new. if you read this book you must immediatly get every sequel or the book will only be the best book you've ever read and not by far the best. PS if there really is a movie coming out i will personally kill everyone reponsable if they somehow manage not to make it the greatest movie ever."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If your one of those people that thinks that the human race isn't as smart as we appear to be, then this book is for you. This is definitely one of the funniest books out there"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I thought it was a spectacular book! It was hilariously funny and had rolling on the ground. Who ever thought that earth was a computer built by mice?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is great. The plot is good, the setting is neat, and everything's cool. The only one thing i have against it is that it gets very confusing. Not only does the plaot jump around, there are things that make no sense what so ever. But other than that, it's great. I would suggest anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the best books you will ever read. A story that begins with the demolition of Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass leaving only two survivors; Arthur Dent and Trillian. Ford Prefect, the man who rescued Arthur, manages to get himself and Arthur on board one of the ships that destroyed Earth, only to be thrown into the great vacuum of space by the owners of the constructor fleet. They are then rescued after 29 seconds at an improbability level of 277,709 to one aginst by the Starship Hull of Gold containing Zaphod Beeblebrox (the only man known to have terminated his role as galactic president by stealing a ship he was meant to be launching!) and .....Trillian. The two earthlings and two aliens then commence on a series of adventures that you have to read the book to find out about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think that this book is wonderful. They way D.Adams can describe things that don't even exist with such detail is great, and he has a huge imagination. I hope many others can enjoy what I have."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never have I read a book that brought to mind so many different things at once. The Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything (which happens to be 42) really gets one thinking. I absolutely could not put this book down! A page didn't go by in which I didn't find myself laughing out loud."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This Book is one of the most facinating books of all time. I have read it now six times and it is still just as funny as the first time. I think that it should be reguired reading for school students. It is a non stop thrill ride that is better than any other book written in history"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, went home and read the whole thing without putting it down. Then I had some lunch, and then I grabbed the Guide and read it again, laughing just as much as I did the first time. This book is a phenomenon, pure and simple."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is your typical Londoner. He has a house, a job, and heads out to the local pub on a regular basis. Ford Prefect, is not your typical Londoner. He is an inter-galactic hitchhiker who stopped off for a quick stop on Earth and found himself stranded there for 15 years. But now he's off again and he's decided that rather then let his friend Arthur blow up with the rest of Earth as it's demolished to make way for a freeway, to take him along for the ride. What happens next is enough to blow Arthur's mind, which he very nearly looses while ldiscovering the Answer to Everything.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an amusing little book but it's not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. The characters lacked any real depth, the plot was practically non-existant, and the conclusion came very abrubtly as if it shouldn't have ended when it did. I seriously have to question it's consideration as one of the best books written or it's inclusion as one of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.At 224 pages it should have been a quick diversion, but for me it was anything but. It took me two weeks to complete and a full week to get even 80 pages in. I will likely read the follow-up books eventually as I can't leave a series I've begun uncomplete, but I doubt I'll be doing so anytime soon."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],S={key:0},j={key:1};function E(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(e(),w(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",S,"See more"))],8,D)):b("",!0)])}const q=d(H,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a36960fe"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/44.md","filePath":"quotes/44.md"}'),M={name:"quotes/44.md"},F=Object.assign(M,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{P as __pageData,F as default};
