It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it.

So the item loses a star for being incomplete"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book speaks to every romantic. It's written beautifully in the classic language that every man and woman speaks while in the throes of the mating game. I read this book at least yearly to remind myself of not only the gloriously beautiful fluent English language and wit of Miss Bennett, but the always refreshing humility, which this book's title fails to mention. It is truly a beautiful piece of romantic literature. The sensual / sexual tension between Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy is something I never tire of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great text but the reader struggles with male voices. They sound \\"fake\\" and interfere with listening"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is a great book for anyone who has never been in love. it emphasizes the fact that first impressions are not always the correct ones or the best ones. you need to get to know someone before forming an opinion. plus jane austen is amusing and witty and insightful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This Jane Austen novel is fantastic. The characters are very real and the period well represented. It is also funny. I could not put it down once I started and at the end, I just went back and re-read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am reading this book all over again for the, hmm, I really have lost count - let's just say the umpteenth time. Reading it was supposed to be a \\"filler\\" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach \\"The End\\" again.This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of all of Austen's novels, and I've read them all, Pride and Prejudice stands out to me as the most dynamic. The characters are richly developed and the plot woven skillfully in and out of the quirks of society. This book can be boring and tedious to read if you let it, but with a little imagination and an enjoyment of the language it can take flight and transform. I have read the book five or six times and studied it in an English analysis class, and each time I find something new to discover and relish in Austen's witty commentary. Read it once for the plot, then read it again for the social critisism, and it will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore. But as I got into the book (which didn't take very long) I found a REALLY great novel.The plot is amazing, it's one of those books that make you think about it when your done.I have read alot of romance novels in my life and this is by far the best one.I also think this book gives an important message: You should get to know a person before you jugde them because for all you know they could be your true love.If you are looking for something a little more than just a silly romance. Look no further than Pride and Predjudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever. Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the \`classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely adored the movie Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley. I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle. Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written. I'd recommend you watch the movie first and then you will have something to compare this to.

Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"~3.5/5[Also available on my blog.]I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book.

We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be.

Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man. Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth. More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite. We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her. She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham. The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes. I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And that says a lot! Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household. She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind. However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge. Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood. Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth. Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him. Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!). Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!). Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed. Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane). The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining. Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh. It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going. Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned. Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley. It is perphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is. I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice. Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. It gave me wonderful insight into old England and early authors. But what makes me give this book 5 stars is the fact that it was truly enjoyable. Pride and Predjudice can easily be called a vintage classic but also a modern classic. The book is easy to relate to on certain issues, let alone very amusing some times. READ THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I started to read this book for AP English expecting another dry, boring, and hopelessly long novel. However, I was soon pleasantly surprised to find that I was absolutely enthralled in it. It has a timeless plot involving the survival of love when experienced by two different people, each in a very different social status. The utilization of wit and sophisticated humor along with an intricate plot kept me fascinated with the subject matter the entire time. Jane Austen is indeed a wonderful author who's witty and exciting plot will most likely more than keep your interest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book ever. I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters. You begin to relate to their fears and desires. It takes great story telling to bring characters to life. Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An amazing book! I thought this was one of those &quot;girly-girl&quot; books that was mushy and stupid. Yet this isn't some Harlequin romance. In fact, it pertains equally to both genders. Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy, the characters are amazingly created by Jane Austen. A wonderful book, definitely worth the time and effort spent trying to understand it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"...I also strongly recommend that an interested reader try listening to the audio version of this novel. If you think the prose of Austen dry, I assure you that you will find a good reading of it a revelation indeed. Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet. The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn. However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped. Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected. However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said. I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon. ...If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had never read the book, though I had seen the movie many times.

I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable. Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive. The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored. Everyone should have this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved it.

Drawing on the universal topic of love and marraige, Jane Austen's most \\"sparkling\\" work addresses the role in society of women, social/class differences, and well...pride and prejudice...with scintillating wit. Producing two of literature's most loved protagonists, the witty Elizabeth Bennet and haughty Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice remains a joy to read. Having inspired books and movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary, P&P is one of the must-reads of English literature!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A beautiful novel. You can not find better writing than in this book. The words flow together so beautifully. While the romance is barely tangiable throughout the book, it still feels overwhelmingly strong. Proof that less can be more. I am thoroughly impressed with Jane Austen's writing style and only wish we would all speak in such a poetic tone.I have stated the obvious about such a wonderful classic, but this, by far, is my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best novels I have ever read. Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love, money and the importance of family life. She does this through the narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett. Through the love and devotion to her eldest sister we see Elizabeth at her best fighting for the interests of her family and connections. A wonderful novel of two sisters and their struggle for true love in a society with pecuniary worries and stations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is certainly a great love story and will survive for generations.I would like to point out something. Perhaps some British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet. The latter group had less money and social status. Is this the reason ?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today? Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again. It's funny, it's smart, it's romantic, and Elizabeth Bennett is my all-time favorite fictional heroine. You can read this book when you're 16 and every ten years after that. All of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal library. It's also proof that a book can have sizzle without any explicit sex."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time. Jane Austen writes with impeccable wit and creates characters who are likeable, laughable, and very real. Pride and Prejudice is an absolute delight, Jane Austen at her best. Read it. If you are anything like me, you will be in heaven."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this novel several times, peeling away the layers looking for new meaning. As someone else stated earlier, P&amp;P is not Austen's deepest work; however, it still contains many levels of meaning. Superficially, there is the charming and *credible* romance. As one digs deeper, one can find lessons on how to read properly (as Elizabeth learns) as well as the layout of a new meritocracy based not on rank, but taste and intelligence. This is not a bland love story, but a quiet, faintly smiling attack on pride, tastelessness, vanity, prejudice and obliviousness. The portrayals of Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh are masterpieces of sweet viciousness.Overall, Austen's late 18th century (*not* Victorian) work is a lovely balance of comedy and commentary, romance and drama. Fun, witty, but not swoony or saccharine, Pride &amp; Prejudice should please all but the most proud &amp; prejudiced reader (or the utterly unintelligent), for it is a charming novel, near to perfection."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW AND EVERY TIME I NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND GET MORE OUT OF IT.

JANE AUSTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY NOW AND AGAIN PICKING FUN AT THE IDEAS OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY ON COURTSHIP AND MARRIDGE AND MANY TIMES AT THE CHARACTERS SHE INVENTS. SHE ALSO MAKES MANY OF HER CHARACTERS REALISTIC AND WRITES HER BOOK COMPASSIONATELY SHOWING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLES EMOTIONS AND THEIR OWN OPINIONS.

Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice. I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an excellent book!!!! The genre is British Romance/ Realistic Fiction. This story is about a girl Lizzy ,(or Elizabeth), who had a \\"poorer\\" family who was very prejudice against Mr.Darcy who was very wealthy.The five Bennet sisters - Lizzie,Jane,Lydia,Mary and Kitty - have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures...and keeping the family name \\"strong.\\"However, the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her father.Mr. Darcy ,on the other hand, lived a life of luxury with his little sister,(age 15). Mr.Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingly's sister were very prideful of themselves.Mr. Bingly fell in love with Lizzy's oldest sister,Jane, and Mr.Bingly's sister fell in love with Mr. Darcy. And Mr.Darcy fell in love with Lizzy but he was to prideful to admit it.When the good-natured Mr Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr Darcy.It is a book about British \\"classes\\" (or ranks) in government and also society : (people were treated differently because of their \\"class\\". Many people who were poor could not even skeak or even stay in the same room with the \\"rich and famous\\" in the 1800's. It is a great peice of English literature.Each family was very close..most of the time. Lizzy's family for example, was all about marrage to a wealthy man or the family name. Mr.Darcy's \\"family\\" was more of just him and his sister who were very close. Lizzy acted the same toward everyone and \\"full of life!\\" but Mr.Darcy was only truely happy with his little sister and later, Elizabeth. Otherwise he would not dance at balls (unless he danced with Lizzy) and he hardly even laughed.In the end,(without giving it away), Mr.Darcy AND Lizzy had a differnet perspective of life and family. And, each family gets a benefit.--Jane Austen is an excellent author. She has written may books before but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would have to be my favorite!--"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"pride and prejudice seems boring if you merely scan it, but if you read every detail then you'll find that it is a very witty, interesting, funny book. many things happen in this novel and you'll learn.this book may be confusing if you don't understand these old english expressions. i luckily knew some of them and learned the rest.pride and prejudice takes you into the world of the aristocracy in Enlgland in the early nineteenth century. You'll learn about matchmaking schemes and what was most important for a woman (marriage, of course) and how people treated their own family. I'm not talking cruelty or anything, but about pride. For ex. Mr. Darcy likes Elizabeth, but doesn't want to, since she's below his class. When Elizabeth's siter Lydia runs off with a guy their father almost disowns her in his anger. It may seem like a cruel and heartless thing to do, but when you read it, it almost seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. women married for money and position, rarely for love. daughters were expected to obey their parents' wishes. Pride and Prejudice shows you all of this.this story takes place in England in around the early nineteenth century. here, in the upper-middle/lower first class is Mr. Bennet, a sarcastic, quiet man, his rather foolish wife, and their five daughters. Jane, the eldest, is the most kindest and prettiest. She's a goody-goody but you like her anyway, since she's also sensible. Elizabeth is the second eldest; the main character and also the wittiest and cleverest of her sisters. Mary is the quietest and most accomplished; she spends her time studying and you hear least of her in this story except when she's making some clever observation on pride or virtues from her studies.. Catherine, also called Kitty, is next, and then Lydia. They're both foolish, flirtatious, empty-headed girls who spend most of their time going to town so they can flirt with officers in the militia.enter Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. They're best friends, both rich young men, both really handsome, both bachelors. only difference is that people hate Mr. darcy, as he's a proud, indifferent man who hates to dance and critizizes things. Mr. Bingley on the other hand is charming and amiable, loves to dance and admires Jane a lot. of course Mrs. Bennet starts scheming. She hates Mr. Darcy though, since at the beginning of the book, Mr. Darcy is heard telling Mr. Bingley at a ball that Elizabeth is not handsome enough for him to go off and dance with. Elizabeth is actually very pretty, as Jane Austen puts it, but nevertheless Mr. Darcy is a picky person. Elizabeth doesn't like Mr. Darcy's personality too much herself. they seem to be destined to scorn and be critical of each other only unfortunately for Elizabeth Mr. Darcy starts to fall head over heels for her after being stunned by Elizabeth's playfully bold, unique personality.of course they don't get married at once, otherwise this would be a very short novel. neither do jane and mr. bingley. The happy endings are delayed as a result from pride and prejudice. After all, Mrs. bennet isn't the only one who schemes. everybody does, from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte to Mr. Bingley's sister.this was a fabulous book and i definitely reccomend it. it depends on the reader's reading level, though."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the book that I chose for my amazon.com report. I liked the book a lot more then I expected myself to. I think that it is a book that should be required to be read in one point or another in the sixth grade. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, New American Library, 1989. I gave the book a five star rating because it teaches you what love is and what it was like for the people back then. For them to fall in love with one another and have all the regulations and rules. It was probably hard for them. Everywhere in this book is love. Whether it is from mother to father or from daughter to mother or father.In this book a family of seven welcomes Mr. Darcy. He is a very rich and hasome man. Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet try constantly to get one of his five daughters to marry Mr. Darcy, but Elizabeth has other plans. For she is in love with Mr. Wickham. It turns out that Mr.Wickham is in love with Elizabeth. They begin dating and cannot stand a single day without each other, so they decide that they should get married and soon they become engaged. But then Elizabeth realizes that she does not love him anymore. She soon comes to a conclusion of why. She loves Mr. Collins.I am not going to give away a good ending because it is so exciting, but they all live happily ever after. Meanwhile Mr. Darcy is having trouble choosing who to marry. I will not spill the beans on who he decides to marry because I would write too much and then it might give all of it away. The other three girls do find their true love and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are happy because their daughters are happy.My opinion of this book is wonderful and outrageous. I think that this book is just like Jane Austen said, \\" it is like your own darling child.\\" Her version of this book has made me want to read more of her books because I think that they will be somewhat like Pride and Prejudice but I would never know till I read another one of her books. I also agree with the old saying, \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" because I picked up this book and said, \\"This does not look like something I would want to read.\\" I read it and said, \\"WOW! This was a really excellent book.\\"I think that the theme is a very important thing when you are trying to rate a book because basically it is what the book taught you about life. So the theme for Pride and Prejudice was that no matter how much you love someone you can't possibly be satisfied unless they love you back, and that love has no boundries. You can love someone and they can love you but you will still love that person no matter what happens. Even if that person leaves or passes away you will still love but you won't know it because it is just from the bottom of your heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,\\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Appropriate for children, this book has excitement, history, and christian thinking in the ways of social behavior.

But I've always wondered about the \\"songs\\" (Chapter 6) that Lizzy performs before giving way to her dull sister Mary. Was she really singing? I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791. Emilia Fadini plays these pieces on an English c. 1800 repro piano with some fire--I can easily imagine Elizabeth wowing Darcy and the crowd with K 381 (track #3).

The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character. In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy. His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride. On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot. The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments. The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers? Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness. The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel. Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor. This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style. To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago. When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times. Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one. That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn. This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him. With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane. Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting. In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice. This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature. Austen has amazing characters and a wonderful insight into the era. Every English speaker should read this book at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every; five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett. They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And the Penguin editions are always the nicest!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice takes place in a small village called Hertfordshire, around the late 18th century. The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read.

I suggest that no civilized person can read these without a smile and a committment to finish the piece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of all of Austen's works, this is her most polished and important accomplishment. Pride and Prejudice masterfully blends excellent humor with a very strong social critique of many of the follies and vices of her times. Within its pages, the reader will find characters that are loveable, and characters that he will love to hate. The ending, while typical of a romance, is brought to its conclusion through the effects of a very tightly spun plot.

My &quot;great thoughts&quot; coming out of the novel were only &quot;I'm glad Darcy and Elizabeth fell in love&quot; and &quot;Gee, I hate Lydia&quot;. Don't misunderstand me.

The characters are phenominal. I don't think Jane Austen missed a single type of person, or disposition in her novel. As you learn of her characters and begin to relate to them you will run the emotional gamet. From anger to tears this book will take you into the perspective of multiple people.

It is a beautifully written, carefully crafted story of an English family with five daughters, and they may be on the verge of losing their home and means of support. The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring person. She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them, at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. That the daughters must marry due to their impending financial situation is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be? What makes Mr. Right, Mr. Right? How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone else but her? With all the social customs and duties is it possible that two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry?

They are completly wrong for each other, or so they think. Mr. Darcy has too much pride, he thinks he deserves the best of everything, including women. Elizabeth Bennet is prejudiced against him; she believes the gossip she hears about him. Who would ever think the two could ever get along, much less fall in love with each other! Meanwhile, Elizabeth's sisters try desperately to find the men of their dreams. I started reading this book a little timid. My mom told me that I just had to read it because it was a classic, but mainly because she read it and loved it when she was my age. So I had my doubts; my mom and I have different tastes in books, and I didn't trust her opinion much. I started reading it because I didn't have much time before I had to finish my book report. I found I loved the book more than I imagined I would. This story is romantic; it leads you in and out of the complicated minds of the Bennet family. Through the hearts of the many men the Bennet girls tend to take lightly. Then into the souls of two lovers destined to be together."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although I am only half-way through this book, I am finding it very interesting. It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story! So far, it is very enjoyable, and is teaching me a lot about that time period--what it was like for women in England then. I suggest you read it! Even if you feel that you are a little young. I am 15, I read a lot, and perhaps I'm not understanding everything, but it is enjoyable nontheless!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go. If you have never read this book, YOU MUST!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favourite book of all time. Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful; the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks off!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot express in words how much I loved this novel! Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye.

Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them. This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature. More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages. It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story. The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family. Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen. Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners. When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing. Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time. The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks. It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process. The book is an excellent example of a satire. The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am ashamed to admit it, but, yes, I have been reading for over 25 years and this is the very first time that I have ever read Jane Austen. None of her novels were required in high school, no literature class that I took in college used any as a text, and I had never thought to pursue her for sheer entertainment. It is quite sad, actually, for I find Austen much more accessible than some of the classic that I did have to wade through, including Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter. Austen has recently seen a resurgence in popularity, likely due to the recent BBC and Hollywood adaptations of her books, including the Emma Thompson vehicle Sense and Sensibility.Pride and Prejudice was Austen's second novel, following the success of Sense and Sensibility. Its original title was--and I'm not making this up a la Dave Barry--First Impressions. To my taste, this would have been a much more apt title, but it had been used by another author before Austen could get this book in print. The story is about the five Bennet sisters, who, while not orphaned or penniless, have few choices as to husbands because their father's estate is entailed on a male heir, and they have no brother. The father seems to have resigned them to their fate, but their mother wastes no opportunity to arrange a good match for her daughters. The two oldest--Jane and Elizabeth--are level-headed and quite understand the position that they are in, but the youngest three are flirtatious and giddy, a bad combination in winning society's eye. Disasters ensue when eligible bachelors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to town, as well as the officers of the ---shire regiment.The reason First Impressions would have been a better title is that each character--not just the main two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy--is constantly assuming things about other characters based on their initial reception of them. Mr. Darcy, in the country, is too proud to dance with any of the young women because of his mistaken impression that they are all declasse; Elizabeth forms her prejudices about Mr. Darcy because of her first meeting with him and this dance snub. The townsfolk think the best of Mr. Wickham because his first impression on everyone is quite favorable. And on and on and on.Very interesting, but it goes on forever, as the characters can never be quite direct given the mores of the time. That does not mean that they can not be insulting, as a particularly vicious exchange between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth shows. I'm glad that I have now broken my Austen fast, but I think that I can wait awhile before digesting any more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet girls are having a problem with primogeniture. They feel that it isnt fair that the first male in the family gets to inherit the estate after Mr.Bennet has passed away. Since there are five girls and no men there cousin Mr.Collin's gets to inherit the estate. Mrs.Bennet takes it apon herself to find gossip on all the men in the town that are making a reasonable amout of money and hook them up with one of her daughters. This continues on thoughout the movie. Mrs.Bennet and all of the Bennet daughters get tangled up with all of the gossip and mishap,and this complicates everyones lives.Towards the middle of the movie one of the Bennet daughters(Jane) gets introduced to one of the wealthies men in the town, his name is Mr.Charles Bingley. Mr. Bingley has his eye set on her and they begin to like each other. Mr.Bingley's best friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy also takes a liking for one on the Bennet daughters(lizzy). Mr.Darcy is hard headed and does not show his liking for lizzy at first. He is rude and does not show much respect for her, in lizzy's eyes. Mr.Darcy is jelous of something and tries to break Mr.Bingly and Jane up. This creates lizzy to have more dislike for Mr.Darcy.The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were very perfect. They understood and comprehended what they had to do and did the job quite perfectly. I really admired how well the plot and characters where chosen. The scene designers and director chose the perfect places to shot the movie. I liked how the two wealthies men's estates in Pemberly and Netherfield Park were placed. This made it seem very realistic. I would defintley recommend this movie to others. It kept you wondering thoughtout the whole movie whether or not Mr.Darcy and lizzy , and Mr.Bingly and jane were going to get together. I feel it was more a chick flick,but would also suggest it to males as well. It might teach them a thing or two on how to approace a woman, and make them feel wanted and loved dispite what others say.Throughout this movie &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a really wonderful message. I feel the message was not to give up hope and try to persue your dreams. If something was ment to be it will always work out at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My sister's been raving about this book for years. It's not until months ago did I have the guts to pick it up. It's been sitting in my mini-library since I got it too... Then my sister once again kept asking &quot;Have you read 'it' yet?&quot; So, to stop this question from coming up in every turn, I decided to read it. I honestly expected this book to bore me to death considering the author is from the late 17th century. What fun could a writer be of that time, huh? Oh not to mention, the author was unmarried. What does she know about romance, right? Well, I was mistaken. I enjoyed this book sooo much, I ordered the DVD movie of it. There was some &quot;slow&quot; moments in this book however, I think it's the over-description of everything. But once you got through that, the book flows with lots of humor and intensity. I liked Elizabeth from the start. Mr. Darcy was kindda hard to like in the beginning but as soon as the book progress, you would love him and would want him for your own :-) The Dialogue in this book was my favorite of all. Uppity, Humorous, Lyrical, Heart warmer and truly of its time.I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and I honestly think most of the ideas and formulas (marriage mart) were derived from this book (did i dare say that?). I couldn't believe this book was actually written at that time period. Amazing! Truly Classic at its best."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE was the first Jane Austen novel I read. I'm currently working on SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.

I definitely recommend it, though."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit, I saw the mini-series before I read the book, but the book was still good. Jane Austen is a wonderful storyteller.

How is it possible that this adorable, timeless love story is now almost 200 years old? I read this book while in high school and could not admit to anyone how much I loved it. There weren't a lot of Jane Austen book clubs for high school boys back then and white-bread suburbia did not lend itself to those types of disclosures. However, reading it and EMMA and JANE EYRE and Dickens spoiled me forever for good storytelling. To this day, I am drawn to novels of eternal themes: love, sex, family and friends. I don't mean to trivialize Jane Austen with my pithy Candace Bushnell nod, but Pride and Prejudice has all of the intrigue and sex and love of Sex and the City--we just can't see it.

I could read it a million times and I cannot stress it enough for you to buy this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, written by Jane Austen, is an amazing work on the nature of love. Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society. Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect. She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline. Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed. Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit. These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley. Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy. He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins. These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society. Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another. Is this a battle that the heart can win?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel. The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book. I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it. The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was. I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing.

I find this book has a romanticism about it and when you read the book, you feel a longing to be back in the period where men where gallant and women were graceful.

What would you do when an attractive, rich man moved in next door and fell in love with your older sister (who is the most beautiful and eligible woman in the surrounding countryside)? You would be happy for her and you would do everything you could to help her marry the man she loves...and you'd be pretty upset if his best friend stepped in and talked him into not being in love with your sister and thus removed your sister's chance at happiness and an improved situation in life. Then what if your socially inept, silly, pedantic cousin asked you to marry him after you had only known him three days? Oh--then what would you do if he proposed to your best friend the day after you refused him, and she accepted?! To top it off, what if the same person who took away the love of your sister's life fell in love with you and asked you to marry him?!Well, that is Miss Elizabeth Bennett's position at the outset of this hilarious and endearing novel which details a year in the life of a genteel English family and their neighbors. During the course of the novel, three proposals of marriage are made to Miss Elizabeth; one proposal is made to Jane (the eldest Miss Bennett); and their youngest sister (who is only sixteen) elopes with an English Army officer who has a worse reputation with the ladies than Wilt Chamberlin. Jane Austen is a masterful storyteller who is able to sketch characters through a plot that is never quite what the reader expects.

One can learn a great deal about oneself by reading this book as it examines the complexities of human relationships and emotions still valid today, almost 200 years after it was written. Other priceless titles by Austen that rate a '10' are Emma and Mansfield Park. Don't miss them, you'll kick yourself if you do"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice isn't Jane Austen's most popular novel for nothing. The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages. Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters. Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight. What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other. Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy. However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration. Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her. As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\" Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by. Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more. You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.Pride and Prejudice is an essential classic for teen and adult readers alike. It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships. Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\" I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality.

To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am.

I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others.

It's a wonderful classic with just the right amount of everything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title. Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story. It starts out with the Bennet family. Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off. When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months. Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself). Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met. But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language. It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood. What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved. Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand. Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England. Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic. I also liked how the book was very decent. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes. For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance. All in all, I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters. It doesn't suprise me that she is able to write such a wonderful novel as Pride & Prejudice.It is a story of a young woman named Elizabeth Bennet ,a.k.a. Lizzy, who has a great dislike for a handsome and rich man called Mr. Darcy. The story takes Elizabeth through twists and turns and some how she ends up in love with Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've watched the movie a few times and read the book twice, and I'm still as excited as the first time I read it! The characters are awesome, and I feel my heart all aflutter just like Elizabeth's when she finds herself in love with Mr. Darcy....*sigh*.A classic that can really never go out of style."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I think Jane Austen wrote a very good novel. I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness. She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives. All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; for a high school english class...but i immediately fell in love with it...it has everything from love, humor, stereotypes, and anything else bundles into one heartfelt, lovely story. If you like anything dealing with romance, this book is a must read. I recommend it to people of all ages, races, genders because it truly emits a universal message!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I have read it so much that the cover is worn. The BBC movie version was almost as great at the book and very very close to the accuracy of the book. I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice. You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few. She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a new Amazon user.

While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to go to the library and take out the book after seeing the movie a few weeks ago. The movie was good but the book is so much better. It was well written, funny and everything you can expect from a good novel. Definitely a must read even if it is not required for class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you only read one Jane Austen book, this is the one to pick. But if like the rest of us, you find something so completely witty and enjoyable in Pride and Prejudice, you'll pick up the rest of her books and read them all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies, while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride. Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots. You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems. You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles. The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's finest novel and one must assume that the author identifies rather strongly with the female protagonist. The book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. The novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\"The present novel is about a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who comes from an upper middle class family living in rural England. She has four sisters plus an interesting mother and a wise but witty father. The novel follows the romances and complications of the Bennet girls, especially Elizabeth and her sister Jane. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read..Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work and it is one of the most delightful and pleasant reads. One must conclude that the very intelligent and witty Elizabeth character is a reflection of the author herself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years. I can think of at least a dozzen books and movies made within the past couple of decades which attempt to rehash this untopable novel. I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book . I heartily recomend this work to the romantics in this world, and all others who just want a timeless storyin which love, honour and to some extent vulnerability trample the strictist rigitity of class, snobbery and aloofness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's finest work is, in my humble opinion, \\"Emma\\". This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind. This, my second Austen, is perhaps the best to get anyone interested in Austen's style of writing. But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This plot was definitely fit for me. I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go. This book was like that for me. I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot. I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details. Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most. &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20). I also love all of the characters in her novel. For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them. I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends. My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth. She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent. She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs. I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her. I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need to learn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it. A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's strength. &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing. It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot; &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style. She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down. Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly. I felt smart just reading her book. It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century. It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one futurein life, and that was getting married and raising a family."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English. However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century. This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee. The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets. Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him. His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income. A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written. Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else. It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men. If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit. All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND. Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits. Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men. As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about. This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite. In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco. What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment. If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.The story:A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together. Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.The language:It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.cheersmichelle (2002)******UPDATE********So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I dont know what shall I say about it, I am in love with this book.

Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the story and all of the characters were so relatable. My favorite though was Mr. Bennett. He was hilarious with his sarcasm and dry humor."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels. Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing. I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am trying to read more classics because I never really paid attention to them in high school. I started reading this one and at first I was having a hard time getting into it, it is a bit slow. But by the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. Terrific love story, literature at its finest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There aren't too many books that I absolutely never get tired of reading, but this is definitely one of them. Fabulous characters and the perfect romance. Even though it's become a bit cliche with all of the take-offs on the market right now, I will always love this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.This was a very enjoyable book. It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations. It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used. There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read. But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark. In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be. Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book. I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels onThe Well-Educated Mind's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is considered a classic for a reason. Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them. Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions.

I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading. I am SO glad I did, after a while I could not put it down.This book has just about everything- satire, reflections on women in society and family, wit, humor, romance, irony, constantly twisting and turning with surprises... the list goes on. Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice. It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner.

Elizabeth Bennett is one of my personal heroes, and Darcy is an excellent match for her.The first time I read it--when I was 17--I was keenly aware of the brilliant comedy in the book. As I re-read it again and again over the years, it still makes me laugh, but it also makes me think of Jane Austen herself, and how a woman whose life was so circumscribed by her circumstances could manage to create such an astonishing array of characters, with such depth.Don't miss it. And for goodness sake, DON'T CALL IT A ROMANCE! It's a comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I like to read and I try to catch up on the classics.

I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight.

Not only is the main plot excellent, but secondary characters such as the droll Mr. Collins and the imperious Lady Catherine are real gems. This whole novel is well worth taking the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've read this book. I keep it permanently on my nightshelf and will often just read a few pages whenever I feel overwhelmed by uncivilised people (like after my evening commute sometimes...).

So well cast &amp; produced you are able to focus on the story &amp; not be distracted by production issues (e.g. &quot;THAT's different from the book...&quot;). My ultimate test for the relevance of a story is how many lines I plagiarize from it to use in normal conversation, and this story has some classics. My favorite is &quot;I am most seriously displeased.&quot;My husband has a new cliche: &quot;what's better than one wedding at the end of a jane austen story?

It takes place in 18th Century, Longbourn, England. The two main characters of this book are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story they do not get along at all. I think that the antagonist of this story is Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This story is about the interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They have several encounters throughout the book and some of them weren't so friendly. Elizabeth is witty and sarcastic, while Mr. Darcy is perceived as proud and arrogant. This book is about the both of them learning to overcome their differences and falling in love somewhere in the middle.I really like the way Jane Austen writes, it is very descriptive and you can see a clear picture in your head of exactly what she's saying. She starts out with her main character and you know exactly who they are and where they're coming from. But then you get to read and see how they change throughout the story. I think that the theme of this story is to look from other people's perspectives and not be so centered on yourself and you might be surprised what you find. When I was first assigned to read a classic I wasn't thrilled, but then as I got reading I came to find that I really loved this book and now it's probably one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"That was a very interesting audio book - I had never read the book and now I know."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice has turned out to be my favorite book when it comes to romance novels...and that's saying something since I'm a 21 year old who reads ALOT.Elizabeth Bennet is such a smart and kind, yet of course flawed heroine, that I felt like I actually got to know her. Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.Learned from this.

If one posesses that taste they can not doubt that Pride & Prejudice is her best work.-VCH"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"I'm going to be honest. This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202. If you're reading to see Victorian society laid out on a surgical table and diced with style, it starts at page 1.4/5 for Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Published in 1817, twenty years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, this novel allows the reader to travel through time to a bygone era where the pace of life was much, much slower than what we experience today. News came only through the mail or newspapers; travel was by horse-drawn coach. Listening to this work is thus a truly refreshing experience.In addition, the main characters, the Bennett sisters, have limited interests. With no educational, professional or political concerns, their only concern is to get married, what will guarantee their future social and financial status. They lead simple, sheltered lives and apparently have no notion of the work and efforts put in by servantsto produce dinners, balls, gowns, etc.The writing style is congruent with the times. The work itself is very long, meticulously written with very slow, restricted action.The audio book's narrator is truly excellent and succeeds, while remaining unaffected, to add dramatic interest by very astutely modifying her voice for each character.All in all, this novel is heartily recommended for a worthwhile escape from our hectic 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is amazing and perfect for anyone just being introduced to Austen.

It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it. A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What could I possibly say about Jane Austen's most famous novel that hasn't already been said? Even those who haven't read it surely know the name Mr Darcy, and how he's the romantic ideal of every housewife around the world. Everyone knows that he and Elizabeth Bennett are one of the most famous examples of a dislike-at-first-sight acquaintance that gradually matures into mutual respect and understanding, and I'm sure a healthy portion of that generalized \\"everyone\\" also knows that the novel also contains Austen's requisite commentary on class, marriage, wealth and families. Witty, self-deprecating Elizabeth is one of the most beloved heroines of all times (to this day, I find that I will always like a female protagonist if she reminds me of Elizabeth) and the novel itself begins with what is one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"The true meaning of this line is obvious, and sets the tone for the entire novel: that it is not young men who are on the search for wives, but young women who are in want of eligible husbands, and that it is only society and decorum that dictates that the search should be undertaken by the men. Like all Austen's novels, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, just beginning to find her place in the community and the world, and who is expected by everyone around her to be on the look-out for a husband. Yet this is not the first thing on Elizabeth Bennett's mind - as the second of five sisters, she's more preoccupied with keeping her younger sisters in check and making sure her beloved elder sister Jane is well matched in life. And if it's to a wealthy bachelor, then so much the better! Although reasonably well-off, the Longbourne estate is entailed on a cousin of their father, and so the girls face grim futures if they do not marry well before their father's death.A cynical and sarcastic recluse, Mr Bennett spends most of his time either baiting or avoiding his vacuous wife, whose most pressing concern in life is to marry off her daughters. Her prospects are suddenly promising when news comes that the neighboring estate of Netherfield is being lent out to a young man by the name of Mr Bingley: pleasant, wealthy, and immediately smitten with Jane. However, society is considerably less impressed by Bingley's companion. Mr Darcy is cold, arrogant and snobbish, who, on being invited to dance with Elizabeth, says of her: \\"\\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to him, an attitude that is only enforced when she meets the charismatic Mr Wickham who tells her he was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, and that the present Mr Darcy robbed him of his rightful inheritance as stipulated in his father's will. A further black mark against Darcy is drawn when Elizabeth learns that he (along with Bingley's spiteful sisters) has deliberately forced a wedge between Mr Bingley and Jane, in the attempt to \\"save\\" his friend from a bad match.It is to her utmost astonishment then, when Mr Darcy tells Elizabeth that he's in love with her and proposes marriage. Telling her that he's struggled against his will, reason and character in order to take this action, (and pointing out obvious disadvantages of the match - on his side), Elizabeth is hardly impressed by his assumption that she'll accept him, and takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what she thinks of him.And yet after this disastrous encounter, Elizabeth begins to learn more about her rejected suitor and his circumstances. Perhaps she's been blinded by her own prejudice against him, just as his pride initially made him so un-gentleman-like toward her...One misconception concerning \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the belief that Elizabeth and Darcy are an early example of the \\"belligerent sexual tension\\" clich&eacute;, in which two characters hide their secret attraction to each other by pretending that they dislike each other. This assumption has always bugged me, as it is certainly *not* what is at work here. Austen is not only poking fun at the notion of love at first sight, but more importantly, is riffing the idea that two people would try to hide their passion by pretending that they don't like each other (the foolish Mr Collins believes that Elizabeth deliberately refuses his marriage proposal just because women often pretend to reject their suitors to hid their true feelings). Elizabeth and Darcy are legitimately unimpressed by each other at the start of the novel, but it is their growing understanding and desire to become a better person for the sake of the other that makes up their storylines. Both of them have to change in order to deserve each other: Elizabeth to overcome her prejudice, and Darcy to realize that he \\"has been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\"In a similar vein, it's important to note that Elizabeth - although prejudiced - is not entirely mistaken when it comes to accessing Mr Darcy's character. Although there is more to the Wickham story than meets the eye, her perception of him as arrogant and proud is indeed correct. It is her words to him after his proposal that force Darcy to reassess all that he's learnt in his lifetime; yet when she learns the truth and cries \\"till this moment I never knew myself,\\" we can see just how shaken she is to learn that her judgment is not as infallible as she thought it was.Different readers take different things from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - at its most simplistic, it's a Cinderella story about a worthy young woman who marries the man of her dreams and by doing so elevates her social standing. On a more contextual level, others approach the text as a vigorous satire of the social norms and expectations of Austen's day, in which the desperate hunt for a husband to ensure a woman's future has to be hidden beneath the constraints of civilized society.Although the novel may seem deceptively small in scope and content (in regards to the setting and general theme of marriage) this is a story that explores the depth of human relationships and the need for personal growth; a simple story about complex characters. Though it is not widely thought to be Austen's best novel - that distinction often goes toEmma- whichever way you look at it, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is considered Austen's lightest and most entertaining read, and is certainly her most famous. If you haven't read it yet - what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon. Thank you Amazon! This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.OK. So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon. So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle. It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration. Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :( I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book. If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book. And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper. I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813 in three volumes, the customary presentation of a novel in the early 19th Century. Penguin Press has provided Kindle owners with a wonderful enhanced version of the novel preserving the three volume format without attempting to standardize or modernize the text.The Penguin book is presented by Juliette Wells, Enhanced E-book Features Editor. It is edited with an introduction and informative notes by Vivien Jones. The result is a very readable yet scholarly treatment of the novel, with a biography of Jane Austen, 19th Century reviews of the book, descriptions of how to make tea and Jane Austen's eating habits, and much more.The last time I read Pride and Prejudice was in 1966 in an English literature class in college. I challenged the professor's choice of reading material as completely irrelevant given the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement and protests on my college campus, San Francisco State. It was a pleasure to reread the book with the wisdom of age supplemented by the excellent notes throughout the three volumes. Kindle owners can, with a spin of the wheel and a click, read explanations of the semantics of the vocabulary used by Austen, consider content interpretations, view illustrations of fashion, learn historical dance steps, and see period architecture.The focus of the production, of course, is the novel with its themes of first impressions, pride, vanity, seduction, feminism, prejudice, sexism, fatal attraction, society, intellectual domination, morality, etiquette, marriage, heritability, class structure, the family as a purposeful unit, and personal happiness. I highlighted many passages and notes to read again and enjoy. One example is from Volume 1 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, \\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\\" Another example of my highlights is from Volume 2 when Elizabeth states, \\"The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.\\" And here is an example of an explanatory note I highlighted from Volume 3, \\"e3. Elizabeth's determination here matches her effort throughout the novel to pursue what she considers to be her own happiness; compare her response to Mr. Collin's proposal of marriage in chapter 19.\\" The novel, notes, and other features allow the reader to experience the historical context of the first edition.Before reading Pride and Prejudice, I reread James Joyce's Ulysses on my Kindle with Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated paperback book as a guide. It would have been a better reading experience to have this excellent source integrated with the novel. Penguin's enhanced e-books with built in reference features will be excellent for new publications of classic novels. I learned a great deal more about Austen's novel in the convenient Kindle format than I did 42 years ago in college. Hopefully, I'll be able to add many enhanced Penguin classics to my Kindle Library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming.

It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist? I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive. Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Elizabeth is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Austen respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Austen was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop. I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting. But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like all the other jane austen books i loved this one just as much. jane austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more.elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy intertwined into their own fixed judgements and opinions make this book not just a must read for its witty satire and humour but for its indepth understanding of true love. eliza,prejudiced ....Darcy, too caught up with his high society unfold their true character gradually making you enthralled and wanting more.mr. collins the cousin, catheran de bourgh his patron bring out the best in subtle humour.mr. and mrs. bennet, both of them a class apart...their uniquely opposite personalities creating sparks. the four sisters: genuine, bingely:awesome...the story i leave for you to unravel. you'll love it to the best of your ability.trust me; you're caught. you won't be able to get your hands off it. its the work of a great woman and a great writer, a true genius who to me is just as equivalent to shakespeare. but then thats just me.a book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love.

It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon. Being that it is, I felt I should read it. The plot in the book is very straight forward. Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage. What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness. Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time. I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy. That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love. Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand. I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book. Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie. The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of. I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story. The book was at times difficult to understand; however, I especially enjoyed the mother character."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey and enjoying it so much, I decided that I would take another stab about Jane Austen and I am very glad that I did. I chose Pride and Prejudice because it is one of her better known novels and has been turned into numerous movies as well as a recent adaptation titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. The story is about Elizabeth Bennet who is a strong willed and outspoken young woman as she tries to find her true love. The most interesting aspect of the story is not Elizabeth's hunt for love, but her relationship with her parents. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty woman whose main goal in life is to have her daughters wed to wealthy men. While, Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and cynical man with no interest in martial affairs. Elizabeth's contrasting parental figures is detrimental to all of the daughters and even places them in danger.Most people identify this novel with the relationship between outspoken Elizabeth and cocky Darcy. However, there is much more to the story than their love.Still, I am looking forward to reading Linda Berdoll's sequel titled Darcy Takes a Wife."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book.

I didn't get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early '80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I've learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The themes of Austen's works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen's writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not one word about the greater world. I doubt that the word &quot;London&quot; appears in any of them except briefly in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;; they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that's part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don't know, and I think it doesn't matter - but there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen's works, of which I believe &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most accessible."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this classic totally. I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible. I have reread it many times. I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today). I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility. I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E; with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have. The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard. The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy. It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution. When you enjoy something you don't want it to end. Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another. Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character. Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning. I grew disgusted. The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable. I am only half way thru the first book, however.The Annotated Pride and PrejudiceJane Austen: The World of Her NovelsMr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice ContinuesAn Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England. The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family. Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters. Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his. Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy. Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead. Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story. To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten. Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all. He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him. It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book. Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\" Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot. This classic novel was definitely not on my \`must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking. After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one. Especially during football season! I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage. However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years! Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty. And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover. Isn't evolution great?Don't make the same mistake I did. I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride. My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years. Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero. None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen's classics.Must read for all who love to read.."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybeThe Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;Great book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I never thought I'd have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice. It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death. Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well. The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town. The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area. At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society. It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn't in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love. In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile. Bingley's personality is a perfect complement to Jane's. He's friendly, generous, somewhat nave and looks up to Darcy. Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her. Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say \\"yes\\" to his marriage proposal. To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him: His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart. Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane. This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as \\"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\" She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each. For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people's personalities and they're like. Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a \\"good face,\\" but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book. I've read it numerous times and there's always something new to discover with each reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's timeless classic. This is a fantastic edition! These little books are well-made, hand-sized, have a slip cover to protect the fabric book binding, and include an attached ribbon bookmark. Barnes and Noble used to sell them, but the editions have since been discontinued, and all B&N; employees are clueless as to if they are being replaced by something similar. A loss to libraries everywhere if they're gone for good.UPDATE: March 2009It appears that Barnes and Noble only sold these little books with their name attached! Most titles (and many additional ones) are still readily available on Amazon.co.uk. Search for \\"Collector's Library.\\" They are a bit more expensive than when they were sold at Barnes and Noble, but not much more than an average paperback. It is worth it if you collect them.

The pictures look great. The original text at the bottom of the pictures is too small to read but that would be true of any version due to the Kindle's resolution. I appreciate the Table of Contents, the list of illustrations and the formatting of this edition. For less than a buck a great classic with great formatting. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This -its author's most popular novel-revolves around the Bennett family which consists of Mother,Father and 5 daughters.The family is not wealthy and marrying off the progeny to suitable young men is a financial necessity, something felt particularly sharply by the Mother.The family and the district roundabout is thrown into confusion by the arrival of 2 wealthy young men both of whom are unattached.There is Charles Bingley who leases a house close to the Bennett home ,and his friend Mr Darcy with whom he shares. Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade.

I admit without pleasure that I am partial to romance novels from the same time period. I also admit that it was very refreshing to read a less formulaic and shallow, meaning more creative, intelligent and worthy book set in this time.My favorite character must be Mrs. Bennet. Can anybody be more delusional, obnoxious and wacko? I laughed and cringed each time I heard her voice which I really did hear as I listened to the book on my mp3 player. And then there is Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine. Right at the beginning of the book she meets Mr. Darcy and it's dislike at first sight on both sides.Since her sister and Darcy's best friend fall in love, Elizabeth has to encounter Mr. Darcy repeatedly. Other events force the two to meet again and again and Elizabeth almost laughs out loud when finally ... but I don't want to spoil your question of \`what will happen if anything between Elizabeth and Darcy?'.I really liked Elizabeth' character development. I admire her steadfastness and honesty."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book. It was written in 1797 and is still a most incredibly romantic story, even for us modern women! Jane Austen's observations of people's characters and behaviors are excellent.I recommend this book to anyone who has seen the movie, and wants more!Or to any hopeless romantics. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times. She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status. Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework. The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England. As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood. To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye. This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade. The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter. In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish. Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader. The 18th century style with it's long, complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action. It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister. For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably my favorite classics. I don't devote too much time to reading classics but I've read some good ones before. They are not really my style but I do like the ones I have read. The different style is refreshing.The book is written much differently than books are written these days. I was reading the begining of the book while I was tiered. I realized that I hadn't understood anything I'd read. I had to go and read again when I was completely awake.It was enjoyable. I loved the characters; they were smarter than so many characters in other books and were very well spoken. That may, however, been how most people were in the 19th century.It was fun to watch Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go on with their love hate relationship. Until the end it was a lot of hate.I thought it was a good classic but having not read many classics I'm not sure how it compares. Better than Wuthering Heights and not as good or as good as Great Expectations.-cdm"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't let my piont of view opinionate this classic story, as I only saw the theater production.

Around the middle of voume two, i started screaming at the book (screaming at inanimate objects-never a good sign) because i was so fed up with it. I couldn't get myself to get really into it like my fellow peers. Maybe its because I'm 14, but I don't get it. The writing is boring, its too cliched, too old-fashioned, annoying and I know that the lovers are supposed to be in passionate love and all, but it feels cold-no love or passion, just boring. I found myself falling asleep in the middle of every chapter after chapter 16. Maybe its just me, I don't know, but I did not like this book, at all. I can understand why people of Jane Austen's time would adore this book, but i don't understand how people of OUR time can enjoy this. If you're looking for a good British classic romance, Wuthering Heights, not Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Elizabeth is twenty years old, living in the Victorian ages in England. Life is a bit tricky for her. She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia. They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons. With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor. Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged. When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked. He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls. He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social. After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth. She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen. Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling. What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day. However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written. The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery. I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the life of those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine. The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic. However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story. The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment. The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid. A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic.

This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15.

It captivates you and takes you on a ride of emotions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"First, let me be clear: I love the story behind Pride and Prejudice. Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P; gets 5 stars from me.But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly. But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.P&P; stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this story! It has a great plot.

Jane Austen has been my favorite of authors ever since. To date, I have read the book three times in less than three years. I have fallen in love with both Lizzy and Darcy each time, and consider them great friends. Mr. Collins never fails to make me laugh, nor does Mr. Bennet. I always pity Charlotte in a way, but then, after all, she chose her own hard lot... Don't know what I mean? Read the book, and you will never wonder again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 and have read it every year since. Although I have read it countless times now, I still discover something new every time. The more I find out about the wonderful Jane Austen, the richer my reading of this fabulous story becomes. 'Pride and Prejudice' is romantic, witty, sad and frustrating (those who have read it will know that I am talking about annoying little Lydia). Mr Collins is a hoot! Mr Bennett is the epitome of patience, (a characteristic obviously developed by years of coping with his wife's &quot;poor nerves&quot;.) And Lizzie and the arrogant Mr Darcy? What can I say about them that fellow readers don't already know? For those of you who are thinking; &quot;What does she mean?&quot;; go and buy the book and READ it!

It focuses on the demands of being married to well off men, the prejudices they have to face and the pride of the gentlemen who thought themselves more supperior. Jane, Elizabeth, and their other sisters have to face allot of discrimination towards their wealth and their family connections. Jane and Elizabeth are the oldest, the prettiest, the wisest, and the most favoured in the higher circles of society. Even so when Jane falls in love with Mr Bingley an \`Eligible' young bachelor, Mr Darcy and the Mr Bingley's sisters dissuade him from this \`most unsuitable match'. Her mother was vaulger, she had little fortune and her younger sisters would be a bad connection. Mr Darcy dispite all this finds himself helplessly in love with Elizabeth, and so the story goes on, I could read this book again and again, it is timless and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book. I loved the language, the romance, the characters, even the choice of adjectives... (tolerably well... , and so on) But the point is... Do these things happen, in the real world?

And considering that I am a reasonably good-looking, tolerably clever, 30 years old Italian man, who doesn't see many chances of finding a girlfriend beacuse of his ill attitude... well, let me confess you that I am starting to feel a bit perplexed (and worried) about my future...

While there may be no accounting for taste or I'm just missing something, I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy reading this. It ultimately boils down to some sisters trying to marry (up, for the most part) in the world. I guess, if I try real hard, I can see some people imagining themselves in the scenes and enjoying the idea of living in the same town, wearing the same clothes, going to the same events, etc., but nothing really ever happens. It just goes on and on and on, only to lead this sister ending up with that guy, this sister ending up with that guy, etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit. Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women. The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman. Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this. But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told. Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed. I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, \\"then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.\\" the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am new to kindle books and found this book for free.

Finally I had the chance to read it and personally I am disgusted. I tried really hard to see what people love about the book. I cannot see it. There is no true love in the book, the characters are shallow and there is absolutely no story. It talks through the entire book of these five sisters marrying. I think that they are al pompous and rather annoying. I do have to say that Elizabeth is my favorite character as she doesn't seem to be as sucked in to the society nearly as much, but I do not see what there is in this book that has given it all the wonderful reviews.

Nevertheless, I must speak out and let my opinon be heard even though most of you who can't say enough about this book wouldn't want to hear.I am forced to read this book for my lit class and I find this book repulsive. I have never read such a novel that is completly incompetant, complete nonsence, the smallest talks of all the small talks in the world, it is about nothingness, and how several nothings trying and wanting to get married to other nothings for all the wrong reasons in the world. It is about people pretending to be inteligent and pretending to be civilized. It is a book where they compliment women as being handsome and men as being well...also handsome. It is quite contageous I might add because I find myself helplessly imatitating the language that it was written in. I am offended by every paragraph that I read. I have never felt such contemt for any work that I read. I pasionately despise this novel and I could write an entire paper on why. The 17th century English aristocracy and the way the people cary and behave themselves and think so highly of themselves and so low of anybody who is different, is offensive and without merit. You may think &quot;that I simply don't understand this work&quot; well I don't and I am not going pretend that I understand this &quot;classic&quot; Perhaps I am incapable of comprehending this novel.

In the BBC version of the novel, the adorable Colin Firth plays Darct to a tee. He was exactly the way I imagined him to be.

I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to agree -- Pride and Prejudice is a wee bit, well -- BORING.I don't know what it is. Maybe I just didn't get it -- but that's not like me at all. I don't find classic in general very hard to understand. I've read plenty of classics and both loved and understood them.No, it's not that I didn't understand, it's just that the story takes so long to kick off. It begins with our shero Elizabeth and her pathetic clan of sisters who struggle to appease society by appearing either beautiful, accomplished, well-connected or all three.As most main characters do, Elizabeth stands out from her sisters. She doesn't attempt to be pretty or accomplished and could care less about impressing any man. Her main concerns are caring for her family and remaining witty, independent, and free. She further scandalizes the neighborhood with this rebellious nature by -- gasp! -- walking a few miles in the rain and mud to care for her sick sister! The nerve!And meanwhile, the famous Mr. Darcy seems if anything cold, distant, and rude. He has a slight interest in Elizabeth, but that seems to be all. For this reason I was slightly shocked when I saw the commercials for the movie version of this book -- why, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were kissing!I must have read more than half the novel and they didn't so much as shake hands! I finally gave up and moved on to more interesting works of fiction -- but, hey, if you like and understand this novel, then good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us would like to get back to the more admirable Miss Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth.

Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wish that I can rate 0 star, not the novel itself but the book and it's quality.

I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table.

Am i the only person who thinks that were Elizabeth so intelligent then she must be able to look at things from both sides of the coin as the saying goes.

In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice sucks. Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story. I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby. With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry. It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum. I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character. Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow. If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby. Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading. And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers. Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines. The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table. (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.) And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Excellent character study.

After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My first experience with Jane Austen was an unfotunate one since, like many people, I had her prose rammed down my throat by a dodo high school English teacher. To make matter worse, the instructor, Ms. Z was a retired hippie who wore burlap sacks to school and worshipped Freud. At one point she had me write a paper comparing the three principle characters to the id (Lydia) the ego (Elizabeth) and the superego (Jane). At the tender age when a youth's mind is ripe for absorption and exploration, mine was already acclimated to the professional academic practice of ideological regurgitation of canonical literature.But years later, I saw the mini series and really enjoyed it. I promptly reopened the novel after many years and discovered the intensely liberating sensation of rereading required highschool texts without pedagocical intrusion.Austen's portrait of Victorian society is a sociological gem. And this time instead of taking my teacher's word for it, I actually found the book enormously funny. Much of the language, environment, and social circumstances are completely out of date, but in order to appreciate them, one must read the book in context. Some argue that it is too verbose. But there were no malls, cars or televisions in Victorian England. People entertained themselves, among other ways, by reading and writing and corresponding with each other. Words played heavily in the day to day lives of the middle class and aristocracy.I recommend that anyone who detested this book in high school, reread it and enjoy it. And I recommend that educators present this book in context so that students can appreciate it's humor, language and historical perspective."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers. Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it. A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen. This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read! I wish we still spoke in such eloquent terms. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great classic. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was easy to download and read. I like having both physical and electronic copies if I can. It was convenient to read because of accessibility on my phone or tablet. Anywhere I got stuck waiting I could start up the book again.

I never tire of the classic books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my go to book for those times when you just need a break from the real world. I am constantly reading it, once I finish it I start it over again. Jane Austen novels are indeed timeless and must be enjoyed through all generations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I appreciated the character development. Differences of class and upbringing, coupled with societal exposure and expectation lead the plot through many twists and turns that keep you reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book, and it's really my favorite story of all time. Mr. Darcy is just about as dreamy as they come. I've read this book at least 6 times since I was 10, and that's not including all the film adaptations and mangas I watched and read on this. It's well worth the read. The Notebook has nothing on this!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic is a great love story for the ages. A must read for everyone interested in literature.

I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot. I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book.

Beautiful classic love story with a great ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book quite a while ago, in fact when i was in year 9 and my older sister was studying it for GCSE, i saw the book and seeing as i was bored i decided to read it. to my surprise i actually liked it. it turned out to be very interesting and amusing at times too. the relationship between Darcy and Lizzy interested me very much as i found Lizzy's retorts and critical behaviour great as i am a great believer of speaking your views. For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time. It's an absolute classic and i love it. i really recommend everyone to read it. don't be put off by the fact that it is set in old times. U will be pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austin lays out all of her witt and charm within the first three pages of this novel and by the third and fourth chapters you won't be able to put the book down. If you find yourself unable to keep up with Georgian style of writing (or if you are guy), however, this may not be the best book for you. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a student (10th grade), I feel obliged to relate to other students not only how much I enjoyed this novel, but also that it may not be right for everyone. It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels. Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read. This novel is so wonderful, I wish I had never read it just so I could read it again! The wonderful charactes and charming plot make this novel one of the best of all time. Its wit and charm make any reader simply fall in love with it. I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you like this kind of story...Pride and Prejudice is the best relationship story I have ever read. There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P. Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into. Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling. Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable. Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more. They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them. I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times. You will see how great characters are developed and a great relationship is formed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, two of the worst things in our society (since like...forever). Elizabeth Bennet is a strong, fiesty, witty and attractive young woman who, with her five sisters and onlooking snobbish mother, finds her unexpected true love. At their first meeting, Mr. Darcy, a very wealthy very arrogant young man, shuns Elizabeth unintentially. But later, he begins to admire her and her frankness to him. With all the family difficulties (very humorous) and getting over Elizabeth's prjudice and Darcy's pride, will Elizabeth and Darcy ever stop fighting long enough to realize that their in love?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found that this novel is one of the best I have ever read. When I was young, I read Nancy Drew, Perry Mason, and Agatha Christie novels like food. I found the titles of such classics as Pride and Predjudice, One Flew over the cuckoos nest, The Great Gatsby, Death of a Saleman, and Wuthering Heights, to be pretentious; and if they didn't have murder and suspense, I didn't bother opening the cover. But one day while watching A&amp;E, I saw a glimpse of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I was hooked. I was amazed that a book written way before my time could be of any worth. After watching the movie, I picked up the book, and read it from cover to cover. I found that Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were intriguing characters, and I was utterly surprised when Mr. Darcy confessed his &quot;ardent love&quot; for her, also when he wrote the long letter of rebuttal to her claims to his bad character. At first, you despise Mr. Darcy, but as the book progresses, you find yourself liking him more and more. This whole book was very well-written and interesting, and now ranks with my favorite novels of all time, along with the classics listed above. For those who don't see how special and unique this book is, I suggest that you watch the video (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth), because anyone who has ever seen it that i know of has turned into a huge english literature fan."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say I never imagined I would enjoy reading a 19th century romance, but it turns out that 'Pride and Prejudice' is an easy, pleasant and surprisingly engaging read. The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"outstanding prodcut free...can't beat that can you?? haven't finished to book but so far it's outstandinghope you enjoy it as much as i am.....what's up??"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love this book!I rate this book as follows:Love interest: 5Subcharacters: 5Writing: 5Romantic Plot: 5Overall: 5"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love this book and have read it many times and will read it again.Ifirst read Pride and Predjest in the 40st when I was in High School.

Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with! It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone. Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end. None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you!

I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it. Pride and Prejudice merits the title of MY FAVORITE piece of literature ever written!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the \\"revised\\" setting of P&P. My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th. Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period. So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796. (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation. I can't remember but it sure was fun.But creative destruction, may I introduce diastolic reproduction? People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and shuns another -tion.This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch. Elizabeth would have been abducted by a motley crew of Red Indians, pirates and Jacobins, to wind up at Waterloo crazed with love for a D'Arcy of a Frog, and nothing to be done.But: the work of art must be accepted on its own terms."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This CD is wonderful.

The clashes between Darcy and Elizabeth are pricless and add zing to the book.I wish she had written a sequel though. Looking forward to reading her other books!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well. Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read. This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I would definitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour. Great book, makes it's points without bludgeoning you on the head."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you want to understand \\"relationships\\" better ( I would like to think we all do) and you have limited time, that you can use to read, say, \\"Pscychology Today\\" and watch Oprah and Dr. Phill -- or read Jane Austen's great work -- I say go with Jane. You will learn more and enjoy a classical reading experience in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my mom's favorite book, which I have finally read this year after long years of her trying to get me to read it. Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the \`prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the \`pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i am fourteen years old. i am an avid reader. i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times. my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good. i just started reading for the heck of it. i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have. but, anyways, the book is excellent. elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel. she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female. mr. darcy is a man. proud yet sweet in his own way. they are perfect. mrs. bennet is a character of her own. lydia is amusing. the whole book is great. it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book. it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels. it is certainly sweet. it allows you to relate to characters in your own way. maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything. but it definitely worth it. if you haven't read it you must. if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it. i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it. it is just a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Though I have heard much praise of Jane Austen, this is the first time I've actually sat down and read one of her books. I was impressed. Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires. Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn. She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing. I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically. I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love. Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;. I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable). The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PNP was a delight to read. I'm not a fan of Jane Austen. I was in fact, dismissive of her work as being too boring and feminist (though I insist that the two are not necessarily related!) which led me to pick up this novel to see for myself. For a story so well told, it's surprisingly well paced with little attention to insignificant details and events. I would have though Jane Austen novels spent page after page describing beautiful English scenery but it's feelings and relationships that are the focus of PNP. I can now understand why it's hugely popular with women; it reads like a very sophisticated soap opera. There are handsome young men and ladies, a dodgy character or two to make things interesting, and romantic entanglements aplenty. I quite enjoyed following the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and the enigmatic Darcy. Things change a lot in 200 years, but not when it comes to love. The language could be hard for many to grasp, but that is my only reservation. Pride And Prejudice is a fine book and one I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review was written by my class's literature circle group:Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, was a humorous tale of love and drama. It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically. Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character. She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life. It shows the tough spots you can have in life. An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on. At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen. I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it. Ever since then I have had an interest in it. When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going. I took this oppertunity to read the book. As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it. I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story. I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.I found the story very romantic. I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her. It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her. In my opinion that is one sign of true love. Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over. Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth. The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin was a fascinating author! Pride And Prejudice is by far one of her best novels. Her characters are so enduring and spontaneous. Every reader will not be able to help him or herself from falling in love with Elizabeth and her down to earth behavior. This is a romantic comedy as I see it for I found myself laughing at the humor and humiliation through out the whole novel. You don't have to love romantic novels to want to read this book. Pride And Prejudice is filled with the \\"Battle of Sexes\\" and the \\"Battles of the Richer and the Poorer!\\" You can be 13 or you can be 35 and you will still love the novel ever more. It is a story that has stood proudly against the tests of time and will continue to astonish its readers for years to come!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. I first read it when I was 16 and thought it was fantastic. Now, ten years later, it still remains my favorite book. I also love Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times. So, go for it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started reading Pride and Prejduice, I was 13 years old, and didn't understand it much. The vivid and detailed literature with underlying hints of sarcasm didn't make me laugh because I was illiterate to the writing at the time. I had even resorted to cliffs notes and such to help me through the book, even though I was reading it on my own accord. Now that I am older and far more wise, i read this book and love the romance, social placings and every moral connected to this book, but the male sex will turn up their noses to this amazing novel because it will be \\"too girly\\" for them.

I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women. Her writings foreshadowed and inspired succeeding generations of women as they fought to obtain equal rights."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"love this book, have always wanted to read it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Ships quickly.

I also bought the paperback version because my teacher did not allow electronics.

For some reason I read the Kindle version much faster and this helps me with bulky reading assignments so this is great for me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This product was in my mailbox and I didn't expect it for another week!

Somewhat challenging to read due to the old English, but such a powerful story none the less."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations. It is hard at first to adjust to the language of the 1800s but is well worth the effort. Once the story begins to unfold you will not want to put it down. I also highly recommend Mansfield Park also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I have seen the movie and loved it, so I wanted to read the book. It can be difficult to read old english, and some words I didn't understand, but I still love the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book countless number of times in my life. I downloaded it telling myself I didn't need to download it but I got to reading it on my ipod touch no less and I got caught up in it. Every time I was out I'd pull it out of my purse and read a little bit here and there. Throughly enjoyed the book again! Very good experience and can't wait to read my next book. I've gone overboard on the freebies but purchased some books too. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorite classics. I never thought this book was slow, although some might disagree because of the older english. I personally found the language in this book to be beautiful. I love the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She was a feisty, strong-willed woman, who wanted to marry for true love, as opposed to convenience or wealth, which was not very common during the time that this book was written. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A very loooooong time ago I was a Honors English student in college; we read the classics voraciously. While Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of my all-time favorites, I always dreaded reading Jane Austin. She can be very bland, dry, and boring. This book is a bit different, with the characters showing more wit than Austin usually provides.I recently read the \\"Zombie\\" format of this work and found it absolutely laugh-out-loud funny! Can't wait to see the movie! If you like this book, by all means pick up the P,P & Z edition and prepare to be charmed all over again.Best,Vienna"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did enjoy the novel, but was not particularly fond of how Austen (as opposed to Chralotte Bronte) portrays marriage as a necessity for women or essential for a woman's happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love the story, and this little book with gold edges is the perfect copy to keep and enjoy again and again. In our disposable society they just don't make books like this one anymore. Great gift for the Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, lover in your life, or better yet for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book several times, and each time it continues to amuse me more. the wonderful thing about Austin is the style of her writing is so wonderful and other worldly that one can keep reading the same book over and over and always find some new intricate detail of her writing to marvel over. I know that some people are not up for the task of 19th literature, but if you can just give it your all and dig in, Austin will certainly make it worth your while and more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a great book full of forbidden love, greed, bribery, sorrow and triumph. Jane Austin, once again, has written a beautiful novel that should be read by everyone! Not only does she describe everything well, but the way that she writes lets you infer how the character is feeling and thinking.Mr. Darcy is a great villian/hero when you read because he is so lovable and caring without being obvious.Lizzy Bennet is one of the greatest characters ever written about! She is spunky, speaks her mind and she is supportive of all of her sisters (which is very important when Lydia takes a turn for the worst). She is a great, admirable person in the story, which makes reading Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. Jane Austin really knows how to write!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield. The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth flatly refuses him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.BY steffi castillo"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed it.

Elizabeth Bennett was ahead of her times, a lady who paled in the beauty of her sister. And I would love to meet someday a man like Fitzwilliam Darcy who can see through her lack of means and radiating sister to see the real woman whom he can truly love. And each of the five sisters represent a stereotype of women in literature in those days. The beautiful, the independent nurturer, the bookworm, the flirt, and the follower. Everyone ends up with someone in the end who matches their personalities with the exception of Mary, who stays with the woebegone father. A must for anyone who is a romantic at heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a story of love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman.

The story depicts the charactes of the beautiful Jane,witty Elizabeth,their mother and father,the handsome Mr.Darcy, the Bingleys and the Lucases.Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth,charms her way into the proud and cold heart of Mr.Darcy. And this love story is certainly CHARMING."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far, in my opinion, the best of Jane Austen's works. I can't really say what makes it that fabulous, but once you started reading, you can't stop. Jane Austen had fully developed the characteristics of Elizabeth, and made her very human. The feelings stitched into the story has made an impact on the readers' mind, enabling to feel for the characters themselves. This, I think, is a very important point why I consider this book one of her best."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"WONDERFUL!!!! That is the best description of this wonderful love story.

Everyone should rush out and get this book..if you haven't read it yet..you should be shot...Buy it now!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's subtle wit and piquant characterizations are at their best in this, her most famous work. Lizzy Bennett is the most delightful heroine of all time, and Darcy will spoil women for real men for all time.

Everybody gets what they deserve in the end, and there is not a loose end to be found. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read hundreds, possibly even thousands, of books in my life and this is one of my top three favorites. Austen is an incredible writer who draws you into her story until you feel that you are one of her characters. It is comical, passionate and even sad at parts.I have a hard time finding books that have appropriate themes for my age yet are still intellectually stimulating. This is an enjoyable and even slightly challenging book that I reccomend to EVERYONE! I love it!

I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.BY Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is not about the book but about Amazon. I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen a great deal more than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".Elizabeth's sense of humor made her a much more interesting heroine in my opinion. She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!! Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me. Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her. Her epiphany......&quot;how despicably have i acted......till this moment I never knew myself!&quot; Is worth reading the novel for."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better.

I fail to see, other than a nice, happy story, what gives this novel its value."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it's boring.

Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems. Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This story was written in the early Victorian era, and hence it is quite old. I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and prejudice, is a novel on the love and hate of a man and a woman who are perfect for each other from the beginning but do not realize it until the end. It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other. This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring. One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have. I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love. I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them. Pride and Prejudice is a novel that did not interest me, but may interest those old grannies that jump and express their happiness when everlasting romance novels end in happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous. I had to read this book for a class, and disliked it so much, i didn't even remember that I had read it (repressing it in my mind). It wasn't until one of my friends who had also been in that class reminded me that we had read it that I even remembered that i HAD read it.

By-the-way, what's Mr. Darcey's first name?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This one is a favorite; Austen combines hilarity, satire, and a touch of suspense to create a fun-to-read novel, which can hardly be put down once begun.

I just adore this book, I could hardly put it down, I finally had to stop reading when my butt started falling asleep. I is so exciting to find out who will marry who, and to see Mr. Darcy change his manners and Elizabeth change her mind. The elegance of the novel truly added to the characters and the setting.

I love reading, but this book just seemed a bit boring. Well, once I began reading it, my opinion drastically changed. It is so well-written. The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel. I also completely enjoyed the fact that there was not a lot of description in the book; it let you form your own opinion of how the settings and characters looked.

I'm not sure what it is about this book, but I'm hooked. I have read it and reread it countltess times. My small paperback book shows how well it's loved, pages crinkeld, some stained. There's something about opening the book and reading the lines those lines which are so familiar to me that gives me a comforting feeling,. It's the same feeling as coming home after a long time. If I was stranded on a desert island this book is what I'd take with me because it offers a solice like no other. I'd highly reccomend this book to anyone.

They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas. It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom. No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent. Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\". Decorative, but hardly important.Would someone please tell me what these people were reading? It certainly isn't the same book that I read. Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are. That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible. Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here. To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt. It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself. Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first. And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world? That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice? Baloney.Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present. The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name. The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies. Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both. Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them. Jane Austen was a very great author.If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author. Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence. That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\" Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that. It's positively delicious. With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.Don't let that scare you, though. I told you, it's delicious.

There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen. Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I won't presume to review Austen, so this review covers the quality of the Penguin release. Many of us have discovered that the \\"free\\" ebooks on Gutenburg and other sites frequently have such poor formatting that they are irritating to read. One can either re-edit the book to fix the problems, or just live with them and have an inferior and annoying reading experience.Penguin's P&P; is the closest ebook equivalent to the joy of reading a quality physical book--the text is perfectly formatted for the Kindle, it's been proofed, and the supplemental material is almost overwhelming. Detailed intros, useful hyperlinking and a wealth of information on Austen's times, including fashion, furniture, and food and drink, are included. It's truly an immersive experience.I believe this book will be seen as a turning point for ebooks: the point at which editorial and publishing quality became a significant purchase criterion. Early ebook adopters (myself included) were willing to spend hours cleaning up Gutenburg editions and formatting them for the device du jour. No longer. The ebook is moving past the early adopter stage and is making inroads into a market that expects quality editing, publishing, and supplemental materials. I'll definitely pay a reasonable amount for an ebook that I can just start reading, instead of tinkering with, and that provides a comfortable feeling of having gotten one's money's worth.Penguin has set the bar for ebook quality with this release. I urge anyone with a Kindle to get a copy--*this* is the ebook experience we've been wanting."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This particular book is delightfully illustrated. I have three P&P books and this is the most treasured of all. Not only the novel itself is wonderful to read, but also the illustrations are beautiful to look at.

You will agree when you open this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Okay, I admit it: I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV. But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason.

Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go). Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute. The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening. Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Wow! What else do you say after you read such an incredible book? Jane Austen's timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don't you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this intricately woven plot. Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the prize). This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament back then. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all, you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. However, don't stop after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them all. (It won't take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there weren't more) Jane Austen's work is incredible; the only fault I find is that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it won't be a chore to read it again, more like opening a treasure chest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No need to review the book itself. What I want to address are the hyper linked notes and footnotes.One of the big criticisms of other books on the Kindle is that it was very hard to access notes and footnotes.

They have hyperlinked the notes and the footnotes, so that you can get right to them with your Kindle scroll wheel, and not lose your place in the book.More publishers need to do the same!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version is far and away the weakest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i think that this book was a very descriptive book that had some good points but also had some bad points. i read this book for a class and i had some trouble reading it because it got kind of boring at times. overall though it was a very well writen book by jane austen. i would recommend it to those who enjoy reading books that contain alot of detail."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to be a historically informative and interesting read. I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society. Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time. Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power. Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values. Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love. This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable. The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful. However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today. Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel. As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students. While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year. It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel. Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam. I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was in amazing condition.

Hope they'll be publishing this one after this item, submitting my complaint..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice deserves a 5 star rating, but this Kindle edition is sloppy, and \\"free\\" is not an excuse. Those familiar with Jane Austen, and P&P in particular, need only search for \\"call her mother a wit\\" to see what I mean."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel is about the story of five daughters with an elderly father and an opportunistic Mrs. Bennet, their daughters will never pronounce the word mother.Mr. Bennet having five unmarried daughters is preoccupied because, according to the law a daughter (if not married) cannot inherit the estate where they actually lives.Another aspects of this novel is the centrality of the letters and their messages fundamentals for the develop of the story.The most important letter is those written by Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth nor for his amorous declaration but for explain to Elizabeth why he has refused Jane and the Mr. Wickham's heredity.In my opinion the pride and prejudice of this novel revolves around the main characters, in particular when Elizabeth is conscious and recognise her prejudice in the confront of Mr. Darcy, the pride is to have discovered a true and unconditional love.The main characters are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, the most hated is Mr.Collins.Elizabeth is intelligent romantic generous determined sensible and rude girl, in brief she is the antithesis of a homophobic world.In my opinion Mr. Collins an handsome guy but he is a person full of hate and his aim is engage on his suffering the people around him.The opposite is Mr. Darcy, his external appearance is rude and provocative, but his soul is noble romantic and altruistic and surprisingly he is against the classism of the British society, the souls of Mr.Darcy and Mr. Darcy are very similar.CheersItalo"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too! I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them! My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is appropriately titled because the focus of the story is about social prejudices and preconceptions. The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story. If you like British literature from that time period, you will love this story. I think it is a good book, but it's not really my particular genre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I do not often find myself reading female authors, but when I do, it is always in the classics. Jane Austen is deserved known as one of the best. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is witty and memorable. I need not say more. I cannot see how this brilliant work could do anything but polarise opinion, there is no middle ground."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children's one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can't seem to put it down. I'm also planning to read Jane Austen's other novels as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin. Why? First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago. Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short. (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...) Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know. Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman. At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy. Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief. There's no way this couple could ever get together, right? :)Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more. So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books. Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy. I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read. Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore. Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.Recently, I did just that. I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it! (Far more than I thought that I would!) Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time. Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature. She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme master of her craft. In her characterizations, plotting, and language she is the model of exactness and efficiency. There simply is no gratuitous business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal fantasy. Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit, each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot; Where lesser writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the description of a raised eyebrow."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it's still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for your money.If you're reading for a class or for independent study, you can't go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives. This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those secondary sources you'll need for your research paper.If you're just reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It's a well-edited version that's appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on Austen's writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it's boring or difficult to understand). In my opinion the Penguin Classics edition is definitely the best bet for your money."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought I would have trouble getting into one of those \\"old, frilly romances.\\" Picking up this novel with great doubt, I delved into a beautiful love story with enough humor (especially directed at the character Mrs. Bennet) to keep my interest perked, as well as delicious twists and secrets among the characters that make this a stunning work of art. Austen makes a simple romance a page-turner."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic read. I am not a fan of all Jane Austen's writing, but this one is worth reading. Almost all of us know the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, but reading this book was still a pleasure. I find this book over some other Austen books a much easier read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Gave as a gift, it was in great condition and a excellent price., and was received promptly.

I fell completely in love. I had to buy it for myself. I already knew the story, having read it a few times myself, but hearing it read on this set, it was so much more beautiful. Ms. Williams voice is lovely, I love the way she speaks as Lady Catherine, and her voice for Lydia. Both hilarious but real, exactly as I would expect them to sound were I there.This is one of my very favorite stories ever, and Ms. Williams made it that much more wonderful for me. I recommend this product to everyone in the world."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is no other story told and re-told as much as P&P. This book transcends many generations with a true and tested story. The characters and story line are so similiar to this day and age.

Love it, love it, love it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is written during my favorite time period. . . It goes well with some other favorites like Dickens' works and Les Miserables. . . Well written with deep characters and funny portrayals of human nature (ie.

Correcting this mistake proved interesting. While the style is dated, Austen's take on \\"polite society\\" is very funny and the title particularly apt.The characters remain true to their own inner logic and this comedy of false assumptions plays out to a pleasent and thoughtful end. I don't know if I feel obligated to read the rest of Austen's work, but I do agree her work has withstood the test of time very well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a pretty good book although there are some dull moments for me as a reader. As for female readers, they will probably enjoy this book greatly and it will most likely become a great book for them. As for male readers, it will probably be dull for you just like me.The story most of the time is centered on one girl named Elizabeth and there are many fights over whom will marry who. Many events happen and after some of Elizibeth's lovers have been taken by other rich people who have power, she settles over a person called Mr. Darcy who has known their family for many years and seems to notice everything going around and gives an aura of some sort to other people. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy marry and the book ends there.Overall this book is a pretty good book and I enjoyed some parts of it fairly well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary! In order to &quot;save space,&quot; the publisher, Brilliance Company, has recorded the tape twice on each side, requiring special equipment in order to descramble it when listening to it on a Walkman-type casset player. The equipment goes under the name of &quot;Bookcassette Adapter,&quot; and there is no indication how to get hold of one.

I know you are all going to hate me, and never look at another one of my reviews, but honestly it is one of the few titles that I actually believe I liked the movie better. There, I said it. Maybe it is because modern screenwriters are able to present their attraction to each other better than Jane Austen could in 1800's. The movie is one of my favorites. I still get chills when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth she has bewitched him.

In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men.

After I read Pride and Prejudice, I realized that there are books out there that are worth reading for fun, and ever since, I have always been in the process of reading a book for fun, even in addition to the books I read for my high school classes.

I read it just to prove to her that I could, and now it is definitely one of my favorites. There were parts of the book that were long and confusing for me, but they were certainly overshadowed by all of the many exciting and romantic scenes! A must-read book!

The romance between Eliza and Darcy is thrilling. The characters of Eliza's parents are hilarious. I loved the style of the writing-not flowery or rambling.

One doesn't feel detached from the plot and conflicts despite the myriad differences between Regency England and late 20th century America.

Austen tells a wonderful story with side plots and interesting characters. You'll laugh at Mr. Collins' speeches and Mr. Bennet's way of looking at the world, get angry at Lady Catherine and her high handed ways, and dispair over Lydia's and Mrs. Bennet's silliness. A great book to curl up with."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Nearly 600 reviews have been written on this book at the time of this writing so I suppose there is little I can say that has not already been said about Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice. What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites. It reads like a dream and is difficult to put down. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is a literary genius. Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue. There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start. You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through. Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections. I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says. His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book. Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy. She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman. There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas. As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him. I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible. Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard. Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get. Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry. This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

But the printing of this particular version is TERRIBLE. It's apparently a \\"print on demand\\" book from Tribeca Books. Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying. The one I got was only $5 and much easier to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I remember liking Sense and Sensibility in college, but I struggled through this one a bit. It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable. The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia. But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the \\"happily ever after\\" marriages. I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been a fan of Miss Austen from day one; and I firmly believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a novelist.Don't buy all the \\"critics\\" commentary and praise regarding \\"Persuasion\\" and some of her other works as being superior to P&P.; That's pure contrary-ism at its worst.If you only read two of her books, then read this one twice. And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E; miniseries for P&P; is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle.

Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The construction of the story and the storytelling are wonderful. It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The diction and the story line of the novel is so amazing, The Darcy/Elizabeth chemistry is amazing and great for any romantic reader."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Brainy sophisticated and hilarious.

The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B; mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation. In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The main plot of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is about the relationships of people and the misperceptions we sometimes make on them. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet, an outspoken and somewhat modern girl for her time. She resides in the country with her family; her obsessive mother, quiet spoken father, and her four other sisters, her elder and loving Jane, sentimental Mary, and the two flirtatious Kitty and Lydia. When a prosperous man named Mr. Bingley arrives near the Bennets, Mrs. Bennet's first idea is that Jane shall marry Mr. Bingley. At the ball which he first makes his appearance, he brings along his friend Mr. Darcy, a man who is even richer than Mr. Bingley. It is soon discovered that Mr. Darcy has somewhat of a prideful air about him, and after saying an offensive statement about Elizabeth, she is prejudiced against him. The book goes on to show how Elizabeth and Darcy grow closer to each other, from her finding out about his past to him helping her family out when Lydia elopes with an officer in the military. The ending is probably no surprise to anyone, but the way the book progresses is so fascinating that you want to keep reading it to find out how everything will turn out.My personal thoughts on the book are thus; the characters are very involving, as is the plot. The choice of words and dialogue are a bit hard to comprehend, but that's how people spoke in the 18th century. The book is more enjoyable than the movie adaptations I've seen, although the A&E; version was great in my opinion. I think the way Jane Austen was able to capture each character's feelings and actions as she did in the book is so fascinating; mainly because she did that by observing all the people in the countryside she resided in. Personally, my favorite characters so far are Darcy and Elizabeth, the latter being a close second. I just feel I relate to both of them well in the way that I speak my mind and am misunderstood at times. I believe people interested in the behaviours and relationships of people during a certain time period would best like this book. Compared to books written today, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is totally different. It has small humour, an interesting plot with many sub-plots, and great characters where there is a type assured for anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste. I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters. This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down. Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next. This book was, \\"Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know\\"(59)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet. The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This will certainly be a classic forever. In this book, she proves how well she can manage a story almost entirely on pure dialogue, for she isnt that very descriptive about her characters or the places they inhabit- she sticks to the basics- but wonderfully constructs all the dialogues throughout the story. Not only are the dialogues very well elaborated and the ones that keep you reading, but in them she very subtly gives a critique about society - reflecting, most probably, her own opinions about her own time and the way society worked. A good critique of her own era.And what to mention of the story itself!!! The dislike between Darcy and Elizabeth , Jane's impossible love for Bingley, Bingley's horrid sisters... she keeps you turning page after page!In any angle that you analyse it, you'll find it to be an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed.

Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages.

It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations. Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film. There was one notation at the closing of every (mailed) letter that I did not understand, but otherwise did not see many mistakes that would not have been in the original manuscript as other reviews reported. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading so many modern fiction popular titles it is so refreshing to go back to a classic.

I absolutely loved the story, the characters, just everything about it. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended. The progression of Elizabeth's and Mr. Darcy's relationship and love was beautiful. The family dynamics of the Bennetts was so real. Amazing story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books. After I read the zombie version of 'Pride and Prejudice'. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My English master at school made us read P&P out loud and we did enjoy it but I still have no idea why. Since then I have read it many times but still can't put my finger on the reason that it is so good. One of the problems is that we have all seen the TV adaptation and the movies especially with that background music. I recently read it out loud to a class of school children in Africa and they were captivated. But why?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This tale is a classic, and for good reason. It has managed to stand the test of time and even after so many generations, Jane Austen is still able to capture your heart and pull you into this charming, little world and endear you to her lovable, fleshed out characters. It's witty, heart-warming, funny, filled with wonderful life lessons and just an overall fun read. Easily one of my favorites books of all time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love how beautifully published this edition is. It is still a favorite of mine, after all these years.

However, I find the most delight I receive is in the clever phrases and word usages. It is a kind, long poem to my ears.Naturally, I do like Elizabeth as well. She is very human.

I love being able to take this with me where ever I go with out carrying the book with me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, Jane Austen(This review was originally published at The Brazen Broads' Book Bash)A Timeless Classic...For anyone who has never read Pride And Prejudice, this Broad would urge you to crack the cover! If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic.

I LOVE THE LANGUAGE, THE MANNERS AND THE RULES OF SOCIAL LIFE.

All I can say is \\"Read it.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this beautiful novel only three times. A British Prime Minister read it 26. My novel, \\"The War Less Civil\\"THE WAR LESS CIVIL, deals with issues Miss Austen would be shocked, and in some cases, horrified by. But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age. If one desires a book offering endless pleasure, one that could be reread once a year for a lifetime, then I strongly urge one to read \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My daughter and I both read this book.

The book keeps you entertained as you picture each chapter in your head.

Even though the novel lacks the description of nature, it enables one to feel rural England with its green meadows and fields.

Nice, comfortable copy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Okay, just to set this straight, I absolutely love Jane Austen and always have. Pride and Prejudice is by far my favourite novel and I love the movies too, but this kindle edition was killing me.What's with the caps lock where italics should be? I imagined everytime there was a caps Elizabeth would be screaming. It was just irritating.Also, there were a few errors here and there.I recommend buying the paperback or hardcover version of Pride and Prejudice if you really get annoyed by errors like I do, but overall it's still for free, and let's face it, Mr. Darcy in print is good no matter what."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was different reading this book which I must have read nearly 30 times..this is my first experience reading it via my kindle.

It's easy to see why this book has inspired so many other authors to draw from it and adapt the story to give it new spins... it's almost an archetypal \\"boy meets girl\\" story, including the wrinkles at the beginning that make them think they are all wrong for each other, when it's all just a matter of perception.Highly recommended, to anyone that reads!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book and would encourage others to read it. The classic books are part of history so please share this book and other classic books with family and friends."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like all the other Jane Austen books I loved this one just as much.

There is no turning back now; LOVE MY KINDLE and LOVE that I purchased Pride and Prejudice for it! The writer, Jane Austin really knows her stuff and knows how to capture a reader! I would reccomend this book highly!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Truly one of the best stories of all time. Pride and Prejudice will always be a classic. Bravo Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you like romantic classics you do not need my advice...if not do not read this book!

Also contains great words and gives you a good idea of marriage and romance customs in the past."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Tough read, but it's a classic. Half way through and it's hard to put down. I recently read Jane Eyre, so I didn't have to look up as many words : )"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never tire of reading the &#34; oldies&#34; but &#34; goodies&#34; The tried and true literature of the past always brings pleasure to the reader."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I will be honest and say from the beginning that I did not enjoy 'Pride and Prejudice'. I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic! I absolutely adored this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always wanted to read the classics but never took the time. Having a Kindle has allowed me to read a LOT more than I used to, I carry it everywhere. This was the first book loaded (my husband pre-loaded it for me prior to presenting the Kindle as my birthday gift). I dove into the book like I have never read before and cannot express in words the joy I felt when I was finished. It is by far the most wonderful book I have ever read and do not know how I have lived 47 years without having read it.There will NEVER be an author born the likes of Jane Austen. Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great.

It made reading the book kind of like reading it with a friend who loves the story too. In fact, at times I wished they had given more annotation. Examples of the annotation include information about the different carriages families travel in (comparing it to modern day cars).

Also,I prefer the A & E adaptation of the book(Double DVD). The version with KEIRA KNIGHTLY is o.K, but the former adaptation has actors that are more creditable as their characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm sure there are a multitude reviews on the actual story of P&P;, to which, I'm sure, I can add very little. I will, therefore, just say that this is one of my favorite books. I read it several times a year. This is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written.I mostly wish to comment on this particular edition of the book (Robert Frederick Ltd.). I just bought it, today, at the local used book store. I already have another copy and decided that an illustrated edition would be a nice addition to my book collection.The hardback book is of fair quality. I'm not sure if this book originally came with a dust jacket or not, but this one doesn't have one. There is a picture of a man and woman, dressed in Regency period clothing, walking on a wooded path. I'm sure, if there is a dust jacket, the picture is probably the same.The spine is a bright pink color and the title on the cover is surrounded by a bright pink oval.Inside, the pages are made of good quality paper. There are black and white illustrations. They are well drawn. There is a picture placed above every chapter heading, either of a scene from the previous chapter or the forthcoming one. There are also pictures placed randomly throughout the book.I would say this book would make an excellent first copy for a young girl."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great book one of the best written books written.

That means that not only is it telling an entertaining tale, it is also calling to something deep in the readers' souls. Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written; I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety. She believed that the happiest marriage was one between a man and woman who were intellectually and spiritually in tune with one another.To the readers, I say: Go thou and do likewise. Read the book.

Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Adopted the thrift edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to reduce the textbook expenses for a college-level literature class.

It is remarkable the way she brought off the mercenary and ignorance of the people-a common criticism of the 18th century.I can assure that those who have a taste for the classic and the romantic are going to have such a pleasant reading as I had.What I've found most interesting was the constant presence of an utterly charming, engaging and fast 'war of wits' among characters.It certainly has a great theme and we can still see its content applied in todays world. Pride and Prejudice was elegantly-written by Jane Austen and I can say that it was very worth it as well as inspiring to me reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed.

I'm reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as if it's hot off the press in 19th Century England.

It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading.

Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society. Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth. The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour. Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was supposed to read this in high school. Didn't happen.Then I was supposed to read it in college. Again, didn't happen.It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right? Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?Everything, it turns out. And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses. It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short. And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\" Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them. Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been. We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud? Where have we been prejudicial? Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us. We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is. I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room. And it has everything to do with the here and now.(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book? I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen. Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility. I liked the first, but was blown away by this one.

I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again. That's exactly how I felt with this novel. I could read it forever. I would reccomend it to anyone who remotely enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story? Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight. Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader. First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface. Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature. An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth. Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats. However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader. First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is. On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased. Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia. The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries. Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled. But is this is a typical love story? Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?

It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era. The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society. Jane Austen's style is so stellar. She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy. They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth. Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match. Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance. Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels. When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters. She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity. Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries. She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place. She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace. Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy. Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period. Good book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat. More of a powerful weapon than the extraordinary novel that it is, Austen uses the book to fiercely criticize nineteenth century society and the essence of human nature while still managing to create an extraordinary and captivating plot.Beginning at the novel&#8217;s outset, the reader becomes a puppet at the mercy of Austen&#8217;s ability to evoke any emotions she desires within her readers.By creating a diction and syntax unique to each character Austen holds the reader within her grasp. All of the characters are very different from each other in many aspects; this creates grounds for conflict and essentially propels the plot.Also, each of the characters is somewhat of an extremity of a certain characteristic that most people possess. Mrs. Bennet is the spoiled side of our personalities, Mr. Darcy the proud side, Lydia the irresponsible side, Jane the quiet side, Mary the feminist side, and so on.The novel encompasses main elements from many different genres of books such as romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, which make for a very entertaining read. Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you&#8217;ll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat.

Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you'll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen masterfully weaves an endearing love story, with cosmic irony, and a keen awareness for social distinctions, which took us through a colorful journey of mind, body, and soul. Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class.Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity.Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When i read this book for the first time, i just thought that it was just same as the other love story.But after i read twice and three times, i found that it's obviously different from any other romantic books.It's the only one book for reflect of women's life in society.and i really want to be a character like lizzy:)I think that it's the only book to express feminism."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has yet to let me down.

But I loved it anyway! The whole concept of 'I hate you so much' turned 'I love you so much(even though I don't want to)', is my favorite.

Well written and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Was not disappointed in the service or shipping or the product. Very satisfied with the purchase that I made. Thanks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"because nobody does it like Miss Austen. Even the minor characters are immortal -- Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennett, Lady Catherine in particular -- these are characters without which our imaginations would be the poorer, would they not?As to Elizabeth, one can only lament that she is fictional, and not a real woman one could fall madly in love with...New readers of Austen, please note: although she writes about a period when women were in certain ways subordinate, she makes it clear that at least some women considered themselves to be essentially free and equal, and succeeded in holding their own, or more than their own, in their relations with the other sex. If I may venture to say so, her best women are both quite feminine and quite strong &amp; spirited. Her best men respect those qualities. So my recommendation is to read her with an open mind, and not let the social customs -- so different from our own -- prevent you from seeing the real human virtues (and vices) of her characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"jane austen has been my favorite author since i was required to read pride and prejudice in high school. her character development of the bennett family as well as the darcys and other characters is phenomenal. the tension between elizabeth and darcy drives the story forward and there are so many subplots inerwoven within the story that the reader will never be bored."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a little anxious about clasics because they includes a lot of detailed descriptions which I can't give myself easily and their language are hard to fallow whos native language is not English....EXCEPT JANE AUSTEN's... She is marvelous, funny and kept you suspicious at the end. Although her language is hard to me , I like it very much. Luckily I have seen the BBC series of it ,then I decided to read it... How fortunate I am for that decision, it is captivated me from the first page ... recommend to everyone who loves 19th century stories..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I note with interest that every one-star review posted here comes either from a male or an unidentified &quot;reader&quot; . . . I'm not especially surprised, and to the males, don't blame yourselves if you can't penetrate Jane Austen (it is undoubtedly more appealing to the female mind), although I must vouch for P&amp;P and pity those who pass over this excellent novel. The whole charm of the story lies in the high vocabulary which Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy and the rest employ, and the wonderful language creates a rapid succession of wit, romance, and observation on human absurdity, in style. ~~~~ It's hard to understand how people can find this book dull, for the very first chapter rolls out a lively discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice only gets better as you go on; I admit to once finishing the novel and promptly rereading it one day later. Also to smiling for one week straight, for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. ~~~~ Please don't come to Jane Austen only to criticize her subject matter-- every author has a style and a realm of experience which make their books unique. If you think the young ladies' endless pursuits of wealthy marriages to be old-fashioned and petty, they are! But Jane Austen crafts the novel with a skill and wit that lets the novel at once both expose how ludicrous that English society was and yet create lively and very human characters you have to love; and therein lies its charm. Pride and Prejudice is a lovely combination of sly humor, exasperation, and romance that make it one of my favorites. I hope it will be one of yours too-- don't give up on Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before you even know them! And understand Jane Austen for the talented authoress she is, whether you think her settings and period portrayals deplorably dull, pathetically petty, or (I hope!) cleverly charming. ~~~~ I think that most people, when they read P&amp;P, either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an excellent book! It is clever with a strong plot line. It's beyond your basic theme of Romeo &amp; Juliet. The characters are vivid and realistic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What more do you need in a well-written, crafty, and amazing novel, than Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy? Nothing. This is one of the most extrodinary novels of all time.

This book was so charming and funny it was hard to put down and so easy to read! Elizabeth Bennett is a wonderful heroine. Many of the scenes left me laughing outloud! Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins still bring a grin to my face when I think of their antics!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, in my opinion, is the epitome of a love story. I found myself in complete suspense to find out if darcy and elizabeth got together. Jane Austen combines 19th century wit with romance to create a book that you just can't put down. Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole story. Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting remarks, remains irrestistable. The reading itself can be a little uneventful sometimes, but Jane Austen saves it with a sarcastic comment from Mr. Bennet, or a witty remark from Elizabeth. This is my favorite book ever and i recommend it to anybody who can appreciate the 1800s style of writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book I read and after reading some of her other works, it is still my favorite Austen of all time. P&amp;P is interesting and so well written. Some people think that classics are a bit dry and something you only read in school.

If you like the classics, this is a good buy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this for school, but I actually turned out liking it.

Whenever I am at a loss to find anything decent to read in the modern literature I find this a real comfort. A great read!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"MY DEAR READERI cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours.

While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my all-time favorite classics and a book I have read endlessly and will read many times more, so am delighted to have this on my Kindle as well as having several print copies around.

It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This Book is just the kind of book that I like.

BUT, please be informed that this edition requires the tapes to be listened to on a player with speaker balance controls! If your player does not have this capacity, or if the speaker in question cannot be turned off completely, this set is useless. Of my two cars, two portable players, and home stereo, only two of them can play this edition. So, this means that I drive that car even more than I used to, and fold laundry more, whilst listening to this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am 16 years old and was scared about reading this book because I have heard that it is hard and boring. I however find those to be lies. Although it took me a while to read, i was perfectly able to understand it and any girls that like romance should read it. It's a true treasure!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although many might find Austen boring, I'm certainly not one of them when it comes to Pride and Prejudice. I have to admit than Austen does have some pretty slow-moving novels, but this is not one of them. The characters are very lively and real. Austen really does a good job of creating a very charming and truly fairy tale-like situation. This is my favorite book to date."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are many audiobooks version of this time-honored classic, but I found that LA theatre's works's lively dramatized version pales other reading versions. For one thing, various actors play out the parts of the story. Granted, there are many ommision for this two hour audioplay, but essentially, it retains the very essence of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has created a very believable world in P&amp;P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It feels a little strange and even presumptuous to review Jane Austen online. I was prompted to do so when reading other reviews dismissing Pride and Prejudice as nothing more than a silly romance and a relic of a bygone era.It would be silly to suggest that the social mores and manners that Austen skewered are unchanged. Young women are no longer dependent on a husband simply for food and shelter, and I have no intention of spending my life in a drawing room trimming hats and sewing screens. But it would also be silly to suggest that Austen's tale offers nothing to the modern reader. Even in our enlightened age, young women in indelicate situations are pressured by their humiliated families into unfortunate marriages. Manifestations of social standing may differ, but money, education, and other modern expressions of social class still play more of a role in the choice of spouses than most of us would wish to admit. And to this day, young men and women alike are mortified by their families in public situations, justified or unjustified.To fully appreciate Austen's sense of humor takes a bit of effort on the reader's part, but once acclimated to the language the hilarity of the book becomes apparent. Pride and Prejudice proves that classics need not be dull; Austen had a lively and sharp wit. If you are truly put off by the language, and don't get the humor, it's actually worthwhile to find a good production on video and rent it. The BBC version produced in the 1990's is long, but a very faithful and extremely well-cast adaptation that does an excellent job of translating Austen's humor onto the screen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this novel. It has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, comedy, and more. Every time Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are in the same room you can expect some kind of comedy. Lizzy's bizarre family (not counting Jane) would drive any man away.If Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bennet were real I wouldn't be able to understand how he could possibly stay married to this rude and ill-mannered woman. But since they're only characters in a book I would have to say that they are a perfectly matched couple. Each one posseses what the other does not.If you can get past the old English that Jane Austen wrote in, this is a great read and a wonderful romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. All this is potrayed marvellously by Jane Austen. I loved it so much that I've read it about 5 times till now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read a lot of different books. This is my all time favorite, I have read it several times in just a few months."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If this book needs a recommendation, it would be that it has been delighting readers for almost 200 years. In Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen has created the quintessential spunky heroine who refuses to let her somewhat low position on the social ladder dictate her behavior. Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience. She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself. She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title. He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The language of the book is, of course, quite different from modern-day phraseology, but it's worth plowing through the conversations of manners and morals to uncover the delightful story of this star-crossed duo. May it continue to delight readers for the next 200 years!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic novel follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage. The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage. Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign. Austen also has a great sense of humor, although many times I wondered whether it was intended as funny or whether it only appeared comical from a modern point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite novel. I read it for the first time in 10th grade and have read it 4 times since. Every time I get something new out of it and the story never loses its charm!Austen is an undeniably talented author and Pride and Prejudice is arguably her best work. All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life. The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there. Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides. Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development. This is not so with Pride and Prejudice. This book is a true gem. Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said. It has appeared in countless other books and media. I love this book for it's wit, it's humor, it's unconventional love story and because it is almost the singly best early example of individuals rebelling against conformity. This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn\`t contemporary.Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written. It is therefore a classic. I recommend it to readers who want to read an engrossing book with a lot of dialogue."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the best i have read in years. Every page it got better, and i finished the book in no time. Totally recommend it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Here's one more reader who finds Pride and Prejudice an excellent novel. I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal. I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it. I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters. In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be. One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted. I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite. I could not have been more wrong. I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother. However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious. Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity. The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws: the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight. If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments. Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written. The plot is as real today as it was when it was written. The characters are strong and vivid. Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been.

Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen knew what she was talking about, way before a time were women had many rights. Her characters in this book are witty, charming, and well spoken.

I'm here to tell you different. P&P; is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...This isn't to say that P&P; has no value to its readers. Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi. But what IS its value? The great moral lessons it imparts? Its grave lessons in proper deportment? Of course not. P&P; retains its value simply in being a good read. This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time. Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested. It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.Novels are read for different reasons. Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something. That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\" Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view. Austen's P&P; truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion. It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story. It doesn't have to teach us anything. It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England.

I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations. Women may be more independent today, but there are still women who seek marriages simply to validate themselves or their lifestyles. Not only have I enjoyed this book, I have learned from it.

I was not quite certain what to think.....that is until I started to get into the book. This novel is a delightful and intriguing romantic comedy. The pride of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett's prejudice against him are overcome as they learn that love can and does conquer. Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. With Mr. Collins' &quot;speeches&quot; and Mrs. Bennett desperately trying to marry off all her daughter's, who can help themselves?

She pokes sly fun at anything foolish, especially snobbish manners (i.e. Mr. Darcy and Lady Catherine de Bourgh).In this unmistakable classic, Jane Austen makes the reader laugh at Mr. Collins' foolish speeches, cringe at Mrs. Bennet's crude behavior, and angered at Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst's rudeness and cool manners.This is a delectable book; one for all to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Appropriate for every young male &amp; female inevery part of the world.

It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books. However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons. The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters. The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader. The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation. Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities. The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane. The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate. This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters. Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many. I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment. For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island. The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart. The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island. Perseverence would be the only way one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course. Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it. Enjoy! By the way, I only noticed your sample e-mail address after I finished this review"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This enchanting novel tells the story of Elizabeth Bennett, a young English woman with one elder and three younger sisters. Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother. Her father loves her dearly. He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family. The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau. Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story. I was unable to put this book down, but I regretted it not being any longer"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As always, Austen ridicules the conventions of the time, but acknowledges that they must be accepted. Women must find men (hopefully rich) to marry them; any feelings of love or respect in marriage are wonderful, but not always necessary or relevant. The characters are far from perfect --- pompous, superficial and greedy. Even the heroine of the novel, Elizabeth, is prone to prejudice. She is a willing participant in the titillating conversations with the proud Darcy and the envious Bingley sisters which serve to amuse and entertain the reader"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis.

My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well. I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women. The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period. I would tell him to take a hike if he came around. I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star. I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms. I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me. Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion. A decent read, but not a rave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am an avid reader of English classics so naturally, I came across P&amp;P fairly soon after I discovered my love of literature. I had heard so many glorious things about this novel (that it forms young women world wide, that the characters are incredibly convincing and realistic, etc.), that perhaps I was expecting a little bit more. Sure, Austen claimed she wrote about the &quot;things she knew about.&quot; Unfortunately, there were many other authors, female artists to be most specific, who were her contemporaries and wrote far more incredibly mind blowing novels (Mary Shelly comes to my mind).I will begin by saying that this book was wonderful to read. It was witty and the story line was intriguing enough that I had no trouble completing it a few days after beginning it (I will confess, I even gave up a few nights of slee to find out if Elizabeth's character flaws would resolve). The characters were convincing, the book well developed and not extremely predictable. Unfortunately, these assets did not redeem the novel in my eyes, because shortly after finishing it, I simply could not believe I had wasted a few days of valuable reading time to devote to a relatively 'numb' piece of literature. Simply put, I felt it lacked depth, and although it was witty and enjoyable to read, I do not exactly understand why it has lasted as a classic depiction of human existance. The plot was unrealistic, the ending contrived, and besides the obvious message that 'pride and prejudice are evil and indulging in either of these flaws will cause misery' I did not receive any further enlightenment by reading it. It is an excellent documentation of courting rituals during Austen's time, as well as what I imagine to be a realistic depiction of the concerns of upper-middle-class English society, but to be perfectly honest, who cares? If these subjects interest you, I'm sure you will be enthralled by Austen's work. I appreciate her and respect her because of the history she represents, and for this reason, you should NOT AVOID READING THIS BOOK, but I do not think I will ever be able to say her work moves me. Of course, I could be missing something. I'm only sixteen, so my distaste for P&amp;P could be the result of youth and foolishness. If any of you have read this novel were sincerely moved by it, I'd love to hear from you. There's nothing I hate more than simply 'not getting' a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book!

But I will read the longer fervesion this time seen I like it so will I thought that the pictures were great in my book. Jane austen is a great writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very nice story. However it is difficult to read because it is written in Old English. My favorite character would be Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy as she is frequently reffered. She is willing to let love walk out the door because another woman is interested. Lizzy definately dislikes competition. She does make her presence known. Not rudely, but can get very defensive and in that quite comical. Lizzy presents herself very well. Like they say &quot;A first impression is a lasting impression&quot;. I picture her as tall, very beautiful, and soft spoken. Unlike others she has a beautiful smell and good taste in clothing. Lizzy reminds me a lot of Emma Woodhouse in Emma and Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensability. Coincidently, both of these novels were also written by Jane Austen. The reason I believe these three characters are alike is because they each either search for love for other people and over-look their own need, in the case of Emma, or they simply allow other women to appear to fill in the role in the cases of Elinor and Lizzy. Another thing that relates Lizzy, Emma and Elinor is the fact that they are all very dependent and become so in the coarse of the novels. Their love interest are not a priority and they do not depend on their parents support emotionally. Lizzy grows as and individual when she spends two weeks at their friends house with her sister Jane. This seperation allows her to grow away from her parents to take care of Jane and make some of her own decisions. While there, she does not allow herself to show many emotions toward other people and over looks emotions displayed toward her by others. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, dislikes going out past their fence and that forces Emma to go out to social events on her own. In a way she becomes too dependent and doesn't realize what she may be missing out on with other characters of the book. Elinor appears to be unconcerned. Her love interest pops in and out of the novel and her true feelings are not completely revealed until the end of the novel. Her independence comes from helping her moher raise two of her sisters, Margarette and Marianne. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is enterested in branching out their reading experiences to old English romance. I enjoyed reading this book because of its interesting characters. There was always a mdest joke or disagreement, I was never bored. I also enjoyed picturing the events in my head. Some of the scenes were so beautiful. Taking place in lovely gardens you see only in your dreams, and extremely elegant mansions. Reminding me of the time I went to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Montecello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. Back then people were so polite. Rudeness was severly frowned upon especially when directed at or in the presence of a lady. Very different from today's society. It is interesting to see what it was like back then for entertainment without a television or radio. I enjoyed this novel very much as well as some of Jane Austen's other works which have been made into major motion pictures that are also very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I though is was a wonderful and Romantic Book. I like that Elizabeth is so headstrong and knows how to express her feelings toward Mr. Darcy. It shows him that she is no prize and she is a humanbing too. I will denfely read it again.

But level-headed Elizabeth, although unknown to her, has charmed the proud and prejudiced friend of Jane's love, and thus changes his outlook and opinion of the Bennett sisters.

BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Chinese (Teach Yourself Tape)","review":"The author is quite talented in the presentation of grammatical points. Her explanations of the structure of the language are intuitive and readable without being oversimplified or patronizing. This book contains a wealth of grammatical information, much more than other beginning books I have seen, and always clearly explained.Unfortunately, the book and tapes together contain only a small fraction of the amount of excercises, conversations, and other reinforcement that would be necessary to support the amount of vocabulary &amp; grammar presented. The tapes are good, with a steadily increasing pace, but you would need more of them to really get practice at listening. The readings are modern, friendly and interesting, but they are lacking in volume. Chapters 7-11 (out of 22) have such a high density of new vocabulary as to make the readings discouragingly difficult.If used by itself, this book may not be the best for self-study. However, I would recommend it as a supplement to any course. If you are having trouble with technical points of grammar, this book might make it easier for you. If you are taking a self-study program which espouses the &quot;conversation-only&quot; approach and lacks the grammatical information so useful to an intelligent adult, this book will provide it. I plan to keep it close at hand as a reference."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processing: DSP and Applications","review":"The online description states &quot;Ideal for introductory university modules&quot;, but the preface of the book (which is not included in the pages that are provided for online viewing) states &quot;This book is not a basic signal processing textbook... it is assumed you have a good knowledge of sampling, difference equations, z-transforms, FIR and IIR filters, FFT, etc.&quot; I was looking for something more basic so I sent it back."},{"Title":"City of broken promises","review":"Clearly this book has not had the attention it deserves. As one who traded in Hong Kong for many years, this book helped ease me into the cultural conflicted days of Britain opening China for its trade; tea and opium. This woman's ability to turn a dispicable personal situation into a success is worthy of anyone's attention interested in the history of these two cultures, both assuming to be the center of civilization at that colorful time.This is one of my favorite books of all time because it tells of overcoming irreversible adversity to forgive and succeed over it all. Set in Macao in the 1780-90s, it is the life story of a Chinese woman Martha Merop \\"who came with the house\\" and was the property of the son of the first Chairman of Lloyd's of London. Abandoned at birth, sold into prostitution, she became the richest woman on the China Coast and Macao's greatest bunlic benefactress. I manufactured in Hong Kong for twenty years and this was the book everyone read. I corresponded with Coates but never met him before he retired to Portugal and died in 1997. He as the son of the English composer Eric Coates.Frederick R. Andresen, Author of \\"Walking on Ice, An American Businessman in Russia,\\" over sixteen years in Russian business, six years in residence."},{"Title":"City of broken promises","review":"Coates is one of those colonial Brit types, who is probably most famous for his book Myself a Mandarin. He's the son of Tin Pan Alley composer Eric Coates, and an interesting writer about Asia and Asians. While he usually writes non-fiction (his books include histories of the Whampoa docks, the rubber trade, the Hong Kong telecommunications industry, Macau in the good old days, etc.), this is his attempt at a novel set in 18th-century Macau.As a novel, you could easily do better. But if you want to hear someone tell a story of Old Macau, at a time when Hong Kong was still part of San On county in the Qing government, you have no other choice. Since none of the 20th Century's great authors have taken an interest in Macau, Coates currently claims the land for himself. The story is quite romantic. It's also quasi-historical, in that the main female protaginist was an actual person. Coates draws on his extensive research of Macanese history to flesh out the plot.Again, for someone who wants to be whisked away to this far-off time and place, Austin Coates is your best (and only) choice."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I am a minister and I see many people loving her other books but not liking this one because of the politics. I believe she is hitting the Christian Right where they live. She has moved from their \\"priest\\" (in former books) to \\"prophet\\" (in Plan B).It seems the Christian Right does not like the prophet on their door step. Sorry she does not reconcile your idea of Jesus liking war, giving tax breaks to the rich and waging war on the eco-system. She speaks like Jesus, chosing love over law in that radical and even \\"four letter word\\" way. By the way there is swearing in the Bible, ask a good biblical scholar and they can tell you where."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Traveling Mercies ranks as one of my favorites. Though my political viewpoint is quite different from the authors, her insights that illustrate how you could work around your own bias and experience the holy in your own human failings was totally up my alley.I was sorely disappointed by the venom that whacks you upside the head shortly after opening the book. I guess loving your neighbor as yourself only applies to those folks whose politics are not too far off from your own.I had to get it returned before it tainted my love of her other books. If it were not for those other writings I would have rated this book NO stars! I pray that her next offering will be more about faith than hate."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"With the political scene these days being so meshed with right-wing religious influences, I found it refreshing to read a Christian perspective that didn't embrace the party line. This was my first book by Lamott.She discussed the challenges in her life (teenage son, getting older and wider, troubled relations with mother, disagreeing with the US war in Iraq, etc) with honesty and wit, admitting that it can be hard to keep the faith toward those we disagree with.One reader writes they wish she had expressed her sorrow (not anger) about the state of the world, but Lamott does have anger and to not express that would be dishonest. She struggles with it. We read because we too can relate to the anger, sadness, and struggle (in whatever area of our life). Another reader states she is still searching rather than living by Jesus' word. Isn't that Lamott's point? It is hard to live in the world today and placidly face its challenges."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"When I read this book, I felt like I could have written every word. Like Anne, I sometimes think that I make Christ drink himself to sleep at night. I wish she was my sister.Anne writes for us Christians who aren't afraid to say in really expressive terms what we really think and feel about our faith. To me, it seems like most Christian writers live in a rainbow gumdrop unicorn world where nothing bad ever happens - not Anne. She is so refreshingly honest about her struggles with both her family, friends and faith and her redeeming moments. If you are uncomfortable with people who share exactly what they feel without mincing words, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is back in all of her glorious humor, angst, and wisdom. If you haven't discovered Anne yet, she is shock therapy for those of us who learned how to be religious before we learned how to be human.In Traveling Mercies, Anne shared her crooked journey through alcoholism, bulimia, and broken relationships to a connection with St. Andrews Presbyterian Church and Jesus. Now, in Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith, Anne shares the new challenges to her faith: The Bush Administration, her aging mother, menopause, the losing friends to illness, teaching Sunday School, and raising her teen-aged son, Sam. While many of her crises in Plan B are stock milestones of middle age they are no less poignant when rendered by Anne's pen.Anne's power comes from her unflinching authenticity, a scarce quality in the self-serving industry of memoir writing. Anne describes her life has it happens, without bothering to airbrush away her neurotic impulses and imperfections. Her self-depreciating humor and honesty creates a picture of spirituality reminiscent of Dostoevsky; we are all simultaneously noble and depraved. As I read Plan B, I laughed with Anne at her foibles and became more honest about my own.Anne Lamott, along with Fredrick Buechner, might be the best living Christian Author that you can't find at a Christian book store. Anne elevates cursing to a literary art form. More significantly, Anne is openly pro-choice and pro-gay rights. She addresses God as a feminine being. Some readers might balk at her left-wing politics. However, I'd challenge any reader to see Anne as more than the sum of her politics and ideas. Reading anything by Anne Lamott creates the opportunity to remember that God wills and works through your bad attitudes, flawed character, and humanity. Wading through Anne's positions is worth any personal risk you might feel. Encountering her writing style is a joyous experience and you'll bump into God's grace as often as you will step in piles of human frailty.Anne is back and triumphant."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"OK, so I loved Anne Lamott before I read this book, but now I love her more. Her lecture agent once told me that Anne had a problem when people who read her books thought they were friends, because, of course, she doesn't know them. Well, if I ever saw her in person, I'd want to hug her, too. She writes with such clarity, such fearless honesty, such humanness. She shares and validates my faith in a God who understands brokenness and the grace of striving to heal, to be better than you are. Reading \\"Plan B\\" is a healing journey -- I laughed out loud and cried. I will read it over and over."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I never take time to review anything, but I can't help myself in this case. Anne Lamott's insights are the perfect balm in a world when the righteous right seems to have wrapped Christians in a tidy black and white, neo conservative, judgmental and pontificating profile to file with the world. Christianity isn't about having the answers. It's about working earnestly every day to allow our own lives to reveal a little more of the love and incredible Grace demonstrated by a God who proved his unwarranted love through the ultimate gift of the life of his son, Jesus. Anne Lamott's honest writing and self-deprecating style make room for all of us to relate, and I believe our relating to one another is where the world's healing will begin.If you love George Bush and you love Jesus, you can still love this book. What Anne shares about her personal political plight in coming to grips with treating the President as a child of God can be applied to anyone in our own lives with whom we seem to share little common ground. It is a great lesson and a great book. I'm buying four more copies today for gifts."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"One of the reasons I enjoy reading Anne Lamott is because she is not afraid of being Anne Lamott and this comes through in her writing. She is an original voice, shoots from the hip, and lets her words fall where they may. She is also a believer in God, not a cookie-cut version of God, but a God like the God who bargained with Abraham, wrestled with Jacob, and could be fiery like a prophet. This God is also big enough to put up with Anne's foibles and knows that Anne is not a finished piece of work. Some find her interpretation of God enlightening, and others have difficulties since it is not always scripturally based or dogmatically correct. Because Lamott is such a unique voice in spiritual writing, I could not wait to read her newest book PLAN B: FURTHER THOUGHTS ON FAITH. While I enjoyed it overall, there were also moments where I was disappointed.Those who are familiar with Lamott's writing and enjoy what she has to say will find her irreverent yet witty style still intact. More than likely readers will also see a great strength and a great weakness in this volume which do not balance each other out in the book. The strength is her faith itself. It has matured and developed since TRAVELING MERCIES. It is a nuanced faith, and a faith that is real. It can be jarring at times to those of us who somehow fall into the category of \\"mainstream Christian,\\" but we can't fault her for that. Jesus Christ was hardly mainstream either. What potentially is a strength that can add a new dimension to religious discussion is weakened whenever she talks about the current presidency and the war in Iraq. She has some valid points that people of faith should be considering. There area few moments where we see that she is angered at the injustice of war, but instead of focusing on peace or the atrocities as so many other writers of faith would do, she spews her hatred for President Bush and all things right wing, but it sounds just like angry words, and at times just sounds like bellyaching. While she may consider hate too strong a word, her writing seems to state otherwise. At times her anger is so strong, she sounds like those she is criticizing, only offering the opposite perspective.Though the book has some serious flaws, I do believe it is worth reading. We do see that faith and conversion is an ongoing process. We see a woman who loves her son and is doing the best she can as a mother. We read the words of a writer who is honest about how she feels, and she also has plenty of anecdotes about the Church she belongs to which sounds vital and under the direction of a vibrant pastor. It tells the reader a great deal about Anne Lamott, but readers will have to decide for themselves if it says a great deal about faith."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I love Anne LaMott for the same reason holier-than-thou reviewers like B.C. despise her. They are addicted to some judgmental, doctrinaire version of Christianity that spells God \\"EGO.\\" Anne LaMott has made room for Jesus in her heart and learned about love, compassion, fairness and humor, and many other virtues that Jesus tried to teach us before he was over-interpreted and manipulated by people who use him as a commodity they can sell. Money changers in the temple!LaMott reflects the thinking of people who know God is still speaking, directly, to them - and calling upon them to do what is most difficult, act with love and responsibility in the midst of a world that makes it easy to hate and hurt others. For those of you who feel demoralized by the injustice that perpetrators insist on defending as \\"faith-based,\\" you will find here a simple, brilliant person who listens to the whispers of God, and \\"gets it.\\" What a blessing!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is, well, many of us. Theology just always comes down to \\"How did you treat the least of these?\\" If you feel it's inappropriate to admit nastiness, mind clutter, personal hypocrisies.....(sin!) and still call yourself a Christian, then you shouldn't even try to read this book. If you're certain, totally certain, about anything, you may be put off by Anne Lamott. If you're sure that none of us left-wingers might sashay through Heaven's pearly gates, you might not have room for Anne's irreverence, or her calling out contradictions between her faith and the current political climate. For me, Plan B calls me to be, and to acknowledge, what I am: a sinner redeemed by the inexpressible Love of God, Himself. Alternately grateful and indignant, full of praise or uncertainty, loving and accepting or consumingly selfish, in the end I know \\"whose\\" I am. I'm grateful to Anne Lamott for bringing Christ-ness into the bright, examining light of daily life; you might come to remember that that is where Christ hangs out."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Lamott does it again!Deeply spiritual, deeply honest, and incredibly funny, Anne Lamott once again presents a collection of 'thoughts on faith' that is so much more. What Lamott calls thoughts are really heart-deep reflections and ponderings from everything from the mundane to the most sacred, from the stuff of parenting and pet-rearing and travel, to the realms of politics, church life, spiritual disciplines, and the ongoing journey into maturity. Whether she's learning to love her mother, her president, or her own thighs, Lamott never takes herself too seriously, and never lets her audience escape from the honesty of her lens. Whether this book challenges you or resonates in your spirit, it is not one that can be easily dismissed."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Equisitely written magazine articles brought together in one book. Questions of Faith and Race and other big issues are dealt with with incredible honesty and truth. I love the way she writes. If you devour it too quickly, it can feel a bit samey, but if you read it slowly, take a break between chapters, it is indeed a soul refreshing draught of water. I got it from the library and immediately went out and bought a copy. That's how much a keeper it is. :)"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne LaMott never ceases to amaze me with her honest vulnerability and complete faith in God. Her writing is so open, so willing to admit her own weaknesses, as she said at the Politics and Spirituality conference in Washington, DC this past weekend (January 14-16, 2006) \\"If you want healing, pull out your secrets.\\" And in sharing hers with us, readers are reminded of the spiritual freedom of surrendering our own insecurities. A truly inspiring writer and speaker."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott retrieves faith, and Christianity in particular, from the jaws of those who would privitize it for their own organized clubs. With her honesty and wit, she gives faith back to each individual to accept as the gift of Grace it was meant to be. Along with \\"Traveling Mercies\\" \\"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith\\" is a ticket to the transformative power and the joys of true religion."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Every time I read a book by Anne Lamott I think it must be her very best and then, along comes yet another. Perhaps it is her tendency to be as absolutely honest as possible with herself and with the reader that frightens us. But it is her openness about her own journey into Christ that draws us to the hope that He is real and able to grow us into the people of which C.S. Lewis wrote. To have come so far against such odds is great achievement, to share the trip in such an unflinchingly personal way is to give us real clues to overcoming our own struggles. The piece on losing Sadie left me teary in a public place. The account of Sam tight in the grip of teenage angst took me back to those times when my own children tempted me to felonious acts of rage. For those Christians among us who support Mr. Bush's foreign policies it would be well to remember that the dissenter has always had and must continue to have a place in American society. Anne mentions Bush as a man who also calls upon The Name making him a brother. Do we always agree with our brother? Of course not. Isn't that true of a healthy family, of a free society? I admire Anne's commmitment to other people, to causes bigger than any one individual. They may not be my own causes but her personal involvement puts my own little activities to shame. Thanks Anne for this terrific and personal look into your view from there."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I love Anne Lamott's writing and her neurotic confessional style. Traveling Mercies was probably one of the most important spiritual books of the last 10 years. Plan B, however is not a worthy successor. For one, it isn't a BOOK, it is a collection of uncollectable pieces. They all stand out well but have no unifying strand. She tends to repeat herself a lot too because of this; by the time you get to page 100 you will get sick of hearing about George W.On the other hand, if you are a Christian leftist, frustrated with the Religious Right's hijacking of Chistendom, it might be therapeutic - the redundancy that makes me want to stab myself in the eye with a pencil might bring some inner healing to the right person. I hate politics on all levels, so it's hard for me to empathize with someone as politically minded as Anne Lamott.The writing itself seems strained in some places, as Lamott refers to her \\"thinky thoughts\\" and her \\"bodily body\\" and other bizarre word-usages that will have you scratching your head wondering where her editor was when that page was approved. When she wants to explain to you, her audience, why she thinks someone is a great person, she merely says that they are \\"totally leftist\\" and leaves it at that. What disappoints me is that this is a deep as it gets. Why not explain why you believe in leftist principles and go in depth into whatever right-wing policies you are railing against, Ms. Lamott? Why not give us some real thoughts, if you are so bent on getting political?Instead she keeps things mainly on a knee-jerk emotional level, with no real substance to offer. She agonizes over a picture of the president, with his \\"Yertle the Turtle mouth\\" and struggles to find anything to like about him. She knows he is a Christian like her, but condescendingly struggles to see his humanity. In so doing, she becomes what she hates. A political hack. A black-and-white moralist. A dull, dull writer, compared to the writer who wrote Traveling Mercies.Still, even at her worst, she's still pretty damn good. There are some beautiful patches here and there, between her juvenile descriptions of George W's evil features and her spoiled son's annoying tomfoolery. Wait for it on paperback. Look to it for light reading, because unfortunately that's all it is."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"\\"On my forty-ninth birthday, I decided that all of life was hopeless, and I would eat myself to death.\\" So begins PLAN B: Further Thoughts on Faith, a collection of delightfully honest and gritty essays from Salon.com columnist Anne Lamott.Lamott, like the best essayists, finds most of her inspiration in the ordinary stuff of living: the exhaustion of parenting, the frustration over a middle-aged body, and despair over the state of the world. In OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS, Lamott gave us a window into her life as a new single mother and her battle to kick her addictions. In TRAVELING MERCIES, she chronicled her spiritual awakening (kicking and screaming) into Christianity.In PLAN B, Lamott's Sam is a teenager, Sam's birth father is back in the picture (sort of), and she is moving toward a menopausal 50. With all the hormones rocketing around, \\"Sometimes the house gets crowded.\\" Her faith has matured, but she quickly cuts through any notions of super-spirituality. Lamott refuses to put a \\"holiness filter\\" on her prose or her lifestyle; her language leans more toward truck driver than toward Tipper Gore. In an early essay, she writes of a talk she gives at church that receives enthusiastic applause, followed a few hours later by a rip-roaring fight with Sam. \\"It's hard to imagine things can get so ugly so quickly, just because the word \\"homework\\" has come up....\\" Any parent of a teenager will commiserate.It's these moments when Lamott shares what she calls our \\"ugly common secrets\\" that make us keep turning the pages, sort of like rubbernecking at an accident site. Her language is vivid and fresh, whether she's describing a ham she wins unexpectedly at the market as \\"ten pounds of salty pink eraser,\\" or the hills behind her house where she walks almost every day, \\"a quiet and holy space.\\"Some of Lamott's best observations are on prayer. \\"The problem with God --- or at any rate, one of the top five most annoying things about God --- is that He or She rarely answers right away. It can take days, weeks.\\" She reminds herself that when you pray, \\"you are not starting the conversation from scratch, just remembering to plug back into a conversation that is always in progress.\\" Some days, she refreshingly admits, she hardly knows what to pray for. \\"Peace? Well, whatever.\\"When she starts a Sunday school, she unearths some unpleasant truths. \\"It turned out that I did not like children, or at any rate, they made me extremely nervous, and I had almost nothing to share with them, except that Jesus loved them, and I did too, even when I was in a bad mood.\\" Teaching Sunday school also unexpectedly spawns racial tension. After working toward reconciliation, she philosophically concludes, \\"Time, and showing up, turn most messes to compost, and something surprising may grow....\\"Reconciliation isn't easy, as we see when Lamott reflects on her departed mother. \\"While she was alive, I spent my life like a bitter bell-hop, helping my mother carry around her psychic trunks.... For a while I did not miss her at all, and did not forgive her a thing.\\" Forgiveness, she finds, comes not as a landslide, but rather as small \\"mosaic chips.\\" The ability to do so arrives as a gift: \\"Grace means you're in a different universe from where you had been stuck, when you had absolutely no way to get there on your own.\\"It's this same grace she claims for herself; \\"God must see me as so many people at once: beloved, nuts, luminous, full of shadow.\\" Whether she is reminiscing about her persona at 48 (the Menopausal Death Crone), participating in a peace march, lamenting the loss of a beloved dog, or nicknaming the jiggly areas on her legs and butt \\"the aunties,\\" we see her as she believes God does, full of flaws and creativity, insecurity and pride, and rage and love. Someone a lot like us.Like any collection of essays, this one is a bit uneven in spots (one chapter is a commencement address of sorts), and the time frame skips around. Savor it a chapter at a time rather than gulping it down in one long narrative read. Less ardent Democrats may also find the continual Bush-bashing a too-easy device. But what makes this book sparkle is Lamott's signature voice, wrenching honesty, willingness to look at our \\"ugly common secrets,\\" and authentic, hard-won faith. Don't miss it.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Key line in this book: she is writing about her youth and says, \\"I couldn't deal with any more abortions.\\"Then she navigates away from this rather remarkable statement, going on about I forget what. Why had she had to have abortons? How has that opened her eyes about women's rights? How does she view herself?There is also a very unpleasant tone of: \\"I can make do with my perfect San Francisco apartment, my low-stress, high-profile job, and my partying friends. I guess I can accept the rigors of Christianity.\\" It's hard to take life advice form someone who seems to have had zero stress in her life and who sems pretty comfortable. Oh, wait, there's those abortions. Too bad she didn't mention more about them, she could have had something there.To me, being Christian means suffering with thr world, and giving things away to alleviate suffering. I'm suspicious that Lamott is more of the \\"rich young man\\" variety rather than the \\"Good Samaritan.\\" And recall, both were pretty decadent.I read a lot of Christian memoirs, and I guess since I'd never heard of her before, I now know why.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I will preface my review by saying that I have been a huge Anne Lamott fan for years, enjoying her nonfiction writing more than her fiction.

Jesus is made in her likeness, and God becomes her alter ego.The things she reveals of herself would be better said to a paid professional, though you must give her credit.

Her continued diatribes against Bush and the right wing (an undefined term) showed a bitterness of spirit and a willingness to demean that astonished me. Had she attacked the left wing with the same venom I would have had the same reaction. Stylistically, I found the cussing distracting and was continuously reminded of a comment by a high school English teacher that only those with a limited vocabulary resort to swearing.I would defend to the death her right to express her opinions by whatever vehicle in whatever forum she likes. But I view this book as further evidence that while religion may be useful tool in politics, politics is always bad for religion. The message that we are cherished by Christ in all of wretched humanness regardless of where we are in our lives got totally lost.Having said all that there were many essays I liked -- particularly the church of 80% sincerity and the ham story. People who are deathly serious about everything all the time like so many religious folks just aren't that attractive to the rest of the world! So good for Ms. Lamott for \\"taking it light\\" -- draw in the crowds first and THEN show them how amazing it is to be a Christian.I sobbed through Travelling Mercies -- my copy is so underlined and starred and waterlogged that I wouldn't dare let another soul look at it for what it might reveal about me!

The bad movie does -- and often will -- allow one to close weary and heavy lids with perchance to dream. There's no chance of slumbering with Anne Lamott's dry-drunk rage against the evils of the GOP, the evil George Bush, his far too proper and prim wife Laura Bush, the bad daddy patriarch and also heinously evil George Herbert Walker Bush, and let's -- for convenience sake -- apply the aforementioned traits to the only superficially kind Barbara Bush, and, at last, in what you'll discover is only a rare and occasional lapse of fevered hatred in Lamott's faith meditation, a milder rant or two heaped upon former attorney general John Ashcroft and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Somehow I feel I've missed someone. But perhaps you're concerned with the possible harshness of the term dry-drunk? Yes, I know that categorizing the saintly Lamott as a dry-drunk may seem so, but when St. Anne gives no quarter to a Bush DUI transgression of thirty years ago what choice is there? You only get what you give is the law of reciprocity -- another Christian principle.So the assessment stands: Anne Lamott is a dry-drunk. She's funny, but she's also mean and angry, and yet to her credit admits as much. I hope she can unravel her own personal bitter knots while being a bit lenient on elected officials, and those within Christ's Church who happen to be outside her immediate circle of enlightened bay-area adherents.

Life is not perfect and neither are the people in it."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"INTOLERANT. INTOLERABLE.I ran into the 'f' word twice (not to mention other gratuitous profanities and rantings against the duly elected government that got old really quick by chapter 1!) by an ostensibly 'christian' author before I had to close the book in disgust and put it backwards behind other books on the 'New Age' shelf where I first found it.Not for sensible, sensitive-to-those-disagreed-with, reading.INDIGESTIBLE. INEXCUSABLE."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"First, let me say, that I absolutely ADORE \\"Bird by Bird\\" and \\"Traveling Mercies.\\" Anne Lamott is unlike any writer I've ever read. She is honest, sincere and tremendously funny.Second, I must admit that I am not fully eligible to write a review for this book; I have not yet read it. But, what I must say is that I did read the first chapter, and on that I will base my review.The first paragraph of the book begins by bashing George W. Bush. I have figured out that Lamott is a liberal from her other books, and I still love and respect them, but this book starts off on a whole different note from her others.I respect Anne Lamott, and in time, I will read the entire book, and I will write another review if my opinions have changed. But for now, I will wait until it comes out in soft cover. (A bit less expensive, as I feel that purchasing the hardcover is a little too much: I don't agree with a word she said in the first chapter.)Happy reading if you choose to do so!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I was truly disappointed in this book. It's my first \\"Lamott\\" read and fully expected a book subtitled \\"further thoughts on faith\\" to actually be uplifting. This book was a \\"downer\\" for me. Someone claiming to be a Christian using the \\"f word\\" as liberally as she did and inserting her hatred (by her own admission) of George Bush in every other essay whether it \\"fit\\" or not was truly annoying. Some might think this \\"refreshing\\" but it wasn't for me. I'm all for living one's beliefs and following Jesus' example of charity, but I don't think that \\"being human\\" is an excuse to use that kind of language and displaying hatred. Having said that, I did enjoy her essays about her teenage son, her thighs and her mother. I just wish the overall negativity hadn't tarnished it all."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is talented writer with a gift for prose. Unfortunately, in this case she chose to use her considerable gifts to rip the President, democracy, patriotism and every other traditional value known to man.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Profane pontificating. Smorgasbord spirituality. Desecrating to the Bible & Jesus (See chapter : \\"Ham of God\\"). Envisions the disciples drunk, uttering blasphemous remarks/vulgarity after Jesus' murder: 'We're ****ed!'This sort of personally-tailored eclectic hodgepodge belief system and overreliance on junior-high-locker-room-trashtalk for maximal expressiveness and shock value are definitely an acquired DIStaste."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"This book stunk. I really, really enjoyed reading Bird by Bird and Traveling Mercies, so much I recommended them to friends. I could not do the same with this book. I felt dirty reading it and that I was in cahoots with Ms. LaMott and her unhealthy dislike of George W. Bush. Really, Ms. LaMott, he's just one man and a human at that. Let it go. No person should make you that unhappy, especially if you've probably never met him. Go back to writing about other topics and do what you do best. In the meanwhile, I will be waiting and reading the reviews of the next book before I actually sit down to read the book myself-so that I will not be subjected to the same ranting."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Reduces Christian Faith to her tailored manageable version minus the intolerable parts and gains popularity for denigrating the Lord with her revisionistic approach to Bible accounts of Jesus' life. Why tamper with history with such bizarre commentary and quirky application that seems to suit her taste? \\"If it's offensive, in your face, off the wall, then: deal with it!\\" is the attitude that shouts from the pages. Doesn't make for a winsome, inclusive, loving, embracing-your-enemies sort of Faith that attracts outsiders (or other insiders, for that matter!)If only there were something Closer than Further, Attractive than Repellant!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott's witt, dramas, questions, faith are all there as in her previous books. I enjoyed reading this book so much that I hated to reach the end. She speaks at my level and really hits home with her struggles with her realtionships with her son, boyfriends, friends, relatives, her church, even her dead mother. She also has many moments of joy and acceptance with all of these people and find a growing contentment with herself and her life. She is down-to-earth and so real. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Full of herself, full of ignorance, full of hatred, full of superiority.I liked \\"Bird by Bird\\" but this book is just a continuous rant. And I don't really like rants that go on and on. A good short rant, to the point, that can be interesting, but she says this book is thoughts on faith. It's really not. It's just her blabbing on and on and on and on.She seems so proud when she writes of how she screams at her son and then apologizes! Wow. What a good parent! Why doesn't she just control herself in the first place? It's all about HER.I really tried to like this book but it is offensive.A friend loaned me the book. I gave it a good try. I began each essay and finished about half, got 1/2 way thru the rest.Her irrational hatred of Pres. Bush is strange, really on the edge. I wonder if Lamott is still sober. There isn't a lot of humility here.Her nobility almost overwhelms her, she is so wonderful.She \\"slips\\" when talking to a black friend and makes an insensitive, somewhat racist remark. What she said was what she really means, even though she says she didn't mean it like it sounded. It's obvious she's the superior person. Her true character shows in this book.One essay \\"this dog's life\\" is sickening. Her dog is sick, dying, but she has a vet (a jerk in my opinion) who doesn't believe in putting animals down unless they are in pain -- even if the animal is dying -- and he gives Anne syringes of sedative for when the time comes that dog is almost dead. The labored breathing of the dog concerns Lamott but her vet assures her the dog doesn't feel any pain. As someone who has had many dogs, I wonder how that vet could tell by listening to the dog's breathing over the phone that the dog was not in pain! (I couldn't help but think of Terri Schiavo.) This is a quote of what the vet says: \\"She's not really in distress,\\" he assured me [Lamott]. \\"This is hard work, like labor. And she has you, Jesus, and narcotics. We should all by so lucky.\\"Excuse me, I think I'll go throw up now."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"\\"On my forty-ninth birthday, I decided that all of life was hopeless, and I would eat myself to death.\\" So begins PLAN B: Further Thoughts on Faith, a collection of delightfully honest and gritty essays from Salon.com columnist Anne Lamott.Lamott, like the best essayists, finds most of her inspiration in the ordinary stuff of living: the exhaustion of parenting, the frustration over a middle-aged body, and despair over the state of the world. In OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS, Lamott gave us a window into her life as a new single mother and her battle to kick her addictions. In TRAVELING MERCIES, she chronicled her spiritual awakening in Christianity.In PLAN B, Lamott's Sam is a teenager, Sam's birth father is back in the picture (sort of), and she is moving toward a menopausal 50. With all the hormones rocketing around, \\"Sometimes the house gets crowded.\\" Her faith has matured, but she quickly cuts through any notions of super-spirituality. Lamott refuses to put a \\"holiness filter\\" on her prose or her lifestyle; her language leans more toward truck driver than toward Tipper Gore. In an early essay, she writes of a talk she gives at church that receives enthusiastic applause, followed a few hours later by a rip-roaring fight with Sam. \\"It's hard to imagine things can get so ugly so quickly, just because the word \\"homework\\" has come up....\\" Any parent of a teenager will commiserate.It's these moments when Lamott shares what she calls our \\"ugly common secrets\\" that makes us keep turning the pages, sort of like rubbernecking at an accident site. Her language, while often profane, is also vivid and fresh, whether she's describing a ham she wins unexpectedly at the market as \\"ten pounds of salty pink eraser\\" or the hills behind her house where she walks almost every day, \\"a quiet and holy space.\\"Some of Lamott's best observations are on prayer. \\"The problem with God - or at any rate, one of the top five most annoying things about God --- is that He... rarely answers right away. It can take days, weeks.\\" She reminds herself that when you pray, \\"you are not starting the conversation from scratch, just remembering to plug back into a conversation that is always in progress.\\" Some days, she refreshingly admits, she hardly knows what to pray. \\"Peace? Well, whatever.\\"When she starts a Sunday school, she unearths some unpleasant truths. \\"It turned out that I did not like children, or at any rate, they made me extremely nervous, and I had almost nothing to share with them, except that Jesus loved them, and I did too, even when I was in a bad mood.\\" Teaching Sunday school also unexpectedly spawns racial tension. After working toward reconciliation, she philosophically concludes, \\"Time, and showing up, turn most messes to compost, and something surprising may grow....\\"Reconciliation isn't easy, as we see when Lamott reflects on her departed mother. \\"While she was alive, I spent my life like a bitter bell-hop, helping my mother carry around her psychic trunks.... For a while I did not miss her at all, and did not forgive her a thing.\\" Forgiveness, she finds, comes not as a landslide, but rather as small \\"mosaic chips.\\" The ability to do so arrives as a gift: \\"Grace means you're in a different universe from where you had been stuck, when you had absolutely no way to get there on your own.\\"It's this same grace she claims for herself; \\"God must see me as so many people at once: beloved, nuts, luminous, full of shadow.\\" Whether she is reminiscing about her persona at 48 (the Menopausal Death Crone), participating in a peace march, lamenting the loss of a beloved dog, or nicknaming the jiggly areas on her legs and butt \\"the aunties,\\" we see her as she believes God does --- full of flaws and creativity, insecurity and pride, and rage and love. Someone a lot like us.Like any collection of essays, this one is a bit uneven in spots (one chapter is a commencement address of sorts) and the time frame skips around. Savor it a chapter at a time rather than gulping it down in one long narrative read. Republicans will likely find the continual Bush-bashing offensive and a too-easy device. But what makes this book sparkle is Lamott's signature voice, wrenching honesty, willingness to look at our \\"ugly common secrets,\\" and authentic, hard-won faith. Don't miss it.[...]"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I love books and reading. I read Traveling Mercies and enjoyed it and learned and was touched by it. I tried to read this book but couldn't get past the Bush bashing. Comparing him to Osama bin Laden was the last straw. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody, except maybe Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott loves Jesus and isn't afraid to say so. She's also not afraid to show how messed up her life (just like the lives of all of us) is. While some readers might get tired of her string of self-deprecating stories, I find it refreshing to find someone who is not only vulnerable, but also a gifted writer.I will admit, though, that after awhile I got tired of hearing how much Anne hates George Bush but doesn't want to hate George Bush because Jesus loves George Bush, but still she hates him anyway and Jesus is helping her with that, and... well, you get the picture. I can accept it for one story, but it becomes one of the underlying themes of the book. I'm surprised that someone as gifted and insightful as Anne Lamott has such one-dimensional political views (republicans=bad! democrats=good!), but I can accept it because her writing is so darn good.After reading this and \\"Traveling Mercy\\" I can't wait for \\"Plan C.\\""},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott's certainly an engaging and witty writer. However, it was the substance of the book that caught my attention - and got me thinking. Allow me to express my questions below.Regarding Lamott's faith maybe hers is best be described as general spirituality. Some have described her as, \\"A Presbyterian in dreadlocks who wears a red cotton cord blessed by the Dalai Lama and a Virgin Mary medallion... She believes in karma, and swears. A lot.\\" However, she also claims to be a 'born-again Christian'. I wonder what that means, (born-again Christian?) and wish she would have revealed more about that.She's been applauded for her easily trusted essays as they don't try to 'convince the reader of anything'. Is there anything she's garnered through her years worthy of promoting to others? If so, wouldn't convincing 'the reader of anything' be a virtue?Lamott's spirituality comes into clearer focus when she writes, \\"God has extremely low standards.\\" I was thinking, would Jesus have suggested the same or the opposite? She goes on to say, \\"Pray, take care of people, be actively grateful for your blessings, give away your money -- you're cool. You're in.\\" I wondered how the Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus fits with her suggestion of salvation through being a good person? Are they the same - because they appear to be different?Of course her trademark quirky sense of humor helps smooth over many of the rough spots. In fact, she uses it with incredible precision. However, I wanted her to explain her terms and ideas in greater detail."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I am an aspiring author and I am inspired by Anne LaMott more than any other author. Her newest work shows her growth in life as well as in writing. She deals honestly with her feelings regarding life and the struggles within it. I was encouraged by her words, comforted by her story and touched by her gutsy, raw and real way of depicting how she lives. The chapter that was of particular interest to me was the one on motherhood. I have a two year old and am often overwhelmed. Her words empowered me to keep loving, keep mothering and keep writing. Lastly, I am grateful to Ms. Lamott for writing so candidly about her faith. I love Jesus, but sometimes find it hard to live in faith. Reading her words encourages me to find that small place in my heart that does believe and nurture it, however difficult and scary. It is nice to know that I am in good company."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"If you have warm feelings of sweetness when you witness what Christianity in our country has become, you will not like this book. If you feel hopeful, like a child whose birthday is just a day or so away because you see our country returning to good old Christian values and making right--at long last right--the mistake of separating church and state, you will not like this book. If your heart quickens with thrill to have a born-again national administration and you bask in the quiet joy of the prospect of having our country returned to a Christianity of a glory not seen since days of Cromwell, you will not like this book. If, by your actions, you daily demonstrate that your object of worship is the Bible, you will not like this book. If yours is the Christianity of Revelations; of God's power, might, and unwavering, righteous judgment--you will not like this book.If yours is a Christianity where, for maybe the first time it history, what is divine was revealed to be more like a baby in a manger or a man unjustly executed on a cross than like the power, might and glory of an ancient despot, you will like this book. If yours is a Christianity where it was revealed that love and compassion are more important and more vital than power and judgment, you will like this book. If God is more important to you than the Bible, you will like this book. If Jesus has touched your life in such a way that you are heartsick--soulsick--at the hatred, fear and contempt that today masquerades as Christian piety, you will like this book. And if you are sick to your very soul to see this masquerade parading in the highest halls of political power and rendering unto God the things at are Caesar's, you will like this book.I, for one, would no more touch popular American Christianity today than I would Afghan Taliban Islam. I am grieved to behold the sack and ruin of a perfectly good religion by a primitive piety of fear, exclusivity and fierce judgment. I am grieved almost to the point of despair when I behold the conservative eclipse of the wonder of the incarnation of Christ revealing that love is more important than power and revealing it in such a way that, for a time, the world into which Jesus was born caught fire with the power of this truth. And I am grieved because when I look at this truth against the backdrop of the history of our kind, it is as if God indeed revealed this truth to us for our salvation for it seems that only this truth--the truth that love and compassion are more vital and important than power and might--only this truth can save us now.I am less surprised that Anne Lamott richly includes her despair and outrage at contemporary politics in her reflections on faith than I am that she has managed to maintain her Christian faith while living in an America that slouches unrelentingly toward the holy state of Christian theocracy, in which auto de fe is replaced by inquisition de fag. I am amused that there are those who find her new book offensive because of her expressions of outrage and despair at the willful destruction of the U.S. Constitution in favor of a presidential monarchy. Apparently, one is allowed to mingle politics and faith only if one's religio-political orientation is that of popular American Christianity, i.e., if you share the prevailing belief that the \\"Reagan Revolution\\" should find its natural conclusion in an American theocracy ruled by fiat by a born again appointee of the godhead, the chosen instrument of God's righteous judgment.Whatever the pain she must feel as a minority Christian of the Beatitudes living in the new American Christian theocracy of Revelations, Anne is still able to help us see and marvel at the love that can hold and keep us through our frailties, a love that mystics of every age--Buddha, Jesus, Rumi--have known to infuse the heart of all there is, a love that inspires, in T.S. Eliot's phrase, the laughter at the heart of things. And, as Anne reminds us, \\"laughter is carbonated holiness.\\""},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I like Anne Lamott's writings but she continuously bashes the President in this book.

How many folks have felt that way? I have. Since my son has done three tours in Iraq in the last three years Anne Lamott has the same feelings I do for our current administration. Sorry, but it's how I feel. I enjoyed this book -- the insight to little things, the desperate clinging and wanting of hope when you feel totally wiped out and can't move another inch, the thought of is God really listening resonated deep within me. There was one story that had some very \\"salty\\" language that could of been left out; but, overall I will recommend this to people. It's nice to read about others muddling through, doing the best they can and it's not always picture perfect."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamot takes the \\"Thee and Thou\\" out of her relationship to Jesus and puts him directly in her heart.

I also struggle with loving others as Jesus does. I also struggle with anger and frustration. So, I give this book three stars more as a comparison to other Anne Lamott work. I LOVE TO READ ANNE LAMOTT'S WRITING - in books and at Salon.com. I think I simply expected too much here.

I quit reading it when I was half way through as I wondered why I was bothering - why continue to be assaulted like this? Other books by Lamott have been invigorating and fun - this one bashes our President repeatedly (Ok for a chapter - but in almost every chapter?), flaunts the use of vulgarity (just because she's free to do so, doesn't mean she should), and champions rebellion.

In \\"Plan B\\" she shares her continuing faith journey in mid-life, struggling to enjoy her success and her family, and coming to terms with the loss that greets everyone who has lived long enough to watch a parent die. She can be laugh-out-loud funny: she names her saddle-bag thighs \\"the aunties\\" and vows to treat them with love and respect.

The good include her reflections on faith and growing older. I especially appreciated her thoughts on her son's adolescence. However, for the bad, her liberal political views wear less well after 9/11. Worth the read, but...."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"If you're a Christian person with left of center politics who has had it with insulting, sweeping generalizations, rigid certainty, smarminess, smug lectures, the intellectual dishonesty, and the \\"Liberal Anything=Big Bad Atheist\\" attitude of Ann Coulter and others who believe the Righteous Few (although not their clothing), will make the Afterlife look like a naked prayer breakfast at Bob Jones University, there is help at hand. Read Ann Lamott's _Plan B_ for some much needed relief.There are several reasons why I enjoy reading Ann Lamott, which are as follows. She does not presume to tell her readers what THEY should think, but is definitely not shy about saying what SHE thinks and feels. She's not begging for approval, she's just writing down everything with an honesty that is disarming and sometimes uncomfortable. She makes it clear that she can love her son unconditionally, and still have moments when she doesn't like him, very much. No doubt a relief to other parents going through their children's adolescence. Lamott acknowledges the difficulty she had in loving and forgiving her mother, and admits how her life improved when she died. Probably many caretakers of Alzheimer's patients will acknowledge THAT truth with great relief, as well. She admits the moments when tempers are lost, when things spin out of control in seconds over seemingly trivial matters, and when terrible things are said to and by the people she loves most. She also has moments of spiritual clarity, such as in \\"Ham of God\\" where she meets a friend in need and gives her the ham she has just won, believing God had a hand in the coincidence. In the hands of any less honest writer, that would make me squirm and put the book down. Instead, it made me think. Lamott is not afraid to share moments of spiritual joy, and other times when she feels doubt, depression about the world and herself, a lack of faith, an inability to go on. She dares to write about the feelings resentment and racial tension even between the members of the church she loves with incredible honesty. And she frequently makes me laugh out loud in every essay.I can understand how some readers might not like her swearing, or her references to George Bush. Chacun a son gout. Lamott is and always has been a very political person, and she doesn't try to hide it. Nor does she make any bones about which side she's on. Such is life in the very politically divided 21st century America. While I have no trouble loving Jesus, in terms of lovability, George Bush represents a real problem for me, as he does for Lamott. I subscribe to the wisdom of \\"If you're not completely outraged, then you haven't been paying attention.\\" Sometimes, bad language and lots of it seems like the only appropriate response to a war we didn't need begun on false pretenses over WMD's that weren't there and which has been excruciatingly badly run by a lot of Neocon chickenhawks who did not care to listen to even the soundest military advice. Thanks to them, we're in greater danger of terrorism while our futures are being mortgaged. Lamott relates the story of a man who stood outside the White House with a lit candle during the Vietnam War. When asked if he truly believed he could change Nixon's mind by doing this, the man said he was not trying to change the President's mind, he was doing it so that his country would not change HIM. For me, Ann Lamott's book is a guide to living through Bush's America in such a way that he will not change us. And it's nice to know that the Rapture Right does not \\"own\\" God, Jesus or Chritianity, even if they're convinced they do."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I so enjoyed Traveling Mercies and Bird By Bird that I couldn't wait to read Plan B.

If you haven't discovered Anne yet, she is shock therapy for those of us who learned how to be religious before we learned how to be human.In her previous book, Traveling Mercies, Anne shared her crooked journey through alcoholism, bulimia, and broken relationships to a connection with St. Andrews Presbyterian Church and Jesus Christ. Now, in Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith, Anne shares the new challenges to her faith, namely The Bush Administration, her aging mother, menopause, the loss of friends to illness, teaching Sunday School, and raising her teen-aged son, Sam. While many of her crises in Plan B are stock milestones of middle age they are no less poignant when rendered by Anne's pen.Anne's power comes from her unflinching authenticity, a scarce quality in the self-serving industry of memoir writing. Anne describes her life has it happens, without bothering to airbrush away her neurotic impulses and imperfections. Her self-depreciating humor and honesty creates a picture of spirituality reminiscent of Dostoevsky; we are all simultaneously noble and depraved. As I read Plan B, I laughed with Anne at her foibles and became more honest about my own.Anne Lamott, along with Fredrick Buechner, might be the best living Christian author that you can't find at a Christian book store, likely because Anne elevates cursing to a literary art form. More significantly, this author is openly pro-choice and pro-gay rights. She also addresses God as a feminine being and some readers might balk at her rabid Bush-bashing and extreme left-wing politics. However, I'd challenge any reader to see Anne as more than the sum of her politics and ideas. Reading anything by Anne Lamott creates the opportunity to remember that God wills and works through your bad attitudes, flawed character, and humanity. Wading through Anne's positions is worth any personal risk you might feel. Encountering her writing style is a joyous experience and you'll bump into God's grace as often as you will step in piles of human frailty.BOOKBLOG RATING: A--LS"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is a woman after my own heart! I have heard that Christian book stores will not sell her books--Shame on them! The readers are missing out on an author who will undress completely and reveal her dirty sins for everybody to see---Anne is exsactly the sort of Christian who will bring others to Christ: non-judgemental, accepting, loving, smart, says it how it is, an alcholic, a former druggie, a mom who hates her teenager!,a woman who hates her thighs, a women who swears sometimes and yes, a Libral! OHHHH Boy! is that naughty for a Christian to be? Oh, I almost forgot--- Anne gives Jesus all of the glory for her transformation.I Loved \\"Furthur Thoughts on Faith.\\" I laughed outloud at Anne's observations about life, teens, church, God, and the world. \\"Does everybody scream outragously (as if their crazy) and go absolutely insane with their teenagers?\\" Anne asks her readers this. Now--tell me, would a Christian admit this? I am thinking, Yea--I am like this, I identify with this, I am far from perfect; but I am trying!Anne does not only talk the talk---but she is proactive, and says without hesitation how she feels about President Bush, the war in Iraq, and what we should be doing to save the world. What I love about Anne is that she is not this perfect little Christian stuck in a pretty little box, behaving and thinking like a pitiful little robot. One could say that Anne has erupted and ripped free from that box in a big way.What is boils down to---is Anne Lamott loves Jesus---and He is using her to reach people who otherwise would not be reached; the sinners who can come to Him just as they are; beautifully imperfect. Even if they are liberals!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is not for the faint-hearted. A bookseller and I agreed last week that Lamott is an acquired taste and more enjoyable if you've read a lot of theology and still find your heart is broken. Lamott reminds us that sanitized piety should not be confused with real faith; that Jesus Himself had radical ideas and didn't sit around worrying about whether our kids are watching PG movies.Lamott's personal relationship with Jesus is one she's forged on her own, against all odds, reminding us that faith doesn't always come in an apple-pie/right-wing/Miss-America package. She is a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-to-work Christian -- a Christian who knows that it isn't enough to sit around quoting the Bible to be a good human being. Admitting her broken-ness and allowing us to laugh with her, we open our hearts to our own humanity. What a relief."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith contains a series of essays by Lamott from her salon.com column that she wrote during the beginning of the Iraq War. As a left wing Christian, Lamott understandably has trouble with the war and George W. Bush. As if that weren't enough, she is also turning 50 and her son is becoming a teenager. Lamott writes of all these things with great candor and humor. She is breathtakingly honest, but not in a way that makes me cringe or think \\"too much information.\\" She also writes of friends and loved ones with great affection and compassion that manages to avoid sentimentality. Lamott has the ability to be very funny and very wise at the same time, which is always a pleasure. As a person who more and more searches for straight forward honesty, I find Anne Lamott a welcome breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott has written some wonderful texts, namely 'Operating Instructions; a Journal of My Son's First Year'. However, she has really fallen short of the mark with this collection of essays on religion, American presidency and her family.Essentially, the greatest flaw of the work is its mind-numbing repetition. It unfailingly reinterates the same points and covers the same material in each and every essay or article.Whilst I strongly agree with her endless tirade on George W. Bush and the state of American leadership, it does become slightly dull when repeated in every chapter. Similarly, I realise that she is angry at her mother and the behaviour of her son, but there is only so many times I can read about it. The work comes off as self-indulgent and Lamott herself is less likable in this work than her others.Despite this, the text is beautifully written and does have a few topical highlights. These are generally the stories she shares about the unflinching beauty of others, such as 'Joice To The World' and 'One Hand Clapping'.It is for this reason I give the work three stars, although it undoubtedly left a sour and negative taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I feel like I'm not other reviewers of this book...I believe in the Christian teachings, but I am not a church-going, Bible-reading, Jesus-loving type. I don't do ANY of that stuff. In fact, I'm an atheist. So I was curious, but also a little hesistant. I've never read a book about faith before because any one I've ever picked up were all \\"fire and brimstone,\\" \\"Jesus this, Jesus that,\\" and it completely turned me off and turned me away. I picked up Anne Lamott's book at a tag sale & I knew who she was from \\"Bird by Bird,\\" and I was willing to give her a shot because she has dreds. I know this sounds silly, but seriously, that was my deciding factor in reading a book about Christianity...the author has dreds.It is FANTASTIC. This is coming from an avowed atheist who . I haven't been able to put the book of essays down since I bought it yesterday...she is nurturing whatever burgeoning spirituality I have inside me and making me think about thinks I have avoided thinking about before. That is all you can ask for from a book...that it makes you think.The top two best things about Anne Lamott are 1) she's both really cool and really uncool at the same time, and 2) she's honest, even at the risk of having judgement passed on her. By 1) I mean that she's totally this Northern California, ex-alcoholic, progressive Bush-hating hippie, but she's also the mother of a teenager and writes about how they fight over him not having good manners.By 2) I mean that she writes about her deceased mother very, very critically and that's so _refreshing_ for people who don't have nicey-nice, glowing things to say about our moms all the time.I love her: I just bought 4 of her books off Amazon.In summation: I feel calm after I read this book."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I first encountered Anne Lamott when I read Operating Instructions, her wonderful book about her first year with her son Sam. I have never read a more honest account of motherhood's beginnings, or one with more love shining through. I've tried since then to find another book by her to love, without success.I agreed with almost all Lamott's views in this book---which are mostly political, despite this being subtitled a book about faith. So my mixed feelings about this book are not because of differing political views. Rather, I felt that the tone here was mostly harsh. That's honest---it's nice to read that faith doesn't turn us all into happy clones. But I guess when I read a book about faith, I would like to have some feeling of grace or of being uplifted or at least of happiness. After reading this book, I felt totally depressed about the state of the world.I also felt often that Lamott was making fun of people she didn't agree with. Especially when I read about her cruise, and her discomfort with all the flag adorned people, it seemed she didn't really try to follow the basic Golden Rule. She seemed to have little regard for those she met, and it seemed as if she was on her own personal cruise---which is fine, but again, not really too uplifting.It was great to hear more about Sam, at least from my point of view. From HIS point of view, I would guess that he might not want to have it in print that he could be very mean to other kids, that he got drunk a few times, that he doesn't like to go to church...all somewhat normal teenage things, but I always wonder if it's really a parent's place to write about their teenager. There were a few times that she said she wasn't allowed to say more about him, but that didn't always seem to apply.The writing is skilled here, and the honestly refreshing---especially the section about starting a Sunday School and race. But I don't really know what the reason for being of this book is---I don't feel like I learned more about Lamott's faith, or was given insight into my own, or even just plain enjoyed the reading. I will be honest about this, as Lamott unfailingly is!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I read many of these online already. The book is slender, with big print and margins. I'm glad I borrowed it rather than buying it. I found the political essays less than interesting, and feel it will really date this book, unlike her others."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I have always appreciated Anne Lamott's writing for its upfront honesty, downright hilarity, and the raw edge she brought to her spiritual quest. Now a lot of what she is writing seems trite -- maybe like she's gotten pretty comfortable and lost her edge. The only thing that keeps her going is her hatred of the right wing in American politics,but she doesn't even probe that hatred very skillfully -- it's just there, like a dull toothache. There are some moving moments, for sure, like the ski trip with her friend who is dying of cancer. And it's nice to know she's made friends with her cellulite, I guess, but ultimately not very enlightening.The spiritual insights aren't very insightful, they boil down to this: make friends with uncertainty. Be open to the universe. Breathe regularly."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I think you can make fun of George Bush. And I think you can inject a little humor in your own Theological beliefs. I mean look at what we put on television and call it a 'craft,' then host a show with people who only have one name telling us how great one particular show was and how the actors never gave up their 'integrity,' and then tell me God doesn't have a sense of humor. \\"Friends\\" ran on network television for what . . . 60 years?It's just if you have a point, make it. Don't leave the reader confused as to what you were trying to say.I find this to be mean spirited writing. Ms. Lamott seems uncertain as to what she is going to say and I am then left with uncertainty as to what she said. Or why. Writing about Christ and his teenage years is something I would expect from George Carlin or Moore. I get the feeling that Ms. Lamott wanted to touch on everything that might pull in a few extra readers. Like a director of a poor script, action, violence, skimpy tops on the female stars, \\"cool\\" humor between the African American and Caucasian heroes, more violence, more skimpy tops, fast cars. Let's do a little of everything.Some points Ms. Lamott makes are genuine. They are unfortunately few and far between. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Let me preface what I am about to say by letting you know that I LOVE ANNE LAMOTT! Traveling Mercies resonated with me like no other book. Operating Instructions made me laugh and cry. This book however, left me feeling hollow and sad. It should have been called Further Thoughts on Anne's huge anger problem with the president, her mother and her son. I can appreciate getting real and honest, but come on, some serious therapy is needed here. Her hatred of George Bush borders on the obscene. She lost me when she compared him to Osama Bin Laden. The George hatred takes up about five chapters. Hate is a major theme in this book. Unlike TRaveling Mercies which deals beautifully with the issue of faith, this book really isn't about that. I think she throws in a few thoughts about Jesus here and there so she can put that in the title. Despite all of this, Anne is till one of my favorite authors. I hope her next book is more like her previous non fiction attempts and not so devisive and political."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I am a longtime Anne Lamott fan from Tiburon California, and a left-leaning democrat of eclectic but genuine faith. So you'd think this would be right up my street. I think of Anne as part of home, but I fear she's lost her mind. I loved Traveling Mercies: it didn't preach, it was funny, it was full of mercy and joy and wonder. Plan B is strident, arrogant, ignorant, and narrow-minded. I can't imagine who would like it. Annie! Quick, call your friends and get your joy of spirit back! And send Sam to a relative until you recover your sense of humor and proportion, for goodness sake!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I used to love Lamott's writing, but this will probably be the last of her books that I buy. I was extremely disappointed in the underlying tone of bitterness and resentment. If she is truly a Christian, where is the joy? Her take on Christianity is superficial and false. She writes, \\"But in any case, we should try to stay on God's good side. It's not hard. God has extremely low standards. Pray, take care of people, be actively grateful for your blessings, give away your money--you're cool. You're in. Nice room in heaven, flossing no longer required--which is what will make it heaven for me. Oh, I mean that, and Jesus.\\" Her ideas about God and Jesus are more cultural than biblical.Lamott's rantings about George Bush and war in Iraq should have been omitted. We can hear that for free on CNN. Who wants to pay for that kind of drivel? She should not write when she is in a really bad mood."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I thought this book was fabulous. I totally dug the journal, storytelling feel of her writing style. Regardless of whether or not you appreciate her more liberal political views, she still brings an honest and refreshing look into what it takes to truly be a follower of God and the scriptures. She is the first to admit that she has problems with always following the \\"rules\\" but approaches them in a way that keeps you engaged in the story... like you are sitting next to her in a coffee shop."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I don't understand why some readers are upset with the author for \\"complaining about the government\\" and for \\"bashing Bush.\\" This is a book by a woman who is a Christian. Jesus preached LOVE, not bombing. He preached poverty and service to others, not no-bid contracts for Haliburtan. Do the people upset with the Bush-bashing really believe they can be Christians and support a man who bombs people? I don't get it. Read the Bible.As for Lamott's book---she has great writing flow going through a lot of Plan B as she chronicles her life as a modern Christian in the Bay area. Lots of good laughs, tender moments, and a good, quick read.That said, I had a hard time grasping exactly what Lamott hated about her mother in spite of a profusion of words about her. It's completely unclear to me.Lamott has always struck me as someone with a mood disorder. She seems to go over the edge a lot emotionally. For example, Lamott goes to great lengths to justify requiring her teenage son to go to church, letting us know that other people support her decision. The disharmony this causes \\"every other week\\" as Lamott struggles to get Sam to comply against his will is whacko to me. It's frustrating to read about the drama this creates in both of their lives. If Lamott would just let the young man set his own boundaries regarding faith, the conflict would go away. I mean, like, have some faith! The kid can find his own way without her attempts at control and without her emotional freak-outs over this.Unfortunately, I find myself appraising Lamott no matter which of her books I'm reading. Lamott is very opinionated. If we are, too, than her narcissistic writings inviting us to be voyeurs are necessarily going to give rise to our own opinions.This was no more apparent to me than when reading Lamott's description of a ski trip with a dying friend, and of a nearly free jaunt on a cruise ship with other friends. What comfortable places to be a Christian in angst from.Despite nursing a few dying friends (who hasn't at her stage of life?)---I prefer to grapple with the issues of faith from a less comfortable position than on ski trips, cruises, or when gushing over a $150 necklace my kid buys me for a gift. If that's what Sam's learning in church, why force him to go?Give the money to the poor and make a necklace.You gotta give the author credit for laying her life bare for the world to see, and critique. We are all sinners in the eyes of ...If you want a good and imperfect read about an imperfect person of faith, one that leads you to question your own beliefs and reality, Lamott has produced it."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I found this book so disappointing. One might expect more growth and love and tolerance from someone who embraced a spiritual path - how many years has it been? The narcissism and whining and self-indulgence is wearing pretty thin. Like another reader, I will definitely take a closer look before investing in another book by Ms. Lamott, hoping to see some growth and transcendence."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Reading the reviews for this book and then reading the actual book was interesting. I think some of the reviewers (esp those writing in rhyme) did not even read the book. Seems like a kind of lie to write negative comments about a book you have not read (or any comments, guess this could go both ways). In any case, I found the complaints about Bush-bashing to be vastly overwrought...in fact there is a whole section of the book where Anne tries to love Bush despite her anxieties about the war and other policies of his administration. I am a fan of Anne LaMott's going back to Bird by Bird, I think I have read every one of her books. The thing about Anne is she does not shrink from the gritty daily everyday struggle of life, and in the process she is very life-affirming. I feel so grateful to be on the same planet at the same time as Anne, to have her books that say yes, we are not perfect, we doubt, we are scared, but life goes on and it is good. Amen."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I like Ann's method of writing: articulate, descriptive, witty. I read Bird by Bird and Traveling Mercies and enjoyed them.I really disliked this book's message. I came expecting to see her progress in faith, and instead I found her message to be angry, intolerant, and unforgiving. Wading through her bad language is tiring. She seemingly scoffs at all historic and practical, let alone biblical, standards of Christian behavior, while forging her own brand of Christianity instead of it shaping her."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I doubt I can replace her disparagers! I might even be in their company, had I stayed into dear Mother's Scofield KJV! In early 1950's \\"Searching the Scriptures\\" by H.E.

Now that's accepted by both English and German theologians 'specially in schools as Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta. Here I quickly sought out the renown scholars and writers as Sir Walter Brueggemann, Charles Cousar, Kathleen O'Connor and Oxford's Brian Wren!I point to four examples from PLAN B: \\"In last Sunday's Sermon, I took my opening story from Joshua 2 about the Spies sent to Jerico by Joshua; who decided to keep covered from Jewish publiciity in staying with that best known prostitute, Rahab the harlot!\\" Most of us have employed her same story for prison inmates who easily fall into that plot! I admit to not being so offended by her use of expletives as the F___ word! Also she describes their pet-half/Lab and half/golden retriever as being like \\"Jesus in a black furcoat or Audrey Hepburn in Blacklama, elegant and lovely and silly!\\" (What a Tremendous Gift for Unique descriptions!)Other Interudes I choose are her quotation from Wendell Berry on page 39: \\"It gets darker and darker every day and then Jesus is born!\\" Also the night she could not sleep for wondering if she really was a good Mom, \\"If I actually threatened to have Sam's pets put to sleep!\\" I did not cotton to her stories the time she insisted on being in-control of Sam's required attendance at Church! She openly inserted comments about teaching San Quentin inmates her art of storytelling! Here is when she uses her great quotation of Dr James Forbes, \\"Nobody gets into heaven without a letter of reference from the poor. Obviously 'the poor' includes prisoners.\\" Later she begins a Graduaton speech with her neat disclaimer: \\"It must be a magical day for You all. I would never know...I accidentially forgot to graduate from college!\\"Upon hearing Anne read from Plan B ++ Fielding comments, I'm in total agreemeent with Michele's words: \\"Refreshing & Honest as a Christian!\\" Totally a real authentic Person...as Beth calls her the type person, Christ would have enmbraced!

By her sort of stream-of-conscious approach, she similarly weaves in and out of ideas. Grace and beauty; life and death; love and loss; race, religion and politics -- Lamott covers the spectrum of human experience in an emotional rawness not often found in other pieces of \\"theology.\\"For those with children, the stories of life with her son capture the essence of a relationships with children -- lots of good but, sometimes, just as much bad. She and her son, Sam, both have alter egos -- \\"Phil\\" and the \\"Menopausal Death Crone\\" -- and the interactions between the two of them are priceless.She tells of how she mourns both life and death: living relationships affected by her messing things up and those with the dead that she can never reconcile. For example, she keeps the ashes of her recently deceased mother in her closet for over two years as post-mortem punishment for years of agony that she blames on her mother. But, later in the book, in a beautiful display of forgiveness and \\"letting go,\\" she releases her mother's ashes to wind with those that she holds dear.She also celebrates life and death in an \\"Easter People\\" sort-of-way that connects to a \\"Good Friday world.\\" One recurring theme is her hatred of George W. Bush and his campaigns in the Middle East and her struggle with that feeling. Distraught by military campaigns and the thoughts of death of Iraqi children, she protests and foments and moans about the Bush presidency. In Chapter 17, she knows that Jesus would love him, too, and that he is her brother no matter how much she hates it.It drives her crazy that \\"God has no standards\\" when it comes to love.God's love is also demonstrated in the life of her cancer-stricken, one-handed church-sister who's outlandish love and compassion for all becomes more visible and palpable in the final days of her life. Or the story of her friend who views his life-long facial deformity as a \\"disguised gift from God\\" which has allowed for him to have a \\"militant self-acceptance\\" of himself. This self-acceptance allows him to transform the way that other see him and his face but also themselves becoming away of the fears they have within themselves.A similarly recurring theme and philosophy throughout the book is \\"Don't be an a-hole.\\" This is the philosophy of her father, the strategy she employs when interacting with her son, and how she understands a key element of the words and life of Jesus.Somewhere in Lamott's colorful book, any reader will find a story or vignette that touches their heart or their funny bone. Like her practice of transcribing silly or wonderful things her son says onto postcards and then decorate her walls with them, Lamott's book is interspersed with many quotable phrases like \\"Nobody gets into heave without a letter of reference from the poor\\" and \\"Jesus never would have been elected to anything.\\"She also lends inspiration to those who would write reminding us that, as authors, \\"we see the spirit made visible\\" and it is our job to make that spirit known. It is known when we are kind and when we love and when we share this with and amongst others.While it's certainly not a short read, Plan B's style allows the reader to fly through it. If you're looking for a wonderful coffee table or night stand book or something to read a single-chapter for some reassurance or laughter, pick up Anne Lamott's \\"Plan B.\\" Experience the divine through Lamott's writing the same way that you experience it in your own world: through human experience, as messy and beautiful as it can be."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Pure Lamott......No one frees me better to face myself honestly without despair, so that I seek the grace daily to inch toward becoming the unique person God gave me the potential to be."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne LaMott is irreverent and spiritual, all at the same time.

I managed to struggle through it, bypassing many chapters where he rantings were too much to bear, and had a few laughs. Based on this book though I will never buy anything else written by her.

I don't think she would like me very much - I tend toward conservative, I work in corporate America and I voted for Bush. Yet, from the opening lines, I sensed there was something for me in her book. I was right. I read it cover to cover, laughing, crying, ok, growling occasionally, but most importantly, thinking. What a dull and boring (and dangerous) world it would be if I were surrounded only with those who think like me. So, whether Ann would like me or not, I like her. A lot. I finished the book not necessarily agreeing with her on many subjects, but knowing one thing - I better make sure that my life reflects the heart of the Lord I profess to follow. I better be sure I am looking out for the poor, the powerless, the marginalized. I better make sure that I use my money wisely and frugally, so that I have plenty to give those in need. I better make sure that I am kind, to people, to nature, and to the broken, wounded, naked, imprisoned, and those in bondage. I better make sure that my inner life and my outer life are in harmony, and that my inner life is formed and shaped by my Maker.Ann's raw, uncensored reality made me think, made me look inward, made me want to do some interior and exterior soul cleaning. I will most likely remain conservative. And I don't know if Ann would ever want to sit down and have a cup of tea with me, but if she did, I would give her a hug, dredlocks and all, and thank her for opening my eyes and impacting my life for the better."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I've greatly loved everything else I've read by Ms Lamott (Bird by Bird, Operating Instructions and Traveling Mercies were all phenomenally funny, real,and wise), but this book seemed to be a mish-mash of nothingness. I was hoping for a further exploration of her faith, much in the same vein as Traveling Mercies, however, Plan B was less of a treatise on \\"the journey\\" and more of a vehicle to bash the Bush administration.What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I have been a Lamott-loving reader for more than twenty-five years, since \\"Hard Laughter,\\" her first novel, was published. Though she has traveled down a lot of bumpy roads that I haven't, I continue to marvel at her articulate accounts of her journeys. Sometimes mordant, sometimes fall-on-the-floor-funny, sometimes heartbreaking, Anne Lamott always makes me think. She is my touchstone for my home state, and her crisply written dispatches from the front are always welcome on my bookshelves and in my heart.That said, I feel that people who cannot abide her political, spiritual, sexual, or child-rearing opinions should just stay away from Lamott. Don't call her \\"mean-spirited,\\" which is an all-purpose catch phrase for people who don't agree with you. Just put the book back. Don't bother with her.In a time in which public and private censorship is growing, it is just plain courageous for Anne Lamott to say who she is, what she has done, and how she feels about it. Thank G-d that a publisher is willing to let her speak out. I am grateful that Christianity has eased her recovery from a plethora of life's burdens, and I am sorry that people who also call themselves Christians are using this forum to bash her for not being the exact same kind of Christians that they think they are.One line from \\"Traveling Mercies\\" still makes me--me, a Jew-- laugh like a hyena every time I think of it, when Anne confesses to having thoughts \\"that would make Jesus want to drink gin out of the cat's dish.\\" If that's not funny to you, surely there's some other, more sanctimonious author who might meet your need for self-affirmation."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"(...)It will take the multiple panicked pumps of CPR to provide minimal resuscitation for a collection of jumbled stream of consciousness ramblings about streetwise spirituality a la Oprah Winfrey, M. Scott Peck and Dalai Lama/Deepak Chopra.Robin Williams has the cure for this sort of illiterature: a few light slams."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is a writer's writer. And what I mean by that is that she writes on a level most writers would LOVE to make it to. She's easy to read while, at the same time, having a deep message, and a raucous sense of humor. I got hooked on her years ago when I read BIRD BY BIRD, a book that I still refer to often whenever I need to \\"get real\\" about my own writing life.I was pleased to learn that these are short memoirs of her life, a collection of short stories. The short story form seems to be making a modest comeback, and I loved the fact that a collection of them made it to the New York Times' list, too.But lets get into the meat and potatoes of the book now ...This is a look at Ms. Lamott's life through her own eyes, and she wears everything on her sleeve, including her disdain for the Bush administration, her dislike of young children, her poor motherhood skills, and her struggles with faith. Examples ...Lamott has to deal with the death of her Alzheimer's mother, pulling the urn that contains her mother's ashes out of her closet. And as she does, she reminisces about the final months of her mother's life: \\"Her purse was a weight, ballast; it tethered her to the earth as her mind floated away. It was also health and preparedness, filled with anything you might need. For instance, there were a lot of Band-Aids. You never know when you'll need one, only that in this world, you will.\\"We also have reflections of her faith on her past: \\"I wear Mary for two reasons: Because she helps me remember the song \`Let It Be.' And because I used to pray to her as if she were my mother when I was coming down off cocaine. I'd lie in bed beside whatever cute coked-out boyfriend I had at the time, who'd be snoring and muttering while I ground my teeth in the dark.\\"Spiritually, the book has plenty to offer the reader, but it's not overly-done. Words like \\"$h!tty\\" and the \\"F\\" word make their appearances regularly alongside comments about \\"God's will.\\" Although this might sound put-offish, it isn't. Lamott has full control over her prose and uses it to engage the reader on many levels without getting preachy, making us think about the spirit within our own lives by looking at hers.I only gave the book four stars because most staunch Republicans will undoubtedly be angered by Lamott's take on Bush and \\"his administration's war with Iraq.\\" I also felt that, at times, she meandered around a bit too much and got off topic, but this was pretty rare.Still a great book to check out, especially if you're a Lamott fan."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Annie Lamott is a rare gift to readers. I love her courage, intelligence, honest humor, depth of heart and fine writing talent. Buying her book, I know that I will be alternating between tears and laughter (and sometimes both). I know I will be touched and entertained AND inspired. I pause before the next chapter, knowing that I will be venturing into a different emotion or thought-line than the previous one. Will I read now or be surprised later? So interactive! But most of all, Annie is about heart and love and grace manuvering through this world in our lives and I appreciate sharing the path with her."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"During a recent visit to my sister's home, I found a copy of this book on the table, and sat down to read it with anticipation because of how much I had enjoyed (and was blessed by) Bird by Bird and Traveling Mercies. However, I wasn't able to read far into the book before having to put it down with discouragement -- I was discouraged by reading this book and Lamott's personal and arrogant sounding attacks against President Bush,and anyone with an opposing political perspective from her own, the same way I'm discouraged when I read a conservative evangelicals' blood curdling remarks against homosexuals and liberals. I don't fault Lamott for having her opinions: politically, spiritually, socially . . . but based on the writing I had enjoyed in her previous works, I was surprised to not sense even a little compassion for someone she feels is in the wrong (Bush and people who think differently from her). . . given how boldly and honestly she has conveyed her own mistakes and downfalls in her previous memoirs, and the \\"amazing grace\\" she has experienced from both God and her beautiful friends and family in her church, I was unexpectedly put off by her comments sounding more like Jerry Falwell with dreadlocks than a smart, independent woman who has persevered, endured, and succeeded in the face of noticeable odds...I suppose I would have been more interested, engaged, and motivated to read if she had simply expressed her genuine sorrow for the state of the world -- realizing that one man, or one line of thinking cannot be responsible for every ill in society... At least I would have thought that the God she described in earlier books, was plenty big enough to overcome rigid political views (whether that rigidity is the result of conservative OR liberal roots). . . but perhaps not.kbjmem2@aol.com"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"As a sometimes fan of Anne Lamott's I was dismayed what I just heard on her NPR interview.--She repeatedly called the host -- an exceedingly soft-spoken and patient man --arrogant,--She publicly attacked a reviewer who slammed her book -- a young novice reviewer nonetheless -- while also managing to squeeze in there that all the other reviews had been beyond brilliant,--She cut off any caller who offered views that differed from hers, without even giving them the time or space to finish their thoughts.On the surface I like Anne's mix of Christianity and progressive liberal politics, but the person behind this comes off as vain, immature, whiney, close minded, incredibly arrogant, self-centered, and kind of mean. Not to mention, utterly lacking in intellectual curiousity or the desire to improve her craft (hence the swift dismissal of critics). It was really disappointing from a 51 year old woman, all these adolescent personality traits. If you come to worship at the table of Anne Lamott, she will no doubt regale you with witty conversation, but God forbid you challenge her, make her think, or, gasp, criticize her, well then she turns into the likes of a jaded rock star who just has no time for you."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I have read and reread Ann Lamott's book Traveling Mercies. I fell in love with the beautiful black women who helped her through her pregnancy. And their great capacity for love. Enjoyed her journey to God, it brought to mind how many of us take the circular route with many detours before we really receive God in our hearts. This book, however, was a great disappointment. Not many thoughts on Faith, a lot of thoughts about how much she hated George Bush, how depressed she and her friends were because if the Bush administration. If I want to read a book about politics I will buy a book about politics. I feel cheated.She already wrote why she makes Sam go to church. For some reason, probably not the authors fault, I cannot seem to see Sam as a real breathing person.I couldn't finish reading the book. I found it repetitious and boring, so much so I doubt that I want to read her latest book. I will probably try though hoping it will be more to my personal liking."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott tells it like it is! She admits to things in her books that are so real and always sees the spiritual even in the worst of situations. I admire her foibles and how she deals with them. Moreover, I admire her willingness to accept her human condition with such grace!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"A good read. You will nod with agreement, wince with pain, laugh, and shrug when you think she's off her rocker, but you will be engaged! I totally agree with another reviewer who said that she is a roll your shirtsleeves up Christian. I think she gives a good name to religion in a day and age where there seem to be Those Who Do and Those Who Don't- Anne shows up and is One Who Tries. Her religion isn't about pontification with false pride, it's about gritty introspection and action and change and love...and meanwhile, finding something to laugh about.Here's something to laugh about."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Wow, when I typed my review here several weeks ago I had no idea how much of a lightning rod this book would be for Christians. So, in order for full disclosure I feel the need to amend my review to note that I am a Christian. I've read the Bible, yet I don't recall anywhere that Jesus asks us to renounce our sense of humor if we choose to follow him. Given all that Anne Lamott has gone through in her life, from drug addiction, to single parenting, to the deaths of so many loved ones, I have to believe that Jesus counts her as one of his success stories. Rather than rejecting faith, Lamott is an example of someone who embraces faith in her darkest times. Perhaps it's not the \\"traditional\\" way that others ascribe to, but in the end that's not for any of us to judge. We all have the choice of whether to read this book or not, and I acknowledge that it is appropriate to \\"warn\\" people that this book isn't standard Christian fare. However, I find myself appalled by the diatribes disguised as reviews for this book. If you are going to argue from a Christian position, at least get your facts right, especially about one of the main tenants of our faith-why Christ died.All that said, I stand by my original review, \\"Plan B Further Thoughts on Faith\\" is an enjoyable read, filled with crazy but real experiences that I found easy to relate to, especially when she totally pegs the crazy out of control feelings that every parent has at one time or another. Rather than being shocked at how she's cobbled together her religious and liberal beliefs, I find it a refreshing antithesis to what we often see as portrayed as \\"Christian\\" today. At its heart, what I enjoyed most about this book was how in one chapter she could make me weep as she writes about her dog, Sadie and in another chapter she could make me laugh at her story of starting a Sunday school at her church. As another reviewer said, Lamott is an acquired taste, but for those of you who have enjoyed her other writing, I'd encourage you to give this book a chance as well."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I perhaps shouldn't be, but I am slightly shocked by what a low rating this book's received. I know that the sticking point for most of the reviewers I've read is Anne's dislike of Bush. I would think that her honesty on the subject would at least be appreciated. I don't think that a lot of readers who reacted against the book for that reason reached the essay \\"loving your president: day 2\\" in which she writes about her struggle to love the guy despite her dislike of him. She's honest at least, and I'd think that pretty much all of her readers could identify with her somewhat in that struggle. Most of us have hated one president or another recently (or other figures), and of course, we're supposed to actively love our enemies. I really appreciated everything she had to say on that subject in particular.And politics are hardly the only thing she covers in the book. After reading all of the reviews, I was a little shocked to not find more mentionings of Bush.And she can sure write. Lamott has a startling way of suddenly throwing pieces of wisdom at you just out of nowhere. And the irreverence and crankiness amongst which these moments of clarity and hope come only serve to prove her ultimate point that despite all the pain and confusion we see, there's the presence of grace. She finds a hint of cosmos amidst chaos, and that's what good writers do.The real high points for me were \\"one hand clapping,\\" \\"good friday world,\\" \\"'joice to the world,\\" \\"let us commence,\\" and \\"falling better.\\""},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I am a patriotic American and member of an Evangelical Christian Church who is opposed to the war and disheartened by the ineptitude (and fundamental dishonesty) of the Bush administration. As such, I appreciate Lamott's insight into the internal struggle many of us are waging. While my Church family and many of my non-Churched friends unconditionally support the ever-shifting rationale and objectives for the war and a pre-emptive foreign policy, Lamott posits that it is OK, even Christian, to question and speak out on what is happening. At the same time, this shouldn't be used as an excuse for losing faith.If I could sum up what I got from the book in a single passage, it would be this: \\"...the opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty. Certainty is missing the point entirely. Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be until some light returns.\\"God bless Anne Lamott for sharing her gifts of wit, wisdom, service and integrity."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I first \\"feel in love\\" with Anne Lamott when I read Operating Instructions. I loved her humor and her frankness, and her ability to talk openly about faith and politics, topics I often see avioded in much of what I read and never mentioned together. She continued her story in this book, Plan B, and I was very impressed. Some may have felt that she ranted too much about Bush, but I felt it was right on track. As a novice writer of creative-nonfiction, I know how important it is to be true to yourself when writing in this genre, otherwise the reader will pick up on it and what you have to say will lack resonance. If she glossed over her feelings for Bush, we would have sensed it and the other stuff she had to say would have rung false. This is who she is, take it or leave it.I also apprecited the fact that she showed her readers that yes, you can be a Christian and a liberal. I am one, and I feel the media too often portrays Christians as conservative. Overall, it's a great read!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne L. supports all of us who struggle with the reality of life and all of its inequities. Reading her work and taking in her perspective re-orients us to what is truly valuable - our human condition made whole by grace and the reality of our life as we must live it day by day. Our wounds are turned into examples of grace."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is most notably the author of Traveling Mercies. That book was something of a spiritual biography as she wrote about her life having come to find a faith in Christ after years of drug abuse and bad decisions. But her faith is not that which the average person or the average Christian would think of when they consider \\"faith in Christ\\". Perhaps Lamott is more honest than most in that she willingly admits her prejudices, faults, and failings. Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith is less memoir and more a collection of 24 essays regarding different aspects of her personal faith as told in a humorous and down to earth, salt of the earth manner. She writes about screaming at her son and her desire to hit people with a wide variety of objects. She writes about finding little bits of grace in unexpected and perhaps unwanted places in her life. She writes about not forgiving her mother for years after she had died. She writes about the grace in being able to give someone from her church a ham when the woman wasn't able to afford gas or food money. Lamott writes with frankness, with attitude, with humor, and gets to the heart of Christian life roundabout ways.This isn't to say that Plan B is a perfect book, because I far prefer Traveling Mercies. This is more an essay collection than a continuous narrative, and I would have preferred the narrative, but that's my prejudice. My real gripe is Lamott's constant sniping at President George W. Bush. You don't like him. You don't approve. We know. It's obvious. Enough, already. Lamott doesn't build a case against Bush, not to any great extent, because this book and these essays aren't about that. It's little pot shots that she admits is something she is working on in the \\"not hating\\" category. It makes her human, but it's too much. I didn't even vote for the man and it's too much. Maybe once or twice and essay (or every three essays, but it feels like more) does a comment fly out. It's distracting.But let me go back to the grace that Lamott finds bits of...This is a decent book, but not the powerful work that Traveling Mercies is. Anne Lamott is, and seems to be, an Earthy Christian. She is of this world, is grounded in reality (though she may dispute that herself), and brings one heck of a perspective to Christianity. She's not the contemplative that a Kathleen Norris is, but both are favorite authors for the Christian/Spiritual writing. Given the choice to find an entry point to Anne Lamott, I would have to recommend Traveling Mercies instead. Plan B is good, Traveling Mercies is better.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"This book is a sequel of sorts to Lamott's book, \\"Traveling Mercies\\" (TM). I read the first book several weeks ago and the moment I finished it, I got online and ordered this book. I did a little math and realized that it had been ten years since TM was first published and I was dying to know what had happened to Lamott and her son, Sam, since then. While TM is a chronological telling of Lamott's life (ending with Sam's eighth birthday), Plan B is not so linear. Instead it is a series of stories about events or themes in Lamott's life that have occurred over the last ten years.I was extemely pleased with Plan B for three reasons in particular.1. The wit and honesty are still refreshing and welcome. (Chapter one is entitled, \\"ham of god\\" and is oh so aptly named.)2. It is evident that Lamott has grown. Her Christianity and faith are not a fluke or an ill-conceived divergence.3. Like an overdue letter from a beloved family member, this book has put my mind at ease. All is well. Life is not without pain; not without challenges. Still, it is joyful, and fullfilling. These people that I have come to care about, Lamott, Sam, Pastor Veronica (and the other members of St. Andrew Presbyterian Church), Buddy, Father Tom, along with the rest of their friends and family, are supporting and loving each other all along the way... And it works!There was one other bonus for me. Lamott gives a wonderful description of a wedding. I now include this quote in all my pre-marriage counseling. It is right on the money and so insightful.You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this book. You might even find the strength to pray for President Bush... maybe even forgive him. I said maybe."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"It is always refreshing to me to come across a liberal, or progressive thinking Christian in an age of conservative ones making book lists, with what to me are fad books. The author is a joy or at least a pleasure because she is so honest about her anti-Bush views, while also being a very, very firm Christian in a manner that would probably make Christ himself proud. She is in essence the type of walk the talk Christian I respect and admire.The author writes in a manner that is human and yet optimistic. Odd as it may sound I actually felt as if she were indeed the type of person Christ would have embraced, because she speaks of struggles, flaws and successes. Reminds me of the saying that ethics/morals are what we do when no one is watching. And she has a sense of humor that is so sorely lacking in most books by Christians."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"A series of thoughtful, truthful, funny and poignant musings on the framework of life from her perspective - what it's like for her in the aftermath of Bush's re-election, what it's like to be raising a teenage son without his father, how she reaffirms her faith and her religious practice from day to day, written with humor, empathy, compassion and her customary sharp wit and intelligence.

I enjoyed Anne Lamott's previous work but this one did nothing but anger me. Yuck. Read at your own risk."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I really enjoyed Anne's previous books, but this one is hit and miss. There is no real cohesive message outside of her ranting against President Bush, pro-life conservatives, etc. She presents herself as a deeply committed Christian, and I honestly believe that she is, but then she says so many thoughtless, careless, and even arrogant things.Arrogance is perhaps the one characteristic that makes this book so rough on the windpipe. I believe that Anne Lamott has a big heart, but she also has a big mouth which often discounts her core message (but then again, one is never really sure if she actually has a 'core message'). I wish she would mature a little through her writing rather than regressing with every book."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is back.Thank God!

Most come from those \\"upset\\" with Ms. Lamott's criticism of Mr. Bush and/or her interpretation of religious dogma.Get over yourself people. First, there is nothing wrong with one critizing your government and or president! Ever since our government was formed, people have bashed the government. Those who challenged government tenets during the 18th century, for example, were not told to cease the criticism or face jail time. Our fore fathers saw debate about issues that effect all of us as paramount to a successful democracy. (It would be nice if all those who do not understand this basic fact, read up on it and become more informed before choosing to voice their opinions on this issue).Second, there is nothing wrong with one person's interpretation of religious dogma. I found Ms. Lamott's writing to be poignant and funny and her descriptions of Jesus as being a rebellious teenager real and refreshing. What would Jesus do? He would not chastize Ms. Lamott for her humor but probably have a good laugh along with her!Third, Ms. Lamott is someone who has had alot of pain in her life and is working it out. She is far from perfect. I know many people who exhibit some of her qualities but with alot less reflection on their parts. She yells at her kid, she swears, she has a drinking problem, ... does that make her less of a human being? What is the old saying about judging not?Join Ms. Lamott for one's person faith journey and leave your judgements at home. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lemott's books of essays are so effective because it is impossible not to recognize that she speaks the truth.

I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"If you are anything but a Bay-area, Bush-bashing, conservative-loathing liberal, this book -- gentle reader -- is not for you.While Traveling Mercies explored the tenuous, arbitrary connections that can make every-day faith funky,heart-wrenching and wonderful, Plan B is a rant. I love Anne so much, she is such a gutsy writer. But based on what I read in Plan B, Anne doesn't love those of us who don't agree with her politics.Here's what I think: I don't like it when people assert that God's a Republican. But I also don't like it when a writer insists that He/She must be a Liberal Democrat. Politics taints this book like botulism in a can of green beans: Everything looks pristine, but there is a mess of ugliness just beneath the surface. In Plan B, politics leads faith. To me, this is one bass-ackwards proposition.Often Anne implies that she and \\"all\\" of her friends are just a short match away from self-immolation because GWB has been re-elected. I want to show her some of the good people I know who voted for \\"W,\\" and ask her \\"Can't intelligent people of faith respect each other and disagree?\\"Not in this book. But with a writer this stellar, there is always hope for her next."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Ask anyone who knows me, and I couldn't speak a bad word about Anne Lamott's craft. In Plan B, however, Lamott misses the mark in a big way--perhaps the weakest book she's written in years.My opinion doesn't stem from her politics or religious views--all very liberal fundamentalist--but from the arrogance that comes through in her waterfall of words, like the very people she is speaking out against. For not liking George Bush very much, she shares his overconfidence.The stories, too, are more cliche--and don't connect with the reader; her ordinarily witty descriptions of the world around her are flat and forced. One of the strengths of the previous books, Operating Instructions and Travelling Mercies for example, were her larger spiritual insights that transcended religion. In this one, however, Lamott mounted her soap box and comes off like a Jehovah's Witness in dreadlocks.Not worth the read. There are plenty of other good books with a similar style--which by the way Lamott tells her audiences is because they are trying to write like her."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is a San Francisco Bay Area native down to the cellular level not only in her preferences, but in her political and social views.

Bush and the war in Iraq. She is saying, \\"Look, Sweetheart, this is who I am, so let's get this straight. If you can't take it, then back up, close the front cover, and get the hell out of my book!\\" I am one of the people who stayed, and glad I did.Unlike her earlier \\"Traveling Mercies\\" which began with a sequential biography of her journey towards God, or perhaps His journey towards her, this book is a non-chronological collection of essays gently demonstrating the fragile yet invincible grace of God evident in the friendships, conflicts, disasters, and tangles of the human condition--her own, that of her teenage son Sam, those of her friends and family, those of her church, and the people she encounters as a lusty, narcissistic, radicalized leftist, mellowing with age, experience, and grace.Lamott places a poem before Chapter One that subtly but unerringly foreshadows the them of this collection of twenty-four portraits of life and grace. By Lisel Mueller, it is titled \\"Monet Refuses the Operation,\\" and chronicles and contrast the painter's view of reality with that view defended by more \\"rational,\\" less artistic people. Of course, Lamott is Monet as well, and his words might as well be hers as he says, \\"The world is flux, and light becomes what it touches, becomes water, lilies on water, above and below water, becomes lilac and mauve and yellow and whilte and cerulean lamps, small fists passing sunlight so quickly to one another . . .\\"\\" The point is, the world is not simply what it seems, and as with Emily Dickinson' poem, \\"All the earth is crammed with heaven and every bush aflame with God, but only those who see take off their shoes.\\" Lamott sees. She sees the pain, the sorrow and the darkness, but she also sees the burning bush, and invites us to draw near and to take off our shoes and join her there.It is obvious to me that she wants not only to sensitize us to how God moves amidst the ordinary, but also to comfort the wounded hearts of readers bruised by life, and longing for the soothing touch of God, whether they realize it or not. Lamott succeeds in this without being preachy, superficial, or simplistic.She never loses sight of life's ugliness, instead finding the grace of God shining brightest in the darkest places. \\"Without all the shades and shadows, you'd miss the beauty of the veil. The shadow is always there, and if you don't remember it, when it falls on you and your life again, you're plunged into darkness. Shadows make the light show\\" (162).This book is mellower than \\"Traveling Mercies,\\" written five years later. Here we see a Lamott coming to terms with her life, finally content, but still radical, still disturbed by life's injustices, still struggling. But she is coming to terms with life as it is, and herself as she is, feeling just a little bit safer in the arms of God. She knows better than before the strength of the everlasting arms.This is not a tightly organized book, but a collection of snapshots of life as she finds it. Some people will be impatient with the gentleness of the book. She paints miniatures, not murals. Nevertheless, upon her small canvases, she paints with great artistry and sensitivity.Prepare to be changed in how you relate to older relatives, to the sick, to the downtrodden, to social justice issues, to undesirable tasks. As for me, I was more than once moved almost to tears by her integrity and intensity of relationship with her son. Her transparency enabled me to look more deeply at my own parenting. Of such glimpses, tears are born.Anne Lamott teaches all of us here about how to live with ourselves, with God, and with each other. Who can afford to miss the lesson?"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"What a funny book. Anne Lamott is achingly vulnerable, from her candor about having hated her mother (p 46, 232) to her rages at her adolescent son (116), whom she loves completely. I am always relieved when spirituality writers are this frank about their lives. Lamott sets the gold standard for being a freakishly truthful blunder among the superficially pious. I simply adore her. There are some utterly amazing thoughts here on the reality of parenting, on racism, on aging, on adolescence, on forgiveness, on body image. And it's all told with Lamott's intuitive understanding of language and beauty, not to mention her trademark humor.She writes here of building a tentative family with her son's father; trying to forgive her dead mother; starting an improbable Sunday school at her church; putting her dog to sleep; and dealing with a teenager while having menopause. Some of these essays were gorgeous and unforgettable.There are some problems with the book, though. Does a single chapter go by in which she does not complain vociferously about our nation's president? I certainly agree with her about the frightening direction in which his administration has taken our country, but enough already. We get it. Of course we're angry. But too many times, this book wallows in a rage that paralyzes us from responding creatively or constructively to these evil times. Better are the chapters in which she unpacks her feelings about the war and how Christians should respond to it. (141 ff) Then she almost saves it all at the end with this self-aware critique: \\"I felt addicted to the energy of scorning my president,\\" she writes. \\"I thought that if people like me stopped hating him, it would mean that he had won.\\" (217) Would that we all should be so perceptive about our own motivations.Apart from the politics, though, there are few consistent themes that tie this all together. Some of these essays are absolutely brilliant, like the rumination on grace in the form of Lamott's friend who founded the Church of Eighty Percent Sincerity (I love that, BTW), but it's sometimes unclear how these discrete elements relate to the whole. Then, too, is the smaller problem that the people she discusses are always re-introduced, as if we've never heard of them before. I learned in chapter 1 that Veronica is Lamott's pastor, and I'm capable of remembering that connection; I don't need to be reminded every time she makes an appearance. Moreover, a couple of essays repeat each other needlessly (like the same info about her mother's ashes appearing twice). The book just needed some tighter editing to pull it together as a unit instead of a series of sublime but fragmented individual vignettes.A longer version of this review was posted on December 27, 2005 to The Review Revolution (janariess.typepad.com)."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Lamott has obviously run out of gas. She should have stopped writing long ago. She seems to have lost her joy and her muse. This book drones on and on, and it's a downer. It's also preachy. It's like a boring letter that goes on and on, but it's not a good book to read. I'm sorry I got it."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I just did something I've never done before. I returned a book to the bookstore for a refund. The book in question was Anne Lamott's Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith. I had been so excited to learn that she had written a sequel to Traveling Mercies that I bought the book the very day it was released. I've had it on my nightstand waiting for just the right mindset to devour it. Last night was the night. I was expecting to find the same kind of thought-provoking, faith enhancing insights I'd found in Mercies. Instead, I found the same mean-spirited Bush-bashing political polarization I could get for free on most television news shows. That was chapter one. OK, I reasoned, I can give her that one. But chapter two was more of the same and a quick scan through the book revealed that Bush was mentioned almost as often as God. While I certainly respect Lamott's right to express her political views I just wish she and her publisher would label the books appropriately so readers can make informed choices about the content of the books they purchase. This was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I have almost nothing in common with the Anne Lamott.George Bush, to me, does not represent the end of civilization as we know it. My three children, my wife and I survived their adolescence. Time passes. With help, I survive, occasionally, even thrive.Yet, I drew comfort from her book. Reading her well-written, brutally honest narrations of life's daily struggles, I gathered spiritual hope.Not everyone comes to faith by the high road. The gift of grace is available for each of us regardless of our backgrounds. Anne Lamott's communicates the essence of Christian faith. It is not found in dogma, but rather, grace. By opening our hearts in the midst of confusion and hopelessness, the world becomes a safer and more loving place."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I think that Anne Lamott is one of the best writers on faith around. In the spirit of St. Ignatius, she takes to seeking God in all things--whether a ham or dog-do on her shoe or patches of blue sky or prison walls. How many people live their lives in this way? Lamott has a wry sense of humor, and the essays are about her personal struggles with being a good Christian and a good person. Both are incredibly difficult. Even when she admits not liking the president, she acknowledges that if she treated him better she might come to feel differently. I would point this out to her detractors--this isn't dogma--it's one person's experience. If people are offended by the language and think that God will be, too...well, I'll just say that I think that's between Annie and her God. And for those who are offended by the reference to God as a woman...I remind you that we were created in the image of God, and so that is black, white, woman, man, whatever. This is a book about being human. If some of the reviewers could set aside their judgment and leave that to God, they might learn something about acceptance."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"The book is well written; Lamott certainly knows how to write. It is honest, but mere honesty doesn't make a good book. Her hysterical and irrational reactions to, and descriptions of, George Bush are strikingly weird. It isn't that she just doesn't like him; she has a clear hatred of him, personalized in a way that is creepy; she's never met him. It is odd given that in the rest of the book she tries to assert her Christianity. Where is her own grace?There is no humor in this book to offset the sadness, anger, bitterness, and pain she emotes. After reading, I'm surprised that Lamott hasn't yet killed herself for all pain she feels, and all the horrors in the world she is surrounded by. She sees little joy in the world, and shares none of it with others. The emotions aren't interesting, but repetitive. I kept reading because it was an easy read, and I thought and hoped -- because it was Anne Lamott -- that it would somehow mean something. Unfortunately, this was just a bad, whining, self-indulgent book.If it weren't written by Anne Lamott, it never would have been published. And after this, I doubt I'll read another book by her again. She seems to have succumbed to her fear of white male conservative republicans, and her bitterness obscures any positive attributes she may have had.If you MUST read this book -- wait, and it will be on the bargain shelf soon."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"My remembered favorite essay by Anne Lamott is an address to a graduating class titled \\"B+ is Just Fine\\", and it is still somewhere on this hard drive. In it, Lamott decries the attempt to attain perfection and focuses instead on inspiring young people to accept their best efforts in life, even if the paradigm shifts from the ideal.Plan B as choice of a title intrigues me, and the connection to the essay is evident. Plan B and Plan C are what humans resort to when plan A doesn't work out. And it rarely does.Anybody out here living plan B? I am.Lamott's narratives in this context justify that whatever works for individuals, with a semblance of grace, spirituality, and humanity, even if the process is not perfect, is good enough to lead a worthwhile life and find joy. Most of the book is about love and gritty awareness-of children, problems, family, friends, our earth, and self. The intelligent, good-humored and incisive prose coats our personal wounds like a balm. The allusions are multiple. The reader's pleasure lies in recognition and empathy, and forces one to reexamine the ordinary with renewed vigor and yes, confidence and acceptance. Lamott skews the standards to add inclusivity to all means, ways, and approaches.I love her words."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"...I got so weary of the incessant complaining about the current government administration. I would've rather she filled those pages with more stuff about her family, her mom, her son. But every time she turned around she was complaining about the government. It was the same kind of thing that really hurt Tony Hendra's \\"Father Joe\\" in my opinion, but here it's much more damaging to the flow of the book. Once I \\"kinda\\" got past that it was a great read, but not nearly as memorable as her previous memoir, \\"Traveling Mercies.\\" Worth a read if you love Annie's writing, and I do, but probably to be missed otherwise."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is a gift to the world and I am going to buy four more copies of this book to give as gifts to my friends.

Unfortunately, this book had too much of the latter and not enough of the former. There are some gems here, but not enough to make me recommend it."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"There is not enough cheese and crackers in this world to go along with the \\"whine\\" that Ms. Lamott serves up in Plan B. I have loved her previous works and based on their merit, I pushed on into this book, beginning each new chapter with hope and ending in dissappointment until I finally had to toss it into the garbage. It was tedious, from menopausal maladies to blaming George Bush for all the problems in her life. And God Himself, or \\"Herself\\", as Ms. Lamott would say, seems to be a reflection of who SHE is and not the other way around. Yes, God loves us just the way we are but He also loves us too much to leave us that way...except in her case apparently. I wanted to like it and I am sorry to say that it fell way below my expectations. Bummer."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Words are not able to describe how loathsome this thing is. As a Christian, I found little Bible-faith and lots of bile. I could hardly believe how she envisioned 12 year-old Jesus as dissing Joseph His stepdad with 'you're not even my dad so I don't have to listen to you..', and Mary standing by with a rock in her hand... or something to that effect? Bizarre!?! to treat Bible history this way!!It's all very well to claim Jesus saved one's life. But this salvation needs to extend to lifeSTYLE, which is sadly lacking here if her vocabulary, expletives, adolescent sass and profane misuse of English is any indication of how an author claiming 'true believer of the faith of Christ' conducts the tongue. See James chapter 3 for a few pointed pointers on Christian conduct of conversing."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Breezing through this book, it seemed captivating at first. But soon my sensibilities were jarred by how she treats accounts in the Bible. In one case, she imagines the apostles in the upper room on Good Friday depressed, drunk and cursing their fate with an 'F'-epithet. Another essay was offensive by suggesting that when the Lord Jesus often went into the hills to pray, he might have been pulling back a few beers instead of actually praying. The last straw for me (a liberal Christian, by the way, active in prison ministry) was saying 'God' spoke in \\"her big mama voice\\".I love humor as much as the next reader. I relish the need for Grace and cutting lots of slack. But one could never imagine a respectful devout Jewish author writing that way about Old Testament heroes (Moses up on Mt. Sinai 40 days & nights for less noble purposes?), or a sincere Buddhist mocking the Dalai Lama or (Nirvana forbid!) Gauthama Buddha himself? Not gonna happen. Why must a person claiming 'card-carrying-Presbyterian' status make fun at the expense of Christianity and its Holy Book?Thankful for small graces & blessings, this book was a gift that will soon be exchanged for Ken Davis' \\"Supersheep Tales\\" by a real Christian comedian that came highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Sorry I just couldn't get into any rhythm with her writing. It's not so much the style as the substance of what she harps on that is a put-off. Much of what she says comes across in an engaging way, but then WHAMMO! comes the inappropriate or out of place slam against someone or something she has intense disdain for (and NO Christian sympathy or extension of Jesus' hallmark trait of forgiveness/compassion?!?). This strikes me as someone still searching but not finding objective, absolute truth outside of herself. Reading this collage of feelings and opinions, it's clear what Jesus says in the Bible and what is shared in these pages are diametrically opposed. But to her way of thinking, that's o.k. because it's up to US as our own self-authenticating revealers of reality to find our OWN way - some Dalai Lama here, some mysticism there, some superstition here, some Buddha there, some new age meditation-cleansing here, a good luck charm scarlet bracelet there, some cuss words here, some ad nauseam venom against the president there, some liberal radicalness here, some misquoting the Bible there, etc. Why she would choose to twist a key Bible verse (John 1:29) dear to Christians into the fall-guy of a quasi-humorous anecdote about winning a free ham at the grocery store makes one wonder what sort of 'faith' she is advocating. Raggedy Anne, object of Jesus' sacrificial love on the Cross gifting her free and full forgiveness by Grace through repentant faith for her brokenness and sin, has become Ruggedly Animus (at least in print here) against the very Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I barely made it through 1 or 2 chapters before the cussing detracted from any points being made. My minister at our fairly liberal and 'inclusive-of-all-sinners-needing-Jesus-forgiveness' church told me he was immensely offended at how she treats Christ in her writing. I was also shocked at the disrespect with utter disregard. Is there no holy shame? Where is reverent adoration for The Savior?"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott is absolutely wonderful at showing the reader where God's grace has entered her life and thus helping us, the readers, to be more awake to grace in our own lives. But, her constant references to her dislike of George Bush (either one) detract from her message and serve no useful purpose (except perhaps catharsis on her part). If I hadn't already read Traveling Mercies I might have put this one down after the first page. I chose to read on because I know what truth and life can be found in her writings."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Yes, I sit here totally heartbroken this morning at having to give a Lamott book 2 pitiful little stars. I read the intro poem at the front of the book and was mesmerized, inspired and excited. I read \\"The Ham of God\\", the first essay and was in hog heaven (pun intended) and again, inspired and uplifted spiritually! But as the essays went on, I could barely see Anne's wonderful, quirky, irreverent, shining faith for her bitter, mean-spirited, totally out of place attacks on the \\"right wing\\" and the current administration. The book should more aptly be titled: \\"Plan B: Thoughts on My Bitter Political Views\\".I own every single book Anne has written and even went to great trouble and expense to find her early out of print books. I love them all, treasure them and keep them in a special place of honor in my home office. I have recommended her books to hundreds of friends and bought countless copies of \\"Bird by Bird\\" for gifts....but this one, I have to say, missed the mark entirely. It's misleading and most definitely NOT about faith. It comes across overall as the rantings of an aging, cynical woman with tiny glimpses of her fading faith.Anne, listen to your wise pastor Veronica and get back to your roots of forgiveness, compassion and love for your fellow man. Bitterness does not look good on you and is overshadowing your faith in your writing. I wish I'd spent the money I splurged on this book at Starbucks....at least I would have come away with a good taste in my mouth. I feel as if a good friend has betrayed me.... Don't buy this book if you're looking for the \\"old\\" Anne Lamott."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Anne Lamott, as always, knows how to pack a comical punch. In previous outings, she has reduced me to laughter, tears, and audible gasps. Here again, she tries to work her charm--and mostly succeeds.It's a joy to read of her parenting travails. Boy, can I relate. It's always challenging to read Anne's spirituality-strapped-to-shoe-leather. She actually thinks that what she believes should change her life--how revolutionary!Somewhere in the mix, though, it starts to sound a bit...well, preachy. In the nicest sense, of course. Many reviewers have pointed out her political remarks as part of the loss of charm. While I don't agree with Anne on every item, I do appreciate her willingness to be honest about her feelings. She even tries to extend forgiveness to her nemesis, Mr. Bush; but, in light of her later rantings, it's obvious she is still working on it.\\"Plan B...\\" is not a bad one. It's just not as good as Plan A, otherwise known as \\"Traveling Mercies.\\" The humor and raw emotion are here, though in lesser quantities. The writing, as always, lifts it above the level of mediocrity that threatens bookshelves everywhere."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Intelligent, thoughtful Christians who take their spiritual journey seriously - with a sense of wonder and discovery, pain and joy, humor and sadness - will appreciate Lamott sharing her own journey with us.She doesn't purport to speak for all Christians. She doesn't claim to have all the answers. She is human, fabulously so, and like all humans is flawed, imperfect. Her Christ is the Jesus who befriended the outcasts, the downtrodden, the sinful. The Christ who forgave, the Christ who struggled, the Christ given to us in human form because His Father so loved the world.On the other hand, sanctimonious \\"christians\\" who can't stand anyone or anything that challenges their self-satisfied narrow world view should not read this book. Put down the mouse, step away from the computer and stop your silly abuse of the Amazon helpful voting system. Go give five stars to the Left Behind series instead.But those of us who celebrate diversity, who believe God made each and every one of us and He revels in His creations even though He knows how flawed we are - we enjoy being intellectually and emotionally challenged, stimulated, and amused by Lamott's essays.\\"Plan B\\" is an excellent companion book for anyone who is examining their spiritual life. I would recommend it to anyone who has the intellectual capacity to appreciate that a relationship with Jesus, like all relationships, is personal and individual. Lamott's walk with Christ is uniquely her own, but it serves as inspiration for readers hoping to establish or deepen their own connection to God.Lamott is a very talented writer with a well-honed eye and a witty turn of phrase, and her prose is among the best of current American writing.Discerning readers will enjoy this thought-provoking, entertaining and illuminating collection of essays."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I have always more or less enjoyed Ms. Lamott's writing - I appreciate her humor, candor and wisdom and although her politics veer far from mine, I appreciate her writing and find myself reading all her efforts. Her type of honesty is unusual to find written, and that makes her very accessible. Despite the persistent indulgence she took through nearly every essay in dissing our government, I liked this book a lot. She has a very unique perspective."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Any new book by Anne Lamott is a welcome occasion, and this one was no exception. If you enjoyed her Traveling Mercies (1999), Plan B serves up more of her irreverent, painfully honest, explicitly Christian, and humorous reflections on following Jesus at fifty. Her son Sam is a teenager now, she has a new boyfriend, she still loves her integrated Presbyterian church in Marin County, California, and still works hard to accept her dysfunctional family of origin and the neuroses she inherited from them. Forgiving mom looms large, as did finally gathering the family to spread her ashes after hiding them in her closet for a couple years. The dog died. Friends died. She hates the Bush administration, loves Barbara Lee, and marched in peace protests. She started a Sunday school class for kids at her church. And, yes, she still sports dreadlocks and loves to sprinkle profanities throughout her narrative.In her telling, all these prosaic events unfold with genuine insights about our fragile, fallen human condition and the tender mercies of God that attend to us if we would only slow down, breath deeply, open our eyes, see them, and receive them. Being kind is probably more important than being right. Don't try to fix others. Or again, if God hates all the same people you hate then you can be confident that you have created him in your own image.I have to say, though, that at least in this book her nutty humor came across as \\"more of the same\\" and (I think she would admit this) self-absorbed. However humorous in the telling, there is nothing especially remarkable about parenting teenagers, middle-aged flabbiness, and cute little flower girls at weddings. I have only read Lamott's non-fiction, so perhaps her fiction attempts more serious forays into what it means to be fully human and truly Christian in our crazy world (she's published ten books). The problem, as I see it, is that Lamott writes as if she is always trying to be funny, and trying too hard. She is such a good writer that she usually is funny. But at some point it comes across like the proverbial class clown; you know they have even much more to offer if they would stop trying to make you laugh all the time. I did not get the impression from reading Plan B that Lamott has developed much as a writer the last few years. I wish she would, too, because she is a favorite Christian writer of mine and my expectations remain rather high whenever I pick up her latest work."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"I found this book funny, quirky, amusing, and even thought provoking. Some people may not like the way Anne Lamott talks about God and religion but then you can't please everyone. This book is a quick read - like a patchwork quilt of short stories woven together by the thread that is Anne Lamott's life."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"It would be impossible for Anne Lamott to be more honest and transparent in her writing than she is in this book. That quality makes it enlightening, entertaining writing, as she is also an excellent and witty writer.Her writing, to me, is like a combination of David Sedaris, Mother Theresa, and on several occasions The New York Times editorial page (I assume).Because of her utter openness, one can find things to criticize about her opinions, theology, politics, etc, but more importantly, one can find so many things to applaud in this book. Mainly, I enjoyed her discussions of the tastes of life and God--the joys, grief, faith and questions--all laced with humor and humanness.As in all things, she is honest about her liberalism that exerts itself in great social charity but also slips into what she describes as bordering on \\"mental illness.\\" The times when she slips into the confessions of liberal doctrines (i.e. Bush is the devil, and all his underlings demons of hell responsible for the world's suffering and her's and her friends' individual suffering, too, God is \\"he/she\\" then just \\"she,\\" America is to blame for other countries not liking us, etc) I think these type of rantings undermine her attempts to write about faith except when she writes about how she deals with her feelings about Pres. Bush and feelings of despair about the Iraq war that I found to be insightful and honorable. She is the first liberal I have heard admit that she felt a \\"secret gladness\\" when she heard bad news from Iraq because it hurt Pres. Bush's image. She faithfully tries to overcome what she perceives as negative attitudes and practices loving and praying for her \\"enemies.\\"Overall, she presents an honest attempt to live like Jesus. A picture that is rarely given in books about faith, because Christian writers are not normally willing to show all their flaws and shortcomings, even though we all have them and are what makes Christ so necessary for us.Emerson said something like \\"to believe that what is true for you is true for all people is genius.\\" Because that is true, Lamott's writing provides us with insights about us as children, parents, friends, faithful & fearful, weak & strong, living and dying, laughing & crying.I listened to the audio version of this that is read by Ms. Lamott and recommend it.I think you will enjoy this book and learn from it. If you are a conservative, just bear with her during the liberal-political comments and keep moving."},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","review":"Lamott is fun to read. She's poetic, intelligent, articulate, and sincere. In contrast, many of her reviewers here on Amazon demonstrate what is repugnant about so many self-proclaimed Believers: their self-righteous intolerance in the name of the Lord. In the Good Book which the Spirit writes on true hearts, Lamott's pious detractors will Burn in Hell for all Eternity: they didn't love their neighbors as themselves, nor did they love God first: They loved their own misguided and pompous interpretations of God first. In contrast, Lamott is humble and a true seeker. More power to her!

Every bride's maid would profit from reading flower girl. And everyone would profit from Anne's comment about resting. \\"When you rest, you catch your breath, and it fills your lungs and holds you up, like water wings, like my father in the deep end of the rec center pool.\\""},{"Title":"Advertraining: 35 Ways to Turn Students into Fans","review":"I'm a retired CEO and am about to teach an adult ed course.

Or, if you're too busy, you can hire us.\\"This book states that it is targeted to training professionals, high school/college teachers, and marketing professionals, however this author seems to have no insight about any of the above.A much better choice is Training for Dummies - which tackles the subject seriously, including how to measure training's effectiveness - something never even mentioned in this one."},{"Title":"Digital UNIX System Administrator's Guide (HP Technologies)","review":"If you are already familiar with the basics of the Digital Unix operating system (or, Tru64 Unix), this one is a great value.

The book is alive with voices and scenes from the past -- I was especially interested to read how Tom Smith actually talked, and what he had to say about the Biscuit. The description of Seabiscuit's birth is really interesting; I found out that he wasn't even named for awhile, because his original owners were too busy with their more promising-looking colts! Little did they know...The race descriptions have a feeling of exhilaration about them, as if Beckwith can scarcely believe that he was privileged enough to see this great horse in action. And it's very touching to read what people of the time thought about Seabiscuit, and how the man in the street talked about him as if he were a well-loved personality, whose every win is celebrated, and every loss commiserated. You can really see just how important this fiesty little racehorse was to the country.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"Anyone interested in the actual story of Seabiscuit and racing in general should own this book. Not only is it beautifully produced, it is an authentic account of a bygone era, the &quot;proof&quot; for the claim that Seabiscuit was indeed immensely popular in pre-WWII America. In fact, it is only because of that World War that Seabiscuit was forgotten for so long.This is the original story of Seabiscuit written by a track writer who knew the main characters personally, Charles Howard, Red Pollard, and especially Tom Smith. Beckwith's book is the source for many of the quotes made famous in Hillenbrand's best seller and in the movie, such as Tom Smith saying to Seabiscuit, &quot;I'll see you again.&quot; It is great to read these quotes in context. I also enjoyed the terrific line drawings by Howard Brodie--the one of Seabiscuit sleeping on his side is priceless!Beckwith's book was an important source of information for the story of Seabiscuit and it is so great to be able to go back in time and enjoy this moving story with all the excitement and energy of the moment it happened. Five Stars. I highly recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"With all the popular hoopla surrounding the story of Seabiscuit, this new book provides an interesting &quot;contemporary&quot; perspective from writers who were alive and covering this amazing story at the time of all the action. This new high quality re-print of the original book provides an insight and a &quot;voice&quot; to the story which is simply unavailable to any writer today. The preface by Grantland Rice is worth the entire price of the book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"I knew B.K. Beckwith personally, and worked with him the last ten years of his life at Santa Anita. He was our television commercial spokesperson for the Santa Anita Handicap for several years, recounting remembrances of Seabiscuit. He was a consummate horseman turned journalist and writer, and had been at Santa Anita from the opening on Christmas 1934. He also wrote &quot;The Story of Santa Anita,&quot; which was never published commercially, but used the same heroic and emotional Grantland Rice style that you enjoy in his Seabiscuit book. His memory was a treasure, and since he wrote this book contemporaneously with events, you can feel the horse come alive, as well as the people and the places. This is SO GREAT to have the publisher find this work of art, enjoyable for anyone who loves horses, or racing, of any age. The drawings by Howard Brodie -- who went on to great fame otherwise -- are superbly reproduced, and so are the historic photos. You can see the 'Biscuit's personality come through, especially when he's looking out of his personal railroad car at all the fans and cameras, and in several others!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"Good for all ages.Step back in time and stand with the crowds to watch the Biscuit fly down the track. Beckwith takes you there again as he did when he wrote this book more than 60 years ago. The writing style, the photos, and the fabulous drawings all help immerse the reader in the late 1930's time period. I particularly enjoyed seeing the real Seabiscuit and hearing what the owner, trainer, and jockey had to say at the time.If you enjoyed the movie and/or Laura Hillenbrand's book, you will treasure this wonderful piece of tangible history. I recommend this edition highly. Don't miss your opportunity to own this gem!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"Owner of Ponder Publishing Company, LLC, my first response after reading was \`I wish I had found Beckwith's story before this publisher did!' I was there! I heard Seabiscuit breathing. I saw him sweat, felt his determination, smelled the liniment. You could taste the air of early last century, to anguish and rejoice with one horse's determination to Keep on Keeping on, despite all adversity.

Beautifully done by someone who knew the main characters well.Nothing to find fault with here. Terrific read."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"Seabiscuit was my favorite book in elementary school and still rates high amongst a handful of favorites. Many times over decades, circumstances gained perspective by recalling the depth of spirit and perseverance conveyed so concisely by Mr. Beckwith. Seabiscuit's story is truly for all ages. I believe stories like this are a reason why people are prone to assign human emotions to animals or treat them like a best friend.As a child I often dreamt about having a horse, hoping I might even be fortunate enough to have one like Seabiscuit. I ended up with four, all of whom indelibly changed my life. I took care of them as if my life depended upon them; even sleeping with them in their stalls when I could get away with it. Bingo, Scamper, Scully and Crackerjack have permanent places in my heart. With them is a picture of Seabiscuit from Mr. Beckwith's book. They always gave their very best and showed me mine. Anyone who reads Seabiscuit's story will come to understand that the innate ability to recover and succeed resides in every person and all life. Opportunity to find and use that power of heart and energy is always available.I am infinitely grateful to Mr. Beckwith for recognizing and writing Seabiscuit's story and especially to my father for making a vital, life changing dream come true."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion","review":"The photos and sketches are wonderful as is the timeliness (1940) of the writing.

On my most recent trip I asked a guide if there were any books worth reading on fly-fishing the Tongariro River. He mentioned several, but near the top of the list was this one by Zane Grey. The book is loosely in 4 parts: The journey to New Zealand, Marlin fishing in the Bay of Islands area, Trout fishing around the Taupo area, and a wrap-up where he answers some of his critics.Zane Grey was a famous author and renowned fisherman. His visit to New Zealand (detailed in this book) was at the behest of the NZ government who at the time (1920s) was seeking to promote their new big game fishing to a waiting world. Through his well-detailed exploits, its hard not to detect a touch or arrogance in his writing when he refers to the \\"primitive equipment and techniques\\" used by the locals. However, this is soon forgotten as his descriptions clearly convey a boyish sense of excitement with almost every big fish hooked. His descriptions of both the Bay of Islands and Taupo areas also show him to have been a true nature lover and keen observer of the natural world.I can heartily recomend this book to the keen fisherman. For a trout fisher such as myself, the descriptions of 11lb fish caught in the 1920s is mind boggling - I can't wait to get back!"},{"Title":"Back to the Wild","review":"My 8 year old son checked this book out from the library.

However the vocabulary was a little over his head."},{"Title":"Between Sundays: Black Women and Everyday Struggles of Faith (George Gund Foundation Book in African American Studies)","review":"I had a chance to read an early copy of this book. (Full disclosure: I know Dr. Frederick personally.) As an anthropologist of religion, I very much appreciated her careful ethnographic work in understanding the subject of African-American spirituality. As she points out, the Black Church in the U.S. is generally understood in political and institutional terms; individual experiences of faith get elided into the overarching category of &quot;The Black Church.&quot; Thus whether people see this church as a good thing (progressive social institution, empowering ideology) or a bad thing (patriarchal institution of control) they do not necessarily see the nuanced understandings that individuals can hold. Frederick's book is a wonderful companion to those focusing on the history of the black church as an institution or political agent by bringing in the ethnographcially rich element of faith, interpretation and agency from the 'ground up.' Her own perspective as an anthropologist trained at Duke, now a faculty member at Harvard, an African-American woman from the South and a practicing Christian provides a richness to her analysis and relationship with her subject that is often absent from these sorts of works. Well written, interesting, and fun to read."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Michener is one of my favorite authors and this has long been on my shelf.

Very good in other parts describing the culture/people of those islands."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"If you've read the responsible histories of the Pacific War, Michener's 1946 book offers and all together different take of that event--a home-front view, as it were, more civilian, and provincial, in character than military. It brings back a time when the islands of the South Pacific were once merely vague dot in the ocean with strange names and even stranger people.

Michener's \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\" is great reading. I wanted to read it after seeing a revival of the musical \\"South Pacific\\".The book is written in a casual, easy-going style. There is much detail about the islands of the Pacific and their eccentric inhabitants.As the musical makes clear: when you're in the Pacific, old ideas and customs become irrelevant. It's an amazing mixing bowl of races.There are many hair-raising and some amusing stories.It's easy to see why it was a best seller - especially for the many Aussies and Americans who served in the Pacific.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"read it when first published. was very enthusiastic. thought i would read again. it appears to be very real. always impressed me as all of his work does. shows americans in all their shades of humanity, the wisdom, stupidity,bravery and all aspects. probably read it again in a few years time. puts me in the mood to re-read all his other works which think i have read most.yes i purchased this at amazon"},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Tales of the South Pacific is the first book written by James A. Michener, but I read ten of his novels before I found time to read it. It is a collection of short stories relating to life in the Pacific theater of WW II. If you've read Michener before and liked what you read, this will be for you. I expected this to be good, but not up to the standards of his later novels. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! His handling of plot, characterization, and description is excellent. I love the book because I can read a complete Michener story in one sitting, something the length of his novels prevents. If you like Michener, or historical fiction, or both, this book is well worth your investment."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Thanks to James Michener's engrossing writing, the reader feels the heat, boredom, beauty, danger, love, hate, death and prejudice that those who served in the South Pacific in WWII experienced. Several of these compelling stories were brought to life in the plot of one of the greatest musical dramas in Broadway history."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Very intersting book, written 1946. Gives a good understanding of the feelings of soldiers in the Second world war. The author was in the Navy himself at that time.Very worth to read it."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"The omission of this work from the academic canon is another comment on the discriminatory but hardly discriminating state of literary studies today. Michener is far more than a captivating storyteller, collector of colorful characters, painter of vivid natural imagery, and documentor of the orchestrations of world warfare. Each of the \\"tales\\" comprising his carefully-constructed epic narrative is at once thematically and stylistically related to the other smaller narratives and at the same time artistically whole in itself.If the reader has expectations of a single-minded patriotic paean to the fighting men of the South Pacific, a close reading of the early chapter, \\"Mutiny,\\" should dispel any such illusions. Here, as throughout the book, Michener uses nature and the ocean as a test, a touchstone, and a foil--exposing the folly not just of warring nations and military campaigns but of arrogant, imperialist civilizations and many of their prideful citizens. Tony Fry, his anti-authoritarian, compassionate \\"hero,\\" commits a subversive act that links him with the mutineers on board the Bounty and casts the American command in the role of Bligh and Hitler! In the next story, \\"Cave,\\" Fry emerges as a war-time philosopher whose meditations on courage move him to acts of selfless, Christ-like charity. In \\"Boar's Tooth\\" Fry is able to overcome his resistance to a primitive religious ritual involving pain and sacrifice as he contrasts it with the empty and self-serving practices of modern religion.The American fighting men and women who come to the South Pacific bring no small amount of baggage from a flawed social order back home, and Michener's heroes are not simply the individuals who perform fearlessly in combat: they're just as likely to be the narrow-minded Americans who are transformed by their experiences in the South Pacific into better human beings. \\"Our Heroine,\\" the story of Nellie Forbush, is a shocking expose of racism, delivering a reeling blow comparable to explosive moments in Flannery O'Connor or Faulkner. When Nellie learns that her fiance's former lover is dead and rejoices not because a rival has been removed but because a black person has been eliminated, she would seem to be beyond the redemption experienced even by O'Connor's most degenerate souls. But in an earlier story about \\"the Remittance Man\\" Michener's narrator has constructed a definition of heroism based on courage and an exclusive vision of the sacred status of all human life, allowing us to see how Nellie's eventual change of heart qualifies her for inclusion among the company of true heroes.The famous Bali Hai chapter (\\"Fo' Dolla\\"), far from an escapist love story, is at once romantic tragedy in the tradition of \\"Madame Butterfly\\" and tragicomedy in its portrayal of accessory characters who recall the nurse and friar in \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\" And once again the narrative's definition of the \\"heroic\\" allows us to see the tragedy play out not merely as a tale of star-crossed lovers but as a drama of choices and their painful consequences. In each case the act precedes and produces illumination: Joe Cable's venture into Bali Hai and the Dionysian produces self-discovery because ultimately it becomes a \\"shared discourse\\" with his dark-skinned, native lover, who turns out to be a \\"real person\\" with a history of her own.Michener is as likely to locate the heroic away from the war as on island battlefields or the Pacific main, because his real subject is human nature and the courage to live in the face of obstacles both natural and human. To their credit, Rodgers and Hammerstein detected (and partially, if unevenly, captured) the strength in Michener's novel: Each of us has a Bali Hai, and our failures to reach it can be traced as much to failures of courage and vision as to the ironclad circumstances of existence."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"To use an old cliche, this book gives the reader a sense of &quot;being there&quot; during the Second World War in the Pacific theater.This is not a chronicle of the war itself. It is not a military history, although it is full of military anecdotes. It's a series of loosely connected stories of the prolonged island-hopping campaign across the Pacific, related through the personal experiences of a variety of characters. Michener's emphasis is on the individuality, humor, valor, and idiosyncrasies of the men and women who populated the bases and combat units of the Pacific campaign.As anyone who has seen the musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; (based on a part of this book) knows, it includes the island natives and expatriates who happened to live in the places where the war was taking place. In reading these stories, you may come to understand why many of the armed forces veterans of the Pacific war were drawn to go back to the islands in later years.If I were limited to one sentence, I'd say that this book is about everyday Americans doing unusual jobs in exotic places. I like it well enough that I've read it multiple times and consider it a favorite. It's a lot easier reading than many of Michener's later epics, and in my opinion it's as good as anything he's ever written and better than most."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I first read this book when I was young, not long after I saw the movie &quot;South Pacific&quot;. I didn't particularly like it because the characters were the same ones as in the movie but they didn't &quot;fit&quot; in the same way. After many, manyy years, I read it just the other night and loved it! It had been long enough since I saw the film that the characters could stand on their own. Mitchener wrote this soon after the war when his memories were still fresh and he displays a great deal of affection for the &quot;typical&quot; sailor caught thousands of miles from home. For many, they would never get home. To this American tale, he adds a lot of tropical spice: Bloody Mary, the Frenchman's Daughter, Emil De Becque himself. Mitchener shows the American fighting man as hero, coward, nice guy, louse, sacrificial, selfish, and mostly a combination of all of these traits. Although I have read many of Mitchener's books, this is still his best: young, filled with Mitchener's memories from his recently-concluded naval service during World War II. Deservedly one of the classics that came from World War II."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I read this book for the first time in 2006. It is a wonderful book, very valuable in learning about daily life for American soldiers during World War II. You also learn what the South Pacific Islands were like then. I have been a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand so I know what is like to have left a life behind in the United States and to live in another country. When you are signed up for a certain period of time, you always have to keep in mind that you are going back to the life you had before, but you are living a totally different kind of life now. People back home will never quite understand what you have experienced and many will not care. Most will only want to know a shallow version of that life. A person keeps most stories to themselves. I feel that Michener understood the life he wrote about in the South Pacific and was able to fictionalize many true stories. The book has insight, compassion and wit for it's protaganists. Just a wonderful book and I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Because this is Michener's first published book, because it is different from his subsequent works, and because many people are more familiar with the Rogers and Hammerstein musical than with the book, I will reveal my biases up front. I do not care for epic historicals, and so have never enjoyed Michener's writing before reading Tales of the South Pacific. The musical was Rogers and Hammerstein's second or third collaborative effort, and to me was a poor follow up to Oklahoma.That said, reading this book gave me the feeling I have when my father and I rummage through his collection of black and white war photos, postcards, and 78 RPM disks from his days as a Chief Petty Officer in the US Navy in and around the South Pacific. Each artifact stimulates a story, many of which are linked to another, and another. Sometimes the stories are about the war theater in Europe or Africa or home in the states. Most often, they are simply about friendships, loss and the discoveries of an eighteen year old doing a man's work in the first few months away from his parents' farm.Like my father's stories, Michener's Tales of the South Pacific could be set anywhere, but they are about being somewhere other than where one comes from. They are about finding belonging in new surroundings and accepting that great people are rarely 100 percent great. Michener's heroes are the very human people who were decent to one another, believed in the value of their nation's cause and the people around them, demonstrated leadership, but didn't take the trappings of the navy or rank very seriously. His nemeses were not just the Japanese, but American biggots, mean SOBs and phonies. Like Hersey's, Bell for Adano, the stories were practically current events when they were published, and Michener's perspective on sex and the races were shocking material for many Americans who had been fed years of propaganda about their boys (and girls) overseas and who only after 1945 could truly emerge from the depression of 1930s to enter a new, modern and more aggressively democratic age. Tales of the South Pacific foreshadowed the new world to come while honoring the great people who helped to make it possible. At the end of the book, the reader is glad to be among the survivors, standing in the graveyard among heroes, but worried that the supply of greatness might someday be used up."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I admit I had very little idea what this book was about when I bought it, but it seemed like something I should read while on vacation in the South Pacific last fall. It wasn't quite the island paradise novel that I thought it would be - it really is a book about WWII, in which the islands of the South Pacific are characters, but despite not being what I thought I enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't put the book down until I was done. My reading experience was definitely enhanced by the view of the ocean that I had from my overwater hut in Bora Bora where I was when I read the book, but even if you aren't on vacation in some exotic locale, South Pacific is a classically entertaining novel well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Mitchener's World War 2 collection of short stories remains as vibrant and compelling in terms of human interest today--as when it was written. Alternating between the logistics of war with personal suffering and joy, these stories present the reader with a composite of life and death in tropical paradise. Characters popularized in the Broadway musical, South Pacific, appear in several stories in this fascinating patchwork of passion and pathos. As all emotions prove more poignant in a backdrop of war, the inner conflicts of personal desire and frustration touched responsive chords in both post-war and contemporary readers.Mitchener's themes include frequent references to racial prejudice which was rampant in still-insular America. As well as the devastating effect of prolonged heat and limited space in Westerners. Throughout the book runs the thread of the Allies' gradual reclamation of the Japanese-held islands, culminating in the strike on Kuralei, with its the shocking toll of life. As the ubiquitous narrator pays a respectful visit to the new cemetery, this collection draws to a gentle close, yet Mitchener's unforgettable characters live on in our literary memory. If nothing else this book reveals the tremendous debt we owe to the brave men and women of the armed services. A sensitiveyet historically-accurate masterpiece, for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"This was Michener's first book and it's one of his shortest. It is also, for my money, his best (though I must admit I haven't read them all), maybe because it is based on personal experience and not research. Exotic island locations, memorable characters and stories: excellent even without the Rogers and Hammerstein tunes."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"This 1947 novel won a Pulitzer Prize and established Michener's reputation as a writer. This book preserves the manners and culture of America circa 1940, both in what he wrote and what he didn't write. Michener shows his artistry in his descriptions of the foliage, flowers, seas, lights, and the people. Michener served in the Navy during WW II, and wrote many other books over the next fifty years. In 1960 he ran for office as a JFK Democrat, in 1968 he was a delegate to the Democratic Convention pledged to RFK.These stories describe life on the islands of the South Pacific. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; tells of the Japanese invasion fleet that threatened New Zealand. The civilian population would flee to the hills, leaving the old men and boys to guard the beaches with picks and axes; they had no other weapons. &quot;Mutiny&quot; tells of Norfolk Island, the former prison that was inhabited by the descendants of the Mutineers on the Bounty. They had to cut down old pine trees to make an airport. &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; tells of the Ensign who had too much time on his hands. &quot;The Cave&quot; tells how they received information on Japanese activities until their coastwatcher was eliminated. &quot;The Milk Run&quot; tells of a rescue of a downed pilot. &quot;Alligator&quot; is about the planning and background for the attack on Kuralei in the coming months. &quot;Dry Rot&quot; tells of the skin diseases and other disorders from living on an island in the tropics.&quot;Fo' Dolla'&quot; subtly explains political economy, the effect of plentiful money on an isolated region, and the interaction of human emotions and power; all wrapped up in a colorful story. The Sea Bees made war souvenirs and grass skirts. &quot;Passion&quot; tells of a problem in censoring personal letters. &quot;A Boar's Tooth&quot; notes the religious ways of some island peoples. Can a pig be sacred? Is pain and suffering at the center of all religions? Was Michener an Agnostic? &quot;Wine for the Mess at Segi&quot; explains the travails of getting refreshments for Christmas. When the celebration ends, they learn they will hit the next beachhead. &quot;The Airstrip at Konora&quot; tells about capturing an enemy-held island and creating a 6,000-foot airstrip from coral.&quot;Those Who Fraternize&quot; tells about the French colonial planter's society, and their relations with the Navy. &quot;The Strike&quot; describes the Kuralei operations, the Supply Depot, and the masses of goods needed for the invasion. Naval aviators loved baseball caps (did this create the fashion?) The author tells how important it could be to know an admiral! The big attack on the Depot came from a hurricane. An ammunition carrier anchored in the channel exploded; no one ever found out why. &quot;Frisco&quot; tells of the beginning of the assault on Kuralei. This is continued in &quot;The Landing on Kuralei&quot; which describes the landing on the beaches. This is the climax of the book. &quot;A Cemetery at Hoga Point&quot; wraps up the story. Who replaces the good men who died, asks Michener.We now know that the Japanese code was broken before Pearl Harbor, and our top military leaders knew of their plans. The emphasis was on first winning the war in Europe. The island hopping strategy was based on winning the war with minimal means. Japan lost the war with the Battle of Midway; they gambled on a quick victory, and lost."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Because I had seen the movie South Pacific, which was based on this book, I already knew the main characters and the plot of the story once I reached for this tear-jerking book. But, Michener surprised me with this war-time, romancing drama that depicts realism in a manner of brashness.

Michener only takes you a little further. Read for yourself..."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Tales of the South Pacific is a book of interconnected short stories that take place during World War II. Each story is told from the perspective of a different military officer. Some of the characters make repeat appearances in other stories later in the book. It was a nice touch because we were able to find out what happened to them after the stories they were featured in were over.I must admit when I read the first few stories, I was pretty sure this book wouldn't warrant a very high rating from me. First of all, I tend to avoid books about war. They just don't appeal to me. Secondly, these early stories didn't grab my attention. As I kept reading, I found myself totally immersed in the lives of these soldiers. I really felt for them and the situation that they were in. I think my favorite story in the book was \\"Fo' Dolla\\". It was longer than the other stories, the character development was deeper, and the emotional impact was higher. Overall, this was a great read. I can see why it won the Pulitzer. The only reason I didn't give the book a five star rating is because I just didn't feel those first few stories. It took me a bit to warm up to them. This was my first book by Michener, but it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"The loved the movie and the musical and found this bookgripping."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I picked up this book looking for some vivid imagery of the South Pacific to help build anticipation for my upcoming vacation to Bora Bora, which is said to have been the basis for Michner's fantastical Bali Hai. While this book wasn't quite what I was expecting, it was a terrific narrative of the war in the Pacific, and in several places painted a colorful picture of the natural beauty of South Pacific islands.A contrast to most wartime fiction I've read, the vast majority of this book occurs a great distance from the action. This distance causes the characters to reflect upon their role and purpose in the war, and forces them to preoccupy themselves with whatever they have available to them. The need to amuse themselves leads to this collection of entertaining antidotes, from courting nurses in a nearby hospital, to speculating about the mysterious life of a distant spy, to distributing medicine to a beautiful island of native women.Michener saves his best for last, as he releases the tension built upon the endless island waiting in an abrupt storm of war as he masterfully details the chronology of an island invasion. After the battle the characters reveal what they have learned about heroism and wartime contribution.While the characters in this book are lovable and memorable, Tales of the South Pacific doesn't leave you wondering what happens to them next. Rather, you wish the novel's focus could pan to another nearby island and start the whole process again, meeting and watching the next crew of airmen, officers, and enlisted men, as they wait for their chance to fight the enemy.I had to assume that the details of this novel were historically accurate (despite being a work of fiction), since it is said Michener wrote this novel while in a quansett hut on one such island.If you are going to read this novel, I would recommend making a conscious effort to remember names and places, because as the book progresses, familiar faces and intertwining references to past stories become more and more frequent. I have still not seen the musical, so I can make no comparison with the film or stage show."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I'm an avid Michener fan.

Fans of the show will definitely enjoy the novel, although the material used for the show is only about one fifth of the book.It is basically a novel in short stories, with the same narrator (presumably Michener himself). As the other reviews state, it does indeed give you an idea of what it really was like to be there. The two stories that primarily inspired the show are \\"Fo' Dolla\\" and \\"Our Heroine.\\" (I especially enjoyed seeing how the song, \\"Twin Soliloquies\\", was lifted right out of the book!)The only other Michener novel I have read so far is Caribbean. He does seem to have a style - a series of loosely connected stories, concluding in a final story that ties up the loose ends.

This did win the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. The comparision between the book and the play is like comparing apples to oranges. The play focuses in on Nellie and Emille and Liat and Cable. In the book there are at least a dozen or more seperate stories, none who are in the play. Nellie, Emillie, Cable and Liat are only two chapters in there book. I can see where people did not totally enjoy the book, maybe if you saw the play first you would love the book like I did. For the average high school student to have this book on the summer reading list, it probably would be boring. The book describes a bygone time but with modern day desires. The reader needs to transport themselves to where this is all taking place. The first paragraph of the book really tries to put the reader in that place, the vastness of the ocean, the lonliness, the native people, unbelievable. I really enjoyed the book and if you saw the play read the book it will have enhanced your experience of the play."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"This is a collection of 'tales' but together they are also linked as a complete story about a group of people that is preparing for a strike on an island held by the Japanese in the Pacific in WW II.The stories are about love, infedelity, loving native girls, pregnancy, marriage but also sadness, war, and ultimately death during the strike when some of the characters use their live, and not always in a flattering way.It is also a book describing the beauty of the islands in the South Pacific (Bali Ha'I) and the kindness of the native people. The story about the boar's tusks is amazing. One of the last stories is about all the men before they start fighting, they talk about their time in San Francisco, for most the last place they were in the US.It's a lot different than his others books, especially a lot thinner. It's magically written and sometimes heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Liquor, love, babes, war, ships, planes, etc.! You name it and Michener included it somewhere in his book. Tales of the South Pacific is a book that is written to make many different points about human nature and war. Many of the characters whom the reader is made to sympathize with show the aspects of human life. These characters are also brought to the piont that the only thing they will ever have is what they had doubted the entire war... heroism. These short stories are written in a heavy style that becomes too much work to read sometimes. Even so, the reader is brought along by wondering about the welfare of the special character that they feel close to. This writing is best if one can take brakes through-out the book to let their mind catch up with the story. This book was interesting, yet overall the way in which the characters are represented made the book come alive with emotions."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to see the revival of \\"South Pacific\\" at Lincoln Center in New York City. It was a wonderful experience and it got me to thinking about the book upon which the musical was based, so I bought the book on my way home.This book was written over 50 years ago, but still holds up well as a chronicle of wartime in the Pacific theater. Many of the characters from the musical are in the book, but not necessarily in the same situations. The real \\"hero\\" of this book is the South Pacific itself, and the feeling for the islands instilled in the men who were serving there.I've read elsewhere that the writing is not first quality and the plots of the stories (there are 19 of them) rather thin. Accepting these things to be true, the book is still well worth reading, because it does give the modern reader some insight into the thoughts and actions of the men fighting, and waiting to fight, on the many islands scattered throughout a vast expanse of ocean.You'll also read the subtle racism that existed at that time, even if it is not highlighted by the writing.

It continues through 1943 when things have at last started to look more optimistic. South Pacific is full of Michener's own views against bias, and his vision of a people unfettered by the prejudices of their parochial backgrounds. The Broadway musical had the stars Enzio Pinza and Mary Martin in the leading Tony awared winning roles, and the show won ten Tony's; becoming the only Broadway show to win all four awards for acting. The 1958 film version with Rossano Brazzi and Mitzi Gaynor in the leads, along with John Kerr, Ray Walston, and Juanita Hall is a must see.I don't know how well young people can understand the depth of the adult emotions that fill South Pacific from one end to the other, but for those interested in courage, fortitude, love that goes beyond devotion, and the trimuph of the American will when it had to triumph, I must say you need to know and appreciate \\"South Pacific.\\"Jim French, Dakota, Illinois, USA January 3, 2013"},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"stay away from this edition, from this publisher. spelling errors thruout book are unacceptable. plus, print quality is so poor that parts of words are simply obliterated. to the publisher: what is the point of so many speling erors? oops, spelling errors."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I was a little disappointed in the book.

I believe that, for the time, they were very enlightening, enchanting, and, at times, even vividly frightening. But if one is to judge it by modern standards, Michener was anything but realistic about the grim realities of war and death. (I do think his last two stories, The Landing on Kuralei and A Cemetery at Hoga Point are very powerful writings, on any standard). Essentially, taken in the context of his time the book is a good one, but not a great one. Taken in today's world of realism, The Tales of the South Pacific is simply OK."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"&quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; is one of those books I don't want to believe. How can a book which puts such an romantic layer over something horrible become a classic?The book is a mix of a novel and a collection of short-stories, becoming more novel-like towards the end. Several characters reappear, some more often than others. They are integrated in stories about either a strange idea of love, heroic tales about ideal soldiers and detailed descriptions of war plans and battles. Following that order, the book is ridiculous, disgusting and boring.When in the second story &quot;Coral Sea&quot; a New Zealander gives a description what New Zealand will become if it is captured by Japan, you wonder what is going on here. Why is this description there, talking about &quot;white men being used on farms&quot;? It dehumanizes the enemy, the Japanese and is just one instance of many in this book where those people are described in the most defying ways one could imagine. Maybe I'm just not used to that, but the ongoing glorification of Americans versus the prejudiced description of the non-human Japanese in this book just made me sick. Of course war can only be fun if the enemies are pure evil, but I live in the real world where everybody is a human being.Next tale, &quot;Mutiny&quot; is about a captain who has to decide if some old trees are chopped down for an airstrip. Of course he does (after all, they're just trees), but what's interesting is the description of a girl called Lucy living on this island. The words used for her are the following: chubby, crazy, fat little moron, chubby moron, etc. Very nice and a good basis for the description of all natives. Lucy isn't a native but a mix between natives and white men, an idea that makes our &quot;feel a bit sick his stomach&quot;.On other occasions natives are primitive beasts who are unable to understand anything (because they can't speak English which makes them not worth respecting them), who are dumb and naive, maybe greedy, often mysterious and odd. But there are also good things, because when the natives are female and young, they function as excellent sex objects. Really romantic, isn't it? In the &quot;tragic&quot; story &quot;Fo' Dolla'&quot; a poor American soldier falls in love (read &quot;has a lot of sex&quot;) with a young native girl and just can't live his life with her. He doesn't need to explain why since his motives are quite logical. Right? He is an American and she is a native, so what other motives for dumping her, after using her, do you need?The rest of the book consists of terribly boring descriptions of battle plans of which I have no idea why anyone would want to read about them. There are also battles which aren't more exciting because you don't care about the characters, since you don't know them. The author doesn't care either, since most of the deaths are just mentioned without going into detail. &quot;Then so-and-so many were killed... three were shot... we lost so-and-so many soldiers... etc.&quot; After all, they're soldiers, it is war, they're supposed to die. Right? And if they're white they're at least lucky enough to be heroes because, well, white soldiers are good and others... not. My favourite quote: &quot;I thought of the dead Japs bobbing upon the shorelines... Even some of them had been good men... All men rotting in Iron Bottom Bay were good men too. etc. etc.&quot; Repeating it doesn't make it better or less disgusting.What is left is a view of war which is very far from realism. Criticiscm about war is unknown to the author. They did what they had to do, and there was enough fun, alcohol and girls to enjoy it even more. I don't deny that the book is sometimes entertaining, because some of the recurring characters are interesting. But it also is glorifying war, it depicts natives and Japanese as negative as possible and it replaces love with sex. If that has to be part of a classic, I have no problems with getting rid of some classics pretty fast. Read Steinbeck instead, or Spike Milligan's memories of the war, if you like. &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; is most of the time just disgusting."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Its all here - fantastic locations, gripping stories love, death, war, bigots and racists, hope, waiting waiting waiting on desolate coral atols, disease, cowards and heros, an ancient avenue of noble pines cut down for a runway, a mountain moved in a week, wild tribes, brutal nature, life lived and lost.

While all are set during the War, they are quite different from each other. Some are of battles, some of strategy, and some of love featuring soldiers, nurses, and native islanders. Others take a more philosophical slant as the men reconsider their lives while in service.While entertaining, I am not really a fan of the short story genre and so had a little bit of a hard time getting involved in the characters and the stories, although I liked that they followed a general timeline, keeping them all united. Some of the longer ones, especially Fo' Dolla I enjoyed a lot. The descriptions of the South Pacific seem very accurate as do the motivations and actions of the characters.

He wrote it following a tour in the South Pacific during WWII.Authentic is the best word I can find to describe it. His imagery and stories are very powerful and really transported me into the islands of the South Pacific during the war.The tales are distinct but related by recurring characters. A lot of people were waiting for the big push and in the meantime experienced boredom, love, longing and discomfort. Living on islands with few facilities was difficult. They found comfort in whiskey, girls and general carousing.There were smugglers, scoundrels, brutes, heroes and a long list of characters that are memorable and feel authentic.I agree with several reviewers that the physical book is an embarassment. The type is small and faded on many pages. There are many spelling mistakes. Given that it's an excellent book, the attention paid to this edition is absolutely atrocious.For my rating, I'll ignore the physical aspects of the book. It's a wonderful read.

Tales of the South Pacific is a collection of short stories based upon Michener's WWII experience in the South Pacific. Rogers and Hammerstein borrowed characters from the stories and put them in the musical South Pacific. Tales of the South Pacific is much grittier. It is basically about the war effort and the characters, GI and locals who share that slice of time. If you order Tales of the South Pacific, you might also want to purchase Return to Paradise, in which Michener returns to the same islands in 1951. These stories chronical the post war effect on island life. Both books are somewhat dated, but nevertheless are important for being eye-witness accounts of a significant chapter in American history."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I have read and enjoyed a number of Michener novels.

If you are a Michener fan or are interested n the Pacific Theatre of WWII, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"This is a pretty good book, but I kept getting the feeling Michener didn't really do much in World War II. He's got a lot to say about officers messing around with women, and that's okay. He's got a lot to say about getting ready to fight, and that's okay. But fighting? Not much. Oh well, at least he didn't write about a lot of blood baths. Still, it hardly seems like a war novel."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Reading \\"Tales of the South Pacific,\\" you get a feeling of what it was like \\"being there.\\" Unfortunately, James A. Michener makes no apologies about the fact that \\"being there\\" was often quite boring. The Pacific theater was often a day of intense combat followed by months of monotonous sitting around. This is a book about the months of sitting around.The book reminds me a bit of \\"Catch-22.\\" Both are products of World War II. Both are about the hijinks of a group of U.S. servicemen sitting around between battles. Both focus more on character than plot. The difference is \\"Catch-22\\" has sharper wit, and feels more realistic on a personal level. Despite the zany nature of the novel, when characters die in \\"Catch-22,\\" the death feels heavy. The deaths in \\"South Pacific\\" are often strangely detached. In some ways, \\"Catch-22\\" feels like a parody of \\"South Pacific.\\" However, the characters and situations in \\"Catch-22\\" could be transported to any war at any time. I think that's why history will remember \\"Catch-22\\" better than \\"South Pacific.\\"That's not to say that the book doesn't have some wonderful and powerful moments. My favorite part of the book is a story narrated by the character Bus Adams about how he was shot down and stranded, and the military spent $600,000 in a rescue mission to pull him out of the sea in enemy territory. It creates a stark contrast with the Japanese, who expected their men to crash their zeros into Allied ships in mindless suicide missions.While the book does have some beautiful, poetic passages, much of the it is a monotonous drone. There is little dialogue to break up the long paragraphs, with sentences as predictable as a sleep-inducing lullaby.The book has some memorable characters, like Bloody Mary and Luther Billis. Other characters tend to blend into one another, making it necessary to keep a running list of characters and their back stories to keep them straight.I say this book is dated because it was written in 1947 for an audience that would have been much more familiar with the events. Two generations later, when lay readers have general knowledge of the events with 65 years' perspective, but not intimate details of the military jargon and specific operations that were still fresh in the minds of the original readers, this adds a veil of inaccessibility today. I am not saying that is a fault of Michener, but it does detract from the \\"timelessness\\" of the book.Non-white characters are reduced to stereotypes. I am not complaining that this book is not politically correct. Whitewashing history with political correctness actually undermines claims of historical racism. Referring to the Japanese as \\"Japs\\" is historically accurate. It would have been natural for Americans to depict them as inhuman monsters (as many Americans died at Pearl Harbor as during the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, and the Japanese Imperial Army committed atrocities on mainland Asia for which they are still unrepentant). Keep in mind that Michener's wife was Japanese, and he was a great admirer of Japanese art, so he probably wasn't racist against the Japanese himself. I also don't complain that the native women are viewed primarily as sex toys for bored GIs. That, too, would have been historically accurate. But it gets to be a little too much in the scene where the two \\"colored\\" men, who are picaninny stereotypes, are honored to bury the heroic white folk who died in battle.Like \\"Catch-22,\\" Michener tries to give some ironic humor in portraying how silly the men's boozing, womanizing and black-marketeering were in the prelude to one of the most decisive battles of the war. This might have been a way to introduce conflict into an otherwise rambling book. It works in the scene where Billis takes Fry to a ritual pig slaughter, where the natives will harvest priceless boar tusks. There is also a touching chapter in which the narrator, who is charged with cutting down some trees for a landing strip, has a clash with a local woman who is opposed to the destruction of the trees her forefathers planted, and he eventually comes to respect her veneration for the trees (although he ultimately has to cut them down). But at other times this lack of focus makes the book mind-numbingly boring.Then there's the final battle that the book has been building up to (I won't give away any details). Rather than being the exciting scene it could have been, the battle is reduced to a dry timeline of who did what when. Half the paragraphs start like, \\"At 1605...\\"In conclusion, if there's a Readers' Digest version of the book available, go for that. This is a classic example of how less could be more."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I loved the movie and wanted to read the book.

I suppose part of it stems from the fact that in general I happen to not enjoy war stories, the exception being The Killer Angels which I also recently read. Just a personal note, so if you are the type who doesn't agree, well, there you go. :) Overall, I found that when I enjoyed a story, I really enjoyed it - and when I didn't, I tended to be slightly bored by the writing. I was absolutely a little disappointed since it was one of the Pulitzers I was looking most forward to reading; though I do feel the scope and portrayal of the people and events do warrant the award."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Maybe it was because he was so young when he wrote it or maybe it was because it was his first published novel, but I thought this fell short of the kind of work I have come to expect from James. Having read and thoroughly enjoyed such behemoths as Texas, Chesapeake and Caribbean, I was expecting great things from this book, especially since it won the Pulitzer. I found that the book didn't flow very well and the character's (aside from Bloody Mary) were not very well developed. Being a fan of the historical epics, I find that Michener doesn't really hit his stride until he wrote Hawaii in 1959. Tales was written in 1947. If you like Michener for his history, this book will disappoint."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"I picked this up used last summer and, in light of ongoing world events, it seems as appropriate as any war story to read now. Indeed it may be more useful than most, since it is based on a point of view shared by many older Americans but not as many younger ones. This is from WWII, the Pacific Theater of course, a time and place where Americans felt they were fighting the good fight, and maybe they were. Still, this book presents a very serious subject - war - with unapologitic racism and, generally, a &quot;white man's burden&quot; perspective.The writing itself is spare and Hemingway-esque, a good choice for the subject matter. Like Micheal Herr in the Vietnam-era &quot;Dispatches&quot;, the author writes about the fighting from a distance, though Michener appears to have been a naval officer. Unlike Herr, Michener is uncritical of the idea of war, but he does show some of the seamier side of the soldiers' lives, for example their relationships with native women. The writing carries one along and builds (unevenly) to the climax, an island invasion that is bloody in a clinical way. No agonizing over spilled guts here, the attitude is &quot;we had a job to do and we did it and blah blah.&quot; For those used to post-Vietnam literature, this may seem a bit cold.I have read other Michener books, I recall Poland and The Covenant specifically, and Tales is clearly superior in readability and literary quality. Michener's historical novels suffer from forced, dragging plots, cardboard characters, and endless page counts, but Tales seems to be alive with real, if not always sympathetic, people.All in all, a book worth reading if you are interested in the war, but hardly a complete source for any perspective."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"Just remember they are all complete fiction, after all. Nothing recounted in these stories is real! The Island of Vanacoro? Fake. Ditto Bali Ha'i. Operation Alligator? Fake. The Remittance Man? Doubtless Fake.He DOES kind of get the fact that there was this thing called WWII though....NO WONDER it was made into a mindless musical...although I bet Mel Brookes could have made it MUCH more entertaining!"},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"My first Michener novel.I was listening to an NPR show talking about the unexpected hit that the current (2008) Broadway revival ofSouth Pacifichas been. In the show they started talking about this book, the inspiration for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. I was just finishing a book and this sparked my interest. I also heard it won a Pulitzer Prize, so I went out and picked it up.I had never read anything by the fabled James Michener before, but this (his first book) seems a far cry from the bricks of historical fiction that would later make his name. Instead, Tales of the South Pacific is an interconnected series of short stories detailing the lives of the Naval men and women serving in the South Pacific. It covers the inactive period between the battle of Coral Sea (1942) though the landing on Kuralei (1944).Though the main characters are in the Navy, the stories that make up the book are almost entirely land based and are about the day to day life on the islands rather than details of battle. James Michener has a real storyteller's knack for pacing and characterization. His dialog however felt very stiff and awkward. His characters actions and reactions seemed believable enough, but reading his characters speech reminded me of watching a movie from the early forties.A couple of times he or his narrators would wax philosophic and it would come off pretty clumsy. On the other hand he was very good when he would show rather than tell about the long days of boredom or the difficulty of understanding a different culture. The best parts of the book were the bits dealing with soldiers from little Midwest towns that were in awe of the beauty of a place they'd never even heard of before the war, or showing the soldiers trying to deal with the natives they shared the islands with.I was very put off by the racist attitude presented in the book, not by the characters but by the narrator. I understand that this is the forties and these attitudes were prevalent and would have accepted it, but the two most famous stories in this book (Our Heroine and Fo' Dolla') are about accepting other cultures. Elsewhere in the book however black soldiers or natives were portrayed in very stereo-typed or derogatory ways. I guess it seemed like Mr. Michener wasn't following his own advice.Also, I realize that this was written just after the war, but I kept wishing that he would have been a little more descriptive of the various planes that were such an important of the stories. He would mention PBYs or F6Fs and not tell you what those were.You are probably thinking that most of the negatives I've mentioned are unfair or due to the time the book was written. I'd suggest you check outThe Caine Mutinywhich was written around the same time and has none of these problems.In the end, the book was interesting and I did enjoy it, but for me it wasn't a classic."},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","review":"The book is a good read, I quite like the format of a collection of 18 loosely related stories, each independent in its own right, but some characters reappear. This format allows one to read more leisurely and skip some if one wishes.The writing is pretty good, with lively conversations, vivid description of the Pacific islands, and sometime humorous delivery. Literarilly I can only find two blemishes: 1. the excessive use of exclamation marks; 2. the use of military acronyms without explanations. But overall the writing is crisp, it is hard to believe it was written more than 60 years ago, it really feels very contemporary (except for the following aspect, see below). It is also hard to believe this was the author's first novel, it is quite sophisticated.But what marred the book is the prevalent prejudice throughout the book. The other races (other than white), especially the native Pacific Island, are stupid, lazy, devious and indolent under Mr. Michener's pen. Even considering the time and circumstances, these things are not easy for one to gloss over. For this reason I cannot give it more than 3 stars."},{"Title":"Better golf in 5 minutes","review":"Mr. East had decades of experience designing and building golf clubs, and also taught golf in Australia and in the USA.

It tells of the reasons behind their homeschooling, the struggles with legislation and school boards they had to face, and the day-to-day activities of the children. As a portrayal of homeschooling it is of course very accurate in that it is real: however you cannot expect to draw many generalisations from it as all homeschooling families are quite different. Nancy Wallace really explores *music* and learning music more in depth than some other fields, yet her comments and observations are often very helpful to a new homeschooling parent or to anyone intersted in the parent's role.

The author notes that to \\"write about the shaping of the modern German landscape is to write about how modern Germany itself was shaped.\\" It begins with the tale of the draining of the Oderburch, a great swamp on the river Oder from Oderberg to Lebus. This swamp along with others was progressively drained and settled in the 18th century. Colonists were brought in and the wolves were hunted to extinction. This was a frontier like any other and the author compares it to other conquests of nature in the New World and South Africa. It was a \\"conquest from barbarism\\". This use of science and technology to tame the wild beast of nature is as old as man itself but found a special expression in Germany.The next section of the book examines the taming of the Rhine river and the harnessing of it to agriculture and the state. The book takes the reader on a wonderful journey alongside the German engineers and statesmen and visionaries who tried the utmost to control flooding and build ports and canals such as Wilhelmshaven. Land reclamation followed. Once again people had to settle and colonize the new areas. The same was being done across Europe, for instance South of Rome where in the 1920s and 1930s colonists would be set to colonizing the Malarial swamps.But where once colonizing and reclamation were peaceful pursuits they eventually turned sinister with the advent of Nazism and the decision to reclaim the East for German settlers. The idea was that the \`barbaric' Slavic peoples could be harnessed as well or removed from the swamps they were \`indigenous' to. Propaganda saw them as growing out of the swamps themselves. The \`dead space' of the Pripet marshes. Everywhere German \`model villages' were designed to replace the \`natural' villages that seethed with disease and closed spaces in the \`east'.A brilliant book that weaves together so many topics and is hard to put down, the subject seems staid, but is fascinating.Seth J.

This is part of what made Germany into a nation.It is quite interesting as it talks not only about what was done but about other aspects such as the health, econonic, cultural, and political aspects. The Nazi's for instance looked at the work done as proof of the natural superiority of the German people.With all of the success of the projects, the book at the end turns to the problems the efforts have caused: flooding, fish habitat destroyed. In essence all of the problems we are having with these same areas in the United States."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany","review":"This is a magnificent book. It reminds me of William Cronon's Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists and the Ecology of New England (and, to a lesser extent, Charles Mann's 1491, and its sequel, 1493). There is the same realism and clear-sightedness, the same recognition of trade-offs, the same openness to irony, the same appreciation of time. And, very important, an ability to put words together in a way that adds to the reader's enjoyment.However, it is not perfect. For a book that is so much about place, there is a frustrating lack of useful maps. Thousands of place names are mentioned. Maybe a tenth can be found on the included maps. The few maps that are included are mostly small and flat; there is no sense of mountain, plain, and so on. Those who don't already have a sense of German geography should read along with a good relief map at their side.Similarly, Blackbourn often uses German words without providing a translation. A German dictionary or a web translator will improve the reader's experience.And to be totally petty: the Publisher's Weekly blurb mentions \\"lavish illustrations.\\" That is a lie. The illustrations are small and poorly reproduced.Still, 5 stars. No question."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany","review":"An interesting examination of German attitudes towards the natural world and the effects of large scale civil engineering projects on the German landscape. Blackbourn examines attitudes towards nature and civil engineering projects from the second half of the 18th century to contemporary Germany. For much of this period, and despite a fair amount of romanticization of the natural world, the basic attitude was that of control of nature and conquest of nature in the interest of German populations. Blackbourn opens with a discussion of major marsh drainage projects during the reign of Frederick the Great. The latter's military conquests greatly expanded the Prussian state, but as Blackbourn points out, marsh reclamation also greatly expanded the available arable land in Prussia. Prefiguring the character of major civil engineering projects throughout the 19th and 20th century, these projects were expensive, state directed, labor intensive, often accompanied by substantial movements of people onto newly created arable lands, and often produced significant negative unanticipated consequences.Blackbourn discusses the rationalization of the Rhine watershed, the development of the port of Wllhelmshaven, the construction of dams in many, many German watersheds, the complex relationship between Nazi ideology & practice and views of nature, and the more recent rise of environmental movements in Germany. The quality of writing is very good and Blackbourn's documentation is excellent, drawing on large variety of German primary and secondary sources. The latter are mainly unavailable in English and this book is partly an insightful summary of what appears to be a substantial German literature.Blackbourn is not a naive Romantic decrying the loss of the natural world. He is very clear on the many considerable benefits of these large scale projects. He is scrupulous as well in documenting the costs, both financial and human, of these projects. One major theme is the unanticipated negative consequences of projects. Rationalization of rivers and draining of wetlands improved navigation possibilities, increased trade, provided additional farmland, but often increased the risk of major, damaging floods and reduced traditional fisheries. Unanticipated consequences were often dealt with by additional, major civil engineering projects such as larger levees and and additional dams. Another major ironic feature documented by Blackbourn is the way in which earlier transformations of the landscape came to be regarded by later generations as parts of the natural world.Blackbourn shows very well the somewhat contradictory nature of German attitudes towards the natural world. A combination of Romantic sensibility but also glorification of human achievement and taming of the landscape. The latter often had a strongly racist component with German industry, achievement, and civilization contrasted with the Slavic (and other non-German ethnicities) savagery. He has an interesting discussion of what the Germans intended for Eastern Europe had they won WWII. This would have been a grandiose version of the types of engineering projects practiced in Germany.Blackbourn concludes with the emergence of environmental concerns in the past few decades. While certainly not without elements of romanticism, this is a much more balanced view of the costs of large scale environmental manipulation, and in important respects represents a qualitative change in German attitudes. Blackbourn is cautiously optimistic about prospects for the future."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany","review":"THE CONQUEST OF NATURE: WATER, LANDSCAPE, AND THE MAKING OF MODERN GERMANY is a recommended pick for any library strong in modern Western history in general and German history and culture in particular.

The main topics are Walrasian equilibria (optimal choices relative to a price induced budget set), the core (a generalization of the familiar contract curve), and the relationship between the two. Everything is done in an exchange framework (i.e. no production), which makes it easier to focus on the concepts involved.Kirman and Hildenbrand prove the existence of Walrasian equilibria, give conditions for the core to be non-empty, show how the core of finite economies converges to the Walrasian equilibria and demonstrate the equivalency between Walrasian equilibria and the core in economies with an continuum of traders. In the last chapter they look at the structure of excess demand functions, conditions for uniqueness and stability in respect to ttonnement dynamics (no trade until equilibrium is reached). Four appendices give essentially all the mathemtical background needed, except for a little calculus and linear algebra needed in the last chapter. A motivating overview of the content is given in an informal introduction.All results are well discussed and put in the proper context.

For a short story, there is a lot of action. The sex scenes are very hot, with both hero and heroine enjoying each encounter thoroughly. While I thought it was a fun read, I have to admit that I thought the crude language a bit overdone. I don't mind \\"dirty talk\\" when it takes place in the midst of sex, but it seemed like every other word in the entire story was Anglo-Saxon.

She's denied him human companionship for far too long, and Abraham is determined that she now pay him back - with interest.I am, admittedly, not a fan of anthologies. Most authors can't quite get that emotional connection I require in a story for my own personal enjoyment. That being said, I was drawn to purchase More Than Magick because, as many are aware, I'm an avid fan of Rhyannon Byrd. I must say she delivered in spades! This introduction to the McKendrick family of Witches and Warlocks is, quite simply, a decadent delight. In Magick Men: A Shot Of Magick, Lachlan is fierce and arrogant, and his words alone made me melt into a drooling puddle. Evan is strong-willed, yet demure. They are a great combination that left me hungering for more!Once Upon A Midnight Blue is furiously fast-paced. There was so muchinformation packed into a short story, that I felt it would do better as a full length book. I am a bit disappointed in Amery's childish poutiness toward the end of the book, I feel it doesn't fit well with her character. Beyond that, the pages are filled with steamy m&eacute;nage scenes that will make many readers quite breathless.Titania Ladey's quick fantasy story Spell Of The Chameleon is, for the most part, too implausible for me. I find it rather unbelievable that after being in solitude for three hundred years, Abraham is at first hating Mia, then quickly desiring her, then abruptly loving her. That is too far beyond my scope of believable fantasy. Other than that, if youdon't mind your stories missing the emotional connection though packed with sex, this book is for you.All in all, I loved Ms. Byrd's story, enjoyed Ms. Walker's and would have passed on Ms. Ladey's. More Than Magick is worth the money for the first story alone. However, if you don't want to pay full price for this anthology on written page, and enjoy reading ebooks, simply purchase and download the individual books from Ellora's Cave.

He emphasizes the role of archeoastronomy in this process, harnessing history, science, sociology, and anthropology to uncover a long distant and poorly understood past in North America.Williamson finds that \\"To live in harmony with the world and its cycles is the goal of traditional Native Americans.

I like the way Williamson not only gives insight on the customs, culture, and significance but the story behind the re-discovery of these creative and profound places, beliefs, and rituals."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"Dear Readers, I am 37 years old and havent read this book since 1974 but I remember it as one of the books that helped form my character. I had nothing in common with Fran as a child. My childhood was easy. Fran had to deal with issues that many adults can not handle and it was through her eyes that I saw a different world. Sad and depressing? Well, I can only say that this book wasn't just fluff and silliness.( not that there is anything wrong with fluff and silliness sometimes) This story taught me something about compassion for others and understanding. I remember seeing my less fortunate classmates in a different light. The bears' house that Fran looked at but didnt play with touched me deeply and I could understand her wanting to go to the Bears' house as an escape from reality. I remember father bear telling her to persevere. I remember looking that word up in the dictionary and feeling empowered. So many times growing up and even now as an adult that advice proved to be solid. I read so many great books as a child. This one was very different from all the rest and I have verbally recomended it to people over the years but never without a few tears. Yes I recomend this book to children in the nine and up crowd. Although I was a middle class suburban child I think this book has something for children in other social economic groups as well. This story although sad made you feel hopeful and that all things are possible."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"Fran Ellen is a likable character despite her problems. And the strange way of acting at school. I really wanted Fran Ellen to get that prize and I was so glad the teacher was nice after all. Those mean girls were the worst! This writer can really make the readers feel what it is like to be someone no one likes at school like Fran Ellen. Yet I admired Fran Ellen a lot. She was good to the baby and I liked the way she played with the bear's house."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I first fell in love with &quot;The Bear's House&quot; as a shy, unpopular bookworm of a ten year old, who found a kindred spirit in Fran Ellen, the trying, picked on, &quot;welfare kid&quot; protagonist who escapes into a dollhouse fantasy world as she struggles to deal with poverty, class bullies and a mentally-ill mother. I stayed in love with the Bear's House as a twenty-seven year old confident, outspoken, social worker, who sees too many Fran Ellens in her day to day work. The Bear's House is a must read for children and adults alike- it's prose is blunt but eloquent, and it's message both tragic and hopeful. It paints a perfect picture of a child often forgotten in children's literature- worn out, tired, but without a completely happy ending. A read that not only delights children, but enlightens adults. Highly recommended for classroom read alouds and discussions."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"Every child has had problems that they think they cannot handle. In this book, we live the struggle of a young girl just trying to make it in her world. She doesn't want to see her family split up, but in order to keep it together, she has to dodge reality and teachers alike. To escape from her problems, she creates a family for herself in the dolls that her teacher has brought in with her doll house. By creating this &quot;family&quot; her life becomes bearable for the time she is &quot;with&quot; them. A good book about the pain of living in a family that is not exactly like everybody else's family, and coping with reality"},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"Fran gets into fights a lot, and she gets into trouble. She even gets into trouble by going home! But you have to read the book to figure it out. It's called,''The Bears' House'' by Marilyn Sachs. Fran is at school and at home in this book that happens now-a-days. Ms.Thomson picks Fran to take the bears' house home. If you like the story ''Goldilocks'' then you'll like this book. I recommend it for a girl, because I think that a girl would like it."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I am a fourth grade teacher, I choose to read this book to my students. It really tells you something about a book and its characters, when children ask to hear it read over playing Gameboys during free time. The children gained a better uderstanding of the \\"different walks of life\\" They have been much kinder to one another since we read this book."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"This book is great, I had searched for it for quite some time. Simple and quick read, but tells a great (and sad) story."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I first checked this book out of my school library in 5th grade, and it stuck with me ever since. When I found a paperback reprint as an adult, I quickly grabbed it. I feel this is one of the most important children's books ever written for this age group, handled masterfully by writer Marilyn Sachs.It is not a happy book, but it is thoughtful and moving and will teach children about other walks of life and how many people live. It will teach them to appreciate what they have and to have compassion for others. I agree that it is best read under the supervision of an adult so children can talk about what they're reading.Disney stories are wonderful, and so are happy endings, but there is a place even among younger readers for books about kids in jeopardy, in poverty, and who are struggling to make sense of the world. I also recommend the sequel, \\"Fran Ellen's House,\\" for those who wonder what happened to the characters."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"Nine-year-old Fran Ellen's mother is sick, and none of the Smith kids know how to help her. Ever since their father walked out on them, Mama just lies in bed, refusing to talk and ignoring their baby sister Flora.Twelve-year-old Fletcher, the oldest, says they've got to keep the household running smoothly so no one finds out and puts them in foster homes. Fran Ellen's job is taking care of the baby, which she loves. But what happens when she's at school, and little Flora is all alone in her crib?Although Fran Ellen's doing her best to hold her family together, she can't stop being afraid all the time. She sucks her thumb nonstop, and gets teased by her classmates incessantly...until it's apparent to her teacher that something is really wrong in the Smith home and she's determined to get to the bottom of it.If you enjoy this book, check out the sequel, \\"Fran Ellen's House.\\""},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I loved this book as a teen and now my teenage daughter loves it. This is a wonderful story of a little girls survival in a world filled with fear and trouble. It will touch your heart."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I first read this book as a lonely, insecure, slightly overweight 13 year old. I was picked on a lot at that age and i could really relate to what Fran Ellen goes through in school. I, too, was also a big klutz in PE and i was so shy and afraid of bringing attention to myself that i'd hide in the bathroom just like Fran Ellen did. I however think that when those girls bullied her she should have stood up for herself more. I would have, i think. However they did pressure her a lot but i would not have given in like she did. It was cool the way in the end the teacher stands up for her as she notices Fran Ellen is improving a lot. The ending was sort of a cliff hanger, however, but one of my fave things about this book is Louis Glansman's illustrations! I had checked it out at the library and could not get enough of his pen and ink pictures--they are so real! The library kept reminding me to return the book and i could not get enough of the illustrations! CHECK IT OUT!!!"},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"This is a very good book which I have read to each new group ofFran Ellen's Housestudents for the past 8 years. They always love the book and ask for me to read \\"Fran Ellen's House\\" next."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"...and I don't mean just that it's an excellent book; it is, but unlike Sachs' other books (Amy, Laura, Veronica Ganz), this is the most un-childlike children's book I've ever read -- indeed, I read it as an adult and it resonates with me to this day. Unbearably sad, and I don't even recall the end as being hopeful (if I recall, it ends with the possibility of the kids being split up between foster families). But I would even go so far as to say it's a must-read for kids. If this were Sachs' only book, she'd have a right to be proud."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I loved this book when I found it in fourth grade. I was just like Fran, poor, geeky, and too smart for my own good. I read this story over and over, and I have never forgotten how it made me feel. I would recommend this book to any thinking child, and more than a few adults who need their priorities adjusted. Moving and beautiful, this story should be treasured by everyone."},{"Title":"The Bear's House","review":"I found this book extremely depressing and unpleasant when I read this as a child-- and I was a voracious reader who'd been exposed to all different sorts of themes, so the fact that this &quot;got to me&quot; is probably significant. I recommend that teachers guide students through this book carefully if it's one they choose to share with their class."},{"Title":"MY LIFE IN THE SANDBOX: A compilation of letters home written during Operation Iraqi Freedom","review":"How dare you Chambers try to profit off Iraq.

Now that I have a child, I realize that this is in fact a no-nonsense, completely serious and accurate description of pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing.While other baby books mislead you with emotional descriptions of the joy and wonder your &quot;little one&quot; will bring, Dave Barry pulls no punches in his hard-hitting, gritty portrayal of baby behavior. There is a quiz early on whose purpose is to deter prospective parents who may be weak of heart or stomach, with questions such as &quot;How many diapers will an average baby go through before it is toilet-trained?&quot; or &quot;What is the most repulsive thing a baby would put in its mouth?&quot; Those of you who are parents will know the answers. Those of you who are not, be warned: you may think Dave Barry's answers are too outrageous to be true, but you're wrong!Anyway, this book is an excellent source of information for anyone who is considering having children, or who is considering not having children. It is also useful for those who already have children, as it will reassure them that they are not alone -- though they may wish they had read (and heeded) it sooner."},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"Hi all you expectant parents out there. If are like my wife and I, as soon as we learned that we were pregnant my wife immersed herself in Dr. Spock and other &quot;reputable&quot; child care and parenting books. Being of a somewhat different ilk, I undertook my own brand of pre-baby training with this wonderful primer about babies, where they come from, what happens when they get here, why they do what they do, and how to cope with it all as a parent.Know what? Dave Barry's book is the most readable, enjoyable, and useful introduction to the little people who show up at our homes that I have ever seen. Move over Dr. Spock!Dave gives advice about diapers and dealing with unsolicited advice on parenting. He also explains in perfectly understandable detail why babies spit up their food (it's the &quot;food-return loop&quot; that causes it), drool, and other typically unexplainable baby behaviors. In addition, there are tips to fathers about when diapers need to be changed, etc.Read it and weep or laugh out loud, depending on whether your baby's already home or still on the way. This book presents real life...no sugar coating here!This book also makes a great wedding present!5 stars, no doubt about it!"},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"At last, an author willing strip away the pastel, candy-coated mystic of parenthood! If you have children, read this book and know you are not alone. If you're considering having children---RUN AWAY!!!Seriously, though, like the movie &quot;Parenthood&quot;, this book is especially hilarious for those of us who've been there. Right on, Dave!"},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"There are two things that will assist you in getting the full enjoyment from this book. First, you have to appreciate Dave Barry's sense of humor. Second, you have to have experienced the \\"birth process\\" as well as seen those formative years involving toilet training, preschool selection, first words spoken, and taking a kid to a restaurant or on a plane.And if you haven't done these things, you still may find this book entertaining!There were four times a laugh/sob just escaped spontaneously as I was reading this book:- As part of a quiz to measure whether you have the knowledge to become a parent, Barry asks, \\"What do you do if your two-month-old baby is screaming in an airplane and refuses to shut up and is clearly disturbing the other passengers?a. Summon the stewardess and say: 'Stewardess, whose baby is this?'b. Summon the stewardess and say: 'Stewardess, this baby is very interested in aviation. Please take it up and show it around the cockpit for the duration of the flight.'c. Summon the stewardess and say: 'Stewardess, please inform the captain that this infant has just handed me a note in which it threatens to continue crying unless it is taken to Havana immediately'\\" (p. 3).- In selecting toys for the newborn: \\"You don't want so-called educational toys that claim to teach 'spatial relationships,' because the only spatial relationship newborn babies care about is whether they can fit things into their mouths. This means you want toys that will fit safely and comfortably in a baby's mouth. The best way to select such toys is to try them out in your own mouth, bearing in mind that yours has eight times the volume of baby's. When you go to the toy store, ask to see eight of each potential toy; if you can stuff them all comfortably in your mouth, you should buy one. Remind the salesclerk to sterilize the other seven, so as not to pass infectious diseases on to the next shopper. The clerk will appreciate this thoughtful reminder\\" (p. 21).- On naming your baby: \\"In recent years, it has become fashionable to give children extremely British-sounding names, such as 'Jessica.' I think this is an excellent idea. Despite the fact that Great Britain has been unable to produce a car that can be driven all the way across a shopping mall parking lot without major engine failure, Americans think that anything British is really terrific. So I recommend you give your baby the most British name you can think up, such as 'Queen Elizabeth' or 'Big Ben' or 'Crumpet Scone-Hayes'\\" (p. 38-39).- On kids learning to talk: \\"I remember once my wife called me into the living room, all excited. 'Watch this,' she said. 'Robert, where's your head?' And by God, Robert pointed to his head. I was stunned. I couldn't believe what a genius we had on our hands. Then my wife, bursting with pride, said, 'Now watch this. Robert, where's your foot?' Robert flashed us a brilliant smile of comprehension, pointed to his head, and said, 'dog'\\" (p. 70).Too close to home! Be prepared to have your funny bone tickled."},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"My wife got me this as a gift, and my only complaint is that my youngest is now eight, and I could have used this a long time ago. Dave Barry hits the nail right on the head with this book.In this book, Barry puts a very serious subject in a humorous tone, but he still speaks the truth. Yes, this book is intended as humor, but his reasoning and descriptions are pretty dead on true. I seriously could relate to a lot of the situations he described. This book was hysterical.Jerry O'Brien's illustrations are hilarious, and, as always, the perfect compliment to Barry's book. For any new parents or expected parents, this book is definately for you. Not only will this book not pull any punches, and tell it like it is, but it is very enjoyable reading, and will help ease some of the axieties that you may already have. Yeah, it might add a few as well, but hey, at least you'll laugh so hard, you'll forget about labor pains.Dave Barry is easily the king of comedy, and this short book even illustrates this even more. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"My husband and I are thinking about trying to conceive soon, and we thought this would be a great humorous view of the whole process.

(e.g., &quot;That's a goat.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;) My only gripe is that there isn't more to this book, a lot of page space is dedicated to only mildly amusing pictures.Overall though, a fun read which you can finish in one or two sittings."},{"Title":"Babies and Other Hazards of Sex","review":"I first read this book when I was pregnant with my second child in 1984--since I am the oldest of 6 kids and already had a 1 year old son, I could see that Dave was right on in his perception of the craziness that parents experience!

While comics can sometimes be crude, insensitive and/or on serious mood-altering drugs, Mr. Barry is quite the contrary...hehehe.

For some of us who work within these fields, the logical sloppiness of most of the theoretical positions on madness available is quite infuriating, and it is satisfying to see these two philosophers come in and &quot;clean house.&quot; However, in some respects, these authors' command of the literature on madness is a little disappointing. For example, they suggest that the alien quality of alien voices and inserted thoughts may be due to the subject's inability to integrate these experiences into her picture of herself as agent- a theory that is probably right but not exactly original. Post-Freudian psychoanalysts have been saying almost identical things for years, and it is too bad Stephens and Graham were not aware enough of psychoanalytic literature to make real use of it; if they did so they might have found themselves in possession of a more comprehensive phenomenology of agency and a more highly differentiated account of its distortions. As it is, to be sure, their theory is nevertheless pretty good, and of course one can't expect those doing this kind of interdisciplinary work to be completely versed in every single theory available. Perhaps the best quality of the book is that it is capable of introducing psychologists and psychiatrists to the intellectual rigor of philosophical discourse."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"This is about today, of course. As every science fiction writer knows, any futuristic venture, either in fiction or nonfiction, is an extrapolation from the present. How prescient the writer is depends partly on how well he understands and observes the present and on how lucky he is. I don't know how lucky sci-fi novelist Bruce Sterling is going to be as a visionary, but he definitely has a keen insight into the present. To use his words, &quot;the victorious futurist is not a prophet. He or she does not defeat the future but predicts the present.&quot; (p. xvii)I have read recently, Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution (2001); Howard Bloom's Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century (2000); The Next Fifty Years: Science in the First Half of the Twenty-First Century (2002), a collection of essays edited by John Brockman; Francis Fukuyama's Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution (2002); Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (1999), and others; and I can tell you this is as impressive (in its own way of course) as any of those very impressive books, and has the considerable virtue of being beautifully and compellingly written in a style that is polished, lively and sparkles with deft turns of phrase and a cornucopia of bon mots and apt neologisms. Furthermore, Sterling really is a visionary of the present in that he sees connections and developments that most of us miss. Here are some examples:&quot;The sense of wonder has a short shelf life.&quot; (p. xvii)Speaking of SUVs and cross-training shoes: &quot;Modern devices are overstuffed with functionality...&quot; (p. 81)&quot;The right wing wants to leave the market alone but to regulate sex. The left...[tolerates] domestic license but wants to regulate private industry.&quot; (p. 160)&quot;...[F]oreign investors are entirely indifferent to...[the] phony-baloney national mythology&quot; of any given country. &quot;They may feel very ardent about their own country, but they won't tolerate any pretension from&quot; someone else's country. (p. 162)&quot;Garage sales became Ebay.&quot; (p. 224)Speaking of the abundance of &quot;giant armadillos, sloths as big as hippos, three kinds of elephants,&quot; etc., and other fauna in North America before humans arrived: &quot;A natural Texas would look like the Serengeti on steroids.&quot; (p. 270)On what is causing the glaciers to melt: we are &quot;digging up fossils...and setting fire to them.&quot; (p. 279)&quot;The actual likelihood of people...getting atomically bombed is much higher today than it was during the cold war.&quot; (p. 260)On the human-caused &quot;extinctions, and the sheer air-borne filth that comes from burning fossils&quot;: &quot;It will...[transform] the whole Earth into something like a grim mining town in East Germany, only without frogs.&quot; (p. 281)Sterling sees the first &quot;superbaby&quot; as a very sad creature indeed because it will be superceded almost immediately by a superior version, and then by a super-superbaby, and will be superior only to its &quot;moronic parents.&quot; (p. 30)&quot;Blobjects...are computer-modeled objects manufactured out of blown goo.&quot; They &quot;tend to be fleshy, pseudo-alive, and seductive...&quot; Some examples: &quot;the Gillette Mach 3 razor. The Oral-B toothbrush... The Handspring Visor PDA. Gelatinous wrist rests. The curvy, slithery Microsoft Explorer mouse...&quot; (p. 75)In addition to &quot;blobjects&quot; there are also &quot;gizmos&quot; which are &quot;small, faddish, buzzy machine[s] with a brief life span.&quot; A computer is a gizmo. There are also &quot;blobject gizmos.&quot; (p. 89)And on and on. What Sterling is really writing here is social criticism. He is revealing us to ourselves by highlighting our technology, our consumerism, and the way the various economic and political players--governments, corportions, terrorists, NGOs, etc.--are all out to manipulate us to their advantage. His take on what he calls the dichotomy between the New World Order (the technological haves who are able to effectively manage information) and the New World Disorder (blighted areas of the planet taken over by terrorists, drug dealers and other high risk takers) is especially interesting. He sees the weapons of the unconventional warfare that is now, and will continue to be, the norm in a revealing way. He notes, for example, that terrorist-induced plagues, sometimes called &quot;the poor man's bomb,&quot; will only lead to the &quot;poor man's doom&quot; because &quot;Areas with organized governments and public health systems will be the last to collapse from germs and viruses, not the first.&quot; (p. 262)Sterling's vision is of the postmodern world giving way to the posthuman. He sees the disadvantage of our becoming part machine and part biologically-enhanced beings: we will &quot;still have some kind of everyday treadmill&quot; to negotiate, and we may even acquire a renewed respect for death. (pp. 299-300)In the final chapter he touches on the notion of a &quot;Vingean Singularity&quot; (from Vernor Vinge) which is a place in the future &quot;impossible to describe, simply because&quot; we as human beings &quot;cannot comprehend&quot; such a posthuman environment. In other words, like the event horizon of a black hole, the singularity allows no communication between us and that future world, and that it why it is called a singularity. (pp. 295-296)Bottom line: be not dissuaded by the nay-sayers about this book, who may not like the unnecessary use of the extended metaphor from Shakespeare's As You Like It, which Sterling uses to frame the text (&quot;All the world's a stage...&quot;), or who are put off by Sterling's sometimes paternal and self-centered expression. This is a terrific read. I enjoyed it from first page to last and found myself nodding in agreement and surprise with much of what he writes."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"The cover and slipjacket of the book smell of terabyte hard drives and organic cell phones. But that's about it. I didn't buy this book---got it from the library. Feel like I didn't waste money, but I did waste time. There are gems...the section on biotech is really provocative and well-written.But the rest?Filler. The ideas about the importance of networks in the future (whether cell based terrorist groups, or profiteers) are covered in more depth in both sterling's fictional DISTRACTION and Rheingold's SMART MOBS. The critique of education is pedantic, as is the discussion about the future of politics.I get the sense that these pieces were just lying around on the hard drive, and he realized there was a book in there. He was almost right...some tight editing would've been very helpful."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I know and admire the author, whose other non-fiction book, \\"Hacker Crackdown\\" was an extraordinary contribution to social understanding, of both the abuse of uninformed government power, and the potential enlightenment that could be achieved by hackers (who are like astronauts, pushing the envelope in cyberspace).This book is uneven. There are some truly brilliant gems, but there is also a lot of rambling, and I fear that the author's brilliance as a science fiction writer may have intimidated the publisher and editor into settling for what they got, instead of what the author is truly capable of producing when diligently managed. However, after thoroughly reviewing the book to write the review, I ended up going for 5 instead of 4 stars because this kind of writing is uncommon and provocative and my lack of patience may be the external limiting factor.There are a number of gifted turns of phrase and ideas, and so I do recommend this book for purchase, for reading, and for recurring review. The author focuses on generic engineering, imagining an order of magnitude of achievement beyond what is now conceptualized; he properly redefines education in the future as being disconnected from the schools that today are socializing institutions, beating creativity out of children and doing nothing for adults that need to learn, unlearn, and relearn across their lifetimes; he is brilliant in conceptualizing both crime as necessary and exported instability as tacitly deliberate--Africa as the whorehouse and Skid Row of the world; he recognizes oil as the primary source of instability and inequality, sees all politicians as devoid of grand vision (and we would surmise, character as well); he is hugely successful in talking about the mythical \\"American people\\" that do not exist, about moral panics after Enron or 9-11 that achieve no true reform; and his focus on the information age basics that make it cheaper to migrate business than people, that make it essential for the Germans to see through Microsoft's insecure code and thus to opt for LINUX or open source code for their military as well as their government systems in general.He ends brilliantly in conceptualizing a new world order within a new world disorder, in which very rich individuals combine with very poor recruits from a nationless diaspora, a new network that looks like Al Qaeda but has opposite objectives.In the larger scheme of things, as the author concludes, Earth is debris and the humans are on their way to being the Sixth Extinction. Party while you can."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I like Bruce's work a lot, both his SF and his punditry/journalism on the Viridian list and elsewhere. So I had pretty high hopes for this, but unfortunately came away unsatisfied. Years ago, Bruce said that cyberpunk aimed for \\"crammed prose\\" - a density of ideas, impressions and telling details which his own SF novels provide brilliantly. \\"Tomorrow Now\\" is far from crammed - it's padded. While there are cool, convincing ideas (cloned babies will grow up to be the world's most angry adolescents) on past evidence I'd expect about 10x more of them per page. I haven't read a lot of futurology books, so this may compare more favorably to most of them. But for Sterling fans this is thin stuff."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Tomorrow Now is essentially a long and brilliant essay by Bruce Sterling, a noted science fiction writer and futurist covering some of his ideas of what the future may hold. Sterling very cleverly breaks the book into seven parts based upon a soliloquoy from Shakespeare covering the ages of man from birth to death, and wittily prophesies what life may shape itself into in our near future.Two things struck me about this book. The first is that it is not nearly as focused on the next fifty years as the title purports. There is a fair deal of what the future may hold, but there is also a great deal of the present thrown in (especially in the soldier section), and some futurism that is more than 50 years out. Surprisingly this didn't bother me at all because his analysis of the present, especially an exposition on three different terrorists warlords, was fascinating, absolutely fascinating. This book ranges far and wide, and colors outside the lines of the 50 years stated, but I was glad it did as I read.The second thing that struck me was that this is one of the most amazingly well-written books I've ever read. I am not sure I have ever read something as engaging, fascinating, informative and so easy to read at the same time. I have always enjoyed Sterling's fiction work but, frankly, the quality of this non-fiction book trumps his fictional stories. His writing style is very chatty, more or less as if you are sitting across the table from him, and at first this threw me. It's not something you expect in a science book. Yet once I adjusted I realized that this may be one of the clearest pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure to read. When I say \\"pleasure to read\\" I actually mean it. That is a phrase far too over-used, but in choosing it I mean it literally: reading the words was a pleasure regardless of what he was talking about. His sentence construction and word choices were simply pleasurable to read in and of themself, and I have never seen adjectives used so well to create shades and nuances of meaning before.Much of the speculation for the future involves biotechnology, changes in workplace dynamics, and what we actually produce, the change of market dynamics, consumerism to end-user, medical advances, and the rift between the New World Order (the first world) and the New World Disorder (the third world). If I had one reservation about this book it is that Sterling promised to show why the Islamic terrorism today will be irrelevant in the future. I don't think he ever really did that; he set the stage for it, and provided the backstory necessary to see the writing on the wall, but he never came out and posited why. I agree with him that the terrorism is not a long-term problem but it would have been nice to see him forcefully make that conclusion. That one quibble aside, this is a book that anyone who cares about current events, the future, or science will find compelling, interesting, and incredibly easy to understand and follow. This is a first class work and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I enjoyed Tomorrow Now tremendously; it's not as densely-packed with speculative nuggets as some of the author's work, but his approach here waxes more poetic than techno-polemical, and focuses on the human context of the changes he's projecting, and the attendant dilemnas and decisions we'll need to confront in order to navigate it all. This book is not about &quot;nuts-and-bolts&quot; futurism, but about the choices and conflicts surrounding social, political and technological change, and I found it extremely grounded and candid."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I enjoy all of Bruce's fiction. Every book and article has been great. But these article are boring and uninspiring.No-one could ever finish reading this useless stuff in 50 years.It makes you wonder how he can write such good science fiction.Actually, I have found his no-fiction science in various magazines very good but these are not. I ordered this before it was even published , since he has never disappointed me.This is a great disappointment since I expect much more from him."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Tomorrow Now takes a science fiction writer's uncanny ability to predict future technology and lays down plainly for the reader to see."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Tomorrow Now is a bit dated already, which might be surprising considering that it claims to envision the next 50 years. He claims that Biotech will be important, but this should not surprise anyone. Roger Revelle told me the same thing in 1980.Sterling predicts our extinction. Predicting apocalypse is not hard. People have always done so, although the means has changed. In the '60's it was air pollution that was going to kill us, and now the air in L.A. is very much improved. What is more interesting and profitable is to discuss the means of getting out of this mess.This is an ok read, as it will make you think, but it is not as great as some of the reviewers make it sound."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Mr. Sterling's clever analogies and examples keep the pace of this book readable and interesting. So often \\"futurists\\" deal only in numbers, quoting Census statistics that do not illustrate the wealth of technological and other advances that will shape tomorrow. The subject mater of this text is usually fodder for scientists and think tanks. The Future Is Now provides a terrific \\"futuristic\\" outlook for those in a variety of professions and industries."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Sterling's science fiction is characterized by a keen appreciation for social forces and the increasingly intimate realtionship between things seen and unseen (the latter being anything from genetically tailored microbes to omnipresent cultural agendas). In \\"Tomorrow Now,\\" his first book-length nonfiction work since the dated but fascinating \\"The Hacker Crackdown\\" (a tome on computer crime and digital culture written in the Internet's infancy), Sterling envisions the trends, technologies, and mutant ideologies that will define the first half of the 21st century.\\"Tomorrow Now\\" is Sterling at his chatty, global-headed best. He writes about the future with skill and heartfelt exuberance, avoiding the perils of dystopian science fiction. Readers expecting biotech holocaust or maurauding robots will probably be disappointed in Sterling's close-to-home approach. But for readers into the political ramifications of computer networks, \\"ubicomp,\\" and postindustrial design philosophy, \\"Tomorrow Now\\" delivers in spades.The future, in Sterling's eyes, is merely an alternate way of looking at history. As such, it's an artifact of our own desires and creative stamina: a perplexing realm where \\"dystopia\\" and \\"utopia\\" blend and ignite with incandescent results. True to his science-fictional visions, \\"Tomorrow Now\\" is both laugh-out-loud funny--read his commentary on the pervasive techno-ecology of pseudo-organic \\"blobjects\\"--and grimly cautionary. \\"Tomorrow Now\\" unveils a world that thrives off future-shock, held together by neobiological systems and threatened by greenhouse catastrophe. Along the way, we meet angst-ridden clones, digitally savvy terrorists, and our own posthuman descendants.\\"Tomorrow Now\\" is imminently readable, thoughtful, and soundly structured. Required reading for postcyberpunks and curious bystanders alike."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I have enjoyed Sterling's fiction and probably will continue to do so. Unfortunately, he has skidded off the runway with Tomorrow Now. This is a pile of words with no real ideas, just recycled catch-memes that read like the breathless cyber-cheerleading mindporn of a late-nineties Wired issue.Between the lines of this book is the feeling that Sterling felt compelled to write it; that he needed to publish a volume of punditry in order to continue being invited to Davos, an achievement that he mentions frequently enough to be irritating. An author of his stature and experience shouldn't have to strike a pose, over and over, but that is what this book is really about. If you want to understand the future, go back and read Orwell."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"I read the book in a little over two hours. In the title, Sterling says he is &quot;envisioning the next fifty years.&quot; In fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is Sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years. In the introduction to the book he presents his &quot;seven novel aspects of the twenty-first century.&quot; He does this using a character from Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'; Jaques, who is best know for his famous lecture, which begins with: &quot;all the world's a stage&quot; and ends with &quot;Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.&quot; It would have been more appropriate if Sterling had used Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.' Sterling tells us he is both a Science Fiction writer and a Futurologist. I know a Futurologist when I see one, and Sterling is no Futurologist."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Bruce Sterling is, without doubt, a brilliant futurist. In &quot;Tomorrow Now&quot;, he serves up a feast of clever and entertaining prognostications about humanity's near future. But reader beware! The book is like a gleaming, new building whose stunning design, lavish decoration and gleaming contours can blind observers to many small architectural flaws and the crucial fact that it's built on shaky foundations.To take one example, Sterling tells us in one paragraph that a &quot;cruise missile ... is just a rich guy's truck bomb&quot;. But in the very next paragraph he emphasizes that there are in fact huge differences between cruise missiles and truck bombs that go far beyond the class background of their users. Cruise missiles are produced and deployed by complex, industrially advanced societies, while truck bombs are used by terrorists who operate beyond the ken of settled governments and civilized society.Another, more serious example of some of the less-than-deep thinking that went into this book is its overall organizational gimmick, which is based on the &quot;Seven Ages of Man&quot; so poetically described by Shakespeare and Marlowe. Sterling emhasizes the chronological aspect of these &quot;Ages&quot; by labelling his chapters as stages. Stage 1 is the Infant, Stage 2 is the Student, and so on. He uses these stages as conceptual launching pads for fascinating riffs on a variety of subjects related to 21st century technology, culture and politics. In the chapter on the Infant, for instance, he writes at length about future bioengineering not just for babies but also adults and what this will mean for huminaty as a whole. In &quot;Stage 4: The Soldier&quot; he speculates on the nature of future warfare. Thus, Sterling is really often talking about cross-cutting themes rather that chronological ages, which is more than a little confusing. Why he did this, except that it is so cool to quote from Shakespeare, escapes me.A final example of Sterling's inconsistency is the subtitle of the book itself: &quot;Envisioning the Next 50 Years&quot;. In fact, he often describes trends from the late 21st century, which puts us more than 50 years ahead. So why didn't he just call the book &quot;Envisioning the 21st Century&quot;? Search me.This is a great book, but Sterling's slickness can't completely compensate for these weaknesses. Cool soundbytes, technological virtuosity, cute wordplay and even large dollops of honest-to-God weighty insight are not enough to make up for some rather shoddy underlying illogic and conceptual weaknesses."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Now - Envisioning The Next Fifty Years","review":"Sterling's career has been a fascinating ride, watching the young &quot;blazing fanatic&quot; who wrote Schismatrix decades ago grapple with and harness - but not tame - his revolutionary imagination. Bruce has become his own best protagonist, who since 198n has taken himself, and us, on a picaresque journey through the hyperreal present. With Tomorrow Now, the Huck-Finn-by-way-of-Baudrillard part of that journey is over: Sterling has matured, emerged, and come full circle (thinkers who have followed Sterling from the start will realize that Tomorrow Now is Schismatrix as non-fiction, or a manual).Reading &quot;Tomorrow Now&quot; (the title is not actually the vapid jingle is appears to be), i laughed the way i laugh when reading Zen masters. The honed clarity of this mind is Western Zen on the order of Mark Twain. To my X and Y cohorts who (as i once did a decade ago on the Well) complain that Sterling (and Gibson) appear to be writing on Prozac compared to the shiny aggression of their earlier work: let's do what Sterling is trying to get us to do and grow up. Instead of wasting more of our precious early midlife on faux-revolutionary pop imitations of early cyberpunk (the Matrix, etc.), let's do tomorrow, now: it's taking both the red and the blue pill. It's Gandhi's own Fight Club. (If you just have to fix on early Sterlingian visionary depth with more edge, read D.H.Lawrence's poems and nonfiction.)Have you noticed?: the rebirth of a new cultural core for liberal democracy is entering the third trimester. Bruce and that sci-fi character par excellence, Ken Wilber (wasn't he in the Artificial Kid?), are giving us the left and right prongs of a neo Hegelian pincer. It's up to us to man that pincer: I am in a Global Paris, and it is 1841.

My problem with this book is that, like many early men-at-arms titles, it simply bites into way more than it could chew. The organization and weaponry of three distinct cultures spanning a period of roughly six centuries is a sizeable topic indeed for a book of 40 pages. Though I will not say that this book is a total waste or that I wish I had not bought it, there are better alternatives availible from Osprey; for example, the Vikings and the Normans both have their own elite titles, which are much more in depth, and all three of these peoples have titles on their warrior elite."},{"Title":"Saxon, Viking and Norman (Men at Arms Series, 85)","review":"This book, covering Dark Age Germanic/Scandinavian warriors (Saxons, Vikings, and, ultimately, Normans), was an early Osprey offering, designed to have as broad an appeal (and, hence, market) as possible. Since it was published, however, Osprey (having discovered how rich the market really is) has published numerous, more directed works on the Saxons (e.g., \\"Saxon Thegn\\"), the Vikings (e.g., both \\"Viking Warrior\\" and \\"Viking Hersir\\"), and, of course, the Normans (e.g., \\"Norman Knight\\"), which cover each of these types in far better fashion and far greater detail than this book can - or does. If you must know about the Vikings, buy one of the \\"Viking\\" titles, ditto the Saxons or Normans. Then, if you wish, you can always add this - just because the pictures are cool. However, don't expect it to act as an \\"overview\\". There really is no attempt made (at least beyond the most obvious - e.g., \\"the Normans were Vikings who settled in the north of France\\" kind of stuff) to integrate the various groups or to tie them together in any kind of rational sequence or to otherwise synthesize their histories. It's not a bad book, just a bit too broad and too basic to do justice to any of its subjects and, because it was published before the more detailed works, it wasn't really designed to bridge them or to tie them together. Tho', as I noted, the pictures are cool. Osprey's pictures almost always are. That, alone, is worth the $12-$18 Osprey usually asks for one of their titles. If nothing else, think of it as helping to keep Angus McBride at his easel.

They are sometimes not the most exciting read but they are well informed about Indian culture and other aspects of history:perhaps the best is her first novel,\\"Pushing The Bear\\" about the Cherokee Trail of Tears in 1838. It is both erudite and historical and contains a great deal of grueling detail about the history of this perilous journey filled with treacherous pitfalls and the grim reality of death; also it provides many details about the Cherokee's animistic religion, dance rituals, language and world view. Revd. Bushyhead, a secondary character, is a Christian minister, formerly a Cherokee; the novel also contains conjurers or shamans. \\"Pushing the Bear\\" is a metaphorical way the lead character Maritole, a young Cherokee female, has of describing the difficulties of the journey. \\"Stone Heart\\" is about Lewis and Clark's journey up the Missouri and Columbia Rivers in 1807, where Sacajawea a Shoshone Indian kidnapped in her youth served as a part-time guide and interpreter. This novel is notable for its numerous excerpts from Lewis's and Clark's actual journals in the margins, as well as for Sacajawea's fictional musings about various aspects of the trip, including many references to her baby Jean Baptiste,who is often sick, to hunted animals, landmarks, horses and to various Indian cultures. Sacajawea was Charbanneau's husband, a rather brutal fellow. A map is also provided which is very helpful.The two contemporary novels, \\"Flutie\\" and \\"The Mask-Maker\\", both set in Oklahoma, were also interesting. The first is about an adolescent 1/2 Indian girl from a family of mechanics in Oklahoma with a developmental disability (she can't speak) who eventually overcomes her disability to become a geology teacher. The novel is good at portraying her day-to-day life as well as her mythical or symbolic dreams derived from her Indian heritage which seem to lead to her interest in geology. \\"The Mask Maker\\" is about a divorced half -Indian mother of two who becomes a mask- maker and travels to Oklahoma high schools teaching this art. The latter novel also uses the technique of additional text in the margin to clarify or expand on the main text. Her house and trunk of her car are full of her masks. You will be impressed by Diane Glancy's knowledge of Indian history and religion and culture in any or all of these 4 novels. For example, \\"Flutie\\" discusses sweat lodges, while \\"The Mask Maker\\" has information on the Pawnees and on Pawnee Bill who was a business associate of Buffalo Bill."},{"Title":"Stone Heart: A Novel of Sacajawea","review":"The mythical status of Sacajawea is seductive indeed, and Diane Glancy attempts to fashion a novel that gives that myth a much needed rest, trying to get into the voice and experience of the &quot;real&quot; Sacajawea, but as always, language is the heart and soul of any recreation of historical voice, and here is where voice fails Glancy. The writing simply is not good enough. The second person narration makes the character a bit too literary, a bit to fashionable, leaving this reader bored by its simplistic syntax and unimaginative detail. Who knows what Sacajawea thought and dreamed! As Irish poet Eavan Boland suggests, one improvises when faced with this mystery. The improvisaiton here is uninspired. The fragments of journals from the expedition, rather than moving the novel along, impede its flow. This novel is considered experimental, I suppose, but the experiment fails. Why? Because the voice and language fail."},{"Title":"Stone Heart: A Novel of Sacajawea","review":"I read this book a few months ago and couldn't stop thinking about it. Combining excerpts from the journals of Lewis and Clark with a beautifully written prose poem written from Sacajawea's point-of-view, this book, although fiction, gives a realistic voice to the women of this story.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to feel what it must have been like for a women to travel with this group of explorer's on their journey across America."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Taming of the Cimarron If you liked \\"Dangerous Minds,\\" you will like Tracy Kidder's book, Among Schoolchildren. For one school year Kidder observed the fifth grade class of Chris Zajac, a petite teacher, who works in an urban school in Massachusetts. The author portrays the teacher as a diligent, dedicated, and caring white woman who is determined to educate children of color. The sad thing about this book and others like it is faculty logic -- part for the whole. Few teachers are like the protagonist. Also, few white teachers teach in the inner cities of the United States for a long time. They usually stop teaching after the few two years. This book is nothing but a glorification of European American with all the racial stereotypes of people of color. Among Schoolchildren is the making of white folks as sheroes and/or heroes which is the reason it was a national bestseller. If you like these kinds of books to make you think how good white folks are, especially white women, you will enjoy this book, especially in taming the wild beast. However, for those of us who are tired of seeing and hearing how good white folks are, this book rates a zero. But zero is not on our rating scale; thus one star is the next best choice."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Hello, I am an Education major at Macon State College and I read Among Schoolchildren as an outside reading assignment. Among Schoolchildren is an excellent book for beginning early childhood teachers. Tracy Kidder done an excellent job of portraying teacher and students in the everyday classroom setting. This book tells the true story of how one teacher deals with the trials and triumphs of being a teacher. Chris Zajac is what I consider a wonderful teacher. She is one who truly cares for her students and about their education. The backgrounds of these children are typical of most any place one can travel in the United States. I think this book shows just how unequal the living standards and educational oppurtunities are for some children. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted a real life account of what it is like to be a teacher."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Kidder tells the story of a year in the life of a fifth grade class with excellence.

Tracy Kidder could have picked a top notch prestigous school to continue to pull the wool over americas eyes, but instead he gave us reality, which we needed as a wake up call. I enjoyed the way Chris handled her students. I felt like Chris did an awesome job in the ways she dealt with her students. I feel like every teacher could learn from her examples. She tried so hard to reach all of her students with positive attitudes, and hoped that she did her best in all that she did for them."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"The author Tracy Kidder did an excellent job writing this book. This book gives the reader a very good outlook on what its like to be a teacher. I would recommend anyone who is an education major to read this book.

This also shows that teaching is not what everyone makes it out to be."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This book focuses on the day to day narrative on the life of a school teacher and her students, while here and there adding some comments about the larger picture of education in the United States. So this larger view comes in and kind of hints at what the author wants to express. All in all, it was a worth read."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I found Among Schoolchildren to be a very helpful and informative book. The way in which Mrs. Zajac handled each situation with a different perspective was inspiring. She truly saw the differences in each child and strived to approach them in that manner.

I hope that I can be a teacher that doesn't ignore differences but rewards them in an appropriate way."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student, studying education. In my Education 2000 class we were required to read a novel about education and present it to the class.

I have always wanted to be a teacher, but in this last few months I have been struggling with myself to see if this is what I really want. After I read this book, I knew that teaching was for me! I think that anyone seeking to be a teacher should definately read this book... It is AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student who is majoring in education and I had to read this book for one of my classes and I thought it was absolutely wonderful. The teacher in the book, Mrs. Zajak takes the children on as a personal mission to better each one of their lives.

I would definately recommend the book and give the book two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Among Schoolchildren, by Tracy Kidder, is an eye opening and hope- filled book. This real life story shows you the truth of teaching( the hardships, the frustrations, and the pain) but it also gives you hope and joy in knowing that you can become a stronger person and you can make a difference in a childs life. How rewarding! I believe telling the truth about dealing with children like Clanrence and Robert is realy important. Alot of teachers go into their job not knowing anything about how a real classroom runs and the real problems faced everyday. This book is very realistic and should be read by every person who is planning on being a teacher. I love the book because of its truth; it does not hold anything back. After reading this book, I believe you will know if you are called to be a teacher or not- your response to the situations. I like that we could enter into Mrs. Zajak's mind and know what she was thinking and feeling. This book realy helps prepare you for teaching."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am currently going to college majoring in education and read this for a class. It is a wonderful book to read and helped me understand exactly how teaching children can be. I recomend this book to any parent or person who is thinking of going into education. GREAT BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I was inspired to write this review not because I loved Among Schoolchildren-of course I did; I had Mrs. Zajac for a teacher. I was in the 6th grade when Mr. Kidder spent a year at The Kelly School. My motivation was from reading another review-someone questioned if Mrs. Zajac really had a LASTING impression on these students. I would compare myself to Alice-I had a loving family, intelligence, motivation. . .whether or not I had Mrs. Zajac for the 5th grade I would have attended college. But a lasting impression. . .to this day she remains one of my top three teachers-including college. She is unique-and maybe from reading the book the reader doesn't see that, but she is not the average teacher. And I think parents would feel the same way. She is a very wonderful teacher and a true friend. Please, don't read this book and think her students &quot;forgot 5th grade&quot; it's scarey how much I remember of 5th grade. Her mix of humor, toughness and compassion make her a great role model; and now that I too am in education I hope my students remember me as fondly as I remember her."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"As a former schoolteacher and the wife of a teacher, I can tell you that Tracy Kidder's \\"Among Schoolchildren\\" accurately and soberly depicts what teaching is really like, day to day, year in and year out.Mrs. Zajac, the grade school teacher on whom Kidder focuses his detailed narrative, is what every teacher should be: tough in a loving way, disciplined, self-aware, willing to admit to her own faults (and when she's boring herself and knows she needs to shake up the lesson next time to avoid boring the students), brimming over with ideas. She's a wonder, and the kind of teacher every child should have at least once in their grade school career.Kidder leaves no stone unturned. We see here not only the joys and sorrows of teaching, but the accumulation of detail that leaves us feeling we understand, from the inside out, what teachers go through in order to get through to their students. We see how \\"problem students\\" and \\"good students\\" present different challenges, how teachers and administrators deal with each other (and deal with the parents, the superintendent, and the school board), and even such mundane concerns as how to keep the class in Kleenex (they go through about twenty boxes a year). Though the book is over a decade old, it's prescient about some things. The majority of students in Mrs. Zajac's class are Hispanic--a growing truth throughout the United States--so along with the everyday frustrations of every teacher, we see that Mrs. Zajac has an additional workload imposed merely by the presence of a language barrier:\\"Horace, are you all done?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"Then why are you talking to Jorge?\\"She turned back around and said to Felipe and Jimmy, \\"What's the matter with you two? The minute I turn my head, you have to talk? What number do you carry, Jimmy?\\"\\"The four.\\"\\"Very good. Got it now? OK, Jimmy, you can go back to your desk.\\"\\"Ocho,\\" said a voice behind [Mrs. Zajac], unmistakably Manny's hoarse whiskey voice. Manny was trying to whisper to one of his buddies, but he just couldn't do it quietly. [She] turned. \\"Why don't you try Chinese, Manny? You can say it in Swahili, Manny. I still know you're giving him the answer.\\" [She] liked them to help each other, but today she wanted to find out just how each one was faring in multiplication, so she kept saying, \\"Your own work.\\"\\"Diablo!\\"\\"You keep it up, Manny, and I'll show you what a diablo I can be.\\"Anyone who's curious about the life of a teacher--or who is thinking of becoming a teacher--would do themselves a huge favor to sit down and read \\"Among Schoolchildren.\\""},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am an African-American teacher, and I highly disagree with the one star review that this book received -- that it is nice for 'white women' teachers. Good teaching is not a black and white issue. Caring is not a black and white issue. It is irrevelent if the teacher is black, white, brown, etc.. It is attitudes such as these, the elevation of ourselves in terms of educational importance, I believe, that lessons the teaching profession and is a major contributor, I believe, to why people do not want to be teachers. I became a teacher because I love to see my students grow mentally, intellectually and physically. The minority and white teachers I work with are outstanding, and I am happy they are my co-workers. Mr. kidder's book is one shining example of a beautiful teacher who is a representative of all of us who do teaching for the right reasons. Thank-you, Mr. Kidder!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Kidder's examination of a 5th grade classroom is a fascinating study of the complex little societies that every child interacts with every day. His descriptions of the dynamics of Mrs. Zajac's class brought me back to my own elementary school days and the familiar roles that the children here seem to have-- the troublemakers, the smart students, the space cadets... Until, that is, his close observation of the children's behavior reveals how complex each of these young people actually is.Mrs. Zajac, as the ruler of this mini-society, is a fascinating character in herself. Her tough-love compassion for her students and her attempt to address all of their needs provides a fascinating up-close look at the way a teacher with the best of intentions can both draw out students or send them hurtling back into their shell. The well-documented phenomenon of teachers spending much more time with their male students is seen here-- clearly an unconscious thing on her part because she mentions her desire to interact with all of her students consistently throughout the book. In short, a fascinating text for anyone interested in education or in child psychology. The minute observations that Kidder makes of the various reactions the students have to events in the classroom are fascinating. My only criticism-- he sometimes seems to tend toward large generalizations and sometimes to interpret a little too liberally what the students might be thinking and experiencing. When he allows the children to speak for themselves the text is much more engaging."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Tracy Kidder captures the angst and the anger of the classroom in his book, \\"Among Schoolchildren,\\" about the teaching-life of Mrs. Chris Zajac. Certainly those who criticize the public schools must read this book before they give up on schools and opt for vouchers for all.Mrs. Zajac has all the necessary qualities of a good teacher:1. She's empathetic, almost to a fault. I know she gives too many second chances to kids who try to disrupt her class, but she also got through to them all, even the ones who had to be removed.2. She's hard-working. She always brings home both the paper grading and the worry. It's hard to leave teacher feelings at the school door. Most teachers take them home as does Mrs. Zajac. Many of her great ideas develop while she broods at home over some kid's plight.3. She has a big heart, enough to mourn for kids who have their own hardships at home, enough to get angry at these same kids when they need it.Tracy Kidder's book captures all of it. Highly recommended to college education majors and to veteran teachers who need a jump start to recall why they got into teaching in the first place."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"In all the talk about education issues these days, it's easy to forget that what's really important is the relationship, the energy, between students and teacher. When the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids--THAT'S where it's at. It's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum--it's what happens between PEOPLE in a classroom. This book shows that dynamic relationship between eager, active kids and a caring, active teacher. It's not all pleasant, and successes are sometimes small, but a pervasive caring underlies it all. As a teacher, this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing I can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork, go for a walk, go to bed early so I can be there for them the next day."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This book has been an incredible relief for me to read. In the midst of my master's training in education (for a career change), I have been bogged down in the textbook version of a classroom--which is hard to translate into a real classroom. This book made me more aware--and consequently, less scared--of the plight of the teacher. Kidder puts you right into the life of Chris Zajac, and allows you to see how a \\"good\\" teacher deals with the realities of teaching.With so much focus on \\"improving\\" education through standardized testing, it is enlightening to observe the inner workings of a teacher working in the real world, confronting the real issues of humanity that are uniquely bequested to teachers.A great book that gives you real respect for the profession."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I chose Among Schoolchildren as a supplemental text for an Introduction to Education class. I had read the book some time ago, and remembered it as being a realistic portrayal of life in classrooms. I thought my students might enjoy this glimpse into the life of a teacher, warts and all. I re-read the book and still enjoyed it very much, and found many of the relationships with students, Chris's worries about her students, and the variety of problems that teachers deal with to be on target. However, many of the elements of the elementary school curriculum have changed even in the relatively short time since the book was published. It is not the overall picture of life in elementary schools that it might have been when it was first published. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating and fun read. I enjoy reading about how other people handle difficult situations. There is always something new to learn."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"As an education major at Macon State College, I read Among Schoolchildren for an assignment for my education in a diverse society class. This book really opened my eyes to what teaching is like in the &quot;real world.&quot; Tracy Kidder supplied very detailed information about each student in Mrs. Zajac's class and about Mrs. Zajac herself. I took note of many excellent teaching strategies used by Mrs. Zajac, and I hope to be able to apply them when I myself am teaching. Kidder's awesome description and remarkable ability to recreate various events in the book made me feel as though I were right there in the classroom. At times this was scary, seeing as how the students misbehaved quite often, but at least I now know what to expect from my own students. Hopefully I can become a wonderful teacher as Mrs. Zajac is.

It has held fast as my inspiration for the profession. One never realizes the responsibility teachers carry on their shoulders on a day to day basis. Kidder fantastically shows this courage, compassion, and love for children that teachers need in order to go into such a powerful profession.After digesting this book, I reflected on what teaching actually entailed. I knew then that this was what I would like to do. You are not only a teacher to children, but you are in many way their only positive role-model. Sometimes you are the only adult they see for the majority of the day and their greatest influence in those early years of their lives. But you are not only their teacher, but their nurse, their confidant, their disciplinarian, and the role-model in which they learn what is acceptable behavior in society.This book is a wonderful reflection on what happens in the American classroom.

For this reason, I chose to read &quot;Among Schoolchildren&quot; for my college journalism course. I was disappointed in the book. ~Maybe what was most disappointing is that I have seen teachers handle students as well as Mrs. Zajak, and even better, yet they have not been characterized as being so angelic as she. Even on her bad days at her worst moments, Tracy Kidder portrays her as being better than the rest of us. ~I would not gush over the book being &quot;easy to read&quot; because it is written for adults and we should expect to have to think a little when we read a book. We should not be told what to think. We should come around to that on our own. ~I will admit that the last half of the book was more enjoyable to me than the first half. But one thing that bothered me throughout is that in characterizing Chris Zajak, Kidder left out much of the feeling and devotion she surely felt toward her own children. Realizing the story was still about her class, Kidder could have done a better job rounding out his &quot;character&quot; of Chris Zajak, and could have endeared her more to me, for one, by giving the reader a broader sense of who she is. ~Though not a teacher, I spend many hours in classrooms, classrooms whose students are disadvantaged. Many of those students are minoritites: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. There are also many poor Anglo children, and many of these children are from broken homes, or homes where education is expected to take place fully at school. My view of education is an informed view; I am not merely spouting off without knowing of what it is I speak. ~That said, it may be an enlightening book to one who has spent no time at all in a classroom."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I had to read this book for my education class, and I did not like the book very much.

I have to admit I have never read a book like this. I enjoyed the book itself, but I could not stand Chris Zajac. I found her self-righteous, condescending, and annoying. She claims she has great control over her students, but I thought they &quot;walked all over her&quot; mostly because she didn't have much control. She also amazed me by what she did during the science fair.First, she was annoyed at Ashley's mother because she wouldn't by Ashley a pair of jeans. It was as if she never took into consideration that maybe Ashley's mom couldn't afford to purchase a pair of jeans! Secondly, there was another student at the science fair who was sitting in the classroom, and this was where Chris found him. She immediately reprimands the kid and sends him to the office so she can get back to the fair. She spoke too soon! The student was sitting in the classroom because his project broke. Instead of Chris trying to help the student fix his project, she &quot;rids herself&quot; of him. I think one odf the reasons I liked this book so much was because I wanted to see what Chris would do next to annoy me.

It pointed out many problems in the public school system, and gave good examples of what we, as future teachers, will have to deal with.

If her methods weren't working, why didn't she try new ones? I don't find her very intelligent. Why did she wait so long to talk to Robert's mother or file a report about his pysically abusing himself? She wasn't angered enough or frustrated enough to do so since a look subdued him and because he wasn't hurting anybody else, only himself.She'd rather keep Clarence from getting the appropriate help for him in order to make herself feel like she's helping him. She gets off on helping. The quiet kids who don't demand her attention in a negative way are neglected. Thanks to Al, the principal, not her, Clarence got the help he needed. Al was the one who called for the evalulation of Clarence, although not with the intention to help Clarence, but to protect the school if the kid were to commit a crime with the consequence of the authorities coming to ask for records.Surprisingly she saw that the Science Fair is unfair. Why doesn't she consider helping the kids during school? They seem to like working on projects and even doing the research. Also surprising is that she hasn't figured out that the homework battle she will never win. If the parents aren't going to help with science fair they are not going to help with homework. I never did homework until 7th grade. I got C's and D's. My mother meant well by believing that school was school and home was home. (Now I have a Ph.D. in Second Language Acquistion and Teaching. I teach 5th grade.)Chris Zajac defines an dversarial relationship with her students. As I read over and over again how she put her face so close o the kids' who weren't doing their work or who were misbehaving, I expected a kid to spit at her or bite her. That's what she made me feel like doing.Good teachers dont have to be work- and worry-a-holics who bring their work and troubles home. They need to be creative enough to solve the children's problems.To defend the saintly Chris a little, she should have more support from the administration. There need to be proceedures for the problems in her class. Collegues need to observe each other's classes. The administration has to provide the teachers the methods and resources to be more creative problem solvers in the classroom."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Kidder leaves out important parts of Ms. Zajak's story. Why, for example, would a teacher let a child like Robert stab himself, hit himself, and commit other self-destructive acts, without sending that child for an evaluation? Too much of this book is praised without looking seriously at Kidder's failure to cover the entire story. Ms. Zajak spends too much time with the Clarence issue and not enough time with her other students.As a teacher in a small, inner-city, 99% Hispanic school in Chicago, I agree that the issues addressed in this book are real. The students in today's classroom have the same problems as Ms. Zajak's students had in the 80's. This book offers few productive solutions. This book was assigned reading for both my undergraduate and graduate education classes. Most of the students in my graduate classes; many of whom are adults with children of their own, rather than young, recent graduates; felt this book was poorly written, mildly depressing, and written in such a way as too make Ms. Zajak look like a woman on the verge of \\"teacher burn-out\\". What parent would want their child to be taught by a woman who has never left her home town for more than one month? Is that an example for her students?Most of my graduate class agreed that this book is too freely praised, and that another perspective on teaching should be offered in contrast to Kidder's."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and had to read the book Among Schoolchildren by Tracy Kidder. My view of the book was wonderful. The book is very well written and easy to understand. I could not put the book down. It is a story about a teacher and her experiences throughout a whole school year. All of the children she taught were very different, but she treated them all the same. This book should be the first pick for anyone majoring in education. It was GREAT!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I read &quot;Among Schoolchildren&quot; for my class. I really enjoyed this book. It was easy for me to get caught up in the class she was teaching. I wanted to know what was going to happen to Clarence and felt bad when he had to leave the class. I wonder if I would have done the same thing? This book made me realize all of the challenges I will face in teaching and also made me anxious to start teaching."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I truely enjoyed this book and found it very helpful in my quest to decide if I really want to go into education. I feel that the book brought to life many realistic events to expect in a fifth grade classroom. I would recoment the book to anyone who must deal with troubled students. I will most likely read the book over again. I would like to become as strong willed and patient as Mrs. Zajac."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"A great book for anyone going into teaching. There were a lot of great ideas and tips for all teachers to try. It also shows the ups and downs of being a teacher but lets you also know that teaching is a very rewarding profession. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"A reader from Macon,Georgia,July 21,1999 As a Teacher-Coach student at Macon State College, I believe all Education students should read this book. The reason is how the teacher Mrs. Cris Zajac learns how to deal with multicultural students. Her only two failures were students named Robert and Clarence. She really tried with these two and grieved constantly over their rejection. I will use her tactics in my classroom someday and I hope you will also."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This is a good book for anyone entering the education field. It is a very easy, novel like book to read. Parents would also benefit from reading the book. It gives a detailed schedule of what goes on in a classroom. This fifth grade class was very lucky to have Mrs. Zajac as a teacher. She knows how to motivate children, be very stern but caring at the same time. She is an inspiration to any teacher or someone wanting to become a teacher."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This book can be very useful to educators. You can get a real feel of how teaching can be. It is not always easy. You have many conflicts that you may have to face. There may be times were you have to be a parent to your students by always having to discipline them. Teaching is not for everyone you really have to have your whole heart into the job. This book helps give the real picture for teaching."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"An easy book to read. Very interesting and motivating for someone entering the teaching field. The book is not biased. I would recommend the book to anyone. I enjoyed the creativity the teacher used in her teaching style. I think everybody can learn something from this book. It's great!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I had to read this book for an education class.I was not sure what to expect but was pleasantly suprised.The book gave great insight into what teaching in a diversy society is all about. It made you understand what kids today were up against. The book is written in the form of a novel and makes for great reading."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Among Schoolchildren is a invaluable resource for up and coming teachers. It takes a look at the feelings and emotions of one school teacher in a low income community. Through the trials of the class rooms activities the reader comes to know the children, and their lifestyle. Becoming familiar with the class bully, and the hard working not so smart boy is half the books fun. There is also the smart, pretty girl, and the withdrawn shy children who interact with the class in their own way. I would recommend this book for education majors. It has become a staple book at teachers conventions all over."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"When I did my student-teaching, I spent the entire year in the same 3rd grade class. The final 3 months was when I student-taught. In reading Tracy Kidder's Among Schoolchildren, I was consistently reminded of the ups and downs that progesses throughout a school year. Kidder was able to capture Chris Zajac's experiences and weaved it into a compelling story that kept me hooked. Her students reminded me of my own experiences teaching and the difficulties & triumphs you can have. At the end, Zajac was tired but happy. Thus she gave creedance to the phrase, \\"happy-tired\\". Teaching is not a type of job that once you go home, you don't think about it. This is a profession where your life is affected by those you interact with 9 months out of a year. Then you wonder, just as Chris Zajac did, \\"Did I make a difference?\\", \\"Is he or she going to make it?\\", \\"What else could I have done?\\". One thing I have to say is this is not a book of solutions in dealing with troublesome students. It's more about life as a teacher in a poverty-stricken community that could very well be your own."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Kidder has took a real teacher, a real classroom environment and the real world and brought them together for an educational experience for the reader...This is just like sitting down with your best schoolteacher friend and listening to her experiences.. You feel like your there.. You get mad when she does, and sad when she does.. I truly agreed with a lot of her opinions but I also disagreed with some of her views.. But thats okay.. You have to learn whats out there to understand yourself better.. Mrs. Zajac could have been one of my teachers. I loved her.. I was just as frustrated with Clarence and even agreed with the children in her room...So see, this story is really wrote from all sides.. In the long run, who really benefits from this book? The students because we will be better teachers from it. I couldn't quite give it a 5.. I'm not sure if it was the racial tension or just the way it ended.... I really wanted it to go on and on... I recommend this book for reading to anyone that is going to work with children.. It can be very beneficial to all concerned parties..."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Although most people have attended school for years or still do so now, not very many people understand what it is like to be a teacher. Among Schoolchildren is the story of a teacher, Mrs. Christine Zajac, and her fifth grade class. It clearly and accurately displays what the school year is like for a teacher. It tells us of Mrs. Zajac's thoughts and the joys and challenges that she encounters while teaching. The amount of effort she puts into teaching is amazing. Even when she is not at school she is thinking about \\"her children.\\" One example of her dedication is when Mrs. Zajac is grading social studies tests late into the night. She evaluates each child after grading his or her test and plans what she needs to do next. She loves all of the children despite their faults. Mrs. Zajac picks out the good in each student. She even sees the soft side of a troublemaker, Clarence, when she reads the admirable writing he does in class.Although Among Schoolchildren is nonfiction, much of the book, especially the parts that take place in the classroom, reads more like a novel. This book follows Mrs. Zajac and her class for a year, and also includes background information that makes the book more interesting and understandable. In between the sections about teaching, there are descriptions of what the community is like and stories about Mrs. Zajac's childhood and life outside of school. The author, Tracy Kidder (House, The Soul of a New Machine), has once again written an outstanding book. Among Schoolchildren won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award in 1989. The award, according to the Robert F. Kennedy memorial website, \\"celebrates the book which most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes, his concern for the poor and the powerless...[and] his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance.\\"Among Schoolchildren includes some similar themes and values as To Kill a Mockingbird. Characters in both books demonstrate courage. In To Kill a Mockingbird, a lawyer, Atticus Finch, defines courage as \\"when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\" Atticus demonstrates courage when he takes on the case where a black man is accused of raping a white woman and will be tried before a white jury in the 1930s. Atticus knows he has almost no chance of getting the black man acquitted, but he chooses to defend the man anyway. In Among Schoolchildren, Mrs. Zajac also demonstrates courage. She teaches in a poor school district where many of the children live in rough conditions. She knows that many of them will not take advantage of the education she is trying to give them and that there is not a lot of parental support for the children. Many of them probably will not be successful later in life, but even knowing this, she educates the children to the best of her ability, hoping that some of them will retain the values and basic knowledge she has taught them.This book is a great read for anyone in high school and older, especially someone who is thinking about becoming a teacher. Among Schoolchildren shows the importance of education and how difficult it is to teach some kids. This book also reveals how hard life is for some children and how little support they have from home. Most of these poor children don't show a lot of interest in school or don't want to work hard, but Mrs. Zajac does her best to instill curiosity in them and make learning fun."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be beautifully narrated by Kidder. Although written in 1989 I would imagine a lot of the issues addressed in the book are current concerns for teachers today. Things like ESL students and discipline issues are certainly relevant in today's classroom. I would recommend this book for those wanting a detailed look at the daily goings-on in a 5th grade classroom. It was also a good look at one particular teaching style even though some readers may feel that Mrs. Zajac's teaching style was lacking. Perhaps those readers could use it as a \\"what not to do\\" guide. Regardless of your opinion of Mrs. Zajac and her students, the book was a quick and easy read."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"My first year as a teacher I was hired to teach 8th grade at Kelly School in Holyoke Mass, the same school profiled in this amazing book. Very little has changed there in the almost 20 years since Ms. Zajacs students graced the halls of Kelly School. The students are still under fed, tierd, and many living in poverty. The one thing that hasn't changed is the amazing dedication and love that the staff there put into thier work everyday.I came across this book in college and didn't bother reading it becasue \\"I would never teach in a school like that\\". One year later I found myself at that very school frustrated, tierd, disrespected, and often verbaly threatened by students whose home lifes I could only imagine.I picked up Kidder's book over the christmas break while debating if I was going to make it through the months till June. Reading Kidders book gave me the confidence and relaization that if I tried my hardest, and loved them, and worked hard I could do it. It wasn't easy, but I did make small gains through the year from what I had learned.I would highly reccomend this book to any teacher new or otherwise who is in need of a little pick me up and a little faith, he truely does remind us of why we do what we do."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am using this book with my community college students who plan to be teachers. I have taught in public schools at the elementary, middle, and college level and I wish someone had suggested that I read this book long ago. Tracy Kidder really gets inside Mrs. Zajac's thoughts and feelings about the challenges elementary school teachers face every day in their classrooms. This gives a very realistic view of the profession for people who plan to become teachers!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I felt like I was in the classroom with Mrs. Zajac. Tracy Kidder describes a real teacher and her students and takes the reader with them through the school year. The descriptions of the students brought them to reality for me. I did not want to put the book down. Kidder related the problems as well as the successes in the classroom. Zajac is the kind of teacher that a parent would want their child to have. Kidder brings to light the personalities and problems that a teacher has to deal with on a day to day basis. The reader appreciates that a teacher does not only teach basic skills and knowledge, but also must nuture and deal with children who come to the classroom with a lot of baggage.Anyone interested in education would appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"If you want to read a book that is real and tells the truth about the classroom, this is one for you. I can say this because I was just like one of the kids in Mrs. Zajac's class. I was in the fith grade just around the time that Mr. Kidder sat in Mrs. Zajacs class. I like, Judith, was raised in a Chistian-Pentecostal, Puerto Rican church and home (and attend one till this day) and taught Sunday school at the ages of 9-18. Except I grew up just a few hours ride from Holyoke, Ma.. I saw my school and myself through out the book. The book tells the truth; much more could have been told, but the day has only so many hours. I saw many &quot;Felipe's&quot; and &quot;Judith's&quot; graduate Hight School and some &quot;Robert's&quot; and &quot;Clarances'&quot; struggle. But, we each had our own &quot;Mrs. Zajac&quot; along the way; teachers that wouldn't let you down, no matter that your last name was.It was awsome to almost relive the fifth grade again. Mr. Kidder wrote and the most perfect discription of the American class room of the 1980's, that anyone could write. I'm just happy to see that Mr. Kidder give the rest of the world a chance to realize where alot of these troubled teens and young adults of today, come from. The book is real and true, I know because I lived it."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"ALL teachers should read this book! Compassionately written, deeply concerned vision of modern education...and a glimpse into the life of a dedicated teacher. I was a teacher...this story of an educator's 24/7 concerns and hopes rings so very true!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I was still new to teaching when I read this book in 1990. It had a profound effect on me. Although the subject of Kidder's book was an elementary teacher in Massachusetts, it was all so familiar to a high school teacher in California. Tracy Kidder captured the essence of teaching in an area where kids are deprived and in many cases, unloved and uncared for. It is a task so daunting, so wrenching that you wonder how you survived it. You are being paid to teach, but what Kidder describes is what teacher's actually do: teach, mentor, support, provide for, encourage, inspire, and struggle with the realities of their students' world. Kidder is masterful in describing the intricacies of this world. He is all seeing, but absent as his subjects speak for themselves. And he sees into the heart of being a teacher-that in addition to teaching, teacher's save lives."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This is my first Tracy Kidder book. I liked the book, but I cannot say it was gripping. I am not a teacher, but I do have elementary age children in a Christian school, have many friends that are teachers and care alot about the level of education our children are receiving. The teacher, did have a heart for all of her students, the troubled and troubling ones as well as the more adjusted ones. They were all from less than stable households, so the magnitude of the job in front of her can truly only be appreciated by those that have \\"walked in her shoes\\" so to say. This book left a lot to be desired, but I did appreciate the insight into the level of dedication one would truly have to have to enter into a classroom such as this. Perhaps school teachers would appreciate this book much more. I am going to pass mine on to my friend who teaches in the inner city of Chicago to students who possess many of the same issues."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"The writing was absorbing, like most of Kidder's writing. But despite the dedication and perseverance of Mrs. Zajac, I was left feeling that -- contrary to what some reviewers here have maintained -- she didn't have all that much lasting influence on the children's lives. The kids are now in their early 20's; don't you suspect Clarence has been in trouble with the law many times by now? That Robert has had serious problems as well? That Alice is probably in college or a recent graduate, with good prospects ahead? How would any of those outcomes be different without Mrs. Zajac?Don't take this as criticism of Mrs. Zajac! I would be pleased to have her teach my kids. I just think the odds are stacked high against her because of the system in which she works (or worked).One reader review from a teacher made me laugh --something to the effect that Kidder can't provide a good picture of public education because he hasn't worked in it! The reviewer is making the classic teachers' union claim, that only teachers understand education. In fact, though there are many good teachers, there are also many, many poor ones (another teacher/reviewer's message contained grammatical errors). Those unqualified teachers are part of the huge problem that is public education in the United States."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"Among Schoolchildren vividly depicts the daily challenges and rewards of teaching a diverse group of students. Tracy Kidder debunks the myth that anyone can teach by inviting the reader into a real fifth-grade classroom. From effective teaching to classroom management, Among Schoolchildren is an emotional journey into discovering how one teacher can take a group of students who have so much stacked against them and make a huge difference in their lives. As a future teacher, Among Schoolchildren puts the art and science of teaching into perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience the true meaning of the teaching profession!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student and I had to read this book for an education class. Usually I do not enjoy and often I do not finish assigned readings. This book, however, I both enjoyed and finished. The author told the story of a year in the life of a fifth grade teacher. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew her and many of her students quite well. Tracy Kidder did a great job of condensing a year's worth of school into one book and yet giving a thorough picture of the trials and joys experienced by both teacher and students. I would recommend this book to all those involved in education including parents and also to anyone who loves children and the human spirit."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I just recently finished reading Among SchoolChildren for an education class that I am taking in college &amp; I found the book VERY easy to read, humerous, inspiring &amp; very useful! I loved the way that Mrs. Zajac treated her students individually and never riticuled them. She was a teacher that I would consider very dedicated and devoted to teaching. I think that it is a great book to read for anyone who is considering becoming a teacher because the book shows what it is really like being a teacher. There are so many people who think that teaching is easy so I also recommend this book to anyone who is not an education major because it makes you appreciate what teachers actually do!"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I was required to pick a book to read and present it to my Education class as an assignment. I chose &quot;Among Schoolchildren.&quot; Overall, the book wasn't quite what I thought it would be but some parts were very interesting. I would recommend it but not strongly. The book lacks certain qualities needed to make reading go smoothly. Since it is in parts, its harder to 'roll' with the flow of things since it jumps from subject to subject. It seems the only reoccuring idea throughout the book was Clarence. Mrs. Zajac always seemed more concerned than she should have been with him. That definitely has to be a strong will on her part because you are taught that the children come and go and not to get too involved with them. You are also taught that you should take each child into consideration and handle each one individually. Who knows, maybe this is a lesson to be learned on my part."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I read this book as a class assignment. I was very impressed with it's contents. This book gives a great account of what being a teacher is really like. You get to see the teachers triumphs, struggles, fears, and joys.

It will give great insight to any education major."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student at Macon State College, and I read this book for my Education 2000 course. Among School Children was a great book that focuses on the life of a fifth grade teacher. I feel that this book would benefit teachers who are teaching early childhood education. This book can also be read by other teachers because of the teaching techniques used by the teacher, Mrs. Zajac.

Mr. Kidder is a genius."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student at Macon State College. I was given an assignment in my education class to read a book. I chose Among Schoolchildren by Tracy Kidder. I enjoyed this book because it gave a great example of what it is like to be a teacher. I believe Tracy Kidder did a good job of showing how Mrs. Zajak got through her problems and how she dealt with parents, misbehaving students and the everyday problems of the classroom. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going to teach or wants to teach in elementary school."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed reading &quot;Among Schoolchildren&quot; it really opened my eyes to the reallity of teaching elementry school. The way Chris, the teacher strived to really teach her students was uplifting. I am now starting to realize how important teacher interaction with students are. Chris thrived on finding every students good points and treated every student with respect. She had high expectations for every student as well as for her self. I was impressed to see how she intergrated strategies she learned into her classroom. I think Chris did a fantastic job considering the obstacles she faced daily. Despite some her students bad behavior she still cared about each childs future."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was very interesting and easy to read. I think anyone who is considering going into the teaching profession should read this book because it is a very realistic account of the social injustices in one classroom that is representative of society in general."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This book provides an in-depth look at the activities and interactions that take place inside a fifth grade classroom. The book takes you through an entire year of school, in which you have a chance to read about the successes and failures that both the students and the teacher encounter. From students talking out of turn to students hitting and yelling at other students, you will quickly learn just how complex the job of a teacher can be. There are also several good teaching techniques that the fifth grade teacher implements in class that are successful, one such example is role playing during a history lesson. In closing, I would like to say that I feel the book would be of great interest to anyone who is considering or entering into teaching as a profession."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"This book is a valuable tool for anyone dealing with students, whether a teacher or a parent. The interaction between the teacher and her students made you aware how difficult a job teaching really is. The patience and skill in being able to reach a child, to open up their minds for learning and to motivate them to want to learn is a big task that many of us would find overwhelming. If we could all watch and observe our children in the class room, I am sure we would have a great amount of admiration for the professionals who are teaching our children. Not everyone can be a teacher. It takes a person with special skills to take a child and help mold them into a person who can suceessfully fit into the classroom and in society. A teacher has a lot of responsibility and because they spend a third of the days hours with our children, more than most parents do, they have the potential to do great things. The book shows just how society can affects those we teach and the problems teachers are faced with in the classroom. I certainly can recommend this book to anyone who cares about children."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I had to read this book for my Education Class and it was probably one of the best books I have read in a long time! Among Schoolchildren takes a birds eye look into Mrs. Zajac's fifth grade classroom. The reader will share in her joys and disapointments in having the challenging job as teacher. Trust Me...You will laugh and cry and love every minute of this book! If you are a teacher or are planning to become one...Read This Book!!!!!!!!! It's superbly written with grace to excentuate the joy and challenge of being a teacher in today's classrooms! =)"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"As a graduate education student, I read this book for a class and would highly recommend it to anyone considering a career in education or just wanting to know more about our schools.

This book is wonderfully written and easily readable - seeming more like an engrossing story than a documentary."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am an Early Childhood education major at Georgia College &amp; State Univeristy, and for one of my classes we had to choose a book to read and I chose Among Schoolchildren. I thought that this was a great book; it was very easy to read and it kept my interest from beginning to end. The author, Tracy Kidder, spent nine months observing Mrs. Zajac's fifth grade class in Holyoke, Massachusetts. As a reader you are able to get a good idea of what it is like in a fifth grade class, and by the end of the book, you feel as if you really know Mrs. Zajac and her students. Tracy Kidder does a great job of sharing the failures and successes of the class throughout the year. From classwork to homework to the science fair in the spring, you are able to be there for it all...to see and feel just what went on in Mrs. Zajac's classroom. I really enjoyed this book and I strongly recommend it to elementary and middle school teachers, to parents of elementary and middle school students, and to anyone who simply wants a fun and informative book to read."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"So I love Tracy Kidder, like, a lot.And I love the Pioneer Valley area of Massachusetts like, a lot. (As, evidently, does Kidder: both \\"House\\" and \\"Home Town\\" are about the Pioneer Valley and I highly recommend both)And I love education, like, a lot.So it's no surprise to me that I am absolutely in love with this book and read it in a day and a half. However, I am surprised that I didn't like it more.Part of me thinks that Kidder was too ambitious here: by simultaneously observing a classroom and getting inside Chris Zajac's head, he was tasked with understanding the dynamics of fifth graders as well as Ms. Zajac as a teacher. Most of the narrative is from Ms. Zajac's point of view, and while it's neat for a casual reader to sympathize with a fifth grade teacher, for an experienced educator or a reader of education anthropology and sociology, her challenges are nothing new and unusual. What would have been even more intriguing, I think, would have been more about the social dynamics among the students in her class. It sounds like there were a lot of interesting characters, and Kidder certainly is sharp with details on them, but not more. I'm sure he tried, because he's done an excellent job at getting inside the heads of computer engineers, construction workers, policemen, and more in other books.Secondly, I'm trying to think of what I learned from this book that I didn't know before. Yes, teaching is an enormously stressful job, yes, teachers have to prioritize, multitask, discipline creatively and effectively, and decide when enough's enough. Duh. If education grad school didn't teach you that, I'd recommend asking for a tuition refund.What is unusual, though, is Ms. Zajac's ability to handle it all with a stern sense of humor and a genuineness, and Kidder does a very good job at letting her teaching quirks shine through.But again, perhaps somebody who doesn't think about education all day will find this book more enlightening than I did."},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","review":"I am a college student who is majoring in education. This was the book I chose to read out of six for my education class. Among Schoolchildren was a great book for anyone who is considering the teaching profession. I recommend all future teachers to read it, as well as anyone who is already teaching. I really liked Tracy Kidder's research on each of the characters. He did not stop at what the children told him, but tried to gather information from their family members as well. He was not bias at all in writing this book. He told the truth just like it happened no matter how bad it was. I am glad he picked Chris Zajak to do his story on. She is truly a special teacher that all should try to follow. I feel as if Tracy Kidder became close to the whole class during his study of them. After being in the class for so long and watching Mrs. Zajac in action, he probably felt he could teach the class by what he learned from her. Tracy Kidder became a part of that classroom and gave his view of everything that went on.

Preschoolers will have a very difficult time following it. Written in 1924, it is a compelling example of relatively early science fiction, combined with a bit of the Brother's Grimm. Its writing style is reminiscent of the Victorian era. A toymaker comes to a small town, opens a shop, and begins to create mechanical toys that amaze the towns' people. Then, an arrogant aristocrat demands that a toy be made for him, but the old toymaker resists. A short story, very interesting, intended to be read aloud to older children and adults,"},{"Title":"The Old Testament Speaks","review":"Good survey of all books of the OT.

(made up of selected cartoons from Peanuts Every Sunday Vol. 2) is a really good collection of fairly early Peanuts comics, each of them of the longer Sunday variety. Sally is basically just a toddler in these cartoons (Linus even teaches her how to hold a blanket and suck her thumb), Snoopy is constantly trying to take Linus' blanket away from him, and Lucy is constantly asserting her dominance over Linus. Despite the title, you won't find a lot of good days in the life of Charlie Brown in this collection. He can never get his kite up in the air, he's ridiculed as wishy-washy, and he always feels as if no one really likes him. I think there's actually more of Linus than any other character in this book, though (which is fine with me because Linus was always the character I could identify with the most). Not only do you get to see his struggles to remember his part in the Christmas program, you also get to witness his short-lived boxing career, which was less than spectacular thanks to Snoopy and Lucy, who square off against one another at one point in a real marquee matchup. Snoopy, in case you're wondering, fought with one glove strapped around his snout.My favorite cartoon in this collection features Lucy putting on one of Charlie Brown's shirts and running around imitating him, only to get a dose of her own medicine when he shows up and makes her the butt of the joke. In another one, Linus gets so mad at his sister that \\"she hath caused me to rend my garment\\" (Linus was always good with the Bible quotes). You're My Hero, Charlie Brown! has to be one of the better of the vintage paperback editions of Peanuts comics."},{"Title":"Groundwater Science","review":"I and many others have been falsely pertuating the myth that Freeze and Cherry is THE coursebook for serious hydrogeologists.

And if anyone is an expert on the lore of America's music, it's Max Wilk. The book was originally written in 1971. When it was updated 15 years later, many of the songwriters Wilk had originally interviewed were gone, so reading these chapters in the colorful voices of talents like the late Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin, Dorothy Fields, and Harry Warren, who, cigar in his mouth, told him about his three Oscars (&quot;Ah, I use 'em for doorstops!&quot;)-- it's irreplaceable. Even Irving Berlin, reclusive and rather irascible, offered his own glimpse into the man behind all those songs. &quot;If it's a collection of gags about the music business,&quot; said Berlin, &quot;don't bother talking to me. I'm not a comedian.&quot; All these stories are there, plus those of other show business legends like Robert Russell Bennett, Joshua Logan, and nonagenarian P.G. Wodehouse. Taking this wealth of ingredients, Max Wilk put it all together, gave it a stir, got the mix cooking, and then sat back to let the voices take over. For all those who love the heritage of American popular music, get this book, sit back, and read about the masters. Then put on your CDs and listen again to the familiar music they wrote for us.END"},{"Title":"They're Playing Our Song: Conversations With America's Classic Songwriters","review":"I found this book in a second hand store in Sydney (Australia, where I live) about ten years ago.

I'm always fascinated by the paradoxes created when contemplating time travel and this story did not disappoint me. I liked Silverberg's imagination about the crowded cities of the future and the hopelessness of trying to climb up the social ladder. It was an enjoyable read and I recommend it to anyone who likes to ponder the possibilities or impossibilities of time travel."},{"Title":"The Time Hoppers","review":"The plot is a little predictable but that is coming from our modern day view. This book was written 35 years ago and from that perspective, it is more interesting. Science fiction seen from the backward perspective often is. It is short, but that is good given the quality--I don't know if I'd enjoy it if it went on for 400 pages. Silverberg's view of how our world will end up if we continue to overpopulate is intriguing and a little frightening."},{"Title":"The Time Hoppers","review":"The Time Hoppers takes place in an overpopulated world held in check by a rigorous numerical system of classes. Each class receives a certain category of job and a certain allotted area of space. The higher the class the more space allotted -- Class 2s receive a second house in the mostly abandoned continent of Africa (teleporters transport them back and forth between residences). The lower classes share crowded dormitories. The lowest classes seldom receive any jobs and subsist on a government dole. The world is controlled by the ancient figure of the Class 1s who \\"live\\" in expansive residences far underground. Drugs are legalized and government controlled (along with brothels etc) since they distract the masses. Likewise, homosexuality is generally acceptable since it reduces the birth rate (families are allowed two children). Strange cults (some involve communal religious vomiting) proliferate as members of society desperately search for meaning in their regimented, predictable, and generally destitute lives.Silverberg barely touches on any of these fascinating social issues with anything more than a mere sentence or two... The plot is facilitated by a classic technological advance which takes advantage of the resulting social pressures of overpopulation -- the time machine. Alas...Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)Joseph Quellen, a Class 7, works for the Secretariat of Crime. He's ordered to investigate the mysterious use of a time machine to transport \\"hoppers\\" to a less crowded past. The people who take up the offer to travel back in time are the completely disillusioned -- generally the jobless and those unable to rise upward in the class system and receive slightly larger oxygen doles and more housing space. The government, or rather the all-powerful Class 1s deep underground, are against this unlicensed use of time travel for fear of changing the present. The paradoxes presented are the standard unimaginative ones -- you could meet yourself, you could die and all your descendants which could invent things don't, etc. Boring.Quellen, desiring above else more space to live in, has sequestered illegally a Class 2 residence in Africa. His co-worker, Bogg, has ferreted this out and uses it as a bargaining chip to extract money from his boss. This plays an important role later in the novel.So, Quellen figures out the name of a man planning on jumping back in time and has him tracked. The government cracks down and prevents him from arresting the men for fear of changing the present. Quellen's brother-in-law, a increasingly delusional jobless lower class individual, plans on jumping. Quellen is alerted by his sister and through a series of hints and clues figures out the kingpin behind the jumps. However, Quellen and his various colleagues in the Secretariat of Crime are tempted themselves to use the machine!Final ThoughtsSilverberg's World is interesting but all too hastily done. The world attempts to prop up a very banal, predictable, tension-less, and the frustratingly simple plot acted out by cardboard characters. At the very least, the social environment influences the actions of the characters...The Time Hoppers is a paint-by-the-numbers novel with an intriguing world but little else. The questions raised by time travel are unoriginal and silly. Silverberg's prose is far below his best -- for a brilliant novel on overpopulation read his masterpiece The World Inside.For the Silverberg completest only... Well, and those addicted to time travel novels regardless of their quality... And, well, readers like me who'll read any sci-fi novel touching on the social ramifications overpopulation..."},{"Title":"The Time Hoppers","review":"Robert Siverberg confronta o paradoxo das viagens do tempo, num brilhante livro passado no s&eacute;culo XXV, quando a &uacute;nica forma de escapar de um ambiente totalmente controlado, &eacute; viajar de volta ao passado.Mas, j&aacute; que essas voltas no tempo mudam os acontecimentos do passado no qual a estrutura da existncia atual &eacute; baseada, elas devem parar - aos poucos... porque a Hist&oacute;ria de 1970 inclui a chegada de viajantes que ainda no sa&iacute;ram do ano 2490, cuja partida no deve ser evitada.The time hoppers acontece num mundo superpopuloso, regrado por um severo sistema de classes.Cada classe recebe uma determinada profisso ou trabalho e um tipo de moradia espec&iacute;fico. Quanto mais alta a classe, mais espao para viver - a classe 2 pode possuir at&eacute; 2 casas (os teletransportes viajam rapidamente entre as casas).As classes mais baixas tem de dividir dormit&oacute;rios superlotados, possuem poucas opes de trabalho e sobrevivem de ajuda do governo.O mundo &eacute; controlado por ancios classe 1, que vive numa ampla residncia subterrnea, que so contra as viagens no tempo, por medo que elas modifquem o presente - uma pessoa poderia se encontrar com ela mesma; poderia morrer e seus descendentes no existiriam.As drogas so legais, para deixar as massas mais tranquilas.A homossexualidade &eacute; incentivada para reduzir a taxa de natalidade - as fam&iacute;lias s&oacute; podem ter at&eacute; 2 filhos.Estranhos cultos religiosos proliferam, &agrave; medida que os membros da sociedade, procuram, desesperadamente, por um significado para suas vidas med&iacute;ocres.Joseph Quellem, da classe 7, trabalha para a Secretaria de Crimes.

But there aren't any. Silverberg doesn't even resort to a little camp in this paint by numbers yawn.In which our hero, Quellen, who has the charisma of a basset hound on Prozac, gets claustrophobic. We are in the late 25th century, and despite limits placed on procreation, the proles are crammed into single rooms inhabited by scads of people. The only way to get a little room is to climb the corporate/government ladder. But unemployment is chronic.The only apparent diversions which have been created to escape this stifling existence are sniffer palaces, where one inbibes a potion and gets a little fantasy which is always interrupted right before it gets good. There's a little crime, but nothing detailed, and religious cults, including a cult of regurgitation, which I'd rather not go into. Let's just say it involves drug-laced dough and a big bowl.So a guy who's discovered the trick to dropping humans into the past (literally, as for some strange reason they come out about ten feet above ground) figures he'll solve the unemployment problem and make a little cash. They want to stop him because the records show when the hopping stopped, but they don't want to alter the past, etc etc..Quellen, as a secretary of crime, is responsible for stopping this heinous behavior. But Quellen has set up a secret hideaway in Africa for when he wants to go where nobody knows his name. There are side plots involving his brother-in-law on the dole, a fat underling who knows about his African retreat and secretly wants to be a Roman, and a world leader who get his liver replaced about as often as Firestone puts out tire recalls and is terrified that one of his ancestors will be prevented from getting back to the past to make babies. Quellen figures he'll use that fear for a little personal gain.It's an unimaginative work with few thrills, dull tech, and a very simplistic plot. It's a 180 page novel that should have been a 20 page short story, and that's stretching it."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"I actually picked this book up at a thrift shop a couple of years ago for my younger brother (for 25 cents) and here I am at 20 years old looking for a new copy. The previous copy of the book is still around somewhere, tattered and falling apart after entertaining every family member for hours at a time. This is definitely a good book to add to any collection or to start one with. The pictures are close-up, detailed and very crisp. A good rainy-day book."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"I love this book- it is a fun and unique way to see and learn about marine life.

It was difficult to find out how to return, but once I did obtain the information, the return was smooth and timely."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"This book was put out by Chronicle Books, which is the same company that released CALIFORNIA IN DEPTH few years back. The book contains a set of prism lenses built into a special flap connected to the front cover which allows the reader to see the stereo pairs in the book in all of their optimally magnified glory. The views are a collection of the authors best underwater stereo photography work from such places as the south pacific islands of Fiji and Borneo, marine parks in various Carribean islands and off the coast of California. As you peer throught the viewer, you find that it's very easy to lose yourself in that &quot;other&quot; world. In my opinion, one of the best features of the book is that the author decided to include his personal thoughts about the pictures he chose to include. A good example is an image of a Sea Turtle skeleton found deep in an underwater cavern. Apparently the darkness and the twists of the cave walls confused the animal, and it could not escape. Nearby (not in the picture), the author also found the skeletons of a dolphin and a marlin that suffered the same fate. He recounts: &quot;Even with dive lights, I found the intricately chambered cave highly disorienting. When I turned my lights off in the deep recess and imagined being lost there, it was truly terrifying.&quot; To sum up, I really treasure this book and hope that Mark chooses to make another one like it in the very near future."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"I ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son. We're doing a research project on oceans, and while we have a few good resources, I felt this one, with its 3d imagery, would more likely capture and hold his attention. What I didn't realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine. For me, 3D had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches. Though the book was described as stereoscopic, I didn't understand what that meant. Stereography was something new for me, even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old.This is not a matter of red and blue separations; the 3D results from the human eye's trick of blending 2 photos taken (simultaneously) an eye's width apart. Photographer Mark Blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography, and his work is beautifully displayed here. Everyone I've shown this book to has been fascinated by it, and I fully expect that when we've finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"BENEATH THE SEA IN 3-DI highly recommended this book for school children and adults alike.I was introduced to one of Blum's books by a friend and liked it so much that I sought out and bought all of his 3D books. I find the price so reasonable that I've since bought more to give as gifts.I enjoy looking at the 3-D photos as much as my seven year old son so I already know several adults as well as children who will be getting this book as a gift.The technical quality of the photos and printing of the books is very good. A magnifying, stereo viewer is built into a unique bi-fold cover of the book A little research showed that this idea is well over a hundred years old (like stereo photography) but I still find it very innovative because it is so rare and unusual.The photographer has an inspired eye and top technical skill. The underwater photography is amazing. I think the dimension of the ocean really goes well with 3D photos. The colors and forms of the undersea world show so amazingly well in 3D and Blum went all over the world making these photos.The writing accompanying each image adds to the photos with just the right amount of scientific and general information to serve both young and old reader. I like this book very much and I hope you find this review helpful. I recommend looking for the other 3-D books by Blum. They are all great!"},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"Everybody that has seen my copy of Beneath the Sea in 3-D is entranced by it. The superb quality of the photography alone is worth the money. But add the astounding 3-D effect and it is just plain irresistible. My kids love it (ages 7, 11 and 17), and I love it. Great for all ages. The captions add fascinating facts about the animals and the circumstances of the photos. This is a great book! I'm ordering Mark Blum's other books, too! By all means, buy it!"},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"The publisher has unfortunately tried to market these fabulous works as childrens books (not that they aren't wonderful for kids as well), but these photos are truely amazing both in the quality of the photography, but also in the presentation. They are printed on very high quality coated paper with a STURDY set of lenses built right into the hard cover, which allows you to view them in all their splendor without any additional equipment.These are not red/blue lenses! The images are presented in true color stereo pairs and when viewed, merge into a single, dynamic 3D image - WOW! I can't say enough about the overall quality of viewing for ADULTS as well as children.The price is another thing that confuses me. I don't know why these are so inexpensive? I urge anyone who loves nature to buy all of the books in this series!"},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"This is an amazing book! Makes me want to take up scuba diving.

The photography is excellent. For non-divers, here's a chance to get an idea of how beautiful the underwater world really is. I am buying extra copies for friends."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"What a treat for those of us who aren't able to dive into the sea ourselves! Buy this book and it's like you are really there.I just want to offer a hint... To retain the amazing sharpness of the photographs, teach yourself how to see the 3D image without the plastic lenses. Just practice gazing off into the distance while noticing that the two images before you are now three images...whereupon you bring your gaze down onto the middle image, which will be in 3D. Or, if you know how to look at those 3D posters that were so popular at one time, you can do the same here."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"We were visiting a museum one day and one of their interactive rooms hadBugs in 3-D. It is like the old stereoscope viewers in that it shows the photos as if they were three dimensional.The book has a built in double magnifying glass (the glasses are part of the cover that folds out for use). Each page has two pictures of the same underwater scene. If you hold the book at a 90 degree angle, and look through the \\"glasses\\" the photos become three dimensional (and very close up!). You can see the scales on the fish. It sounds creepy but it is very interesting!Using this book gives you the benefit of looking at these sea creatures very close up without having to actually have them in front of you. The photos are beautifully done and very colorful. The text that accompanies each page is educational.I would highly recommend this book as well as any others in this series by Mark Blum. We now have three in the series. If you can't get it new, a used copy is still wonderful."},{"Title":"Beneath the Sea in 3-D","review":"Not only is this book good for kids... Adults will enjoy it as well! Great 3D effect!"},{"Title":"Phenomenology of perception (International library of philosophy and scientific method)","review":"As shown in his first book, The Structure of Behavior, and this extension of that piece, Merleau-Ponty was a philosopher who was way ahead of his time.While Husserl was off sputtering abstractly about phenomenology and 'essences', Merleau-Ponty planted himself squarely into the concrete, thick, world of lived experience: this book is a detailed phenomenological description of of attention, memory, space-perception, free will, and other psychological/phenomenological categories. M-P claims that simply by paying attention to this lifeworld, we see that previous philosophical systems have overlooked ineliminable dimensions of what it is like to be a person, and that this oversight has led to radically incomplete philosophical accounts of things like memory, perception, etc..The book is so rich, original, and nuanced that it is hard to do it justice in a short review here. Not saddling himself with narrow academic techniques or fields, he draws on any resources he can to come to make sense of human experience. He cites not only philosophers such as Heidegger and Sarte, but draws equally heavily upon the Gestalt psychologists and neuroscientists of his day. He discusses phantom limbs, experiments on spatial perception, and psychophysical results from the Gestalt psychologists.Many ideas that are popular in modern analytic philosophy and psychology can be found in this book: the view that 'sense data' are simply theoretical constructs, the view that attention focuses on objects not abstract spatial locations, and the claim that our original concepts cannot be understood independently of the embodied interactions with the world where we first come to use them.I fear that Merleau-Ponty's nuanced philosophical psychology will fall through the cracks, being ignored by continental philosophers who focus on other things nowadays, and also by English speaking philosophers who dismiss Merleau-Ponty because he is a continental philosopher.If you consider yourself a philosopher of mind, epistemologist, or a continental philosopher, please read this book. Twice."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of perception (International library of philosophy and scientific method)","review":"Originally, I read this book as part of a Philosophy of the Body course, in companion with Sartre's magnum opus, Being and Nothingness. Trying to keep the two thinkers separate was quite easy, because of the difference in approach and ideas that they both take. Sartre relies on a dualism and intellectualism not easily understood, resulting in a complex and amorphous work, which is still utterly powerful.M-P, however, as one review said, remains in the concrete experience of everyday life. Perception, the way the mind interprets the senses, the importance of memory, time, and freedom in the world, are all utterly important in this work. M-P provides a work which attempts to synthesize psychology, physicality, and philosophy resulting in a more holistic and foundational work than many 20th century philosophers.This book can be read as philosophy or psychology, in fact, any course on perception in a Psychology department should read it. Anyone wishing to discuss the question of Pontius Pilate (&quot;What is truth?&quot;) should read this book. It touches on so many themes of intellectual life that it will become perhaps the most influential work of philosophy of the 20th century, vying with Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Heidegger's Being and Time."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of perception (International library of philosophy and scientific method)","review":"When all is said and done (and that will take a while) on the studies of philosophy in the 20th century, two names will stand out as being the most influential: Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The Phenomenology of Perception was Merleau-Ponty's second work and lays the foundation for his later writings. What Merleau-Ponty attempts to do in this work is to take phenomenology away from the idealist and dualistic tracks of Husserl and Sartre and ground it firmly in ontology through a psychological analysis of perception. In doing so, Merleau-Ponty lays the foundations for Structuralism and its later incarnations, for better or worse, Poststructuralism and Deconstructuralism. (Derrida and Foucault attended his lectures.)Required reading for any student of 20th century thought and anyone who wants to know how philosophy came to its present position."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of perception (International library of philosophy and scientific method)","review":"This early work of Merleau-Ponty is one of the great works of phenomenology. It is a tremendously rich book, and contains a great deal of thought not reproduced elsewhere in his writings. He takes phenomenology in a different direction from that of Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre, though he remains in dialogue with all three throughout. Late 20th century philosophy owes much to Merleau-Ponty, and this is a key work in understanding his thought. In my own opinion, it is one of the great books of philosophy, and the translation by Colin Smith is excellent. I highly recommend it, as you may have guessed."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of perception (International library of philosophy and scientific method)","review":"The book shipped to Toronto Canada within a a week an a half.

I even liked his unfinished VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE better."},{"Title":"The Man Who Met the Train","review":"My copy of this book had a snippet from a review from the Chicago Sun-Times in which they said it was a 'rawboned' mystery. I was intrigued by that characterization and can now report to you what that means.It means that this mystery is sparely written - no extravagent detail and most conversations aren't even fully fleshed out. It's a quick and dirty read about some quick and dirty crimes set in two small towns in Depression-era South Dakota. In style and setting it reminded me of a western. The hero, Carl Wilcox, comes upon a wrecked car. Inside are four dead adults and one survivor - a little girl.Wilcox is eventually hired on by local bigwigs to investigate the circumstances of the crime, seeing as how he has previous experience as a police officer. Wilcox starts to pull at the loose threads of this crime and starts to discover that some very prominent local names are being implicated in these murders and other crimes.The most interesting aspect of the story is the budding personal life of Wilcox. One of the local ladies enjoys serious flirtation with him and the little girl he saved from the wreck who trusts no one but him. It is enjoyable to follow along with Wilcox's discomfort and awkwardness in dealing with this traumatized little girl. He has obviously been a loner for a while and suddenly he is looking at the prospect of a family and dealing with having to sing little kid sings in the car and telling stories before bed time.This is a solid little read.

As a high school varsity cheerleader there is constant peer-pressure to succumb to the temptations of pre-marital relations. Trust me when I say, 'I wish I had read this book earlier.' I have had countless discussions with my pastor and youth minister about overcoming sexual temptations and no one has ever provided answers as clear as the author did in this book. The author's personal story gave me a new outlook on life and myself. I now know that I am worthy of what God has in store for my life and that I will NOT settle for anything less.

Maybe its my hatred of his writing style that soured me on the entire book...because I was ready to throw it into a corner after a few chapters of LEARNING NOTHING and letting him ramble about himself...but I decided, to spite the author's ego, to finish the book.Here's what you learn in the first half of the book:He was a big, buff dude in high school, and hung out with some attractive girls (ie: cheerleaders) during his high school and college years. He made some mistakes.Well, that sets you up for the great revelation. But not from the author. From his friend. The author tells you all about himself and his past and his mistakes (which, honestly, sounds more like he is trying to politely brag about his conquests...not help out struggling Christian teens), then HANDS IT OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE THE POINTS ON ETHICS. Whoever is going to make the moral arguments ought to be the one whose name is on the cover.I won't spoil the answer of \\"how far is too far,\\" but I want to add that I disagree with the conclusions of this book (and I am a Christian man). However, that's not why I give it only 1 star. It is poorly written and poorly argued.I recommend, instead, anything pertaining to JPII's Theology of the Body...not just for Catholics, but all Christians. It is not necessary to follow specifics of the Catholic faith to appreciate the depth of insight in those writings...and they'll do a lot more good than these other silly books."},{"Title":"How Far Is Too Far?: Where to Draw the Line on Premarital Sex & Physical Intimacy","review":"How Far Is Too Far?

This I feel relieves the subconcious mind to work on important aspects of life without the interference of mundane thought.The humble non-pushy approach of the author is the first striking thing about this book . He gives a wonderful idea about zen and the purpose of meditation. I found his approach very useful.Let me tell a few things that I have learnt about meditation. It might be useful for you too. Our mind has a compulsive need to flow. It always thinks about the past or plans for the future or just dreams. It hardly stays in the present. It is reflected not only in our thought preocess but also in our overall living. We interpret the reality by our experience and knowledge. There is a famous zen story. Once a student wanted to know what zen really means. He raised his question to a zen master with great expectations. But, the master remained still as if he did'nt even hear the student's question. Many say that real zen masters realize the complexity of zen that they dont talk about it. But, in my opinion he did answer the question, and I feel complete silence is what zen is all about. The complete stillness of mind where it becomes one with the universe and becomes aware of reality without any contamination of the thought process is what we are trying to achieve through meditation. As Fast points out, one of the purposes of meditation is to stay in the present. Relaxation of body and concentration of the thought on our breathing will be very useful to achieve this (This book explains the method wonderfully). I would like to mention here that our mind has been programmed to flow for so many years that we should not get discouraged or feel guilty with initial failures. We should practice, persevere and be patient with ourselves during our practices. The decision to be patient with ourselves will be a great boost in learning this art. Also, our mind has the character of branching out. One thought comes in, we interpret it and it branches out in another direction, we interpret again and it branches again and the process continues. When we meditate we should try and not interpret any of the passing thoughts forcefully. This will assist in our mind becoming calm as the practice proceeds. Concentration on some words like \\"om\\" or \\" ave maria\\" or just \\"relax\\" with that in mind helps a lot too.I read this book along with \\" Zen in the art of archery\\" and I suggest this combination for others too."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Gnomes","review":"I was fortunate enough to get a mint-condition copy of this out-of-print book, a sequal to the New York Times #1 bestseller masterpiece GNOMES.

A Vote for Murder is one book in Wishart's series about Marcus Corvinus, a young patrician, set during the reign of Tiberius.The interplay among Corvinus and the recurring supporting cast is one of the strengths of Wishart's series. Perilla (his wife), Marcia Fulvina (her aunt) and Marilla (his and Perilla's adopted daughter) are all well developed characters and each contributes to this book, which is set in the Alban hills at Marcia's villa. Merton (Corvinus' chef) and Bathyllus (his somewhat surly, opinionated and insubordinate major-domo) play a major role in this book as well.The mystery itself is well plotted and the book is well written, as are all in this series. A local election provides the backdrop for the mystery, though the interplay among Merton, a sheep and Marilla is also of note.

I loved the characters and the setting and particularly the way in which the author actually used cultural clashes to further the plot. Congratulations!"},{"Title":"Hangman's Point (SIGNED)","review":"HANGMAN'S POINT is an epic historical tale set on the British Island of Hong Kong during a continuous period of a little more than two weeks, in the year 1857. It has everything you need to keep your interest: A tavern named the Bee Hive with an actual bee hive nailed above the door, drunken sailors - who break out in song at times, an opium addicted Chinese baker, a high society Chinese pawn broker, British women in their colonial dress, romance aplenty, harbour views, harboured criminals, ships of all shapes and sizes, cannons real and made of wood, pirate battles and one of the better one-sided cat fights I can ever recall reading. Mixed in are the various classes of British Hong Kong - upper, lower and in-between - Chinese, British, American and more, all done with meticulous detail for historical accuracy; I learned a lot. The narrative is mostly told through the central character of Andrew Adams, an American tavern keeper, weapons smuggler, non-conformist and gambler who is wrongly accused of murder in the course of his fortnight adventure. HANGMAN'S POINT is narrative rich and character rich, which makes it a dense but enjoyable read, even at 540 pages. Author Dean Barrett seems to be in touch with his masculine side, feminine side and \\"foreign devil\\" side as the narrative is told from many colorful and believable points of view. An example of the Barrett narrative as told by the conniving British widow as she describes her on-the-side lover who doubles as the villain, Ryker: \\"He could be the most attentive man she had ever known and within minutes, his dark thoughts could transform him into a cold-blooded killer with no more feelings for a woman than a lost anchor.\\" This is exactly the kind of book I would normally not read, which makes the enjoyment of the ride all the better. What I want, as a reader, at the end of a long book like HANGMAN'S POINT is a satisfying conclusion with no loose ends. I got that and more. This is a smart book with smart writing, written by a smart author. It will, no doubt, be read 100 years from now, causing readers of the future to GoogleX Dean Barrett in their searchable wraparound eye-glasses. Won't that be fun for them what they find? This was a Kindle bargain at $2.99 but if I had it to do over again I would seek out the hardcover at any price. This one belongs on a bookshelf, preferably made of thick plank wood.

Like George Fraser's rogue Flashman (from the series of the same name and set roughly the same era), Andrew Adams is prone to making unwise decisions, and usually has several women on the side. The story is a complicated one, involving a nefarious plot by an English pirate lord to try and take the port of Hong Kong while the bulk of the British force is away shelling Canton, and an unrelated, but simultaneous plot to poison the entire foreign population. There are load and loads of characters, from all classes and parts of society, and Barrett succeeds in making each indelible. The books flags at times, but Barrett is mostly successful in juggling all the plots and players while dishing out loads and loads of daily life detail on his setting. It's a quite impressive--if slightly old-fashioned--historical entertainment. One small annoyance is the fluctuating spelling of one of the main villain's names.

However, this time Andrew goes too far and to avoid prison, must search out the pirates who beheaded foreign sailors.However, that is only the start of what is turning into a bad new year for Andrew.

Both are excellent, so you can't go wrong---and I think either would be a better choice for most people than past translations. I've chosen Raffel's, though, based not only on word choices (and I think some people need to lower their antennae when it comes to things such as Sancho referring to his \\"kids\\", which seems quite natural), but on Raffel's better balanced, more focused style, and his clarity of phrasing (which also involves word choices). Raffel's style overall is traditional. Grossman seems to jump between the literal, which is sometimes confusing, and the breezy and modern, which is enjoyable but not as wry and witty as Raffel's balanced approach.For example, Grossman's description after our hero has tried to grapple with the philosophical convolutions of de Silva: \\"With these words and phrases the poor gentleman lost his mind, and he spent sleepless nights trying to understand them, and extract their meaning. . . .\\" Raffel writes: \\"Arguments like these cost the poor gentleman his sanity; he'd lie awake at night, trying to understand them, to puzzle out their meaning. . . .\\" A minor example, but with Raffel's rhythm and word choice you can almost visualize the old fellow lying awake trying to \\"puzzle out\\" the \\"arguments\\"---not just \\"words and phrases,\\" per se. Raffel is often more subtly attuned. Notice also that \\"cost the poor gentleman his sanity\\" is not as modern-sounding as \\"lost his mind.\\" So don't think that because Raffel uses a few modern word choices for the sake of vigor that he's less distinguished.Grossman again:\\"His fantasy filled with everything he had read in his books, enchantments as well as combats, battles, challenges, wounds, courtings, loves, torments, and other impossible foolishness, and he became so convinced in his imagination of the truth of all the countless grandiloquent and false inventions he read that for him no history in the world was truer.\\"Raffel:\\"He filled his imagination full to bursting with everything he read in his books, from witchcraft to duels, battles, challenges, wounds, flirtations, love affairs, anguish, and impossible foolishness, packing it all so firmly into his head that these sensational schemes and dreams became the literal truth and, as far as he was concerned, there were no more certain histories anywhere on earth.\\"Grossman's sentence is more difficult to scan, and less concrete. Raffel's clear, no less fine prose in paragraphs like this brings the character of Don Quixote to life."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"As he has with previous translations, Raffel has again proved himself a master at providing an old classic in a fresh and readable way. This edition is even more vitally rendered than the Putnam translation or the Cohen one. While it's true that this work reads more like a loose collection of short stories than like the sort of tightly organized novels we expect today, it still remains an old friend to many of us, and for first readers this translation is direct and passionate."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"My desert island choice?

(More cow than sheep). If you would care to join me in being curmudgeonly and know the original look at the mess that is made of the Bodas de Camacho.I ran across the translator's use of the dollar as unit of currency (&iexcl;Virgen Santa! &iquest;A qui&eacute;n se le ocurre?) before reading Raffel's explanation in the translator's notes, and even after his reasonable explanation of the etimology of &quot;dollar&quot; I want my maraved&iacute;es back.On the other hand, the supporting materials (articles more than footnotes, although these more gratifying than the endnotes that other Quijote translations use) are a strong selling point for this volume rather than the new Penguin translation done by John Rutherford. On the other hand, I think that Rutherford's translation is better.In summary, I would rate this translation of the masterpiece Don Quijote de la Mancha a 3+.

I was thinking of buying it, and now after browsing it heavily in a bookstore, I'm glad I did not. I have opted for the Edith Grossman translation instead.This translation could almost be called \\"'Don Quixote' for the Under-Thirty Crowd\\". I am all for modern translations of this great work, and I fully support the idea of modernizing antiquated language in a translation and avoiding sounding heavy or old-fashioned. This is NOT the same as a translator being so eager to make a version of a great work accessible to normally uninterested readers, that the translation is purposely made in a TOO informal style.The language of this translation is almost ostentatiously colloquial, and I'm not trying to be a snob about this. Even the narration is deliberately phrased in as colloquial a manner as possible. Contractions abound all over the place, not only in the dialogue, but in the narration--something I frankly don't remember any other author doing when he or she is writing in the third person. I am not criticizing the translation for not being accurate--it is highly accurate, with some very ingenious English equivalents for obscure phrases. But there is not a single sentence that does not use an informal style of writing, and if one wants to get picky about it, it is very difficult to imagine a very well-educated sixteenth-century gentleman like Don Quixote speaking like this.And Raffel makes a catastrophic translation error at the beginning of the novel which apparently neither he, nor his editor, nor any critic has yet caught. In describing Alonso Quijana, the old gentleman who eventually becomes Don Quixote after going mad, Cervantes states something like \\"In short, the old gentleman so immersed himself in his books..\\", etc. Raffel actually writes, \\"In short, Don Quixote so immersed himself in his books\\", thus introducing the name \\"Don Quixote\\" in the narrative before Cervantes himself mentions it.The fact that this error has not been pointed out by ANYONE is proof of how blindly overpraised this translation has been. It is accurate, but it is too eager to be \\"readable\\" rather than great."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that Edith Grossman's new (2003) translation is much better than Raffel's. On the whole, Don Quixote has been well served in English translations over the last three centuries. Raffel's is a very competent and at times brilliant translation, but at times it is much too colloquial and, specifically, too American. True, Cervantes wrote in a living, breathing Spanish, but it is always stately, never slangy. Raffel's effort is an American counterpart to the recent (Penguin, 2001) translation by John Rutherford. Rutherford's work abounds in Britishisms (e.g., \\"Just wait a jiff\\" . . . \\"small beer\\" . . . \\"codswallop\\" . . . \\"I'll be blowed, gents\\" . . . \\"a dab hand\\" . . . \\"bloke\\"). Raffel's Americanisms are not nearly as numerous, but he frequently omits deliberate archaisms and settles on too colloquial and/or contemporary an expression. He also, oddly, consistently subsitutes \\"dollar\\" for \\"real\\" and for some reason omits all the prelimary poetic material in Part I. Overall, Raffel's translation is very readable, which will be a boon for students and other first-time readers, but to attain its readability it often has to sacrifice authenticity. The John Ormsby translation, especially the revision made for the previous edition in the Norton series, was a major achievement and a real advance over all previous English translations. It still has a lot to commend it. In the last fifty years or so, though, Samuel Putnam's rendering (still available, in the Modern Library, in a very affordable edition with extensive notes) has been the best into American English. Putnam's is now superseded, I think, by Grossman's, which is fresh, lively, but never self-indulgent. The Raffel translation itself deserves three stars, but the excellent collateral material in the Norton edition in which it appears makes the volume worthy of a four-star rating. The five-star cudos, though, belong to Edith Grossman!"},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I often return to this granddaddy of novels, and consider this particular translation the best. Grossman's translation is stellar, but it lacks the brio, the spirited tone and zeal of BR's rendering. Certainly this translation is sometimes free-and-easy and best serves an American reader, but its rhythm and gusto more than compensate for the flaws an academic might stub her toe on, and that rush of vivid life, in my opinion, is the heart of Cervantes' work. Authentic phrase or authentic feel? I'll vote for the feel. De gustibus."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This translation is quite good and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a faithful English version of DQ. As for the novel itself, what is there left to say? In ten thousand years, people will still turn to the silly tales of this obscure Spaniard as one of the great sources of wisdom humanity has ever witnessed. As Blake writes so masterfully: They must soever believe a lie who see with not through the eyeRide on oh knight, ride on !"},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I disagree with some of the criticism of this translation, particularly that of Mr. Moreno who mistakenly accuses the translator of a \\"catastrophic error\\" ...'introducing the name \\"Don Quixote\\" in the narrative before Cervantes himself mentions it.' If Mr. Moreno reads Cervantes Prologue to the book or even the chapter title of the first chapter, which mentions don Quijote by name several paragraphs before the section he sites, he will see his own error. In addition, Cervantes spells the name Quijote, not Quixote as Mr. Moreno does. Mr. Moreno also mistranslates the text in question \\"en resoluci&oacute;n, &eacute;l se enfrasc&oacute; tanto en su lectura...\\" by replacing the \\"&eacute;l\\" referring to don Quijote with \\"the old gentleman\\" introduced by Mr. Moreno and not by Cervantes. Translation is difficult as the translator's notes document. I was deeply impressed by the translator's use of a 1611 textbook of the Spanish language to clarify the signification of words whose meanings have changed in the past four centuries. In addition, this translator comes closer to Cervantes' actual colloquial style than many of the stodgy English translations that are now in existence. This translation is highly readable and almost as enjoyable as the original work in Spanish that so delighted readers when it was first released to the public at the beginning of the seventeenth century."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I think this modern translation is a lot easier and more pleasant to read than Walter Starkie's version (and due to the simple language it reads a lot faster...) A child could read it. Indeed, the original novel mentions that it was thumbed by children. Though I'm still bothered by all the commas this guy uses and stuff like &quot;more cow than sheep&quot; in place of &quot;more beef than mutton&quot;, but I'm probably being biased. I'd be interested to see what some of you think of the earlier translations if you've only read this one."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Raffel's translation of Cervante's masterpiece is remarkably good. I hadn't read Don Quijote in a number of years and about a week ago I tried to read the Ormsby translation. About one hundred pages in, I stopped reading it and ordered the Norton edition with Raffel's translation. Raffel's translation brings the text to life and captures the humor and personality of the book in such a natural way that it makes the other translations somewhat painful to read."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Don Quixote is a hairy mess of traveller's tales and adventures. It is also a truly wonderful book.One moment you're rolling with laugher at the slapstick situations Don Quixote and Sancho find themselves in, and the next you're in awe of Sancho's simple and earthy wisdom or Don Quixote's erudition on why a career in arms is better than a career in letters. A stop at an inn becomes a diversion into a number of stories, such as &quot;The Tale of Innapropriate Curiousity&quot;, which have little to do with the main characters but fit nonetheless with the overall flow of the book. In fact, these digressions work to its advantage as it means the chapters are short and fairly self-contained - perfect for dipping into before bed or on the train.While it is a long book, it is also a thoroughly rewarding one. Travelling with the Man from La Mancha and his sidekick for so many pages meant I got to know these characters better than any other I have read. Their behaviour in the innumerable mishaps and triumphs they encounter is at once familiar and surprising. Familiar because while Don Quixote and Sancho are, respectively, mad and foolish this does not exclude them from being wise, honest and upstanding. The interplay of these qualities make for many touching and memorable moments."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Reading Don Quijote was one of my goals for 2005. I did a lot of research in order to decide which translation to read. I was less interested in the faithfulness of the translation as I was in its readability while generally adhering to the overall faithfulness of the story and the message of the original book. This translation did not disappoint me. It was very readable and I am confident that my reading experience was as good as possible. The language is quite modern, which only bothered me very slightly. For example, we all know of Don Quijote as \\"the Knight of the Woeful Countenance\\", but in this book he is merely \\"the Knight of the Sad Face\\". Of course they both mean the same thing, but no one today would refer to someone as having a \\"woeful countenance\\".As for the book itself, I very much enjoyed it - especially Volume II which was published 16 years after Volume I. Readers should be aware that this novel is very different from the musical play \\"Man of La Mancha\\" - a great play with a great message, but only very loosely based on this novel."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"'Don Quixote' is largely considered to be a satire on the popular chivalric ballads of Cervantes' day, but don't be fooled. This novel is no satire on chivalry, itself. Indeed, through the trials of Quixote and Sancho Panza, Cervantes is perhaps the greatest promoter of chivalric ideas that the West has ever known. No other protagonist so thoroughly embodies the ideals of heroism, romantic love, friendship, honor, discretion, trust, virtue, and adventure than does Don Quixote. It just so happens that he is insane, but the author is able to look beyond that. So too should the reader.The knight's sallies are absolutely delightful and, it must be credited, alone prove Cervantes' genius in writing. The dialogue between Quixote and Sancho is excellent comedy, creating a duo that has gone unsurpassed in originality and endearment for five centuries. \\"Is it possible that Your Worship can be so thick skulled and brainless as to not perceive the truth of what I allege?\\" Classic.But these adventures, hilarious as they may be, give us frame for a storehouse chivalric truisms, the like of which can be found in no other work of fiction. A sampling would include: \\"An author had better be applauded by the few that are wise than laughed at by the many that are foolish;\\" \\"Anyone who has been a good squire will never be a bad governor;\\" \\"There is a wide difference between flying and retreating; valor which is not founded on the base of discretion is termed temerity or rashness;\\" and \\"Whenever virtue shines in an emanant degree, she always meets with persecution.\\"The reader cannot help but to love such regal assuredness, such profound idealism. Ironically, Quixote's insanity never really contradicts his optimism and in fact vindicates it. It is commentary on the human condition that only the insane person can actually accomplish something virtuous. And after all the delusions are expired and all the fallacies uncovered, Don Quixote actually has accomplished everything he set out to achieve if only because he was noble enough to strive for it.A note must be made on the translations. While much of the verbiage is straightforward, there are several repeated phrases that are different between the major translations, Quixote's moniker being one of the most important. In every translation I have seen, the name has been different--\\"The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\\" \\"The Knight of the Mournful Countenance,\\" and \\"The Knight of the Sorrowful Face\\" are all used for the same phrase. I enjoyed the \\"Rueful Countenance\\" and found it to be well-suited for the style of the novel though I have not read other translations.In the end, though, you cannot go wrong. 'Don Quixote' is a pure joy to read and we are fortunate to have the ability to do so."},{"Title":"Don Quijote (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Hardly a day goes by without a reference to tilting at windmills or other quixotic behavior in the media or conversation.

Himes' literary novels had an ability to reasonably place his heros up against powerful social forces and powerful personal conflict. In such powerful circumstances, the basic human instinct to preserve character, belief and integrity become enough to produce heroism, say big things, and still not leave a believable if uncomfortable reality. In the Lonely Crusade, the target is the war time complicity of the Communist Party with the government and employers in stopping war time struggles for Black rights and struggles by workers in the war industries. This is hinted at in Himes's other novel of the Second World War, _If He Hollers Let Him Go_ which is a far superior novel to _The Lonely Crusade_, although less politically specific.Lee Gordon, the character in this novel faces a savage frame up. His acquisition of a \\"Negro-first\\" union post as a stepping stone to management or middle class upward mobility leads him to a struggle where he must battle both the union official dom and the CP. Finally, the CPers whom he meets in the union and who at first champion him and who try to lure him with chances of advancement and sexual opportunities, turn into his enemies because Gordon will not back down from the struggle. He is left with one person who sympathetizes, a long-time union activist who is in the party, but realizes Gordon is right and the CP is wrong, but this man can do nothing but hear Gordon's story, be afraid for him, and do nothing.This novel led to Himes being Black Balled by literary critics associated with the CP who were numerous in the mid and late 1940s. Along with the hostility of the rest of the critics to Himes's wholesale denunciation of racism, particularly in the literary community, and the approaching witch hunt, this rejection was one of the reasons Chester Himes fled the US for Europe where he began writing his famous dectective novels which draw exact pictures of life in Harlem in the late 40s and early 1950s, even though their author never had enough resources to visit his native country in those years.Himes' literary novels have been republished. They are great reading regardless of their literary or political significance. They're important novels because they voice sentiment and feeling absent from other pages. They're also important because most of them are strong reads, strong stories.Himes was a unique individual, a prisoner who began writing in prison, a self-made intellectual, but a man who never lived separately from the lives of working class African Americans, until he felt he had to go into exile to continue writing.In some ways his views sound more cynical or ironic than Wright or Langston Hughes, two who went before him. Yet, to my mind this was often because Himes reflected the real feelings, the sweat and the grit, of day-to-day working class African Americans and reflected our point of view, rather than analyzed it from above."},{"Title":"Lonely Crusade","review":"I will not bore you with a long review.

I found this an excellent introduction to Hong Kong writing from a studied, academic viewpoint, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in postcolonial literature in the Asian context."},{"Title":"Voices in the Heart: Postcolonialism and Identity in Hong Kong Literature","review":"Mr. Hooper's book is a revelation. Ostensibly a work of literary criticism, it is also a bold meditation on the whole of the post-colonial experience. In limpid and inviting prose Mr. Hooper convincingly identifies a coherent post-colonial Hong Kong literature, and shows its practitioners drawing on both Chinese and British traditions in ways that are at various times ironic, paradoxical, humorous, and deeply moving. Mr. Hooper thus restores to the criticism of post-colonial literature a sense of the common humanity of both author and reader, long-forgotten in an era so dominated by naive master-slave categories. I especially enjoyed Mr. Hooper's comparison of Lee Ding Fai's Running Dog with Somerset Maugham's first novel Liza of Lambeth. Rather than indulging in narrow and self-serving polemics against the latter, Lee instead, in Mr. Hooper's view, crafts an homage that embraces the genuine contributions of British political and cultural life. The post-colonial experience is thus revealed not as a story of oppression and resistance but rather of mutual flourishing. Of interest even to those who know little of Hong Kong or Asia in particular, this is a bravura performance sure to overturn many well-settled opinions on post-colonialism, and much else besides."},{"Title":"Voices in the Heart: Postcolonialism and Identity in Hong Kong Literature","review":"With great learning and a polished, accessible literary style, Hooper undertakes the formidable task of examining a large body of literature produced in Hong Kong to show it as an integral part of the universal human heritage.

Focusing on three central texts-Patrick Acheson's intricately-wrought and provocative Flagrant Harbour, Lee Ding Fai's rags-to-riches story Running Dog, and Timothy Mo's The Monkey King-Hooper offers a lucid, usable theoretical structure for analyzing the postcolonial phenomena in the Hong Kong context.

Jim Harrison's writing is easy, flowing and deliberate but at the same time complex and coordinated. I'm constantly jotting down sentences, words and notions from his books that move me enough that I don't want to forget them. Each character somehow shadows my own life - periodically reminding me of myself, those I love and even, sometimes, those I hate. Oddly enough, Jim Harrison's writing is like the thing he writes about so often, a steady river with a constant flow.I have heard and read a fair amount of negative reactions to his storytelling. Simplistic. Sexist. Perverted. When writing about a man who is thinking about/dreaming about/looking at a woman, Harrison doesn't shy away from overt sexuality and even, it's true, objectification. My argument is this - men are perverts (God love them) and to offer the inner monologue of a middle aged man confronted with a young woman in a short skirt without a little salaciousness would be dishonest. If anything, Harrison's honesty about men's imperfect and impure appreciation of women (demonstrated most expertly by Brown Dog in the second story, \\"The Seven Ounce Man\\") shows just whose side he's on. His telling of the young and exceptional Julip, worthy female star of the first novella \\"Julip\\", gives her all of the strength and worth and paints her male counterparts, \\"the Boys\\", as 3 middle aged men trying sloppily to rescue their own long-dead youths by possessing this powerful and certainly un-possessable 21-year old feminine force.The last story, \\"The Beige Dolorosa\\", is a calm portrait of a middle aged man in an uncomfortable but, ultimately, necessary transition and discovery of himself. This story is an examination of nature and literature woven into the foreground of a weak-kneed but wonderful Midwestern professor forced through exigent circumstances to spend his 50's on a cattle ranch in the wilds of Arizona.Harrison's books offer extraordinary humor, nature, desperation, discomfort and personal discovery in equal measure and this collection is one of his best."},{"Title":"Julip","review":"This collection of novellas by acclaimed poet and novelist Jim Harrison is to savor.

Each of these three novellas made me want to share this book with a different person in my life. In each of the three stories the lead charecter is so interesting and well developed that you wish you could follow them further. These charecters are so diverse (a sprited,young, female dog trainer; a horny, vagabond, wannabee native american; and a aging dispossed professer) that I was amazed that one author created them all. This is truly a book with something for everyone and a lot to love for any reader."},{"Title":"Julip","review":"read these 3 novellas on plane from New Zealand to Jakarta. Not much business to be had in Indonesia but the book made the trip worthwhile. A new writer for me and I was impressed with the ironic, slightly weary style and with the gentle humour - not taking itself too seriously. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Julip","review":"Love his perspective. Love the language he uses. Admire his understanding of Native values and simple all-inclusive humanity. Always want to read anything he writes!"},{"Title":"Julip","review":"Out of all the Harrison books I have read, which is all of them, I like this one the best. There are three novellas and the last one is my favorite story. This collection has one story about Brown Dog, and the last story is about a man who finally discovers who he really is and becoming comfortable in his own skin. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Julip","review":"Granted, Jim Harrison is not for everyone. But the energy that eminates from his novellas truly moves me. I have read everything he has written, and reread most of them. They seem even better on the second reading."},{"Title":"Julip","review":"Not the best by Mr. Harrison, but enjoyable. The 7 Ounce Man is especially funny. I liked all of his characters and they even reminded me of a few people I know. Read &quot;The Woman Lit by Fireflies&quot;, it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Balinese Temples (Discover Asia)","review":"This small and inexpensive book packs with it a tremendous amount of information about Balinese Temples. The author starts by introducing the concept of Hinduism and Buddhism in Bali, as well as religious life in this island east of Java. He then proceeds to discuss general elements of the temples, such as: structures, functions, styles, and types. Along the way, he packs in many examples of those elements (in text and in images), and explains well each new terms that the readers encounter.The illustrations are well thought of and done. The lay-out of the book assists the readers in navigating through the sea of information. Captions, side-bars and placement of graphics work very well. One thing that is missing from this book is the floor plan(s) of the temples. While this book does not profess to be an in-depth study on architecture, it will be useful to include simple floor-plan(s).Almost toward the end, the author puts in a chapter on the kingdom of Majapahit of East Java, the influence of which is apparent in Balinese art and architecture. Somehow I wonder if this chapter would be better off placed toward the beginning of the book, since it would better explain the spread of the religion, as well as the style of architecture from Java, Bali's neighboring island.This book is part of a series in Periplus' &quot;Discover Indonesia.&quot; Check out the two other titles already available at Amazon.com: Balinese Architecture (ISBN 962-593-194-5,) by Davison and Granquist (the same team that writes the Balinese Temples), and The Mysteries of Borobudur (ISBN 962-593-198-8) by Miksic, Marcello and Trachini."},{"Title":"The Bonds;: An American family","review":"I chose this because it is so historically significant in keeping this family's contribution(s) toeducation out there.

I have read the other books in the Crosswicks series but was unaware of this one. It did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"TWO-PART INVENTION: THE STORY OF A MARRIAGE is only the second L'Engle book I have read. Regrettably, I didn't like this one much more than I did the other Crosswicks journal. A very touchy and difficult subject, death and dying, so I hesitate to say much about L'Engle's documentation of that of her husband, Hugh Franklin, who died of complications from bladder cancer. The book itself, however, seemed formless, meandering and redundant, as L'Engle tried to tell the story of their rather unconventional forty-year marriage even as she still struggled with the enormity of her loss.A tough subject to tackle, no matter who is telling the story. I felt deep sympathy for L'Engle, but wondered if she should have published this book at all. Anne Roiphe's EPILOGUE or Joyce Carol Oates's A WIDOW'S STORY were both, I think, better-written books on the same subject.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER"},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book. It was recommended for a book club and had never heard of this book so I didn't really know what to expect.I loved the story line and how she told a real life story. You are drawn in from the beginning and can sense that she is waiting for something special. I love how Madleine interacts with all those around her and how her relationship starts out with her husband. It is a true love story in marriage, even to the end. I was gratedul to read about the courage they both had to make it through all their trials and the love they had for one another through it all. It really helps you to reflect on your own marriage and how you can remain totally in love even after 50+ years of marriage. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"This is a poignant tale of L'Engle's relationship with her husband. It shows what true, mature love is. If, however, you have read her \\"A Circle of Quiet\\" you will find some of the same vignettes here, albeit with a different perspective."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"This book has become one of the ones that I re-read regularly. (I also lend it out regularly, which has become something of a problem--it never comes back to me!) Madeleine L'Engle's story of her courtship and marriage to Hugh Grant is one that everyone contemplating marriage--or divorce--should read slowly and carefully. Nothing is absent from this chronicle: not love, nor pain, nor laughter, nor sorrow, nor failure, nor triumph, nor doubt, nor faith,. Would that we could all treasure the moments of our lives as does Ms. L'Engle, and understand them as the gifts they are, as she clearly does!"},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"If you never commit yourself, you never express yourself, and yourself becomes less and less significant and decisive. Calculating selfishness is the annihilation of self. -Madeleine L'Engle, Two-Part Invention, quoting Chekov?Madeleine L'Engle, author of the beloved Newberry Award winner A Wrinkle in Time (see Orrin's review) here tells the genuinely moving story of her forty year marriage to the actor Hugh Franklin, an early star of All My Children, and of his agonizing death from cancer. The book is at its very best describing the commitment that marriage requires of people, the commitment to one another which makes so vital an institution. At one point she asks :[I]f Hugh dies first, would I ever be able to stop saying 'we' and say 'I'? I doubt it. I do not think that death can take away the fact that Hugh and I are 'we' and 'us,' a new creature born at the time of our marriage vows, which has grown along with us as our marriage has grown. Even during the times, inevitable in all marriages, when I have felt angry, or alienated, the instinctive 'we' remains.This kind of selfless devotion to another and to a relationship is so rare and precious in our ever more atomized culture, that to see two people who realize it so fully is really edifying.Oddly enough, though it is probably one of the things she is best known for, I found her religious musings less effective. Her God is entirely too much a personal God, as she seeks to justify his ways to herself. Likewise, her comparisons of Hugh to Christ, and of his cancer to the crucifixion, seemed a little over the top to me.Lastly, though Ms L'Engle seems like a perfectly decent woman, perhaps even an unusually decent one, her intermittent forays into political questions are disturbingly misguided. As she tells about a trip to China during which the United States bombed Libya and she felt compelled to apologize to people she met in the street, the reader can hardly suppress a desire to see someone dope slap her. She is after all speaking to people who live under Communist oppression, apologizing for a democracy's measured response to the provocations of another totalitarian dictatorship.But let's set these objections aside for now, and just consider the book as a portrait of a loving marriage and of the maintenance that even a love-filled marriage requires. Here it succeeds and is so successful that one wishes all young married couples, or prospective couples, would read it. She does not try to sugarcoat her life or her marriage; she presents them with all their rough spots intact. The message that comes shining through is that the life has been infinitely better because of the marriage and because that life was shared with Hugh. In one of my favorite passages she acknowledges :We were not a latter-day Heloise and Abelard, Pelleas and Melisande when we married. For one thing, the Heloises and Abelards, the Pelleases and Melisandes, do not get married and stay married for forty years. A love which depends solely on romance, on the combustion of two attracting chemistries, tends to fizzle out. The famous lovers usually end up dead. A long term marriage has to move beyond chemistry to compatibility, to friendship, to companionship. It is certainly not that passion disappears, but that it is conjoined with other ways of love.Of course, the culture tends to glorify the passionate whirlwind romance, rather than the steady committed marriage. Anyone fortunate enough to share in the latter, to enjoy true love, realizes how empty is the former.GRADE : C+"},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I have finished Predlude, the first 70 pages. I'm done. This is a step-by-step and quote-by-quote retelling of her love-life, courtship, etc. There are too many great books out there waiting to be read for me to waste my time waiting for this to get better. I don't really care how many times some suitor proposed to her and what her response was, nor how many dog biscuits she ate after taking a bath. The sentences are boring and so is the story. Farandolae are much more interesting."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"When I read this book I was young and single. I was warned that I might not relate well to a book subtitled, &quot;the story of a marriage&quot;. That was not the case at all. I loved L'Engle's reflections on loving, worrying, losing, and continuing on with courage."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"Madeleine L'Engle once again lets her readers into her ownpersonal struggles, and details her faith and grief duringher husband's fight with cancer. There is a strong similaritybetween &quot;Two-Part Invention&quot; and C.S. Lewis' &quot;A GriefObserved&quot; and this book also describes the triumph of faithand love. In a time when terminal illness is a commondenominator for many families, this book is a touching testimony to strength of resolve and the real love possible inmarriage. For anyone who is a frequent L'Engle reader, thisbook gives great insight into her personal journey."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I agree, this book is such a real treat. Ms. L'Engle is such a wonderful writer; the way she expresses things makes it all &quot;clear&quot;. I love the way she urges you to see the beauties in life, love and happiness. This book not only inspired me to begin playing the piano again; it is the ONLY book that has ever made me cry upon putting it down. This book could change your life. Ms. L'Engle, thank you for changing my life. And Alexandra Stoddard (author), thank you also for not only changing my life, but for introducing me to such a wonderful author! :)"},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"\\"Two-Part Invention: The Story of a Marriage\\" was Madeleine L'Engle's fourth and final Crosswicks journal, a series of books in which she bared her soul and shared her unique insights into life and faith. This final book is an examination of her relationship with her husband, Hugh Franklin, as he battles cancer. It is a touching, bittersweet account of their courtship and marriage, the storms they weathered together and the beautiful life they invented for themselves.L'Engle begins with brief sketches of the childhoods that both she and Hugh had, very different childhoods, but ones that certainly made them who they were and made them perfectly suited for each other. She covers their meeting, their courtship, and their spontaneous marriage very straightforwardly. For the rest of the book, she weaves back and forth between the present happenings of Hugh in the hospital and the life they built together for forty years - whether in New York or in the country at Crosswicks. Throughout it all, L'Engle is unflinchingly honest, showing the good along with the bad, and allowing readers to share in her questioning God while watching Hugh's deterioration and the multiple setbacks he goes through. It is more than enough provocation, but L'Engle never loses hope or faith.For fans of L'Engle, some stories that are related here will be familiar, but it is still a pleasure to read them a second or third time. L'Engle's journals were filled with that uncanny feeling of being welcomed home by a long unseen family member: she was everybody's grandmother or godmother. For anyone who has lost a loved one or watched someone they love endure a terrible disease, L'Engle's writing is a soothing balm indeed. She was sustained by her steadfast faith and the immense love that she shared with her husband. Their story, despite the fact that they led far from normal lives, is an inspiration to all."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"Quite simply, this is the most beautiful book on marriage I've ever read. Simple, quiet, honest and heartwrenching, it moved me to tears (and few books do). I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a good love story--the REAL kind, the kind that stays and works."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"A little slow at first but delightful after that. A beautiful description of a real marriage that has become a goal for me."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I enjoyed this book - it was an insightful look into L'Engle's life. I never knew that she had been an actress. I especially liked her stories about her theatre life. The fact that she was married to the actor that eventually played \\"Dr. Tyler\\" on All My Children was interesting too. She shares her views on things that matter to her, and tries to impart some wisdom upon the reader about living with an actor husband, doing what is best for her family, and ultimately doing what is best for her husband in his time of illness. I would recommend this book for anyone going through a difficult time with a gravely ill spouse, and anyone looking to find out more about L'Engle's life."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"I have read the book twice and Madeleine has the inspiring power to bring you into her life and show you that it is possible to find a marrage that works. It is a story of a marrage that lived through the rigors of theatrical lifestyles, compromises for family and illness, and the glorious love of family that gets us through anything. This book makes me cry and lifts me up at the same time. It is worth reading twice."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"A great read on the complexities of marriage, life and facing death. Two of my favorite quotes of all time are in this book."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"A wonderful memoir of Madeline's 40 year marriage--I love it as much as everything else I've read from her. A treasure."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"This book, along with C.S. Lewis' A Grief Observed, are two of the best books ever written about love and loss. L'Engle's characteristic style of inspired wanderings brings you back gently and eventually to her main discussion of her courtship and 40-year marriage, and to the inevitable and tragic ending thereof. While certainly saddening, this book is not about wallowing in grief, but is a celebration of the non-traditional (in many ways) life that she and Hugh built together, and how the strength and love of their relationship rippled outward to affect all they came in contact with: children, god-children, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"(Two Part Invention) I was touched by the way this woman thought as she entered marriage; how she considered the marriage before any other factor in life. As someone born in the last 40 years, I have honestly never heard a woman talk about her marriage in those terms. I was humbled and thought what a shame...we have lost something very special and gentle: honoring marriage. I never did, never knew anyone who did, marriage for myself and those in my circle was more of a nuisance. After two painful divorces I could finally hear Madeline's voice and everything she said made such beautiful and perfect sense. I long for that type of life and marriage and never realized all along it had to come from me. I also cried after putting the book down and a tear often comes when the book comes to mind. I always remember her thought about moving into the city - where she didn't particularly want to live - so that she could be the wife &quot;hosting the slumber party&quot; when they were snowed in, rather than being the wife getting the call when the husband wouldn't be coming home to the suburbs. And how she adjusted her whole sleep schedule to accomodate her husbands' late work nights. Sigh. Thank you Madeline, thank you for a voice that is not often heard."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"What if this book were spread across the bookshelves of stores in the marriage section, replacing the countless &quot;How to..&quot;'s? I believe those seeking guidance and strength for their own marriages would be better served. There is, in so much of what is written about marriage today, an abundance of techniques, tips and tricks to smooth the struggle, if not attempt to eliminate it altogether. L'Engle honors the struggle in this book. Her writing sings when she describes the most difficult times in her relationship.Life and relationship in marriage is about the details. L'Engle's descriptions of countless meals, sitting on her four-poster bed talking into the night with close ones, and of conversations held with intimate friends and family, are jewel-like stones laid on a fascinating and well-told tale of one path of marriage."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"This book was given to me as part of a wedding gift. I read it on my honeymoon, and though it is heartbreaking, even more so it is inspirational. I have since given a copy as a wedding or engagement gift to all of my friends when they get married. I have reread it each year of my marraige, and find it only gets better with age."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"Two-Part Invention was wonderful. Madeleine L'Engle talks about her 40 year marriage in retrospect - while dealing with the imminent death of her husband after a long struggle with illness. It is moving and profound and inspiring - not depressing at all, despite the sad subject matter. I appreciated that she talked about her craft - and the struggle between being a good wife and mother and being a writer. I'm far from a \\"writer\\" but I understand her plight - finding a balance between her vocation as a mother and wife and her avocation as a writer while still doing it all. I think anyone who has a passion for art or writing or any sort of creation and has struggled with that creative urge in the face of their other responsibilities will understand. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Two-Part Invention: the story of a marriage","review":"This book, along with C.S. Lewis' A Grief Observed, are two of the best books ever written about love and loss.
