I did not approach the book with high expectations and expected to find the language archaic, imperialist and racist (the white man's burden, etc.). I was completely swept away by the beauty of this book and Kim's journey of the spirit and identity. Wonderful characters, great insight into the sea of humanity that is India, great respect shown to people of all faiths with Kim cast as the Friend of All the World. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kipling's novel marks the advent of that most twentieth-century--and, some critics might argue, British--of genres: the spy thriller. At the same time, it is a pre-Forster and pre-Narayan peek at an exotic (to Europeans) and magical (if often idealized) colonial India, prophetic in its introduction of Indian lives to Western eyes. But, above all, it is an exemplar of late Victorian bildungsroman, the story of a young man's quest, torn not only between two cultures but also between the callings of the spirit and the demands of the world.Not incidentally, I was led to my reading of Kipling via scholarly studies of the works of Conrad, and \\"Kim\\" straddles the line between Dickensian mirth and Conradian realism, between romance and cynicism. The novel is better, I think, in its former guise: more convincing in the outsized characters it portrays than with the socio-political plot it weaves. Especially memorable are such characters as the oblivious but incorrigibly hallowed Teshoo Lama; the \\"iron-willed\\" Sahiba, known for \\"her failings, her tongue, and her large charity\\"; the patron-spy Mahbub Ali, who takes Kim under his wing; and the sorceress Huneefa, who accepts fees for \\"all sorts of exorcisms.\\" At the other end of the likeability spectrum is Father Bennett, a Church of England chaplain who peddles a \\"creed that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of \`heathen.'\\"Although some readers (especially young readers) have a hard time slogging through Kipling's occasionally elliptical prose and the formal archaisms with which he renders the speech of his native characters, I nevertheless wished I had read this as a teenager. At times, the novel recalls the popular adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson, which I also loved as a kid far more than I do now. Of course, one can't fault Kipling for building a bridge between the literary aims of nineteenth-century romance with those of twentieth-century realism, but his unique yet disorienting hybrid requires a suspension of belief that is a little hard to achieve as an adult. \\"Kim\\" is far more compelling for the fantasy it creates than for the reality it depicts."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The son of an Irish soldier is orphaned in 1800s India and instead of living in an orphanage or British military school he opts to live as a street urchin going on wild adventures mainly with a Tibetan Llama in search of a sacred river. Kipling lived in India for several years and was familiar with the landscape and cultures of India so he does a good job of painting a vivid picture of the place and time. Overall this was a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"A brief, gorgeous and kaleidoscopic picture of the &quot;great game&quot; in northern India. Interesting to read at the moment that India and Pakistan were engaging in the same great game on the same soil, with Pakistanis hijacking an Indian place to Afghanistan.Mom was wrong, I think, to treat Kim's whiteness as a minor betrayal by Kipling of his material -- a retreat from the more wholly Indian story he wanted to write. The whiteness is central to Kim -- Kim is like Leatherstocking a &quot;man without a cross.&quot;"},{"Title":"Kim","review":"The Recorded Book (unabridged version)was my companion on a cross-country drive. The story was so compelling I had to turn it off whenever the traffic was heavy. The book was full of generous-hearted people from different backgrounds, each making his own search, each trying to live up to his idea of the good. The book also gave a vivid picture of India during the British occupation. This book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"Kim is honestly a fun book. This is not to say that there aren't lapses, tedious mirings that swirl around the overall ebullient excitment, but these stem more from an excess of the author's wordplay than from anything else. The story is on the surface rather quaint: Orphaned British tyke grows up alone in India, has the internal wits and capacity to learn basic survival skills and has the ambition and sense of humor to make something of a name for himself. From there he meets a 'holy man'--not one in the traditional sense of Western (or even Eastern) literature, but here is more of a true seeker, someone not pulled down by the conventions of organized religiousosity, but one moreso looking for a one-on-one understanding of God. There is a great deal of subtle and transmogrified mythologizing--the traditional fables bowled over by reality, the high, idealistic hopes often stunted in birth by more rational and everyday life concerns. Kim, street-smart and wise before his time, is fascinated by the holy man's honesty and feels some compelling need to accompany the man on his random journies.Kim is the story of two journies, certainly the holy man's as well as Kim's own, the reckoning with cultural identity and the east/west clash in a time of subterfuge and war. It is really a quite powerful story, dulled down at times by the author's seemingly ceaseless wonder, but for a tale marketed as being about a white European lost in the maze of turn-of-the-century India, there is a great deal that is very contemporary and an enormous amount of action and even betrayal.Give it a go and read it to your kids. There are many valuable life lessons Kipling makes an attempt to teach and many wrong paths he explains to us all about taking."},{"Title":"Kim","review":"This is billed as one of Kiplings greatest short stories, and I must agree, Kim (little friend of all the world.) is for me a great story and as I am also a Freemason and a member of the Kipling society.

When I saw how many people subscribed to the magazine, I started asking people why they did. Inevitably, the answer was, &quot;For the cartoons.&quot; Since then, I have come to realize that The New Yorker is like the hall of fame for cartoonists.I became interested in this book after reading the excellent The New Yorker Book of Money Cartoons. I was a bit disappointed in this book by comparison, which explains the four star rating. While the cartoons are terrific, the book would have benefited from having a great introduction like the one that Christopher Buckley wrote for the money cartoons.There are 86 pages of cartoons and over 90 cartoons in this book. Almost all of them are outstanding.The humor is aimed at both physicians and psychiatrists. Somehow, the humor about the latter seemed funnier than the former. &quot;Does the doctor hug?&quot; was one of my favorites.The strong conservative bent of many physicians was well captured by one cartoon that said, &quot;Doctor, you must stop addressing your Medicare patients as Comrade.&quot;Lawyer humor, and the physician's usual conerns about law suits are here, too. &quot;The doctor's lawyer will see you now.&quot;The questionable bedside manners of some physicians and the quirks of patients were equally well represented in the cartoon that said, &quot;Well, Phil, after years of vague complaints and imaginary ailments, we finally have something to work with.&quot;The ever-growing specialization of medicine came in for comment in this cartoon: &quot;I'd like you to see a botanist. You exhibit many of the symptoms of Dutch elm disease.&quot;Finally, some humor was aimed directly at the profession. In a group of ducks, one says &quot;Let me through. I'm a quack.&quot;A strength of this book is that it will definitely appeal to patients and nurses. I also think that many physicians will like it, as long as they have a sense of self-deprecating humor.Physician, heal thyself!The book is excellent in pointing out that personal habits, the training of the physician, and philosophical opinions can interfere with delivering good medicine. Humor like this can be a tonic to help bust the stalls that those sources of misconceptions and miscommunications help create. Laughter is not only the best medicine, it can bring about better medicine."},{"Title":"The New Yorker Book of Doctor Cartoons","review":"First off, the book is tiny. I mean really tiny. It's about 3 inches square. You can't discern the mini size from the Amazon picture, so be prepared. And, correspondingly, the cartoons are very small and may be hard to read if your eyes are over 45 years of age.The editors have culled together what are ostensibly the most humorous of the doctor-related cartoons from the New Yorker. Because humor is in the eye of the beholder, I can't say if they succeeded. All I can say is that there were a few gems for me, principally those by Gahan Wilson and Charles Addams. The average entry made me smile a little on the inside, but not much more than that.The New Yorker Book of Doctor Cartoons can be useful if you are in the position of needing doctor related visual humor on a regular basis. I could see this book of value to people who give presentations about health care, doctors, or medicine. I could also see this book as a nice (but did I mention TINY) gift to give to the doctors in your life. Doctors who can laugh at themselves will appreciate the humor. I know. I laugh at myself all the time (and yes, I'm a doctor).While not about doctors per se, an alternative to consider is:The Party After You Left"},{"Title":"The New Yorker Book of Doctor Cartoons","review":"Perhaps it was my fault but I have given \\"New Yorker Books\\" of various cartoon subject matter in the past and have been delighted. This little book is tiny!! It's about 4\\" X 3\\" and not a quarter of an inch thick. I would have been happier had I known in advance. There is nowhere in the copy that alludes to this surprise. Many of the tiny little cartoons are very funny, however."},{"Title":"The New Yorker Book of Doctor Cartoons","review":"These books are quite tiny, as in pocket-size. The original hardcover is a standard size book, but not this edition, although the only difference in the heading is paperback versus hardcover. While poetry can be lovely in pocket size books, detailed cartoons suffer in the miniature edition. In the original, the cartoons are wonderful. Fabulous gift of laughter for someone who is hospital-bound, which was my intention, but this edition is too small to be fully enjoyed, especially by anyone with vision affected by age/illness. Oddly, even though it was only two weeks after receiving the books when I tried to return them (because they are just too small for the older patients for whom these are intended) according to the Amazon site these are only eligible to be replaced with others of the same item, these are not eligible to be returned for a refund. Peculiar because Amazon has been good about returns in the past. Go figure. So be careful to check the size listed in the fine print on each edition that you consider before you order!"},{"Title":"The New Yorker Book of Doctor Cartoons","review":"The New Yorker magazine has a deserved reputation for printing some of the funniest cartoons.

Nathan Hale is Connecticut's \\"official state hero\\", and has been frozen in time as \\"the patriot-martyr-spy of the American Revolution.\\" Well, the Nathan Hale that I know and admire was a twenty-one-year old kid with a desire to do something important for his country. Kind of like kids serving in the war in Iraq. What I appreciate about The Once and Future Spy is Littel's depiction of Hale as a flesh and blood, passionate, adventurous young man. While this book may not be great history, and I don't necessarily believe in the accuracy of its speculation about Nathan's doomed spy mission, I do appreciate it for thawing out this frozen icon a little."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"Anyone who has read The Company surely will be disappointed with this short novel. While it was a fast read, it was mostly unspectacular and the writing was poor."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"&quot;The Publisher's Review&quot; was kind to end its assessment of the book with, &quot;...but a little silly.&quot;&quot;Silly&quot; began about page five and reappeared frequently during the remaining 285 pages. We're looking here at &quot;silly&quot; at the high school composition level, and the plot is strained and worse even than the writing.This was copywritten 13 years ago, and Littell has become a somewhat better writer in the interim. I just finished his latest, &quot;The Company,&quot; and it was worth about 3 1/2 stars. I'll skip anything else by him.The old phrase, &quot;the book's not worth the candle,&quot; is too kind for &quot;The Once and Future Spy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"Robert Littell has written some of the best espionage novels ever, with \\"The Company,\\" \\"Legends,\\" and \\"The Sisters\\" rubbing elbows with the best works of le Carre and Graham Greene. With \\"The Once and Future Spy,\\" Littell has created a quirky little novel that keeps the reader on edge literally up to the last page.Littell is a master at creating unsettling tones in his books, and this novel is no exception. Our hero is \\"The Weeder,\\" a CIA-trained historian whose job is to weed through the chaff of the intelligence world - raw data - to find useful wheat - actionable intelligence. The Weeder is a computer whiz, and toils away in his SoHo loft utilizing a computer program that turns literally any phone on its cradle into a perfectly-functioning bug.The Weeder is also a man carrying a grudge - a former roommate once gave the Weeder's girlfriend some LSD, with tragic results. This former roommate is now Brian Wanamaker and also works for the CIA, but is up to no good. The Weeder has stumbled across Wanamaker's plot to explode a nuclear device in Iran but make it look like an accident caused by Iranian stupidity. Horrified by this betrayal of America's ideals - the Weeder subscribes to the Revolutionary War ethic of having our actions as well as our cause distinguish us from our enemies - the Weeder begins to send \\"love letters\\" to Wanamaker - correspondence letting Wanamaker know that the secret is out and to kill the plan.But Wanamaker is an ambitious, ruthless man, and so he calls in Rear Admiral Pepper Toothacher (Littell is wonderful with names) to \\"walk back the cat\\" and plug the leak. And Toothacher, armed with a lifetime of intelligence work, a pair of assassins, and a dark secret, begins the hunt for the Weeder.Sounds conventional, right? Wrong! This is Robert Littell, after all. The Weeder shares a fascination with American patriot Nathan Hale, and believes that they are long-lost relatives. The Weeder can fancy himself living \\"Nate's\\" life and become lost in the rivers of history. Littell tells Nathan's story expertly, but eventually the reader has to face the fact that the Weeder may in fact be a little nuts . . . is he imagining the whole thing?Littell keeps the reader jumping back and forth on the question of the Weeder's sanity up until the last page. Nothing appears to be what it seems, even in the last paragraph . . . or does it?I give this novel four stars merely because the story isn't as epic or sinister as Littell's best works, but that doesn't mean that \\"The Once and Future Spy\\" is anything less than a first-rate novel."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"Bottom line, I liked the premise and enjoyed the read - that is, until I reached the end. I confess, I don't yet quite get it. In six months, once I have had a chance to reflect on the book for a little longer, &quot;Whose truth, what truth?&quot; may help the book come into better focus. But at this point, I simply am not sure how to interpret the end. For instance, where did large parts of the story take place - in the &quot;real world&quot; or in Silas' head? What was Snow's motivation for doing what she did at the end - was she mistaken about her information (re: Huxstep) and more convinced that something wasn't quite right with Silas? Ambiguity is a given in the world of intelligence, but this was a bit too ambiguous for my tastes.Fellow fans, help me out. If you can, I may come back again and revise my rating upwards. If not, then let's let a 3-star rating stand for a good book make a little too complicated for its own good."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"I'm a big fan of Littell and it takes no further look than at TOAFS to see why.Essentially, the books is a parallel exposition of a secret operation by clandestine CIA operatives directed at a foreign power and also a look back at a historicql figure we all know, Nathan Hale. The connection to Hale is because of the obsession one of the operatives has with the Hale story.Littell is a huge fan of the \\"What you think is true is just a surface impression and not at all what is really there: school of writing. Another book of his, The Defection of A.J. Lewinter took that tactic to a dizzying level, and TOAFS is not too far behind. Fake-outs, games within games, and victims walking happily into traps of their own construction are at work throughout this fine work.What makes this a 5 star book is the way Littell tells the Hale story in way never heard before, offering a completely different perspective that causes us to challenge our view of history and what history even is. At the end of the novel, the reader realizes that he did the same thing with the contemporary story.As with TDOFAJL, there's a nice romance in here as well.People who have watched a lot of James Bond movies may think there is nowhere else for the spy story genre to go. Littell proves them dead wrong with this book.HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"A previous reviewer commented that the interwovcen tale of Nathan Hale \\"detracted\\" from the overall experience. I'd completely disagree, and found that it created an excellent parallel to the main plotline. He should perhaps re-read and see how it relates.Aside from that, it's a page-turner that I found to be more a conspiracy thriller than a true spy novel (but maybe because he's \\"reinventing the spy novel\\" as some of the cover reviews claim). It also felt quite believeable as I can imagine various administrations attempting something along the lines of the scheme occuring in this book."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"I read the book 3 years ago and just finished re-reading it yesterday.It has the fairy-tale quality I like so much in works of Cold War era writers - Graham Greene is the perfect example. The mythology is here - or mythologies since the book also deals with a patriot spy of 2 centuries ago. Sometimes the author seems to be unsure of our ability to draw the parallel and elaborates a bit too much on the things that are already evident.But later in the book Robert Littell goes to another extreme - he regretfully overcomplicates the ending, in a rush to make his work a kind of Chinese box - &quot;whose truth? which truth?&quot; - he shies from the possible and feasible happy end - and finishes in a hasty hopelessness.Still the book is very, very good in it's unique way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"How could the author of so great a book as \\"The Company\\" draft such a mediocre cliche-ridden effort as this. One reason, I submit, is that he couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a historical novel or a spy novel. He had a similar dilemma in \\"An Agent in Place\\" where he couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a love story or a spy story. \\"The Company\\" was a whole dimension above most spy novels. \\"The Once and Future Spy,\\" sadly, is simply a uninspired work. The plot was highly improbable, the characters lacked credibility, and Littell resorted to too many cheap plot tricks to speed the book along, at the cost of believeability. Even the whole theme of \\"whose truth?\\" also is not all that unique. Don't want to give the ending away so I won't say any more about that except that, personally, I found the ending to be highly unsatisfying. I still have a few more Littell books to read and I am hoping that I will get from them the deep pleasure I got from \\"The Company.\\" Littell's capable of much much better work than reflected in this novel."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"a sometimes bizarre book.Memorable and menacing characters from the best writer of cold war era novels. Impossible to easily define but very satisfying. Action runs between parallel exploration of espionage then and now but thats not the quarter of it.

The antidote to all the 'hunt the serial killer'writing-by-numbers."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"No, &quot;Weird&quot; is not a term usually associated with a book review, but it's difficult to think of a better one-word description here.This book is so convoluted, and much of it rather illogical,that it is hard to believe the same author has written thecomplex, detailed and fascinating book, &quot;The Company.&quot; This one must have been some sort of practice run.As we read through it, there are interesting parts, but we keepthinking as we go along that the author will surely bring it alltogether in a satisfying way. But he never does. There is anending of sorts, but the story never quite comes together. And many of us will not be wishing there was more, we will, instead,be wishing we had spent our time more profitably.The story, on the surface, is about an ultra-secret project bya handful of CIA operatives working outside even that organization, with the direction and approval of the Attorney General, and the aim of this project is to sow discord in theheart of one of our Muslim enemy countries, while also bringinginto disrepute everything that country stands for. A laudablegoal, and a very nice starting point for this type novel.But the author insists on intermixing with that story another,and parallel, story about Nathan Hale during our Revolutionagainst the British Empire. The Hale story is quite far-fetched, so it detracts rather than adds to the central theme.With the shifts in both era and story, this is not exciting, butrather distracting. Not a very well-put-together story and ultimately dissatisfying."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"Wanamaker ran a highly secret hidden Agency subgroup that devised a plot to neutralize the Iranian nuclear threat. Someone was tuned in to the scheme and wanted to stop it. They kept sending messages to Wanamaker letting him know the idea had been exposed. Was it the Russians? Wanamaker brought in Rear Admiral Toothacher (retired) to backtrack and find the leak. Turns out the leak came from a computer whiz, Weeder, who also worked for The Agency and had devised a very sophisticated program that allowed telephones sitting innocently in their cradles to give off impulses that provided key words that he could decipher. All he needed was the phone number to activate the program. Weeder had attended Yale at the same time as Wanamaker and carried a deep grudge against him. When he figured out the plot against Iran he wanted to stop it. From two perspectives (a) he hated Wanamaker (b) his conscience didn't want the CIA plot to work since innocent civilians would die. As a side plot, The Weeder was passionate about Nathan Hale and considered himself almost to be a modern day version. So there's a lot of back and forth between the present and revolutionary days in the story. I've previously read five books by the author An Agent In Place,Legends,The DeBriefing,The Sisters,Walking Back The Cat. My favorite was The Sisters. This was quite good in places. But parts were a bit unbelievable. Particularly towards the end when Weeder's female friend Snow got involved trying to save him. Still an interesting fairly quick read."},{"Title":"The Once and Future Spy: A Novel of Obsession","review":"This book displays Littell's genius at work. No it isn't 900 pages long. Instead it tells a story with eloquence and brevity.What happens when one rogue CIA operation stumbles acorss evidence of another rogue operation? The answer is obvious, a third rogue operation is commenced to plug the leak and find the leaker.That's the gist of the book without giving anyway any spoilers.This book is not going to take a long time to read, but when you turn last page you might ask what happened? Many things, but which were true and which were fiction?Once again Littell proves he is at the top of his game."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"So elegant and warm is P.D.

However, the lease on the property is almost expired and renewal requires unanimous approval of the three trustees, the adult children of founder Max Dupayne. The museum's manager Marcus Dupayne and his sister Caroline (a school principal) endorse the renewal, but the third sibling psychiatrist Neville wants to shut down the museum.However, Neville's nay saying comes to a quick end when someone kills him using the MO of a famous homicide depicted in the Dupayne Museum. His two siblings are not the only suspects because several people have the motive of keeping the Dupayne Museum open. A widower, Police Commander Adam Dalgliesh would prefer to investigate his growing fondness for Professor Emma Lavenham, but knows he and his Special Investigation Squad must conduct an official inquiry.The latest Dalgliesh police procedural is a solid British investigative tale that readers of the series and fans of the sub-genre will take pleasure in due to a strong cast of suspects. The story line moves forward as the Commander and his team make inquiries into a host of potential culprits each with viable means, motives, and opportunities so that the audience never quite knows who the killer is until the climax. The romance subplot never takes off and consequently is not a distracter from the lead protagonist working the case and fans don't get to see him move forward in his personal life. P.D.

James, I have one question: Who's been putting Xanax in the Baroness's coffee?Much of The Murder Room reads as though James is just too tired to flesh out the plot, the interviews, and the characters. Too much is told in summary, rather than scene. Even the obligatory horror story embedded in the middle is given short shrift, and I still haven't figured out the relevance or the details of the betrayal in the anti-Nazi underground group.But it's more than just the weary, phoned-in quality that bothers me. It's the drawing back from the painful consequences of murder. PD James has never been afraid of hurting (or killing off) sympathetic characters. Indeed, much of her appeal for me has always lain in her ability to show the humanity in all her characters, even the killers, while she nevertheless treats them with the ruthlessness the book demands.The Murder Room is different. The murder does not cause not nearly so much collateral damage as one might expect. Nor does Dalgliesh suffer personal loss during the book.The Baroness's characters may be happier now, but this reader is not."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"There are just too many coincidences and unbelievable incidents that mar this book.A bicyclist hit by a &quot;large car driving fast towards her&quot; is uninjured and fails to obtain information from the driver. Much later she goes to London for no mentioned reason and while there decides to go to the gallery in the House of Lords. She almost immediately recognizes the voice of the person speaking as the one who hit her.I presume the editor caught this and other unbelieable incidents, but it would have perhaps been difficult to make changes (after all James is 85) and still make the publishing deadline. In fact I would go so far as to say there could not have been a book if incidents such as the above were eliminated.This is probably James' last Dalgliesh book."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"PD James has been writing murder mysteries with Dalgliesh as her main character since the 1960s. I've owned this book for several years, but only just got around to reading it.The book and the series is not about Dalgliesh or his life. The book is about solving a series of ugly murders. His life, and the lives of his team are the background. I enjoy the fact that the ending of these books arrive with a reasonable, and fair conclusion.But mostly you read PD James for the language. If there are literary books out there, this certainly is one of them. And it is a very good example of a book where you are reading, at least part of the time, for the language."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The writing of P.D. James is very fine and has a depth & maturity that few other mystery writers have. It is thoughtful and measured but highly suspenseful at the same time. It has that \\" interiorness\\" that sense of place that has always been a hallmark of good English writing. There are also subtle criticisms of modern English society ( and Western society as a whole) and its increasing lack of morality. This is a novel that comes from the pen of a believer (refreshing in itself). The quality and depth of this latest James offering is in sharp contrast to the action oriented American mystery - even the very best American mystery writers don't hold a candle to the great English ladies of mystery - James. Rendell, Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Marjorie Allingham, Dorothy Sayers....I loved this book and couln't put it down. I hope she has another one in the works."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"It isn't even fair to list this book by PD James as a &quot;mystery,&quot;because that implies it lacks the depth to be considered a truenovel. But the author puts so much detail and emotion into thisstory, and she developes it so completely, it can't be anything else.PD James is such a careful, detailed craftsman, she spends morethan the first 100 pages just introducing the characters. Andit is worth it.The action takes place in and near a private, rather specializedmuseum on the outskirts of London, at the edge of one of the great parks, and as the police investigate, the mystery grows.The Commander is called into a meeting which includes some officials higher up than he expects, including representativesfrom Special Branch, MI5, MI6, the Ministry, and he is told hisspecial squad will be handling the matter. And before the original murder is solved, another takes place, and the policehave to expand their investigation.As happens, there are some side issues, with collateral actionstaking place involving some in the higher social classes, as well as at least one Diplomat, so the police are urged to solve the crimes without ruffling too many feathers while doing so.This author can bring together more divergent elements, while making it so smooth as to appear effortless, that it's easy toforget just what talent she brings to this type writing.This is a fairly long book, for a mystery, but it is gripping atall times, and it will continually engage most readers. It willdefinitely be difficult to put down. Don't start this book until you know you can devote some significant time to it."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The Murder Room is typical PD James material-perhaps a bit too typical if the truth be told. While there is always a bit of d&eacute;*j&agrave; vu with James, the continual focus on insular professional settings for her settings and interminable introductions t set up the action are beginning to border on triteness.What saves the day is James' usual literary finesse as a writer. A PD James mystery is an English mystery with a vengeance. All of the quirkiness and idiosyncratic mannerisms and behavior of the Queen's good people are on abundant display. Descriptions of the furniture are just as detailed and as lovingly rendered as the descriptions of the characters. The pacing is not exactly glacial but no one has ever referred to it as anything remotely related to \`fast paced\\". In other words, a PD James mystery is a book to be read and savored, not an experience to be slopped through.In that respect, this is a pretty standard James effort. The characters are well developed and sympathetically rendered. The mystery is fully developed and moves along nicely. The violence is properly muted but nevertheless unsettling. The procedural aspects of the investigation are reasonable and well detailed.There are flaws. James seems to be becoming ever more enamored of long and trifling descriptions of ever more arcane and musty institutions. She attempts-rather halfheartedly-to introduce a love interest for Inspector Dalgliesh that never really takes off and in fact adds zip to the story line. As I mentioned earlier, the introduction and set up process seems interminable-the initial action doesn't actually begin to get underway till somewhere about page 120.On the other hand, an average PD James book bests most others better work, so one cant complain too much.So, all in all, not a bad read but far from James best."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"James best books are psychological novels in a crime setting. In the very best of them, she combines clever plotting, a high level of writing and characterization, and sustained examination of a particular psychological theme. In none of these categories does James approach her best work. In most respects, this is a fairly standard mystery with above average writing. I suspect James was aiming at attacking a particular psychological theme, the idea of secret or hidden lives, but this aspect is not developed well. This would be a good effort for most mystery writers but not close to James best novels."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Each of the mysteries of P.D. James is actually literature and not for those who want a &quot;quick read&quot; or a lot of gunfire. This author is a master of the genre and uses it to explore the human condition. The characters are not simple cardboard cutouts who spout tough talk. These are well developed, thoughtful portraits that reflect humanity. From the beginning of the series to the present novel, it becomes clear why P.D. James is one of the most respected British authors. I have looked forward to and treasured each book and this is one of Ms. James' best. I envy those readers about to discover her."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I love her prose and how she builds up her story and characters. The ending was a bit of an anti-climax. One would have expected more. But as always, it was like good wine. P.D. James as always, never fails to please. She writes so well."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I've &quot;discovered&quot; PD James quite recently with &quot;Death in the Holy Orders&quot;. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is another excellent book based on the same proven recipe: the poet-turned-inspector Dagliesh with his less intellectual but decent team (one wonders why Elisabeth George abandonded the same proven recipe and got lost), an intriguing setting (in this case a fictional Belle Epoque Museum on Hapmstead Heath) and a well woven whodunnit. The fact that the structure of the story remains practically the same with previous books this does not make &quot;The Murder Room&quot; any less enjoyable. A well written book that is surprisingly modern and in line with current societal values. Most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James is 83-years old! Yet her newest book &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is one of her best. It is a hard-to-put down thriller with psychological twists and nuances, a James specialty.The DuPayne Museum, a small family run concern that specializes in the interwar years, is in danger of being closed. The lease needs to be renewed and all three Dupayne children must sign it. One, the psychiatrist brother Dr. Neville Dupayne, does not want the museum to continue. He believes in living in the present and not the past.Well, no surprise, he doesn't get to live in the future. Early in the novel, he shows up dead in his jaguar. Enter James's hero, Detective Adam Dalgliesh, the poet/murder investigator. As always he (and James) tries to solve the murder by digging into the souls of the suspects.And what a cast of suspects...the two remaining Dupayne children include Marcus, a cold civil servant whose career didn't reach expected heights, and Caroline, the sister whose passion is the museum and the swishy boarding school that she leads in her spare time. There is TAlly, the kindhearted housekeeper, whose life of intellectual curiosity in the city of London (visiting museums, taking courses), is supported by her job and her free cottage on the museum's property. Plus Muriel Godby, the efficient and annoying, receptionist/administrator who lives for the museum.Dalgliesh is obsessed by this mystery-as he has been by all in the past-though he is now juggling a love interest. I wish James had delved into this more in the book: she seemed to &quot;tack on&quot; a scene between the two of them as a satisfying way to end the book.However, fans of the mystery genre should savor this book."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Not everyone can write a thoughtful and sedately paced mystery novel and still make it a compelling and absorbing read. For that matter, not many mystery writers can get way with devoting about a third of their book to developing the characters of the suspects and murder victim, setting the stage, and imbuing the novel with the right mood and tone before killing off the primary victim. P. D. James, however, is able to pull all of this off and do so brilliantly. For readers more interested in flashier storylines, &quot;The Murder Room&quot; may not be the mystery novel for them; but if you enjoy a quiet, intelligent and sensitive mystery novel, than you'll be in for a treat.The Dupayne Museum, founded by Max Dupayne, is a private and small one dedicated to social and political history between the years of 1919 and 1939. Now, the issue of whether or not to keep the museum running has come up, and the board of trustees (made up of Max's adult children Marcus, Neville and Caroline) must decide whether or not to renew the lease. Neville is all for not renewing the lease and for closing the museum, much to the consternation of all those who work there. And because all three siblings must be unanimous in their decision to keep the museum going, it rather looks as if the Dupayne will soon close its doors. That is until Neville is murdered in a rather horrific manner. Called in to investigate the case, Commander Adam Daglish has a rather small pool of suspects to work with -- Neville's brother and sister, and the staff and volunteers -- all who, in one way or the other, were threatened by Neville's refusal to sign the new lease. Which one of the suspects decided to murder Neville in order to ensure the continued existence of the museum? If solving a perplexing murder isn't enough, Daglish must also face the unhappy truth that his job is getting in the way of his relationship with Emma Lavenham (whom we were first introduced to in &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot;)...I enjoyed &quot;The Murder Room&quot; immensely. I liked the manner in which P. D. James constructed her story, taking the time to set the stage, introduce all the characters (so that we knew them all rather intimately), before offing her first victim. I also enjoyed her prose style and the lyrical descriptions of London. The mystery at hand was an intriguing one that was intelligently told, so that if you pay close attention, the identity of the murderer becomes apparent after a while. Some reviewers feel that &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is not one of P. D. James's better efforts --I, however, don't think so. And having read a whole slew of substandard mysteries lately, I can ensure you that &quot;The Murder Room&quot; stands head and shoulders above all those books and is a thoroughly good and worthwhile read. And if I had one complaint, it was at the rather immature attitudes of Daglish's two sidekicks, DS Kate Miskin &amp; DS Piers Tarrant. How these two will ever fare without Daglish's wisdom and compassion I shudder to think."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"One morning, by chance, Commander Dalgliesh has opportunity to visit the Dupayne, a small private museum on the edge of Hampstead Heath. It deals with the inter-war years, 1918-1939, and its most renowned exhibition is The Murder Room, a display of artefacts and information on the most notorious murder cases of the day. However, within a week Dalgliesh will have cause to return to the Dupayne, but not for recreational purposes this time. This time, he will be investigating a brutal murder.Dr Neville Dupayne, one of the three trustees of the museum, it being passed on to him and his brother and sister upon the death of their father, is found dead in a burning car near the museum, in a scenario exactly mirroring one of the cases featured in the bizarre Murder Room. And there is no lack of people with a motive, for the Dupayne is coming up for renewal of it's lease which, under the conditions of their late father's will, must be signed by all three trustees or will become void, and Neville is the only one who refuses to sign. Yet there are several people whose futures have a strong stake in the future and continued running of the museum...Then, mere days later, another body is found, once again killed in an identical manner to one of the cases from the Murder Room...Perhaps not quite James's strongest novel, this is still a very good book, and will undoubtedly follow on the immense success of her last, Death in Holy Orders. As a novel, it is traditional in its form, but with James that means nothing, certainly not that you are in for anything like a &quot;cosy&quot; mystery. Content within the boundaries of the genre, she finds those limits not limiting at all, instead using them as foundations and support for an incredibly worthy novel that tells us much about the human condition and the society we, in England at least, live in. It is impeccably written (of course), socially interesting, with a strikingly strong sense of morality, and I doubt that there is a writer at work today who can more subtly but fully evoke a setting. Too, the eerie nostalgia of the museum itself is mirrored beautifully in both the story and the narrative prose itself.Her characters are incredibly strong and she draws them with almost astonishing subtlety; they slink from the page fully-formed and ready for our judgement. They range from the sympathetic to the cold, from calculating to warm. Never are any of them less than human.The Murder Room doesn't quite dazzle with brilliance like novels by Ruth Rendell, Peter Robinson, or even some of James' other books, but it is still an outstanding example of its genre, and it certainly proves that only British novelists can write perfectly about Britain. It leaves foreign imitators languishing by the wayside. It's an intelligent, very literate book which should please all her fans and lovers of such novels. In the end, she presents a solution that is very satisfying not for that it is a bolt from the blue, but for that it is entirely sensible. She has you working out complicated solutions to the mystery, then presents you with an entirely plausible one that you never really even considered, which is an admirable trait indeed in a world of fiction that is far too full of gratuitous unreality."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The lease is due for The Dupayne museum and it may not be renewed. Then the burnt body of trustee Neville Dupayne (whose vote will close the museum) is discovered in a flaming car, a crime that resembles one committed by Alfred Arthur Rouse back in 1930 and commemorated in the museum's Murder Room, an exhibit dedicated to sensational murders. Two more murders follow, each resembling a famous case. Commander Adam Dalgliesh is asked to investigate.The crime wouldn't normally be assigned to Dalgliesh and his Special Investigation Squad, but his bosses have their reasons for calling in the big guns. They say it's because someone at the museum has dealings with MI5. More murders occur, copy cats of crimes chronicled in the Murder Room. While trying to sort out all the suspects and their hidden stories, Dalgliesh patiently interviews people, sifts evidence, checks alibis and, of course, solves the case.Nobody delves as deeply into a character as Ms. James and she's at her absolute level best here in this book that is full of twists, turns, red herrings and mystery. Well, maybe there were just one or two, too many red herrings for me, and maybe a hundred pages or so, was just a bit too long to keep me waiting for that murder. But still, as usual, from P.D. James, a very fine book."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This is the latest in Ms. James' detective mysteries featuring Adam Dagliesh. I have read all the others and this one ranks near the middle of the pack. As is her formula, place is more important than time, people, or motive. Also per formula, the place is a forgotten, down on its luck institution with no obvious reason for existence. Ms. James then quickly dumps a murder on us, and then spends the rest of the book revealing a set of half dozen or so potential culprits.Murders take place in a museum devoted to the inter-war era of 1918-1939. Only a British eccentric would devote his energy and resources to such a pursuit. The museum contains some paintings, books, and other collectables from that era, as well as a room devoted to the great crimes.A convoluted family trust devised by the late founder requires all his children to agree to keep the museum in operation. When it becomes clear that one of the sons is inclined to shut down the place, he becomes the first, but not the last victim.Of course, everyone who lives off the museum has a motive to keep it from shutting down. But there are other motives; some of our characters have crossed paths previously in other failing institutions. It evens turns out that the worst excesses of the Roman Empire are being recreated in the room adjacent to the Murder Room.Ms. James has penned a good beach read here, another tribute to her idol, Dame Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The Murder Room goes over the usual P.D. James territory; a who-dun-it among a group of people, a mix of professionals and common folk, and the motivations and secrets of all the characters. James inserts her comments on the nature of our society today as well, especially through working class detective Kate Miskin, who despises the hypocrisy and smugness of the middle class liberals.Adam Dalgleish is the same as ever; austere, controlled, efficient, and sometimes ruthless. His second life as a poet always seems implausible to people reading James for the first time, but having read most of the Dalgleish novels it rings true with his character. There is a subplot with a love interest of Dalgleish's, but the who-dun-it plot is what captures the reader. James adds her usual twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. Her novels are always a pleasure to read, even if she does have an obsession with Yale locks. (Ever read a Dalgleish novel without in depth descriptions of locks and keys? Well, it wouldn't be the same without that I suppose).So there's a riveting plot, excellent character development, historical backgrond and a bit of social commentary. James does it again."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I am a huge fan of PD James and Adam Dagliesh, but this book just did not work for me. The characters were unappealing, the plot was unbelievable. I normally love mysteries that are slow-paced and build to a climax, and normally you can count on PD James for this type of mystery, but not this time. The book was boring, by the end I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted my time. It was so disappointing."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"which from me, says a lot, because my opinions of her books vary greatly. This book happened to follow another favorite of mine, Death in Holy Orders. She's on a roll. After the first 100 pages nobody had been murdered. I didn't care, I was so interested in the characters by then I wanted to see what happened to them. The setting for the murders and the suggestions of them being copycat crimes of killings during the 1920s and 1930s should arouse sufficiently creepy feelings. The later developments as to what is going on behind the scenes at the museum were great. A very stimulating read. What remains to be seen is how Dalgliesh and Emma make it as a couple. This is definitely in the top third of James's books for me."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I listened to this book on cassette (unabridged) and thoroughly enjoyed it -- there's something about reading a British book read by someone with a lovely British accent and acting ability that is particularly delightful. James has a slow pacing anyway, so having the book read to you allows you to savor the descriptions and not rush past them in the desire to find out what happens next.The plot involves a privately owned museum bequeathed to three siblings. In order to keep the museum open, all three must agree on this, but they're not of one mind on the subject. Needless to say, one of them ends up dead. The descriptions of place and characters are so well done that it's difficult to believe that they don't really exist.The literary quality of James's mysteries is very high, but people who want lots of action and a fast paced may not like this book. It is, however, a quintessentially British mystery and I look forward to the next of James's books."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"&quot;Murder Room&quot; is the latest Adam Dalgliesh mystery from the veteran writer, P. D. James. The setting is the Dupayne Museum, a small private institution near London's Hampstead Heath. The museum features British art and cultural artifacts from 1919 to 1939. One of the museum's more popular attractions is the Murder Room where sensational murders of the time period are catalogued in detail.Suddenly, the calm of the museum is shattered by a particularly brutal homicide, and Commander Adam Dalgleish is called in to investigate. Dalgleish and his team interview the heirs of the museum's founder, Max Dupayne, the museum's small staff, and anyone else who might shed light on the terrible tragedy. The police identify several possible suspects but, at first, no hard evidence points positively to a particular individual.Several fatal flaws mar this mystery. James's best novels are character-driven works with intriguing themes that explore the many facets of human behavior. With one or two exceptions, the characters in &quot;Murder Room&quot; are an uninteresting and unappealing lot, and the endless round of police interviews with these people makes for dull reading. It is too bad that Dalgleish's personal life plays such a small role in this book. More emphasis on Adam as a human being might have livened up the novel considerably.In addition, James includes many peripheral characters whose connection to the murders is tenuous, as well as a host of red herrings that are more irritating than challenging. Long before the book's conclusion, I found myself losing interest in the proceedings. Since I have enjoyed so many Adam Dalgleish mysteries in the past, I was very disappointed by the uninspired and slow-moving &quot;Murder Room.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Adam Dalgliesh visited the Dupayne Museum before a body was found there. A room at the Dupayne was called the murder room. The Dupayne specialized in things related to the nineteen twenties and thirties. In the murder room the most notorious cases of the interwar years were covered. There was a library with first editions. Dalgliesh felt the writers interpreted the interwar years more effectively than the visual artists.Marcus, Neville and Caroline Dupayne made museum decisions. James Calder-Hale served as an unpaid curator. He was writing a book. For a mystery story the characters are wonderfully rounded. The three Dupaynes, trustees of their father's estate and museum, failed to agree to sign the lease for the museum.There is a fire at the museum at a garage where a trustee's car is parked. The unpaid curator, it seems, works as an informant for MI5. Both Adam and the probable burn victim, Neville, drive Jaguars.

Don't waste your money or time with this one..."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I found this book to be horrible. I'm and engineer, so I'm not out looking for any hidden symbolism or themes in a book, I just want a good mystery. But this book had plenty of underlying themes that just annoyed me to no end. First and foremost, the author seems to have a love of Jaguars which she can't contain. Its Jaguar Jaguar Jaguar for the entire book. Sure, I understand that it does relate to the story, but jeez, who cares that everyone drives a Jaguar. Oh, the detective never gets into his &quot;car&quot;... no no, he gets into his Jaguar... she is very careful to spell that out every time. People either drive Jaguars, BMWs, or Mercedes in this book, or if they are poor Ford Fiestas and bikes... Thats it. The endless references to Jaguar and how cool it is made me sick and bored. Also, I love how there was no middle class in this book, people were either rich and crusty or poor as dirt... super realistic. And I love the attention paid to the characters' residences, the way how social standing and proper decoration were always explained in great detail, while the terrible state of the poor residences were looked down on. The author came across as a total stuck up rich upper crust old lady. I mean, seriously, every description was about upholding one's social class or the terrible state that poor people live in (and I don't mean terrible like we should feel bad for them, but terrible in how embarrassed we should be for them)... I'm embarrassed for the author, she's just not in touch with those not in her &quot;class&quot; seemingly. Another strange thing about the book was how all the characters had seedy backgrounds, and were somehow all interlated through tawdry dealings. I mean, very poor character development. Every character had something to hide, every character had a dark past... Not realistic at all. And the whole Emma subplot was pointless. I would say this is the worst book I've ever read, not because of the actual plot or writing style, but because the views of the author come across in her writing, and her views are just snobby and old. Not being a Lord myself, this book just ticked me off about how closed minded some people are, and how material.

James book I've ever read, and I enjoyed it immensely. The book is tightly-plotted and the story moves along at a nice clip. Most of the suspects are introduced early on in the story, and all of them had a motive for murder, making it challenging to figure out \\"whodunit.\\" I have to admit that when I read a mystery, I'm not very much into deep characterization of the main characters. I tend to want the author to focus mostly on the mystery or puzzle at hand and not go over the top with the main character's personal life and relationships. \\"The Murder Room\\" has just a hint of these secondary storylines, and I appreciated the fact that the author kept the story focused on the mystery at nearly all times."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"James gives us a very well written novel about a midly intriguing murder. James' writing is so good that one remebers why British detective novels are genre all their own. The characters are well developed and the plot is well constructed. My only problems with the book is that the murders are only marginally interesting, and that Dalgleish actually does very little \\"detective work\\". He seems to stand on the sidelines while the murder works itself out. We get very little view of his inner thoughts about the case."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James has a moodily delightful read with The Murder Room. The Room itself, part of a museum dedicated to the interwar years in Britain, is full of artifacts of actual historical crimes which become important in the murders which follow, as well as being an effective hook in the beginning of the book to lure the reader forward. This very concept was the driving force for a history buff, such as myself, to pick up the book and return to P.D. James after being away a number of years. The rest of the novel does not let this marvelous lead-in down. The twists come relatively fast and furious and while often unbelievable are just as often unexpected. The ending is somewhat of a let-down but with all the various turns and coincidences the plot had to sustain, it could almost not be any other way. A wonderfully atmospheric and gripping thriller."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS, the penultimate entry in the Adam Dalgliesh mystery series, raised the bar high for the latest, THE MURDER ROOM. HOLY ORDERS had revived the series, with fresh character combinations, plot tricks and the possibility of romance for the long-suffering policeman-poet Dalgliesh. The question begs, does THE MURDER ROOM measure up?One of James' strengths has always been critical description, both physical and emotional. Her invention of the museum that serves as the setting is cunning: an institution devoted to the inter-war years of the 20th century, collecting products and exhibits of art, literature, industry, and murders. The latter is not that far off an idea for such a museum: England has a fascination with intricate crimes going back centuries, and as one character states provocatively, murders have a style that befit their age. This setting alone is worth the price of the book.Plot-wise, James throws out the red herrings like a rotating sprinkler system set on high. If you've read her before, you know what she's doing. You tend to forgive her that. It's the characters in THE MURDER ROOM that I am not so pleased with. She has gone back to old stock: snotty upper class adult siblings, the women without whom, a younger adult generation that is hapless and without initiative, and the working class characters who get drawn into the mess created by the privileged characters.Dalgleish, though still sexy in an intellectual tortured soul kind of way all these years into the series, has lost some of this reader's patience and willing suspension of disbelief. In an age of cell phones and e-mail, he carries on a courtship a la the 18th century. That would be quaint but instead it is exasperating. It does, however, provide some tension up to the end, to see if it repels rather than attracts Emma, the literature professor he met in HOLY ORDERS."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Popular British author P. D. James never seems to run out of plots, situations and surprises - lucky for us! London born Emmy Award-winning actor Charles Keating gives a bravura performance of her latest Adam Dalgliesh mystery.Taking its title from one of the most popular galleries in the Dupayne Museum, &quot;The Murder Room&quot; proves to be one of the commanders most challenging cases as each step he takes in solving the mystery seems to distance him from the woman he loves.The Dupayne, a small private family owned museum located by London's Hampstead Heath, is bound for trouble as one member of the family is intent upon selling it and others are not. It's rather an odd museum dedicated to England between the wars (1919 - 1939). The Murder Room is a gallery full of artifacts representing heinous crimes committed during that time period.To sell or not to sell is not a mere family squabble,it's bitter conflict made even more so when one of the family members is murdered. Almost before Dalgliesh and his cohorts can begin their investigation another dead body is discovered. To make matters even more surreal the killings bear a strong resemblance to slayings commemorated in the Murder Room.Now, there are a host of possible suspects, including Museum staff, and a number of possible future victims. Dalgliesh must not only work with his usual intensity but he must work rapidly.P. D. James weaves another spell for mystery aficionados.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Except for a very few authors, I usually devour mysteries like popcorn. The &quot;Murder Room&quot; is above all a well-crafted novel and a procedural police mystery secondarily. I could not devour &quot;The Murder Room&quot; and found myself savoring P. D. James' written words, even to rereading some pages.James' descriptions of places, people and logistics open the mind's eye. James brings readers to her level via her words rather than writing down to them. If the reader has a map of London and environs in hand while reading the accuracy is obvious. People descriptions are very revealing and I learned more of and felt more keenly about AD and his team then in previous books. The end of the novel is riveting and smashing.I was disappointed with the basic premise upon which the crimes in the book were committed, although there were hints (clues) along the way. I only hope that James has more novels left in her!"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The usual detail on room decoration, depressed characters and dysfunctional families, without an inspired or original plot to support them. The crimes themselves, despite some attractive trappings, turn out to be flat and dull, while also implausible--a problem in a \\"realistic\\" crime novel. The characters mostly are the same stuffy, wealthy, well-spoken elitists we've seen before, too many times now, with the usual wrangle taking place over the attempted closing of some august and architecturally distinguished building. Dalgleish fans I guess are happy to see him romancing Emma, the only problem here is we don't see much in the way of romance. Their romance lacks any of the charm and appeal of the classic romances in James' much admired Crime Queen trio of Sayers, Allingham and Marsh. It's a shame, because one can tell from her personal appearances and interviews that James is a charming, amusing woman. Too bad she snuffs out these qualities in her books."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Adam Dalgliesh has been solving mysteries for P. D. James for some time now. There are something like fifteen of them, and like fine wine, each story appears when it is ready, not when a publisher needs more income. It has been some time since James' last ('Death in Holy Orders') and it was a great pleasure to discover 'The Murder Room' sitting on the shelves.If P. D. James were to be defined by a genre, then one would call her a specialist in police procedurals. But she hardly fits the mold. Commander Adam Dalgliesh, poet and detective, is not one to follow process, and the crime is likely to require both his fine and logical eye for details as well as his sensitivity to the nature of victims and suspects. 'The Murder Room' unfolds slowly, starting with over a hundred pages of finely detailed characters description and scene setting. In this case the crimes transpire at The Dupayne, a family run museum dedicated to England between the wars.The future of the museum is in doubt, as three siblings (Neville, Caroline, and Marcus Dupayne) squabble over the signing of the lease. As tensions slowly mount, one of the museum exhibits - on the murders of the times - becomes a source of inspiration for a killer. Dalgliesh finds himself faced with a case where there is no lack of suspects, but a great lack of hard evidence. Distracting Dalgliesh (if anything can be said to distract him) is his developing relationship with Emma Lavenham (from 'Death in Holy Orders').As always, all of P. D. James characters come quickly to life on the pages. You will quickly find yourself in sympathy with Tally Clutton, the museum's housekeeper. Not all are sympathetic, but it is amazing how vivid each is by the end of the book. James' books are never fast paced, and this one is no exception. There were a few early moments when I though the book might be getting away from the author. But gradually the story becomes harder and harder to put down as it moves towards a well turned finish."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I love all the Adam Dalgleish stories, and appreciate the detail about architecture, English side streets, London, etc, that the author gives us. The two murders that take place are presented with skill, but as one who looks for clues as to \\"whodunnit\\", I was stymied. Particularly frustrating was the indication in the late chapters that Dalgleish and his entire crew knew who did it...they just weren't telling us. Even on completing the book, and re=reading some of the last chapters, I still have no idea how the Commander identified the murderer. And why the murderer included some \\"copycat\\" details of the Murder Room was never explained, at least to this reader. As some other readers have said, I read the very last chapters more on edge about Dalgleish's appointment with Emma--would he get there or not?--than I did about the murder. Still and all, a very good read."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"If there is any criticism about P.D. James, it would have to be that she takes too long to write her books. There is usually a 2-3 year wait between books but when she releases one, it is something to be excited about. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is no exception and while it is not as lofty as some of her earlier novels, it is a taut little thriller and a delightful read. The first 100 pages are devoted to introducing the murder scene (a musuem) and a host of suspects. After the first murder occurs, it is not long before other victims start piling up! In addition to James' extraordinary attention to characterization, her descriptons of architecture, gardens, furnishings, etc. is wonderful. She truly makes the reader feel as though they are in the setting. It is obvious that James got her idea of an important plot event from a highly publcized film that came out a few years ago but no matter, the book delivers and fans should be pleased with this one."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"As another reviewer noted, the author takes her time getting started with the mystery. I was about 100 pages into the book and starting to tire of it when, finally, there was a murder. I question whether anyone but P.D. James could get away with that -- both with the editors and with readers. However, if you persist, the book is worth your time. I've been reading a lot of &quot;thrillers,&quot; and James doesn't set that kind of pace. But there were enough twists in the book, and so many good suspects, that I didn't guess the ending ahead of time."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I have read every mystery by PD James and have come to the conclusion that her creative impulse stems from a need to create slice-of-life portraits. She delves into her main characters/suspects and reveals them (usually) as psychically wounded. As often she creates sketches of minor characters. For example, a very minor scene depicts in great detail the relationship between the two women working at a clothing resale shop .Their importance to the plot is based on their receiving a consignment that includes the purse of one of the victims, but the amount of time devoted to them goes well beyond their significance in terms of plot. I can only think that James is fascinated by people for their own sake, with the murder mystery serving as a pretext for her psyco-social portraits of people living/surviving in 21st century England.On the other hand, she is much more circumspect when it comes to the motivations of major characters. Without giving anything away, I will say that I found the behavior of the first (and primary)victim to be cryptic. At the end, the motives of the murderer are also rather vague and ultimately left to the reader's interpretation.Some people love Dame James' approach to mystery--there is a palpability to the surroundings, to people's living and work spaces. There is a depth to the suspects and the detectives. If you are intrigued by all this, you probably know who you are and will enjoy Murder Room. If, on the other hand, you have a fondness for the Agatha Christie -185- page- or- less-whodunnit that gets you in and gets you out, you'll probably find PD James plotting too slow. If you have never read PD James, I would say this is a typical one, no better and no worse, so a good one to try.Personally, I'll always read the latest novel by PD James. To me, a sub-par PD James is still better than 90 % of the mysteries being written today."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"What a truly gifted writer. One of the greatest tragedies is what happened to England between the wars. The best and brightest of English society were killed in the criminally,stupidly engaged WWI...run by arrogant fools who used their young soldiers like cannon fodder. If you ever wonder why there are so many spinsters portrayed in Dorothy Sayer's novels, it is because the cream of English society were slaughtered in France...And those who survived came home gassed,ill,and often mentally broken. This absurd war was to support the Honor and Preservation of ENGLAND and the English Way of Life.(caps are ironic) I think the bizarre murders that the Dupayne Museum portrays in the Murder Room are symptomatic of the ailing society that England became in the 20's and 30's. James is a social historian in this book...the murders are almost incidental. Of course we must briefly endure the romance between Ms. Perfectly Beautiful and Kindly Emma Lavenham and Dalgliesh. Emma ain't no Harriet Vane.(Sayer's glorious heroine to Peter Wimsey) Where is Cordelia Grey? I'd even accept Kate Miskin. Another reviewer described it like it a Cary Grant movie. Great call. I think PD James sobbed into her hankie when she viewed \\"An Affair to Remember\\". Emma is soppy...and way too perfect for words. I hope James kills her off. I'd pay to read that. This book, never-the-less is STILL worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Police Commander Adam Dalgliesh visits a small museum whose major point of interest is a 'murder room' showing evidence from notorious murders that took place between the world wars. The Dupayne Museum, though, is in crisis. Unless the three trustees agree to renew the lease, the museum must be closed. And one of the three seems intent on refusing to go on. When Dalgliesh returns to the museum, it isn't because of the exibits. Instead, life seems to be imitating history and a new murder has duplicated one of those long-gone ones.Author P. D. James delves into her characters, giving us the details on the psychology and family history that led them to hold their current views and their current fears. Her descriptions of Tally Clutton, in particular, are fascinating and a joy to read.James's style makes MURDER ROOM a compelling read, but the story itself seems somewhat bloodless. James attempts to give Dalgliesh an emotional impact through a romantic involvement that is regularly complicated by the demands of his police work. But for me, Dalgliesh's 'love' seems uncompelling. Of the other police, Detective-Inspector Kate Miskin gets the most attention but she seems emotionally uninvolved with the case or with her life.If you're a fan of P. D. James's writing, you'll find MURDER ROOM to be a satisfying treat. Although I found the plot and characters to be somewhat light, the writing carries the reader forward and gives us an understanding of an England that P. D. James knows and, I think, loves."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"One thing about P.D. James that never ceases to amaze me is how she can fill a novel with unpleasant characters and somehow make you want to know what's going to happen to them. In THE MURDER ROOM, a specialist historical museum controlled by the three children of its founder provides the source of conflict and the scene of the crime(s). The offspring must vote whether to keep the museum alive or wind it up. Two of them are invested in its continuation, while one wants to get rid of it. The vote to keep the museum going must be unanimous-- so you know who victim #1 is going to be. After the murder, Cmdr. Adam Dalgliesh and his investigators move in, disrupting whatever might be left of normalcy for the museum, its owners, and staff.As usual, every character has a secret to keep hidden, and their efforts to keep private things private complicate the investigation. When a second corpse is found in the murder room (an exhibit in the museum), the pace of pursuit picks up, as does the feeling of doom surrounding the entire institution.There are plenty of suspects, but the story bogs down a bit in a strange sex-for-hire scheme that turns out to be one of the skeletons in the museum's closet. When the murderer is finally revealed, it's kind of difficult to figure out exactly what the motive was. Everyone else seemed to have much better reasons for committing the murders!While all this is going on, Dalgliesh continues to brood over his on-again, off-again love relationship with one of the characters from the previous novel, DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS. Will he or won't he? In the end, that ends up being more suspenseful than the murder mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Reading another P. D. James mystery is comforting. For, not only is there going to be a crime and its solution, there is going to be a fine set of characters with whom the reader can become acquainted, another extension of Dalgliesh and his staff of detectives, and another set of privileged people who give in to their basic instincts of greed.The Dupayne museum and the siblings who own it are just one set of complicating characters. For not only do these three have their personal differences and hang-ups, the sets of people who surround and service them espouse equally human needs at various levels. Even the most menial worker, is fleshed out in a full character development.The suspense is there, even beyond the classic red herring found, and there is a very human tying up of loose ends for the noble Dalgliesh.I especially liked the stalwart character of Ms. Clutton, the museum's maid, the onsite resident who faces each horror with remarkable strength and dignity, not unlike that which I suppose P. D. James might herself possess. Very strong, very British, mature and able to see the joy in a simple routine existence.One of the positive features of a P. D. James' book is her ability to integrate modern times into her work. These people are definitely a part of the real world of today's London, with its technological wizardry. But they also reflect the moral questions that currently infringe themselves upon modern life, whether they be subjects of child abuse, sexual licentiousness, poverty, parental discord, or dysfunction period, these folks represent the times of James' present world, not a simpler time of Agatha Christie.Simply put, I do recommend this book. Just the skill of James' literary style is refreshing. Her expertise in using just the right word continues to glean my admiration. Well done! Well read!"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James is 83-years old! Yet her newest book &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is one of her best. It is a hard-to-put down thriller with psychological twists and nuances, a James specialty.The DuPayne Museum, a small family run concern that specializes in the interwar years, is in danger of being closed. The lease needs to be renewed and all three Dupayne children must sign it. One, the psychiatrist brother Dr. Neville Dupayne, does not want the museum to continue. He believes in living in the present and not the past.Well, no surprise, he doesn't get to live in the future. Early in the novel, he shows up dead in his jaguar. Enter James's hero, Detective Adam Dalgliesh, the poet/murder investigator. As always he (and James) tries to solve the murder by digging into the souls of the suspects.And what a cast of suspects...the two remaining Dupayne children include Marcus, a cold civil servant whose career didn't reach expected heights, and Caroline, the sister whose passion is the museum and the swishy boarding school that she leads in her spare time. There is TAlly, the kindhearted housekeeper, whose life of intellectual curiosity in the city of London (visiting museums, taking courses), is supported by her job and her free cottage on the museum's property. Plus Muriel Godby, the efficient and annoying, receptionist/administrator who lives for the museum.Dalgliesh is obsessed by this mystery-as he has been by all in the past-though he is now juggling a love interest. I wish James had delved into this more in the book: she seemed to &quot;tack on&quot; a scene between the two of them as a satisfying way to end the book.However, fans of the mystery genre should savor this book."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"First things first, this is a good book. I'll come to the \\"but\\" part in a minute, but for the most part this is yet another solid entry in the long-running Dalgliesh series. With the private Dupayne Museum's future uncertain, one of the trustees is determined to see its closure. So when he soon turns up murdered in horrific circumstances, there is no shortage of suspects; nervous staff, Dupayne family members, and a mysterious unknown man seen fleeing the scene of the crime. But is the murder really connected to the closure of the museum, or is there a more personal motive?Long-term P D James fans will find plenty to like here, and all of the standard James devices are in place: a self-contained institution on the verge of radical shake-up, a ruthless agent of change making an obvious victim, a surprisingly brutal murder, plenty of plausible suspects, a number of clever red herrings, and some dark personal secrets that may or may not be relevant. Another positive is that there is plenty of personal development for the main characters; we follow Dalgliesh's complicated new relationship with Emma Lavenham, and there are hints of upcoming promotions for Kate Miskin and Piers Tarrant.My problem with the book is that the motivation for the murder (once revealed) feels quite weak. Compared to the motives the other suspects had, the final revelation seems the least likely, and to be honest is a bit unconvincing. Perhaps this is because the relationship that apparently drove the killing was not well developed or explained. And the revelation that Dalgliesh and his team know who the murderer is, without yet revealing this information to the reader, adds to the sense of frustration and confusion. The conclusion does make sense, but compared to the powerful endings of 'A Taste For Death' or 'Original Sin', this one did feel a bit underwhelming.Another potential issue is that the plot and structure of the book feel very familiar after 'Original Sin' and 'Death In Holy Orders'. The set up in the first 100 pages basically follows 'Original Sin' to the letter; swap the small, antiquated publishing house for the small, antiquainted museum and it could be the same book. While James' fans may appreciate the consistency in her approach, it would be nice to see her change the formula a bit.Dedicated P D James fans, of which there are many, will still want to read this, and 'The Murder Room' certainly is not a bad book. But it's not one of her best either, and that ending really is quite lacklustre."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"A Murder Room is certainly not P.D. James' best effort, nor is it Adam Dagleish's. Set in contemporary London, the book nonetheless has a particularly old fashioned feel to it as the murder takes place in a museum dedicated to the era between the two World Wars.While I understand the need to set the scene, and for the most part am not an impatient reader, I did think going 100 pages before a body even turns up was asking a little much of the reader. Especially when it is fairly obvious who has to die for the book to move forward.If you are a fan of James, and her lead detectice Adam Dagleish, you will probably enjoy this, as I did. But if you are spoiled by her earlier work and expect this one to measure up, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The Murder Room, P.D. James' twelfth of thirteen mysteries featuring Scotland Yard's Commander Adam Dalgliesh, is a satisfying addition to that character-driven series. For me, the main attraction to a P.D. James mystery has always been the way her excellent understanding of human psychology allows her to populate each of her novels with so many believable characters. That talent usually complicates her mysteries and keeps readers turning pages all the way to the end and, despite the fact that I listened to this one instead of reading it, The Murder Room was no exception.In London, a city filled with world-class museums, a tiny museum like the Dupayne can easily slip through the crack and, in fact, this one has. Devoted exclusively to the \\"interwar years\\" of England, the lull between world wars with which she was blessed from 1919 to 1939, the Dupayne specializes in rare first editions and artwork of the period. But over time its main attraction has come to be a room everyone calls the \\"Murder Room,\\" a space devoted exclusively to the sensational murders of those particular days. The room is filled with exhibits detailing the murders, including pictures of victims and murderers alike, and the few visitors who find their way to the Dupayne seem to spend most of their time there.But these are tough times for the Dupayne and the three Dupayne siblings to whom it belongs. It is time for them to decide whether or not to keep the museum open, a decision requiring the unanimous consent of the two brothers and their sister, and one that is starting to seem more and more unlikely to be reached because Dr. Neville Dupayne hates the very thought of the museum's existence and cannot wait to see it closed forever.When Neville Dupayne is found murdered in a manner similar to one of the more spectacular murders featured in the museum's \\"Murder Room,\\" Dalgliesh and his team are assigned to investigate. They learn soon enough of the animosity between Neville and his brother and sister, who seem desperate to keep the museum open, but those are only two of several people they interview who might have wanted to see Neville Dupayne dead. By refusing to continue the Dupayne Museum, Neville Dupayne was in the process of throwing people out of jobs, and even out of living quarters, so it was obvious that this cold natured man had enough enemies to complicate any investigation into his death.And things do get complicated when a second murder, which appears to be another copycat murder based on information found in the \\"Murder Room,\\" is discovered at the museum. The Murder Room is likely keep most readers guessing right up to the point the murderer is revealed - and beyond, because of the romance with which James closes this chapter of Dalgliesh's story.The audio version of The Murder Room is read by Charles Keating who is a master of British accents. His use of multiple accents and voice inflections makes the characters easy to distinguish from one another and was, I think, particularly effective in creating one of my favorite P.D. James characters of all-time, Tally, the lonely caretaker who lives in a small cottage behind the museum. Readers who have the time, and who enjoy audio books, would do themselves a favor to listen to this one rather than reading it. This was fun."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Well, it's a P.D. James novel so it can't be all bad...but in the first few chapters I realized that there were too many similarities to \\"Original Sin\\", the saga of the publishing-house family murders. By halfway through the book, I realized that I was becoming bored with the excessive description and lack of original action and thought. By the end of the book, I had to admit that I really hadn't enjoyed it...too little plot or meaning, too reminiscent of earlier (and better) works, too little Adam Dalgliesh, and worst of all -- too much gratuitous subplot material that raised the eyebrows but contributed nothing significant to the story (the pseudo-pedophile Major, Ryan's gay identity, the sex club, etc.) Dare I say that it was actually bordering on shallow? Well, I have always loved P.D. James so I won't go that far, but I must say I was disappointed. At eighty-four, is it possible that Ms. James is starting to run out of fresh stories to tell? If so, please let Emma and Adam go in peace, living out their happy new lives in fiction heaven."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I am one of those people who loves to read mysteries or espionage stories that are both fun and quick to read. For me, the ideal crime fiction novel takes four to five hours to knock out. I like the stock plots with the heroes from central casting.This is my first P.D. James crime novel and what a pleasant discovery it has been. The Murder Room is at the other end of the crime fiction spectrum. Whereas, Eric Ambler or Georges Simenon economically sketch out their tales, P.D. James takes the time to build the back story and flush out even the minor characters. James is not in a rush to tell her story. She has the patience and talent to elevate the humble crime story to another luxurious level.The Murder Room is a book to sit back and enjoy. There is no need to rush this pleasure. If you can afford the CD's, Charles Keating's great voice only adds to the sensory pleasure. All in all, a decadent treat."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"James lays out some stunning setpieces and intriguing themes in \\"Murder Room,\\" but it never quite comes together. I was hoping for more description of the inter-war years and psychological insight into Dalgliesh, but he becomes more like a chick-lit \\"white knight\\" in every book. James can't seem to get beyond his devotion for the annoyingly perfect Emma to involve him in any depth in the actual mystery. And some of the plot twists were laughable excursions into '70s style \\"decadence.\\" Please, I appreciate James' reluctance to indulge in modern serial killer butchery, but orgies just don't cut it as a \\"horrible secret\\" any more. In all, well written and diverting but far from her best..."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Having listened to the unabridged version of this latest story by P.D. James this past week, I was thoroughly entertained by her artful character development of all the characters. The setting is a minor museum dedicated to a short but disturbing period of 20th century history. The victim, while not shown in a very sympathetic light, was struck down shortly after insisting the museum be closed. His siblings only half-heartedly try to help the investigation, while continuing to protect their own interests, the museum. All the characters have their flaws, even the Inspector and his assistants, as they would in real life and P.D. James conveys this as well as any author I have read. The attention to the little details make this story exceptional in relation to other current mysteries. The killer is well concealed until the end of the story. This is one of the best Dalgleish mysteries I have read and strongly recommend this book to P.D. James' fans."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James is one of my very favorite authors, her stories are complicated and intelligent, but not burdened with lots of bad language or graphic descriptions of violence. I did think this book was weaker than her other books. I thought most of the characters were shallow and belligerent, the ones that weren't were hardly used. The narration was dull, I had difficulty telling the characters apart occasionally. The last chapter on the Commander's private life was oddly unsatisfying. I've always left the other books wanting more information on Dalgliesh's life outside of the office, but once I was given it, I was sorry I'd asked. It didn't seem to fit and it had the feel of a Cary Grant movie. Given the age of the author, I was left wondering if she wanted to tie up some loose ends with the Commander. If you are a fan already, you will like it, but overall, I was only *satisfied* with it."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This is another classic P. D. James mystery novel. At an age where many writers would be happy to lay down their pen (or switch off their computers) she still comes up with enthralling stories, vivid characters and plots full of surprises. Her acute observation of the human mind, foibles and reactions has sharpened with time.The story is set in an eccentric little museum in London and the Murder Room houses exhibits relating to murders committed during the 1920's and 1930's. The focus is on a trunk that once contained the body of a murdered girl. The family who owns the museum is divided over whether to close it or continue to operate it, but some of the activities in the museum are more - shall we say \\"unusual\\" - than others and many people would be negatively affected if it closed.Introducing characters in a mystery novel is difficult to do well, but James does it better than anyone. The reader is never left trying to remember if Neville was the doctor or the curator. She also introduces us to the peripheral characters who are affected by the crime, fleshing each one out rapidly, but leaving a clearer impression than most writers make with their main characters.This is a mature writer, still at the peak of her power to draw readers into strong stories and to make them care about characters who may be a little off-beat, but never the usual caricatures of the English. There is a richness of texture in this book. The investigators, chiefly Adam Dalgleish and Kate Miskin have gained some maturity and a measure of understanding of themselves as well as their suspects.I can recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a classic English mystery."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Seldom has such wonderful writing been attached to such an unmysterious mystery. I found myself wishing that Ms. James had skipped the mystery and just written a novel about the characters. The result would undoubtedly have been much more satisfying.Commander Adam Dalgliesh finds himself unexpectedly invited to visit an oddball museum, the Dupayne, which specializes in England between the two world wars. The founder has provided rare first editions of top novelists and representative paintings by the better artists of the time. Maintained as a private institution by the founder's children, the museum's most popular feature is the Murder Room, where the most infamous murders of the period are displayed. There's tension in the family though, as one of the children wants to have the museum closed.Soon thereafter, Dalgliesh has to call off a date with delicious Emma Lavenham, whom he met in Death in Holy Orders, to begin investigating a suspicious death at the Dupayne. MI5 wants to protect one of its own from being discovered so sensitivity is needed. Everyone on the team is quickly struck the resemblance of the crime to one that is featured in the Murder Room. What's the connection? Is there a copy cat at work here?The book's greatest strength is its powerful description of the Dupayne and those who serve it. You will feel like you have been to the museum and met the people there. The book has an extended beginning that gives you more than the usual detail about the most important characters. I felt like I had been invited to tea with them, and had a chance to settle into the story at a very leisurely pace. Of the major characters, both Ms. Tally Clutton, the housekeeper, and Dr. Neville Dupayne, son of the museum's founder, were quite memorable and convincing. Although the other major characters received a fair amount of attention, they did not come alive for me. Several minor characters received loving attention from Ms. James. I found myself wishing that their story lines had been more important.The mystery is vastly too easy to solve. You can start from any one of six or seven different directions, and come to the right conclusion. In addition, Ms. James provides an obvious clue in the first few pages after the initial crime is discovered. Shortly thereafter, the key clue also comes into play. Few readers will miss the key clue after having been alerted early by Ms. James to suspect the murderer. From there, more and more clues point to the murderer.I found myself wondering why anyone would have written such an obvious mystery. A police procedural would have been a better structure for this story. The only reward for finishing the last five-eighths of the book is to find out a number of salacious family secrets and how Dalgliesh makes up for the broken date with Emma.I certainly enjoyed the book, but it is the least favorite of mine within the Adam Dalgleish series of mysteries.After finishing the book, I thought about whether anyone would have enjoyed Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None if the murderer had been apparent after the first death. I think not."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I have read all the books written about A. Dalgliesh. Love them all.

Winters in Virginia get pretty cold for outdoor activities and curling up in front of the fireplace with a good book is a special joy."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"(mild spoilers possible)Having just finished reading \\"The Murder Room\\", I can now compare the first three consecutive novels of the 21st Century by Phyllis Dorothy James. That said, my rating is higher for \\"The Murder Room\\" than either \\"The Lighthouse\\" or \\"Death In Holy Orders\\". Why?Mostly, the suspense - my favorite aspect for mystery and crime novels - here achieves levels unseen at the other two.This is so despite the settings of \\"The Murder Room\\" (a small museum at outskirts of London park) being less attractive and spectacular than theology dorm (\\"Death in Holy Orders\\") or an exclusive/reclusive island (\\"The Lighthouse\\").Meanwhile, although the beginning of the novel is, as I said, rather mundane, and the reader has at first a bit of difficulty of telling one character from another, later on the characters get nicely multi-layered and the read gets more and more pleasurable. The romantic plot involving Commander Dalgliesh is also satisfying (finally), almost as much as the mystery itself.A very interesting twist comes with a second victim, which appears out of the blue and at first has no connection with plot - this is possible because of the open London settings.(spoiler ahead) Also to the credit of \\"Room\\", unlike in the other two books, the culprit here hails from the characters which are rather central to the story, not the second-circle ones.Overall, the \\"Room\\" ranks among the better James books, maybe on the level of \\"Black Tower\\" or \\"Death of an Expert Witness\\".By the way, I don't know why sex plays rather a significant role in Dame James' novels - given the fact that she's written the three books at 80 or later - either she likes Freud very much or just tries to appeal to the younger reading audiences (smile...)."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the book, anxious to read others. Difficult to put down once plot began to develop and enjoyed to end."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"You just can't beat p d James! SHE knows how to write. Her sentences intrigue me. I always feel I am there."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I've been a fan of P.D. James for several decades and am always impressed by her plots, insights, and the elegance of her prose. Adam Dalgleish is a curious detective who quietly looks into people and figures out who did it."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Often, when I start on a new (new to me, anyway) author of mysteries and detective stories, I will begin at the beginning and go pretty much straight through the list. I did that with Michael Connelly and Lawrence Block, and it worked just fine. But P. D. James's novels about Commander Adam Dalgliesh are different. The narratives are too dense and rich to finish off one and immediately pick up another. It would be like eating a quart bucket of caviar all at once. And James is no hurry, either. In this one, you're a quarter of the way into the story before the first murder takes place. But by the time it happens, you've already got a good feel for who the main suspects are going to be and what the motive is likely to have been. (Of course, you would also be wrong, but anyway.)The Dupayne Museum, located in a repurposed big house on the edge of Hampstead Heath in north London, was established by its founder to tell the story of the inter-war years, 1918 to 1939, and since old Max's mostly unlamented death his three children have been it's trustees. Marcus Dupayne, a retired civil servant, is about to take the reins from his sister, Caroline, partner in an expensive girls' finishing school. And there's Neville, an overworked psychiatrist, who, for his own reasons, wants no part of the museum. The thing is, all major decisions, including the acceptance of the new lease, require the signatures of all three, or else the museum will close. Marcus and Caroline insist that it must continue; Neville is adamant that he won't sign, that it's time the Dupayne was shut down. The other principal characters are all employees of or volunteers at the museum -- especially Tally Clutton, the housekeeper, who lives in a cottage out back, and Muriel Godby, who runs the office and is especially close to Miss Caroline. The author introduces you to each of these people and gives you their background and lets you into their heads and they become entirely real. And then Neville's Jaguar, stored in the museum's garage, is found wrapped in flames one night and there's a dead body in the driver's seat. Is it Neville? Was it an accident? Suicide? Murder? Certain people at the Dupayne have high connections, which justifies calling in Commander Dalgliesh and his Special Investigations Squad, and the well-tuned investigative machinery swings into action, with DI Kate Miskin, DI Piers Tarrant, and Sgt. Benton-Smith all doing their thing. The story then becomes largely a police procedural, but this ain't the 87th Precinct, and these people each have their own lives, ambitions, problems, and struggles. Dalgliesh has an important problem, too: Since the previous book, Death in Holy Orders, he has become involved with Dr. Emma Lavenham, a lecturer in English literature at Cambridge, and he's trying hard to establish a permanent relationship with her, but he keeps having to break their dates when important cases call him away. How much longer will Emma be able to put up with this? Will one of them have to sacrifice a professional career in order for them to be together?As always, James tells a gripping story with a well-thought-out plot, and does it in an intellectually satisfying narrative style that just wraps you up and carries you along in the current. But I'll take my time and wait for this one to settle in before I pick up the next book. It's only fair."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I am glad that I read this book, but it's not the best crime thriller and for those used to great things from P.D. James it's a little disappointing.Few crime writers do character development as well as James, but if she'd just reigned it in a little this book would've gone from good to great. We don't need to know the history of every little side character. Also, the motivation for the central murder was not convincing.Overall: 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I love P.D.James for being an authentic in real life status and experience in what she writes about; employed at a high level in criminal justice(home office),judge and BBC governor.She moves with the high movers and rollers in english soceity and even knighted as a baroness for services rendered.With her piercing eyes she can see through and into people, a woman's gift perhaps, and move in the world of powerful men an equal if not more(and before her times)This formidible grip on life is conveyed between the lines in her writing.So when i feel confused or stressed at times in my life she's what i read to calm and direct me with her soundness, with what comes across as, Whatever the situation in life, there is a way through, through her special intelligence. Indeed Dalgliesh can be seen as a projection of herself in the way he's right out there in the thick of life and in authority yet holding a very private artistic even mysical, in its intuitive grasp, inner world.At some time in her books there is an allusion to sheer cosy order and security at home whilst outside,for example, the dawn may be bleak,coldly damp or spitting with rain, heavily overcast, London hostile and alienating in its impersonal inhumaness at times (and why the stoicism and dark humour of the Londoner). And the cosyness is a therapeutic island of confirmation amongst the weavings of her sheer soundness and authority during the book.Yes there is something stilted and formulaic in plot and narration in each book. But rather like being able to watch episode after episode of Law and Order, it doesn't matter in the least. Its merely the coat rack to hang a very intriging well-made coat.She is a writer who matured over time so avoid her earlier books and some of her later ones are better than others.(I'm not up to listing as not read all and some of ones i did were too long ago to be sure of the titles)P.D.James a wonderful writer.She has conciseness and preciseness in exactly what she wants to say so the pace is a joy to read,yet no skimping on detail and tinged with some poignant descriptive imagery at times."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P. D. James just gets better with the years. With the Murder Room she has fine-tuned her ability to suck the reader into her settings, and bring them to care about the characters. This is nothing like any other contemporary mystery or crime novel in that she has given so much thought to the smallest, finest detail, that she is more satisfying to read than perhaps anyone else in her genre.Take a small, insular organisation such as the DuPeyne Museum and its odd but special little community, some of the most interestingly drawn and named characters (Where else could you find people named Tallulah Clutton and Muriel Godby?), then throw them into a glum daily life drawn to a halt by a gruesome murder. This would be enough to keep the reader interested, but we are also given the pleasure of the favourite detictive, Commander Adam Dalgliesh - detective, intellectual, poet, Romantic - James' and my favourite crime solver. AD as he is known in New Scotland Yard is like no other detective. He is subtle, listens, asks questions and observes quietly, always taking note of the subtle little nuances that may or may not help to reveal one of his suspects as a killer.Like all of the others, the Murder Room is written with a mastery of the English Language that cannot be found in much of what is being marketed as \\"literary\\" and always adds to the story itself. A couple of pages into it and I even started feeling English, thanks to the style and mood of the author's writing. It all comes together so nicely that before you know it, you really do feel like a fly on the wall of a London murder scene.\\""},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"PD James elevates the whodonit to literary and psychological levels. My favorite of her many mysteries are those featuring Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgleish. James limits her cast of characters and the list of possible suspects by setting her crimes within circumscribed boundaries: the staff of a village church, the walls of a convent, the employees of a publishing house - this time it's within the wall of a museum devoted to British arcane of murders that took place during the years between the two World Wars.Then a new, modern, and all to real murder occurs, and Dalgleish, with his own history and quirks, is called in one the case. The victim is the museum's owner, a man whose siblings objected to his desire to sell it. James creates characters that rise above the cardboard outlines of those in most mysteries; she adds sinew, flesh, and real live personas with souls to the bones.And, a surprise twist, there's a love interest for Dalgleish himself in this book! Readers who have followed his career since he first appeared within the pages of PD James' books will feel compelled to read this one as a way of continuing their affair with the charming, tortured, and enigmatic detective."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The Murder Room PD JAMESP.D James has done it again. I think this is the 18th time she's done it. She is an extremely talented storyteller with prose like honey! Often you read her work and you forget your reading and feel as if your watching a play or movie. And as always her settings are unlikely places for murder and violence. I suppose these are the qualities that distinguish her murder mysteries from all the others. This book is all about real people and emotion and is not to be missed for the mystery enthusiast.

Buckland, Editor."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This was my first reading of P.D. James. It was a bit of a slog, because I expected to get right into the investigation of a crime. But Ms James spends a lot of pages developing the settings and characters. This she does very well. Then the crime occurs. Well, I appreciate a writer who is willing to provide some solid material to be read and who assumes that a reader who picks up a book has the time to read for awhile. I can see how readers accustomed to the frantic pace and shallow characterizations in most modern police novels would grow impatient. I usually enjoy books by English authors with English settings and characters, so this novel suited me well.I must say, though, that Adam Dalgleish is a bit of a cold fish. My prior acquaintance with him has been via the TV series featuring Roy Marsden and currently Martin Shaw. I thought they must be overlooking something that would make him interesting. Not their fault at all. His activity seems limited to hovering about calmly and then in the last reel (chapter) revealing the killer's identity. He has no apparent idiosyncrasies to lend him some color. He's said to be a poet. No evidence is given. Maybe in James' earlier books some of his work is transcribed for our assessment."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James is a fine writer of stories that happen to be about murder. Her characters are very interesting--and there are always, of course, many with means, motive, and opportunity--or it wouldn't have any mystery. This particular tale starts our slowly but (after about 100 pages) shifts into high gear and is thereafter difficult to put down. There are some interesting nuances for the Dalgleish series concerning staff promotions as well as Dalgleish's romance with Emma (from the prior book \\"Death in Holy Orders\\"). I like the continuity, but would prefer more depth to the relationships. The extensive detail given in the first part of the book does not include much on these relationships amongst the police staff. The Table of Contents is actually interesting here because it lists a chapter for each of 3 victims. So you know before reading word one of the book that there are 3 victimes--BUT, it turns out the most suspenseful part of the book concerns a red herring of who the victim is. Don't worry, I wouldn't dream of saying anything else on this. The author throws in some sudden new characters/events out of the blue, includes some difficult to believe events (car smashes bicycle but no one is hurt & etc.), and unlike Agatha Christie (my favorite, I admit), doesn't provide (at least I couldn't see it) all the clues necessary to solve the case. Maybe I missed something? There didn't seem an explanation of how Dalgleish figured out whodoneit. I don't have any problem if it's subtle or I just can't figure it out, but the answer should be evident at the end. Frankly, the suspense regarding Dalgleish's romance (with a dearth of detail) is greater, IMHO, than the murders. Still, it's a fun read and better than most contemporary mysteries--which also fail in providing the necessary and sufficient."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This was the first P.D. James novel I've ever read. I read mystery novels when I'm simply too tired to read anything complicated or heavy in subject matter. However, this book is not in the same vein of mysteries that I've read before (Barbara Vine and Martha Grimes are other authors who are excellent and who I also recommend). Its a book which makes you think, though its not intellectual. This mystery is one of many books which feature the detective Adam Dalgliesh, though you don't necessarily have to have read other books in the series in order to understand what happens.In this excellent novel, Dalgliesh visits an obscure museum in London dedicated to the years between the two world wars. In it, there's a room which features sensational murder cases of the 1920's and 30's. P.D. James's books may seem frustrating because it takes a lot of time to get to the actual murder. But James proves to her readers that describing the time and place, as well as the people involved, is central to the plot of a mystery. Therefore, the psychology of the crime is crucial. In The Murder Room, over 100 pages are dedicated to setting things up. It only gets better from there on out.This novel is incredibly breathtaking; unlike other books in this genre, you really can't even begin to guess what happens."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"James is one of the few mystery authors where the mystery aspect of the story becomes secondary. I love her character development and her descriptions of places and events are so superb that I am willing to forgive what the story lacks in suspense. This book is a comfortable read that allows the reader to become part of the cast of characters."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"It was with great pleasure that I saw the Murder Room on the bookstore shelf. Other mystery authors release one good book and then quickly seem to lose the spark. This is not true of James, who has been writing intelligent and solid mystery novels nearly as long as I have been reading them. A new book from her is always an occasion for a small celebration of reading pleasure.The Murder Room returns to two of her favorite themes-- history and obsession. The Dupayne Museum as a setting for crime provides a bit of both. Its focus on an the years between the two great wars makes it a little pocket of nearly forgotten history. By contrast, the collecting ways of its founder and the decision to found a murder room from the period lend this quiet dusty place more than a hint of obsession. These two elements play out as well in all the characters: the obsession of a man who is determined to get back family mementos; the obsessive friendships that can develop between women; a son trying to leave his history behind; an unknown mother who holds her private and public histories tight to her chest. Even Dalgliesh himself is not immune, as a new love makes him think back to his own history and attempt to define which things are really important to him.James is never a small writer. Her books tend to have a wide range of characters with complex personal histories. This said, Murder Room had an unfortunate disjointed feel, resulting from too much of this same complexity. There were a few too many interesting elements. It felt as though had she focused more, there would have been a deepening of the book and its themes. As it was, there were so many plot elements associated with the characters that at times it felt like a great big basket of red herrings. A few red herrings are not bad, but a tangle is never good.Still, the flaws should not detract too much from the reading experience-- particularly not for long-term fans of James. If you have not read any of her novels before then I might pick up Cover Her Face or The Skull Beneath the Skin before starting with this one."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The Murder Room PD JAMESP.D James has done it again.

Buckland, Editor."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This is my first book by the famous author P.D. James. I am certain that she has much better novels.The opening 95 page introduction is a bit disturbing, and many readers will be tempted to stop reading and throw the novel away before page 100. She uses a Jane Austen approach to introduce the characters before any action. The difference with Austen is that Austen can do it in 50 pages, stop, and then begin an interesting story. James tends to write on and on. But, it is similar to Austen. Prepare yourself for a slow read until you are in the rythm of her prose. Some of her technical descriptions seems slightly out of date or wrong, but that is okay.From there, the book improves and we have a murder somewhere about page 120 to 150 and then the police enter the picture. The next 100 pages or so the tempo increases and we have an excellent novel. Commander Dalgliesh and his team enter and conference around page 220, after a very brief appearance near the beginning of the book, and it is quite interesting to see the famous detective at work.But then we have a second murder and 7 or 8 new characters after page 300. Each new character comes with a lengthy introduction until we have perhaps 20 primary characters, and then the whole novel seems to spin out of control. This gets worse beyond page 400, and by page 500 the reader is left shaking their head, even laughing at the book. The original crime is solved by a highly improbable event. Is this possible? Can such a famous author write this mess?Adding insult to injurt, James writes on with her complex prose for another 40 pages after the murder is solved and the book is over.This is a basically an excellent 300 page book captured in 550 pages of dense prose. It needs an extensive edit to remove dozens of filler pages and to take marginal characters that just clutter up the story. Then it will be a good novel. Most characters are interesting and the story is good, but there are too many characters. The structure and the number of characters is wrong. Also as a reader, I found the brief comment at the beginning of each section very annoying, since it reveals the plot direction of the section to come.Overall, this is a literary train wreck, hence just 3 or 4 stars for this book."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Knowing the author's age, and remembering the last, unsatisfying work of dear Agatha, I was worried that this novel would fail to please. No such worry. If it does fall short in any way, it is only in comparison to her finest work. It does get off to a slow start, with a multitude of characters introduced. I was tempted to take notes.Her prose is beautiful, as always. It's almost a waste that she spent her career writing mystery novels."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"At one point in \\"The Murder Room,\\" P.D. James's latest (its copyright date is 2003), and darkest, police procedurial yet, her detective, Scotland Yard Superintendant Adam Dalgliesh, expresses the hope that the case his squad is working on won't be much publicized because of other (unspecified) events that are going on.How daring! Ms. James almost seems to be mocking the cozy conventions of the traditional British mystery she's the Grand Mistress of. It's as if she's saying to her readers, \\"with all this stuff going on the world today, how important is my latest novel in the overall scheme of things?\\"Important enough, I submit, to satisfy all her fans. After all these years the author isn't afraid to take a while--a long while--to establish the scene, a small family-run museum devoted to the history of the UK in the years between World War I and World II, along with the characters who will become suspects (a lonely, self-absorbed and obsessed lot), and their motivations. And it takes place in late autumn, with darkness falling in late afternoon, which adds to the overall gloom.The title of the book stems from one of the exhibit areas in the museum. It's called the murder room, and it displays details of some English murders of the inter-war period (Ms. James, in her introductory note, informs us the murders actually took place), and it might be that the murder is attempting to re-enact one of them.Predictably, the victim (and he's far from the usual dolt you're not sorry to see check out early) is the one all the suspects have reason to want out of the way. The story is told from multiple points of view, which aids in the way the author presents her clues, and she never cheats.Notes and asides: Emma from \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" returns for an encore. Has Dalgliesh found love at last? Perhaps in the next novel we shall find out."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I had grown tired of PD James because she seemed to peter out about three quarters of the way through her novels. So many of her novels just ended with a pop! rather than a bang!This novel is different however. Not that her endings aren't still a bit weak (once again she provided a reason behind the crime that is never explained) but this book is so well written, most of the characters so well described, that I felt a sense of contentment when I finally turned the last page. AND she had kept my attention through a 4-hour plane ride! Unusual for me.I do get the sense however that she had to leave out a chapter because her editor said it was too long and then she forgot to go back and rewrite the bit that introduced that chapter."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James wrote her latest book, The Murder Room, like pure literature using atmospheric settings and literary writing to come up with this clever mystery. The book is about a family who own a little museum called the \\"Dupayne Museum\\" located in a mansion away from local tourism. Murder Room contains photos and exhibits from some of the most notorious crimes committed from 1919 to 1938. The Dupayne family patriarch created this exclusive museum; however, shortly after his death, his children have an impending deadline where they must decide \\"collectively\\" whether to keep the museum open or close it. Shortly after they discuss this, murders start to happen.I liked this book because of the intricate writing and the historical information about murders displayed in the Murder Room. Moreover, it lets you reach into the dark recess of the mind of the numerous characters. Though this is a dark, long and deep mystery book, it was an astonishing read. This mystery presents various themes (i.e., family, trust, survival, revenge) that are prevalent throughout the storyline.Some of the reasons I didn't enjoy the book was the plethora of characters that all had ample reasons to commit the murders. Moreover, because of the length of the book (492 pages), it took considerable time to read, but I was committed to enjoy and finish the book no matter how long it took. Furthermore, and this may just have been in my copy, the unnecessary word hyphenations in the middle of sentences drove me crazy! Publishing editor, where were you?Overall, Baroness James has done it again. Therefore, if you loved her prior books, you will love this one. I recommend that you set aside some exclusive reading time for this book so you can truly enjoy the plot. Take time to listen to the outstanding narrative and suspenseful plot and let the story do its job.

James is in top form with her latest Adam Dalgliesh mystery, \\"The Murder Room\\". James' mysteries are always well-laid out and intricately woven with a wide cast of characters. She likes to begin her novels introducing all the characters in the novel, giving motives and means to each one, making the puzzle of who's guilty and who's innocent ever harder to figure out.The title room is set in the fictional DuPayne Museum - a museum dedicated to the interwar years and doomed to close if all three trustees, the DuPayne children, don't agree to keep it open. And when Neville DuPayne, the one trustee who wants to close the museum, is brutally murdered on the premises, Adam Dalgliesh and his special investigation team is called in to solve the case. As they interact with the lives of those who are a part of the museum, Dalgliesh and his team find themselves investigating what appears to be a series of (...)murders, mimicking the cases that are incorporated as exhibits in the Murder Room at the museum. All this while, Dalgliesh is distracted from the task at hand due to Emma Lavenham (whom readers met in \\"Death in Holy Orders\\"). Their developing relationship has constantly been interrupted due to Dalgliesh's job commitments, and he fears that she won't love him enough to stick around.As always, James' narrative shifts focus between her numerous, vivid characters, and is peppered with literary and philosophical references. For those who are wary enough to pay attention, she even gives us the keys to figuring out the puzzle as to who the murderer is. If there's one downfall to \\"The Murder Room\\" I believe it's that enough time isn't given to Adam and Emma's relationship. She appears at the beginning and end, and intermittenly in Adams' thoughts: since she is an important development in Adam's life, readers want to get to know her better - especially by the end of the book.

One feels one knows the characters, especially Tally Clutton, a housekeeper who lives in a cottage on the grounds of the Dupayne Museum. The Dupayne is a small, family run, specialty museum in London whose fate hangs on all three trustees signing a new lease. This sets the stage for murder.

The museum is mostly known for its Murder Room. A room depicting notorious crimes of the era. The deaths being investigated are similar to those depicted in The Murder Room. Dagliesh must determine if these are merely copycat killings or if there is a darker more personal motive at play.James has populated THE MURDER ROOM with interesting and quirky characters. We have a trio of siblings who are at odds on whether to continue the museum when the lease is up. There is also the loyal secretary with no life outside her work, a lonely housekeeper who has taken a young troubled gay man under her wing, a curator with military ties and a volunteer who in her youth was a spy.Dagliesh's love life is also moving forward in this book even though not too many pages are devoted to it. It was nice to see his personal progession.P.D. James can be counted on to give you interesting characters and a superbly written intricate plot. She does not fail here. The one weakness in the book is that the action does not start until well after 100 pages.Quite frankly the set up was boring and my mind started wandering several times. Once the first killing takes place, the pace picks up considerably and the book then becomes a page-turner. I love the Adam Dagliesh series and while I do not consider this the best book of the series, I was not really disappointed. The last of the book made up for the rather slow start. Overall, it was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The story set in a museum with no lack of suspects! The story is well designed to catch you, then keep your interest for the duration. She sets out all the characters, and boy are they characters! While the several of characters are very quirky and have serious personal issues, they are well developed and they all have obvious motives to do away with the victim. After having introduced the characters and set the stage, she springs an excellent yarn that challenges your deductive reasoning to its limits. There are lots of surprises and a few 'red herrings' along the way. Adam Dalgliesh does his detecting once again with a humanity not always seen in detective stories and with a personal relationship at stake. I strongly recommend this story to fans of P.D. James, as it is well done and the climax is unexpected, at least to me."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"PD James, &quot;a&quot;, if not &quot;the&quot;, grand dame of English mystery literature, has given us yet another in the Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh series. Fundamentally police procedurals, James' novels typically employ very solid character work and evocative scene setting to channel our thoughts and imagery along many more lines than just the &quot;whodunit&quot; plot at hand. Making some allowances for our author's 83 years of age, we find some of the familiar setup work and drawing out of personas as in her earlier writing. But the plot per se is like a long and somewhat tiring game of &quot;Clue&quot;! Set in an obscure DuPayne Museum, dedicated to art, literature, and criminal murder activities of England between the two world wars (talk about a narrow niche), we soon become all too familiar with the limited cast of players, almost for sure one of whom is the villain, presuming some crime is in the offing. It takes a full 100 pages or so before a murder occurs to get things moving, and before it's over, a second murder and a third attempt happen before the perpetrator is ID'd -- who then makes things easy with an almost immediate confession. A mysterious driver leaving the scene is one of a few red herrings not cleared up til near the end. And a small sub-plot involving Adam's fledgling romance with college prof Emma, and whether marriage is on the horizon, is almost as compelling a mystery as the central story, despite the very few pages devoted to it.We feel this is a good book but not the best of the author's efforts. The middle book gets really dry, yet Adam's love life difficulties could have added a lot of fun and human interest had it been given more air time. Some of the familiar sidekicks, especially faithful Kate Miskin, seemed to get shorter shrift than usual somewhat to our dismay. While we are more than glad to see PD back, and generally enjoyed the &quot;Murder Room&quot;, this book leads us to fear there may not be too much pizzazz left in the aged pen."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James is by far the best mystery novelist around. Her writing, plot and character development are unsurpassable. This book is no different. It's powerful and suspenseful, and a true psychological thriller. There are a lot of copycats out there, but none can touch Ms. James. In this book Dalgliesh investigates a gruesome murder at a small private museum. This museum is dedicated to displays of art, literature, pop culture, etc. in the years in Britain between the two great wars, and one of the displays is a \\"murder room\\" where information is set out about infamous murders that happened during this time in English history. When the first murder occurs, it looks like a copycat from one of the earlier murders. Before Dalgliesh and his team can solve the first murder another body turns up which reinforces the copycat theory. Dalgliesh manages to solve the cases, but not before we see a lot of unexpected complications. James can magically transcend genres and she accomplishes that brilliantly with this novel."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"Any P.D. James is preferable to no P.D. James and while some readers may have found &quot;The Murder Room&quot; faint in some areas, Dame James' latest Adam Dalgleish is, well, Adam Dalgleish. How can a reader go wrong?Granted, James has given us a new twist (Adam is in love and her traditional police procedural takes a different turn. But before one cries &quot;soap opera,&quot; &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is not about Adam Dalgliesh's personal life. It is about a series of murder, a plot outline with which James is quite comfortable and her legions of fans come to expect.Circumstances surround the undertakings (forgive the pun) of the Dupayne Museum,, a small, rather esoteric, museum devoted to the &quot;interwar years,&quot; the period in England from 1919 to 1939. However, the rub is that the lease on the museum is about to expire and the three trustees (siblings) must agree totally on its extension or else the museum cannot continue. One brother, Dr. Neville Dupayne, is dead set (forgive the pun again) against signing; thus the demise of the museum is at hand, it appears. Quickly into the book, the good doctor is found burned alive in very suspicious circumstances and just about everyone has a motive for seeing him dead. Commander Dalgleish and his team from New Scotland Yard are called in and before this death can be solved, two others follow, all with connections to the museum.James clearly is in charge of this narrative and, as always, controls the pace and the revelations of the investigation. Dalgleish is, as always, superb. The resolution comes not through histrionics or melodrama, but the James/Dalgleish penchant for brilliance.Is this James' best? Hmmmm. &quot;The best&quot; is probably the individual reader's personal choice, as I've yet to read a &quot;bad&quot; James, or even a &quot;poor&quot; one. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; joins the other dozen or so Dalglieshes comfortably. It is an excellent read. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I hate to give any book by P.D.James less than five stars, but as mysteries go THE MURDER ROOM is not one of her better books. She gets four stars from me because even on her worst days James is better than most of her fellow mystery writers.James strength lies in her character development, and as ususal, in THE MURDER ROOM she has done a wonderful job of getting into the heads of the principle players and sharing their &quot;secrets&quot; with the reader. James also has a great talent for setting the stage and if you like being transported to England via armchair you should know that no one does it better--probably why the dramatized versions of her books are so well done.However, plot development has never been James strong suit. She often has difficulty linking the murderer's personality with the motive to kill. Her characters seem like ordinary human beings, but sooner or later one of them does something horrendous which seems all out of character and &quot;overkill&quot; for someone who could probably figure out a better way to get on. Maybe that's the nature of murder--stupid.However, for James, it's almost as though having created a fully rounded character she has difficulty connecting her creation with the act of committing murder. Sometimes she pulls it off, other times not. When she fails, the end is often frenetic and stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point.I will always read James' tales because I appreciate her philosophical insights acquired over a long life lived in interesting times.I bought the hardcover version of this book, but I am recommending to friends that they buy a used book (if they don't borrow mine), check the book out of the library, or wait for the soft cover. The price is too steep for the contents within."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"The latest installment in the Adam Dalgliesh series, \\"The Murder Room\\" is classic P.D. James. As some previous reviews have correctly pointed out, there is nothing new in this book. As a reader, the appeal of P.D. James is not the search for something new, but rather the confidence of a high quality, well written mystery.\\"The Murder Room\\" is set in a privately held, small, family museum that focuses on the interware years of 1919-39. The title refers to one room in the museum that features infamous murders from this time period. As always, P.D. James fills the book with interesting and complex characters--two dysfunctional families, loyal caretakers, mis-guided youths, and of course, New Scotland Yard. Sex, intrigue, loyalty, and of course, money, create alliances between some characters while pitting others against one another.Although the reader knows the murderer is likely to be closely connected to the museum, P.D. James leaves the reader guessing until quite close to the end. The detailed character development, and the way the words lead the reader to envision the atmosphere of this country museum will keep you entranced until the end."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"I have long felt that P.D.James was the heir to Dorothy L. Sayers in constructing the intellectual murder mystery. Her characters and plots, revealed in her uncompromising formal use of the language, has set her apart from most of her contemporaries. Murder Room, however, reads as though it was written by committee. The plot and central characters are unquestionably James' but the setting and early character developments read as though they were assigned to a college literature class then edited by the author. The first one hundred pages are laden with contrived metaphors that distract from the flow of the story. It is as though Ms. James tried to expand a concise l50 page story into a 300+ page novel by adding minutia to every discriptive developmental scene. Even the avid followers of Adam Dalgliesh have difficulty recognizing their hero in this book. One understands that he is in love but he seems to stumble onto the solution of this mystery instead of painstakingly putting together disparate pieces that lead to a discovery. His personality is altered just enough so that long time readers detect a difference. Having written this, however, I concede that the conclusion (to the mystery not the book)is definately P.D.James. She puts the pieces together in ways that are both rational and revealing (though predictable)and then sends Dalgliesh in uncharacteristic emotional turmoil to thrust a letter into the hands of his lady and then stand mutely aside to await her acceptance or rejection. James could have written the ending either way and remained consistent with what we have learned over the years about Adam Dalgliesh."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D. James doesn't write cutting edge thrillers like she used to (she's in her mid-80s for heaven's sake...even Agatha Christie got tired eventually), but she still has her grip firmly on the heart and mind of the inimitable, desirable Commander Dalgleish. The crimes in question take place relative to the \\"Murder Room\\" at an obscure little museum on the outskirts of London. I wasn't transported by the story, which involves murders staged to resemble those in the Murder Room, but I sure did like a chance to be in and around the mind of Dalgleish the Poet once again. I loved dear old Tally, the solitary caretaker, and wished with all my heart that someone would pay attention to her. Alas, this is not a dynamic book, but it is a good, fairly quick read for a nice weekend afternoon. And Lady James sure seems to know a lot about naughty things for a nice old grandmother!"},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"This is not only the latest P.D. James book, it is also her best work in some time. She has gone back to the core of her work, to murder and to Adam Dalgiesh, the Commander. He is still at Scotland Yard and the book is still about people that come into contact with a murder and how it affects them. In contrast to several other very good writers writing today about their continuing characters, Adam Dalgiesh shows no sign of becoming a private eye, and this is a very good thing for us.I think that what I really like about P.D James is her gift for expressing apparently intuitively an insight into the core her characters. She knows what makes these individuals run. They each react to the intrusion of a full scale police investigation in a believable fashion. These individual reactions of each of her characters are different, but they are so incredibly nuanced that they are seemingly real. It is as close as you can get to a fictional person. You feel that the author actually knows these characters as people, and what they think and how they feel, each of them. They are not stand ins for the author.I do not remember if she has been doing this for a while, but there were several words in this book that I admit that I had to mark to look up later. An example of this was the word \\"etiolated\\" at page 244. I had never seen the word before and had not an idea what it meant. Merriam-Webster OnLine says it means: \\"1 : to bleach and alter the natural development of (a green plant) by excluding sunlight; 2 a : to make pale b : to deprive of natural vigor : make feeble.\\" That makes sense and given the context it was clear enough, but there were six or seven of these words that I finally had to look up one after the other - it was fun.But it is not for the words that I read P.D. James, nor even for the characters, how ever well and completely presented, rather it is for the writing, an example: \\"He was after all, a poet with a writer's interest in the fabric of other lives.\\" at page 243. That is to me a beautiful sentence, and in context it is close to perfect. It expresses the poetic side of her major character poetically, and talks of the author as well. It is multifaceted. It is elegant. It is prose carried to the edge by an author in full command of her arsenal of words. But the book itself shows an author in full command of her story as well, and that is special too."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"For fans of P.D. James' intricately developed mystery novels featuring her protagonist Scotland Yard Commander and part-time poet, Adam Dalgliesh, &quot;The Murder Room&quot; will most certainly feel like familiar territory. It doesn't set any new standards, but it tells its story well, if not remarkably. People looking to try out P.D. James for the first time might do better to start with another of her works, quite possibly &quot;Death In Holy Orders&quot; or &quot;A Taste For Death&quot;.&quot;The Murder Room&quot; begins with Dalgliesh immersed in thoughts of trying to balance his busy work schedule with a relatively new romance in his life with Cambridge professor Emma Lavenham. His thoughts are soon interrupted when he happens across an old friend who is doing research at the Dupayne Museum, an aging structure at the edge of Hampstead Heath, which devotes its entire inventory to the British inter-war years of 1919 - 1938. There is one room in the museum, the Murder Room, which houses archival photos and some artifacts which relate to some of the grisly crimes commited within that era. Dalgliesh and his friend visit the Dupayne and, a week later, one of the three siblings who runs the museum is found burned to death in his car. Thus begins the murder inquiry, headed up by our estimable Dalgliesh and his underlings Kate Miskin, Piers Tarrant, and newcomer Benton-Smith.P.D. James writes two kinds of murder mysteries. One starts off with the murder right away. The other waits for about 100 pages, arranging up the plot, the characters, the setting, and the motives. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; falls into the latter category. The author is great at developing the details of her characters' lives, and makes no exception in this novel. All of the main players are carefully drawn, and often times sympathetic. I truly felt bad for the first murder victim. James's description of place, one of her strongest talents, also does not fail here. You get a wonderful vision of the Dupayne Museum, of the cottage of Tally Clutton, the museum's cleaner, and of Cambridge in the autumn.There are some things that count against the book, unfortunately. I didn't mind the first murder coming after page 100, but so much of what came before seemed so obviously to be set-up, that it became a tad distracting at times. Many of the characters in the novel, more so than in James's previous works, come across as rather depressed or, conversely, trite. It made for a bit of a downer. Dalgliesh's right-hand-woman, Kate Miskin, who in previous novels seemed to be growing and becoming happier as a person, is in this book sliding back into some rather blunt eruptions of bitterness. I found this disappointing. Dalgliesh's other main helper, Piers Tarrant, has angry outbursts in every other chapter. Most disconcerting. Also, the book consists of quite a few red herrings, which is not typically James's style. If what she typically presents in other stories does not directly relate to the murder itself, it will usually provide some sort of meaning to the other characters and plotlines involved. That was not so much the case here.&quot;The Murder Room&quot;, despite its flaws, is still a good novel. I went through it relatively quickly, and enjoyed the read, despite some of the oppressively darker aspects. P.D. James is a superb novelist and, at 83, she proves that she has lost none of her masterful literary capability. The prose is excellent. The plot is adequate. It is only a standard entry in James's long and illustrious writing career, but it is head &amp; shoulders above many of the modern mystery novels out there today, so it most definitely recommended to fans of the genre."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"There is no better murder mystery writer than P D James. She is without doubt the absolute best and the reigning queen in her given genre. There isn't a single James book I haven't read and not enjoyed. \\"The Murder Room (MR)\\" is no exception....so if I seem unduly critical of her latest, it's only because I've grown accustomed to her usual high standards and can't help but judge its merits against her very best works.Adam Dagliesh as romantic hero in MR may be poignant only to James' fans. Newcomers are likely to find Dagliesh's new guise oddly irrelevant. Colleague Inspector Kate Miskin shows her slightly bitter and cryptic side and though it's not always a pretty sight, it's a contemporary reminder that the effects of the English class system haven't completely worn off. The characters that populate MR are typically Jamesian, hard, cynical, and ruthless and there's none more unpleasant than Caroline Dupayne, one of the three trustees of the Dupayne Museum, whose fate depends on whether the trustees agree to carry on. That woman chills your blood and wilts your soul. There are also the usual damaged people who make excellent suspects (eg, Tally, Muriel), so once you've met them, you know you're in familiar territory.MR doesn't offer anything new but at 83, James shouldn't be expected to deliver anything groundbreaking. Though I enjoyed the book immensely - her writing is never less than sharp and exquisite - the plotting, I felt, was a little weak and ultimately unconvincing from the second murder onwards. There are too many red herrings in there, suggesting a lack of cogency in plot development. The identity of the murderer, when it is revealed, doesn't surprise though the motive isn't remotely commensurate with the violence and viciousness of the crime.Enough with the negative comments. There's always integrity and quality in James' work as she is never less than erudite in her research. Despite the above criticisms, MR still makes a rivetting read and you can do a lot worse than picking up a copy and finding out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"A complex crime involving scheming people of various classes who are not necessarily what they seem. That's the hallmark of a P.D. James novel and exactly what she serves up here. I loved the setting: a museum devoted to the Inter-War years that features a Murder Room chronicling the most heinous crimes of that period. A copycat killer seems to be on the loose, slaying two people in one night and then going after a third. Now in her eighties, James is in fine form, her writing as tight and deep as ever. This feels like her intended end for the Adam Dalgleish series since she gives him a happy fianc&eacute;e at the close."},{"Title":"The Murder Room: An Adam Dalgliesh Mystery","review":"P.D.

Since then I've read a few more of his novels and haven't been so impressed. I almost gave up hope that perhaps Tau Zero was his only great work... until I came across The Star Fox.A fantastic Poul novel! Early space opera- short and sweet. Hesitant earth lets a colony fall to conniving aliens. The main character Heim says, \\"Oh oh... hell no! Not while I'm alive! I'm gonna go mess 'em up.\\" And does so. Chapters 1 and 3 are pretty much part of a linear story and would have been a 5-star read if it hadn't been for the second chapter, which is out of place. Chapter 2 by itself though would have been a good story. However, it turned itself into a superfluous bridge. Overall, fantastic planets, plotting and people."},{"Title":"The star fox","review":"Poul Anderson was famous for decades for writing hard sci-fi, with a good deal of violence even if it were not mil sci-fi.He also wrote some fiction and fantasy about \\"the northern thing\\", set in various real or imaginary Dark Ages settings resembling northern Europe.He seemed, to me, anyway, to have two layers of writing. One, to be uncharitable, would be called \\"potboiler\\" and the other his serious work. Dominic Flandry and the Polesotechnic League stories would fall, in my view, in the first. Avatar, Orion Shall Rise, Boat of A Million Years, in the second.I preferred the former. The work I--although nobody I know has ever agreed with me--think of as being in the serious category was not particularly appealing, although Orion Shall Rise had some interesting situations.Anderson's first categories had lessons relevant to the times. Appeasement doesn't work (Star Fox). Decadence will cost you an empire (Flandry). Socialism is soul-destroying and ruins economies and human freedom. (Polesotechnic League)Star Fox has three main parts, each of which would be a decent novella, except for lacking a conclusion. The first is when the Bad Guys take a human colony. It's not just any colony. Anderson takes his beloved French countryside and makes an entire planet something like the Loire Vally with the French Alps on the side. The hero, Gunnar Heim, decides to buy and outfit a ship in order to go privateering against the Bad Guys, since the Terran government will do nothing. We see the man, his decision, his manuverings, the opposition in the United Nations.The second part details the visit of the ship \\"Star Fox\\", to a planet where it would be loaded out with weapons not allowed to Heim by the Terran government. There are troubles galore including a trek across a hostile landscape. But the weapons are gained and then the Star Fox sets out. Strictly speaking, this part is not necessary, but is interesting.The third part tells about the fighting, the talks between the representative of the Bad Guys and Heim, the work on the occupied colony planet, and the eventual victory.Anderson does his usual superb job of setting scenes. I believe he once said that he rereads his manuscripts and, if he doesn't see a mention of a scent, odor, smell, fragrance, he puts one in. This is apparently the reason his characters are forever smoking pipes, drinking whiskey, smelling blood and spices.It works.If the book was to be an allegory about resisting evil regimes, it was at a time when the US' interest in such things was ebbing, even before Jimmy Carter.Highly recommended, even if you're not in the market for an allegory about current events."},{"Title":"A to Z of Mathematicians (Notable Scientists)","review":"If you are a math lover, this is the book for you.

Although there are numerous books on the market aimed at beginners, the fine art of observing is something that can't be written about. Or can it? Deep Sky Observing is a book, that while maybe not able to actually give you experience at the eyepiece, lets you glean the knowledge gained by the author over the course of 20 years of observing. Coe has written a book unlike any other astronomy text I've read. The book is written in an easy to read style that will answer many of the questions left unanswered by the other books you may have read. Coe does not try to impress the reader with his knowledge of technical jargon; he instead lets his experience pass along the lessons he is trying to teach. His style will actually make you laugh in a few spots. When's the last time a book on astronomy did that?The book is arranged into 19 chapters. Each chapter title asks a specific question we've all asked (or wanted to ask). Coe then attempts to provide the answers in the body of the chapter. This approach works well as you don't necessarily need to read the book in order. It also makes the book a valuable reference long after its first reading. The first eight chapters answer questions the author has obviously learned the hard way. This first half of the book is worth its weight in practical advice on things I've never seen covered in depth in other texts. Advice on selecting observing sites, accessories and organizing of time and resources is insightful and useful and will go a long way to making your observing experience an enjoyable one.The middle chapters (9-14) are the bread and butter of this book. This is where the reader will benefit most from Coe's vast observing experience. Each chapter is dedicated to a particular type of observing target, and after a brief introduction on what you're observing, Coe presents his observations of various objects. He uses these observations (including many of his own eyepiece sketches) to advise the reader of what to look for in these objects and how and when to best observe them. After reading each chapter, the reader will have a new appreciation for the detail to be seen and will most likely want to re-observe many of the objects they've already seen just to apply the techniques Coe presents. Careful study of Coe's observations will help the novice decide what objects are best viewed tonight, based on expected seeing and telescope size.Coe devotes the final chapters to helping the reader grow as an observer. Discussions on binocular observing, Computer resources, Other books and public observing sessions will help the reader find tools needed to develop his/her skills as an observer and enable them to get the most out of the hobby."},{"Title":"Deep Sky Observing: The Astronomical Tourist (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"Steve Coe is well known in the Arizona amateur astronomy community. His exuberant personality has enlivened many a club meeting and star party, and his great sense of humor really comes across in his book &quot;Deep Sky Observing&quot; as well. While there are some tips on equipment, the book is mostly a guide on &quot;how to use that equipment to view and enjoy a variety of deep-sky objects&quot; (galaxies, nebulae and star clusters), and includes Steve's actual observing notes and his own sketches of each object as seen through a variety of apertures during his 20-plus years of observing. As someone whose entire output of astronomical artwork consists of two crude sketches, I can personally attest to the amount of effort that must have gone into producing the dozens of fine sketches reproduced here. Many of the objects are also shown in photos taken by Steve and others. My only major complaint is that the 373-page book does not include an index, so finding a particular object in the book takes a bit of page-flipping. &quot;Deep Sky Observing&quot; is not only a handsomely-printed guide to a cornucopia of intriguing objects, it's like sharing 'scope time with a friendly and knowledgeable companion."},{"Title":"Deep Sky Observing: The Astronomical Tourist (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This is a good book that contains many helpfull tips for the more advanced beginner.Not recomended if you have just starded down the road for astronemy, but once you nowthe basic, this is one that you need on your \\"Must have\\" list over astronomical littrature."},{"Title":"Deep Sky Observing: The Astronomical Tourist (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"Steve Coe has always been a favorite author of mine in his monthly columns on the net and in various journals.

The 30 lessons are divided into six sessions with suggestions for individual and group study, including facilitator notes. Each three-page lesson consists of two relevant scripture passages, and includes the author's reflection, two or more discussion questions, space for making notes, and a prayer. In about 100 pages, the author introduces Jesus under such names as the Carpenter, Rabbi, Prince of Peace, the Good Shepherd, the True Vine, King of the Jews, Bridegroom, among others. This unique approach to bible study is tailor made for those who are pressed for time yet wish to deeper their knowledge of the Word of God."},{"Title":"The Names of Jesus","review":"Wonderful to use for group study or personal use.

But I am beginning to see a theme here - affairs with the boss and unexpected pregnancies! I'm starting to have sympathetic morning sickness! As usual, I judge them against similar books since they could never hold a candle against other substantial romances and definitely not \\"brilliant\\" in my opinion.Olivia gets dumped, and then decides to turn the tables on a man. Not just any man - her boss, the rather conservative Lewis. He, too, is suffering after the breakup of his marriage. The rather mousey Olivia drops all her inhibitions with a few glasses of champagne at the office Christmas party and proceeds to seduce Lewis after they slip off to his office. As the alcohol wears off, Olivia is horrified and regretful. They both part to go on Christmas holiday with plans to \\"forget it ever happened.\\" -- No such luck since Olivia finds herself pregnant! Lewis (after much persuasion on his part) manages to seduce Olivia back before finding out about the pregnancy. His (almost) ex-wife shows up once and insults and belittles Olivia. Since Olivia figures Lewis is on the rebound, she refuses his offer of marriage. All he cares about is the baby, right? How long will it take until he breaks through her defenses and convinces her he really does care?There were some good secondary characters. Lewis's mother was great and promoted Olivia's independence, as long as she was independent nearby with the grandchild. Olivia's family was great too. For once, both main characters had normal loving childhoods - yea! (I was beginning to see a theme with that in these too!). These all seem to take place in Australia so there are a few words unfamiliar to an American but not difficult to figure out. I am amazed at some of the obvious misspellings - and wonder whether there are editors reading these rather short books? But this is a fun one - quick and the expected happy ending."},{"Title":"The Boss's Baby (Expecting) (Harlequin Presents, No. 2064)","review":"I grab a Harlequin on my kindle--they are sooooo easy to buy with the one click--maybe too easy--to escape. This book is pure escapism. As a previous reviewer said, it was nice to read a book that did not have any parental abandonment.

But this is just a romp and successful as that."},{"Title":"The Boss's Baby (Expecting) (Harlequin Presents, No. 2064)","review":"I really liked it. I did think the heroine was a little too fixed on what the ex-wife said to her. Lewis did say she was vindictive and not to believe her but the heroine still did.

It's the sequel to several other books I haven't read, but I don't believe my enjoyment of it suffered as aresult.The setting is Mississippi during the early 1890s when the memories of the Civil War and Reconstruction were still vivid. A backwoods, locally influential family finds itself under siege by a powerful logging company from Chicago, a new breed of demagogue politicians and family wounds from the Civil War that refuse to heal while the parties involved remain alive. The book is reminiscent of some of the better western genre novels that qualify as \`literature'. The setting portrayed is believable, the plot, crisp, the characters, real.This is the story of a microcosm of humanity during a pivotal time in history. The US hasn't yet gone to war with Spain, hasn't assumed the mantle of an international power with foreign aims. US Territories were roughly the same as they aretoday, minus Puerto Rico and Guam. As Coolidge truthfully stated once, \\"The business of America is business\\". There was no time in history when this manifested itself more forcefully than it did during the 1890s.Street manages to bring alive a forgotten time and context in the book, well worth the time to read and absorb carefully."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"This is a fine piece of work from someone who is obviously concerned about how our nation's history is being rewritten by radicals and special interest groups. Hinkle traces the history of the Confederate battle flag, the symbols that compose it, and what the men who fought for it had to say about it. It also discusses the current controversy, showing how Southerners all across the nation have been fired from jobs, thrown out of schools, and even shot and killed because they dared to tell the truth about the flag and their ancestors. This is a fascinating book about a subject that continues to be in today's newspapers. I strongly recommend it. It is well-researched and contains over 400 footnotes.

Hinkle gives a very well researched story about the truth of The Confederate Battle Flag. What most people do not realise is the fact that just because a symbol is not important to you, does not mean it should be done away with. This book puts to shame those who choose only to destroy the flag. They claim the flag reppresents slavery and that was the cause of the war. Well here is a fact for them...The U.S. had slaves longer than the C.S. did. In the South slavery was abolished in 1865, but the high and mighty North did not abolish slavery until 1866. These people think they know that the war was over slavery are funny. They need to do more reading and get out of celebrity book clubs.

He includes amazing photographs that show the U.S. military proudly flying the banner as a spirit flag and true accounts of the flag being carried by our veterans in recent wars.He also explains the anti-flaggers mean spirited attacks and use of other tactics against the Embattled Banner. It is interesting to note that recently three scalawag Southern governors against the flag all lost reelections.

Unfortunately, this book is not one of them because the quality of the writing is inadequate. If you're looking for some good pro-Confederate arguments, I will recommend a couple below.The immediate problem with Hinkle's book is that poor rhetorical and stylistic decisions appear persistently. The prose fails to flow smoothly due to poor transitions, inappropriate diction, and even some errors in grammar and punctuation. Hinkle criticizes his opponents for being intemperate in their tone, yet he himself repeatedly launches invectives and irrelevant ad hominem attacks against those who disagree with him. A combative tone, unsupported claims, and fallacies in logic result in a book that fails to invite critical analysis of the issues.If you're looking for books that are scholarly and articulate, one is RACIST SYMBOLS AND REPARATIONS by George Schedler (Rowan &amp; Littlefield, 1998), a pro-flag book that is sometimes dense but one that never underestimates the intelligence of the reader. Another is CONFEDERATE SYMBOLS IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOUTH, edited by J. Michael Martinez (University Press of Florida, 2000), which contains a variety of perspectives on the issue.In his introduction, Hinkle indicates that he wrote his book for people who support the Confederate flag but who &quot;don't know how to respond when confronted&quot; by anti-flag arguments. Preaching to the choir is hardly a challenging goal for a writer and it doesn't show respect for the reader's intelligence. The other books that I recommend are much more comprehensive, engaging, and respectful of the reader than Hinkle's book."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"Having finished this book I am left with several impressions - none of them favorable.The first is that the author here, Don Hinkle, makes more than several preposterous comments regarding facts surrounding the Civil War.One is that there were large numbers of slaves who &quot;willingly&quot; fought on the side of the South for their freedom. Freedom?? From what?? The people who held them; who eagerly used their lives up for the sole purpose of providing cheap labor for their highly profitable crops of King Cotton? We are expected to believe this and other ludicrous statements thoughout this work.Another impression I am left with is the small, mean-minded spirit that seems to pervade this book. The author actually stoops to making a snide remark about Abraham Lincoln apparently getting what he deserved when he was assassinated. This is a dramatic difference from any other book I have ever encountered in any treatment of President Lincoln. And, it is a tone that the author seems to have adopted and feels quite comfortable displaying here.In conclusion, and in addition to the above comments, there are simply too many attempts to appeal to emotion over facts - from the young girl holding onto the Confederate flag in a longing manner on the front cover to the author devoting 20% of the book, the final chapter, to describing the events surrounding the shooting death of a white southern male for having displayed that flag - while at the same time ignoring the flood of racial incidents perpetrated by those who love to display that emblem.This book simply does not meet the level of professionalism and fairness that I am used to in similar historical treatments."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"The historical accuracy of this book is sadly lacking.If you don't think the Confederacy (and therefore its symbol) was built on racism and slavery, read the Cornerstone Speech of Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederate States here: http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 .According to Stephens himself on March, 21, 1861, \\"The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution - African slavery as it exists amongst us - the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.

The Embattled Banner does provide more information about the history of the display of the Confederate Battle Flag post 1865 than does The Flags of the Confederacy however. What this book tries, but fails to do, is to show that the battle flag can be disconnected from the taint of slavery. (The first state to succeed from the Union was South Carolina on December 24, 1860 and the legislation of succession sighted slavery and only slavery as the root of the dispute.) The author uses weak and illogical reasoning to try to justify an indefensible contention that the Confederate States of America was not created for the purpose of continuing african slavery.

My great-grandfather fought under that flag, yet he never owned a slave in his life. Our friends in the North often paint a picture that is quite different from the truth, about why the War Between the States was fought. This book was very refreshing. With all the negatives in the news today, I wanted the REAL truth, and this book provided it to me. Mr. Hinkle makes it clear that opponents of the Confederate battle flag are simply ignorant of the truth, and probably make these statements without knowing anything about the flag other than what left-wing opponents of the flag tell them in speeches. Hinkle obviously did quite a bit of research on this book, supporting his arguments with facts, and not distortions. After having read it, I am much more in favor of keeping the flag flying in South Carolina, Gerogia, and Mississippi. It's part of our history, and anyone that doesn't like it can always move to another state."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"As a Southerner I was naturally attracted to this book, which makes a real effort to explain the positive connotations of the Confederate Battle Flag. The question the author does not address sufficiently is why such a defense is necessary at all. After all no one criticizes the American flag because it was the symbol of a slave republic for ninety years and also the symbol of the cultural genocide of Native Americans for longer than that, or the British flag because it was a symbol of the slave trade for over one hundred and on and on. That any public symbol of any group of people can be interpreted negatively is self-evident, but rather than exploring this point Don Hinkle limits himself to making clear (and successfully so) that Southerners (like everyone else) have a right to be proud of their heritage and their emblems, and that Confederate symbols are as much an honored part of American history as the Star Spangled Banner or the Martin Luther King memorial. After all, he contends, Southerners are Americans too, who made and continue to make a sizable contribution to this country. And no, the Confederacy was not about perpetuating slavery, every hear of the Corwin Amendment, or Lincoln's myriad statements that the war was about \\"preserving the Union\\" with or without slavery folks? It was instead, as Hinkle implies but should explicate more clearly, more about trying to keep the South from becoming the political, social, and economic colony of the North (and West), which is just what happened after 1865. Despite these limitations, this book is a good start towards an objective understanding of an issue that has been unreasonably clouded by misplaced and self-serving emotions."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"I am a Son of a Confederate Veteran.

This book explains why the battle flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and pride and DOES NOT represent racism and hatred to the vast majority of people-North and South-who honor it. Most people in this country have never been taught the true history of the war--it's not in our schoolbooks. Remember, conquerors always write history as they want it to appear. It's taken over 100 years for the South to recover economically from the war. It will probably be another 100 years before the events leading to the war, the war itself, and the aftermath can be fairly evaluated without the taint of Northern bias. The events of history speak for themselves when fairly and accurately reported."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"So said the late and great Ronnie Van Zant in the intro to Sweet Home Alabama, and he was right.It is obscene and a total distortion of reality to describe the Confederate Flag as a \\"racist symbol\\". Don Hinkle has certainly done us proud with this much-needed boost for the good people of The South.The supreme irony is that by attempting to ban the Confederate Flag (anti-Flag pedants please note, my capitalization is deliberate) they will turn it into a rallying symbol for every WASP who has had enough of being blamed for all of the evils of the world.Proportionally speaking, very few whites have openly supported the KKK and other Right Wing groups. Yet with a Communist-inspired \\"Liberal\\" onslaught on the Confederate Flag, lines are bound to become blurry.Yes, slavery was wrong, we've all figured that out, and if we hadn't been deliberately undermined by reckless and subversive immigration policies, black and white integration would have taken place much more rapidly.The number of lies about The Racist South are equalled only by the pitiful attempts to deify thugs such as Lincoln, whose War Of Northern Aggression only belatedly and incidentally embraced the slavery issue. As another reviewer correctly observed, it was about taxation and the suppression of The South.Good job, Don. It ain't Tolstoy, but it's written from the heart, and The Truth will always get through. Time to give up the Confederate Flag? No, it's time to draw a line in the sand."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"Dear Readers,I write this review in order to try to set the record straight. This book is quite well done. It points out several interesting facts. But you can read those for yourself. It is well worth reading. My review is more in response to the ignorance shown by a couple of the other reviewers. Although I cannot blame them. They were given a public school education, which is fraught with lies and political correctness. I will attempt to make several points. 1) The African slave trade was much older than the United States. That same trade still exist today in Africa. I find it amusing that with all of this trade alive and well that no one is screaming about it. I guess it is because it is black people enslaving black people. To admit this is happening might lose people some of their freebies. 2) Only about 14% of the citizens of the Confederacy were slaveholders; not 80-90% which the schoolbooks would have you believe. 3) Of those people holding slaves, there existed free blacks who held slaves. The census records show over 2,000 slaves were held by those of African descent. 4) If it was a war to end slavery, then why did the \\"Emancipation Proclamation\\" not occur until far into the war. 5) That great \\"abolitionist\\" Abraham Lincoln once stated, \\" If I could keep this Union together without freeing one slave, I would do it.\\" 6) The fact is the war was about states rights. The north was taxing the South so highly in order to keep the South from selling their raw goods to France and England, that the South was going broke! 7) Oh, and by the way, there were FREE blacks as well as slaves that formed Confederate troops towards the end of the war. They fought with valour just as the whites did! Just as a sideline. I moved to Oregon a few years ago. When I began meeting my workmates. They noticed that I had a Southern accent. The first things out of thier ignorant mouths was &quot;how many sheets do I have hanging in my closet?&quot; Then they began telling about the South. When I asked them what part they had visited, thier response was &quot; oh, I've never actually been.&quot;God Save The South!"},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"If you're a politically correct liberal who can't stand anyone else having their own opinions, you'll quickly suffer a \\"Maalox Moment\\" after reading this book.But, if you're in the vast \\"silent majority\\" and you wonder what the hell all the hoopla is regarding the confederate battle flag and other symbols that have been around for well over a hundred years, then this is the book for you.The author gives a readable, yet comprehensive account of what that flag meant to the folks who fought for it, and where today's politically correct circus got started.And when you're through, you may just feel like singing \\"Dixie\\" again!!"},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"Every once in a while the controversy of abolishing the Battle Flag of the Confederacy pops up. To strip a nation of its heritage and the symbols they represent is wrong. Don Hinkle does an outstanding job defending the Flag with a great deal of research and facts.I thought as an American that you had the right to express yourself as stated in the Constituton. However, it appears that a select group of individuals and organizations wants to strip that right from individuals who have a deep tie with the fallen men of the south.There are people out there that feel the flag is a symbol of racism and slavery. Hinkle shows that that is far from the truth.Many states and school districts ban students from wearing or displaying the battle flag while in school or attending school sponsored events. Yet a student can wear the flag of Great Britain a country we fought for our freedom some 200 years ago. So why ban the Battle Flag?Groups trying to abolish the flag use hate groups like the KKK and others in their effort to ban the displaying of the flag. They state that these groups fly these flags on their marches and demonstrations. Do these groups in favor of ridding the Battle Flag watch current events. I think not for if they did they would see these groups also fly the American Stars and Stripes. So, should we abolish the American Flag. It would seem to make sense to me if they want to continue to use this as their argument.Don Hinkle has done an excellent job at defending the cause of the Confederate Battle Flag. He provides countless reasons for keeping it and none for abolishing it.The American People need to read this book and follow it up with others like it. After all we should be looking for the truth and not what others want us to believe.In sum, Hinkle provides a strong argument for defending the Battle Flag. He changed my view on the flag. I too thought it as a symbol of slavey and racism. I thank Don Hinkle for allowing me to set my own values and not be persuaded by the media and others."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"Mr. Hinkle has done an excellent job of mounting a defense of the Confederate battle flag and knocking down the misinformed attacks made against it. A must read for any historian or anyone who cares about fact concerning the symbols of the Confederacy."},{"Title":"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag","review":"My assessment of \\"Embattled Banner\\" is that Mr. Hinkle has done a very credible job, indeed. He has taken on a subject that is very sensitive in today's politically correct world. He has gone down a path that many less stout of heart would be loath to embark on. As some reviewers have pointed out he has made statements that could be considered inflammatory, but only to those whose minds are closed to ideas other their own. Overall I believe, he done an excellent job of informing and explaining and for that reason alone the book is very worthwhile reading. Mr. Hinkle is biased. Of that there can be no doubt and I am quite sure he would readily own up to his biases. He is a Tennessean. A pro-Southern bias is to be expected. For the record, I am biased, too. I am descended from two of the signers of the South Carolina Ordinance of Secession. I strongly suspect that this \\"accident of history\\" has influenced my enjoyment of the book in a positive manner. Accidents notwithstanding, it seems to me that Mr. Hinkle has done what he set out to do, i.e., make a reasonable [and reasoned] defense of the Confederate battle flag.After reading the reviews for \\"Embattled Banner: A Reasonable Defense of the Confederate Battle Flag,\\" however, I find that not all reviewers agree with my assessment. For example, one reviewer states \\"The first state to succeed [sic] from the Union was South Carolina on December 24, 1860 and the legislation of succession [sic] sighted [sic] slavery and only slavery as the root of the dispute.\\" Either the reviewer never read the Ordinance of Secession or, if he did read it, it was through the uncritical prism of an Anti-Confederate bias. Otherwise, I do not think he would make such an obviously wrongheaded statement.I think we all know that legal documents seeking to redress grievances customarily state those grievances in the order of their importance to the grievers. In the first paragraph of the Ordinance the South Carolina Legislature starts justifying its reasons for secession by stating, \\"The people of the State of South Carolina, ...declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States,...,\\" etc. This refers to \\"states rights,\\" not slavery, as the primary reason for wanting to secede from the Union. In fact, of the 20 \\"justification\\" paragraphs in the document, slavery is not specifically addressed until paragraph 14. Historians, I think, agree that states rights was the most important reason for secession. The freedom to keep slaves was a part of the greater states rights issue, not the other way around.Reviewers need to be wary of making blanket statements, particularly inadequately researched ones. Ideas tend to be repeated, even wrong ideas. That is the crux of the whole problem some people have with the Confederate battle flag, not to mention the raison d'etre for the book.Another reviewer states, \\"The immediate problem with Hinkle's book is that poor rhetorical and stylistic decisions appear persistently. The prose fails to flow smoothly due to poor transitions, inappropriate diction, and even some errors in grammar and punctuation.\\" The reviewer chooses to remain anonymous so we have no way of assessing his bona fides for making such a statement. However, in my estimation, the real problem his statement is the implicit idea that poor grammar is indicative of uncritical thinking. Nothing could be further from the truth. May I point out to the reviewer that many of our founding documents contain grammatical and spelling errors. Does that make them somehow less valid?May I also point out that Don Hinkle is a well-respected journalist (both print and media) of long standing. He has the bona fides. Because Mr. Hinkle's stylistic decisions do not agree with the reviewers does not make them any less valid or effective. By the way, what is a \\"rhetorical\\" decision? To paraphrase to Mr. Webster is it \\"one made merely for effect with no [decision] expected?\\"Yet a third reviewer said, \\"It [the book] is rooted in bias, and has obviously not had the benefit research based on reason, or the weighing of evidence.\\" The reviewer strings together two statements that do not correlate. May I point out that all books are biased in one way or another. Because a book is biased it does not follow that its research has not been based on reason and evidence. Further, neither reason nor evidence is absolute. Each is open to interpretation. If I were a cynical person, I could easily say that the reviewer's review \\"...is rooted in bias, and has obviously not had the benefit research based on reason, or the weighing of evidence.\\""},{"Title":"Buying and Owning Your Own Airplane, Third Edition","review":"I've looked at all the books I can find to learn about high performance singles that can carry 4 people plus lots of stuff for adventure flying.

Johnson, of course, is one of those rare characters who demonstrates that life is not necessarily less rich than fiction, and Boswell is an entertaining (and amusingly exasperating) chronicler. The &quot;Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; is also well worth reading and randomly revisiting.However, I'm somewhat alarmed by the comments below about the accuracy of this version. I bought this because it was a decent-looking hardback version--I had actually read a library copy (some long out-of-print edition). Could some reviewer please explain the deviations?

D","review":"I have read alot of biographys until a recently a Cambridge graduate friend recommended the first great biography-Life of Johnson. My British friends have a much better view of literature at large than I do so I listening and purchased this piece. I only appreciated Samuel Johnson for his work with the first English Dictionary which a first edition now retails for over $35000. James Boswell his biographer deplicts his life with such vivid respect and admiration so as to make me better understand what a true friend can be. They obviously had a great relationship for more than 40 years. Samuel Johnson is captured with all his great and abundant humor and deep insight. I love this quote\\" One man may lead a horse to water but twenty may not make him drink\\". All in all it is 1400 pages worth reading because its insight into 18th century life in London is so heart felt. Additionally alot of the their conversations took place at a Pub called the Mitre. It is located on Mitcham high street in Tooting, UK. I lived near by and spent a few nights their with friends. Little did I realize I was in the very pub where so many infamous conversations took place some two hundred years ago. A great read."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"For those interested in a reliable text, I suggest the &quot;World's Classics&quot; paperback edition. The hardcover edition, while attractive, is somewhat suspect."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson is often called the greatest biography of all-time and may well be. Perhaps such a work can get no higher praise, but it is also highly notable as the first true modern biography - the first really resembling what we think of as biography today. Boswell set new standards for thoroughness, accuracy, and research, greatly expanding the very concept of what a biography could be. He was also very far ahead of his time in anticipating what was later called gonzo journalism - writers inserting themselves into real-life stories; it is of course not done in the same way as later writers, but the concept is similar. Most remarkable of all, though, is that the book is immensely readable, entertaining, and edifying over two hundred years later, which can be said of very few biographies. It is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in Johnson, Boswell, or the late eighteenth century European intellectual circle.Johnson was perhaps England's best known writer during his last several decades and one of the most famous in the world besides being widely known and renowned for lexicographical and other accomplishments. However, this book's greatness and fame are such that he has long been known primarily via it. Many read it who have read very little or none of him, showing that, unlike nearly all biographies, it has earned a life of its own. There are many reasons for this, not least the fine writing. Even more fundamental is that the book vividly brings an exciting, integral, and profoundly influential era to life. It covers the late Enlightenment when many of the most important people to ever live were prominent. In addition to Johnson, we get first-hand glimpses of such illustrious personages as Adam Smith, Oliver Goldsmith, Pasquale Paoli, David Garrick, and many, many others. Numerous other heavyweights - Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, King George III, etc. - are only slightly in the background. We also get contemporaneous accounts of major events like the American Revolution and the lead up to the French Revolution. In short, though ostensibly the biography of one person, the book is as vibrant, lifelike, and memorable an account of a supremely important era as any history book.Yet Johnson is always the focus, shown literally from birth to death. Anyone interested in him will find a wealth of information about all aspects of his life as well as his thoughts, feelings, influences, intellectual background, and far more. There is also a great deal of information about his work. Unlike nearly all biographers, Boswell actually knew Johnson well; he was his friend for many years and spent several months annually in his company, essentially interviewing him and making voluminous notes of his conversation. This last is indeed the book's heart and by far its most famous element. Johnson was perhaps his era's most famous conversationalist, revered for wit and argument; Boswell heard many hours of his conversation and reports faithfully. His style here was again innovative. Rather than sprinkling isolated quotes anecdotally, he went to great pains to reproduce full conversations, not only describing the setting and others present but even using drama-like name headings for full verisimilitude. We thus not only see what Johnson said but where, how, and usually why he said it. Many world famous Johnson sayings that would otherwise be lost - i.e., \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\\" - are immortalized here, as well as some quotes by others. This alone would make the book of great value.Much has been made of how Boswell's presence affected this; knowing he would write the biography, or at least thinking it possible, he undoubtedly orchestrated much, drawing Johnson out when he might have otherwise been silent. Much of this would have been done in any case as he clearly admired Johnson and loved his talk, but there is no denying the question's importance. Some have condemned Boswell as a shameless celebrity whore or otherwise questioned his motives and veracity, but nearly everyone will consider this nitpicking, fascinating as the question is. For nearly everyone, it makes the book better - far more personal and engaging than biographies are usually even capable of being. Also, for what it is worth, such things mean the book in many ways tells us nearly as much about Boswell as Johnson, making it a sort of hybrid biography/autobiography.Boswell understandably focuses on the years he knew Johnson, meaning the book is greatly lopsided in favor of the later years after Johnson became famous and nearly all his major work was done. This will annoy those who want a more balanced overview, especially as Boswell makes short shrift of some important early events. Those wanting a more conventional balance should get one of several later biographies, especially as Boswell makes a few errors and, at least according to later sources, leaves out some highly interesting - if not necessarily essential - facts. He openly admits doing so at the start in order to protect Johnson's reputation, though much of what he says elsewhere is unflattering, but some of it may have been unknown to him. For most, though, this is the only Johnson biography that will ever be needed - and its greatness, influence, and importance are such that it is required for all readers with even the slightest interest in English and European literature and history and the art of biography even if they care little or nothing for Johnson or Boswell.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers. An excellent, lengthy introduction gives substantial background on Johnson, Boswell, and the book plus some critical insight. There is also a worthwhile bibliography, a chronology, and a supremely useful index. As with other Everyman hardbacks, the book itself is also very high quality - clothbound with very strong binding and even a built-in bookmark. This is one of the best versions available."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I enjoyed reading this biography very much, finding Boswell an amazingly adroit reporter and his subject fascinating and wise. Johnson was full of shrewdness and good sense, along with amusing biases and unusual mannerisms, just the sort of person to ask to liven up a dinner. The book is both humorous and moving, written in a lively style, and good for repeated readings through the years."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I had heard since many years about Johnson, i had visited the museum in London, but only now I found the courage the read 'The Life of.....'. It was worth it.Boswell, to my knowledge, seems to be the first biographer in the modern sense of the word. He tries to give a rounded picture of his subject and also a structured account, structured by time but also structured by focusing on the body, the mind and the sould, usually in that order. What a time to have lived in London, to meet Johnson, Adam Smith, Burke, Gibbon. Johnson emerges as the central sun around which all other planets circle. This also makes for one of the weaknesses of this autobiography, that Johnson crowds out all around him. Yes, a biography should put the subject in the center, but not exclusively so. Boswell also neglects to explain the historical context. Like so many writers on contemporary history he assumes his subjects to be of such universal importance as to make them also common knowldge 300 years after publication. Clearly it is not so, and Boswell could have been helpful by putting more of what he is writing into context rather than leaving it to the footnotes of future editors.Delightful rather than annoying are his fights especially with Ms. Thrale about who might be the superior biographer. In 18th century style he does not shy away in calling the competing biographer names and casting doubt on her motives and moral rectitude.All in all a fascinating document, though for modern readers often tedious and only recommended for 'hardcore' readers."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell met Johnson when he (Boswell) was 23 and Johnson was 63. As a result, the emphasis of Boswell's biography is on Johnson's later years, but oh, what a record Boswell has left us. Boswell provoked Johnson to comment on a wide variety of topics, and recorded Johnson's doings with his circle of friends and colleagues. Boswell was a pleasant companion for Johnson, who usually accepted Boswell's constant probes (and even accompanied Boswell on a tour of the Highlands in 1773). Through it all, Boswell took notes, and jotted down everything Johnson said, recording many of Johnson's most famous comments. As a result, Boswell's biography of this great man of letters was a landmark biography, different from all biographies which came before, and still a point of comparison for biographies today. If you can get past Boswell's rather (in my opinion) obsequious tone, you will enjoy the ride very much. This Oxford World's Classics edition, edited by JD Fleeman, has a wonderful set of notes not found in other editions. It is a very affordable and thorough edition."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

D","review":"If you feel obliged to wade through the canon once in a while, this won't be a waste of your time, though these days Gibbon's roughly contemporaneous history is a much better read, Boswell's extreme formality being a bit wearing over 1200 pages (in the edition I read).On the other hand, Boswell's telling of Johnson's life is sprightly and certainly not so tedious as the writings of Johnson himself. People who choose to read the Life will not be disappointed.On yet another hand, I can easily understand why the library copy I borrowed, though purchased in 1949, had not yet been read (the uncut pages showing me so): except to specialists, I would not recommend this book in lieu of, say, 1000 or so others.I guess this actually is a useless review: if you have already decided to read this, you shan't have gone wrong; if you're looking for a good read, you're probably not looking here."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Haven't read it yet. But the processing job on the book itself was faulty...several pages were bent over and thus not trimmed properly."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell was not the obvious choice to write the best biography about Samuel Johnson, much less one of the greatest biographies in world literature. He had much less contact with Johnson than Mrs. Thrale, for many years a close friend of Johnson who spent much more time with him than did Boswell. In fact, Boswell spent perhaps 400 days with Johnson over a period of many years. He also was not Johnson's literary executor. Finally, Boswell was regarded by many of his day, and afterwards, as something of an 18th Century celebrity hound. He made a point of meeting every famous person he could (Voltaire, Rousseau), and went to great efforts to make himself famous. Nevertheless, in his Life of Johnson, Boswell succeeded in portraying Johnson and his circle so vividly that more than 200 years later they come across as real human beings. He did this by breaking the convention of concentrating only on the most favorable aspects of his subject's life, and instead describing Johnson's eccentricities of dress, behavior, etc. Moreover, Boswell did not neglect to include incidents that make himself appear ridiculous. The book is both extremely funny and moving. If you read this, you will want to immediatley get a copy of Boswell's book on the trip that Johnson and he took to the Hebrides."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Ah, Ol' Sam, the Great Cham as somebody called him (it's an 18th century misreading of &quot;Khan&quot;, fact fans). My opinion of Johnson the writer fluctuates over the years; sometimes he seems a long-winded authoritarian, at other times his juggernaut sentences seem possessed of a superhuman vitality. Whatever. This isn't Johnson the writer we're concerned with, so much as Johnson the talker - the gruff, ridiculously prejudiced, gloomy, scrofulous clubman, holding forth from the biggest chair in the room, wisecracking, bullying, brooding and sulking.Johnson was as lucky to have Boswell, as Boswell was to have Johnson. The conversations of great men tend not to be much fun; Eckermann's &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; is fascinating, all right, but Goethe's mixture of gossipy cattiness and Olympian pomposity gets to you after a while (Donald Barthelme wrote an evil parody of it). With Boswell's Johnson it's different. He seems at once painfully real and a caricature of himself. Boswell captures both the readiness to pontificate about anything under the sun and the panicky vulnerability. Eckermann's Goethe leaves the room when he's upset (nothing must ruffle the patrician facade) but Boswell's Johnson stays in his chair - we can see his reaction.Of course there are drawbacks, in that half of the book covers the last ten or so years of Johnson's life, but there really isn't that much hard evidence about Johnson's early life beyond what Boswell himself collected. I reserve my doubts about Johnson's cultural politics, but the rolling, rumbling figure that Boswell sets down is one of my favourite characters in literature. Swift has a darker and more perplexing fascination for me, but you wouldn't have got the 44-year-old Swift out of bed at 3AM for a ramble. He'd have hurled his bedpan at you.Why is it a great airport book? Because there's a lot of it, it's unfailingly entertaining and informative, and it's guaranteed not to include a description of an air crash."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

It is a great book (also great is W. Jackson Bate's SAMUEL JOHNSON [1st published 1975]which is a MUST for anyone interested in Johnson). But although I love the Everyman's Library, I do not recommend this edition of Boswell. Unlike the usual quality of the Everyman's Library, its Boswell is rife with typographical errors (there's even missing text!). Though it's the only edition of Boswell I've read, I regret that a correct edition is not on my bookshelf.

The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary. I recommend this book highly to people with an interest in 18th century England, the literary society of the period, or who simply love a great biography."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

So turn your TV off for a month and read a great book and become acquainted with some truly interesting and intellectual people."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I'm no expert on 18th-century English literature, or on the famous work I'm being so daring as to review. I did, however, read every line of it, and I can say, I liked it.I started reading this work---oft cited as the greatest biography in the English language, and surely the one where the subject was most un-objectively represented by his fawning chronicler---when I was a sixteen-year-old sophomore in an honors seminar. I finished it literally today, some eleven years and perhaps twenty-two starts and stops later.What remains most strongly in memory, above the man about whom this was penned, is the era itself, which was captured in full dimension here by a scribe whose entire being seemed concentrated upon gulping down those scraps of notice sent his way by the movers and shakers, the \\"A-listers,\\" of his century.As a straightforward biography, this work is oddly paced, anything but impartial, and since it concentrates most of its scope on a relatively brief period in Johnson's life and career, curiously uneven. This is not unusual in biographies, of course, which tend to select moments that most closely define the subject's celebrity, but the pacing in the coverage does stick out at me. It also surprised me to find out that Boswell was around the great Johnson about a year's time, and the rest of his work, in all its ever-excusing hero-worshipping, anecdote-dribbling glory, is the result of his being privy to gossip, to making use of the facts known about Johnson, and by his, frankly, inventing whole sections in a kind of \\"non-fiction-fiction.\\"What forgives all that (if forgiveness is needed) is the thing I mentioned above; namely, no other writer from any era does quite so complete a job of making a person centuries in the future feel THERE for the scenes he's describing. To have wrung as much as he did from Johnson, the greatest \\"talker\\" of his time, shows that Boswell had the reporter's gift for conversation as a means of LISTENING. And all that is why this is the 18th century's finest life story, and also why I came to like this book so much in the years between when it was assigned to me, and when I finally finished it as a pleasure read in the year 2006."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell took as his subject, the person called ' the greatest talker the English language has ever known'. He went around with him, goaded him here and there, and allowed him to talk.In return Johnson said countless wise, provocative, interesting, and offensive but above all humorous things. Boswell wrote down these , and also wrote down , or reconstructed conversations of Johnson with his friends. All of this helped make his subject ' alive' to his readers in a way no detailed recording of his every action from minute one of his life to minute zero at the end of his life could. He had the sense and intuition to help bring out what is most interesting in his subject. And so he presents the subject not only in a realistic way but in a sense in a most appealing way. This made Boswell the pioneer in a form of biography , or in one of the techniques of biography which is central to it. Boswell himself with all his much self- regretted dissolution was also an interesting apprentice, a writer too after all who learned from the Master. Johnson is a great and central figure , for many the greatest critic the English language has ever known but he is too an acquaintance and friend of Garrick, Hume others of distinction .Boswell listens to them also .Johnson was something of a curmudgeon a lovable kind of character who in his anger and outbursts amuses us. He was also a moral teacher although apparently he did not give much attention to the stricture regarding the wrongness of needlessly defaming others.Together these two are one of literature's great teams, not equal to the Knight of LeMancha and Sancho but up there on the top.Like all works of genius this work has its fanatical followers and its petty demeanors. It is better in these cases to trust the first .For a work like this enriches our common humanity as all the truly great books do."},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"'No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money,' Samuel Johnson.Sorry, it is a hobby.Samuel Johnson the writer of the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, which was a very big deal in his day as the elite felt the English language was in decline due to it being influenced by so many foreign influences and the marvel of Samuel Johnson's efforts and method of writing made him, according to Lord ChesterfieldLord Chesterfield's Letters (Oxford World's Classics), as someone to be deferred to as the \\"Caesar\\" of the English language. Samuel Johnson, along with his friend and former pupil David Garrick, helped place Shakespeare as the permanent king of the English language; further, Johnson was a great and singular essayist and has an eternal place as a minor poet of the English language. His dictionary shot Johnson into the inner circle of elite in English society.Boswell's \\"Life of Samuel Johnson\\" is a fascinating read as Boswell traces Johnson's life story. Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, a friend of his, and together the center of English political and cultural life with the 'Literary Club' that they had both started were big players in forming the English reaction to the major liberal events going on in their day and could be said to be the fathers of modern conservatism. They were alive to face the genesis of modern liberalism, in the form of Jean Jacque Rousseau along with the American Revolution, theirs was the conservative response. 'What hypocrites are the drivers of negroes to be demanding liberty,' Johnson in reference to the Americans. (It is funny that Samuel Johnson was against slavery while the more liberal Boswell was for it). Although, I know Edmund Burke felt England to be in the reconcilable wrong with the American RevolutionEdmund Burke's Speech on conciliation with the American colonies,: Delivered in the House of commons, March 22, 1775; ed., with notes and a study plan ... I. Crane (Twentieth century text-books)the Doctor, Samuel Johnson, did not and felt the Revolutionaries hypocritical ingrates. What is good about conservatism lays with these two fellows, Burke and Johnson. It is also amusing that Johnson's conservativism included the observation that countries should be judged by the condition in which their poor lived, disapprobation given to the worse.Samuel Johnson came from very humble roots and his early life was spent in modest means, fortunately he was surrounded by books. His first years in London were quite a struggle, near pennyless, sometimes sleeping on the streets. The money he ended up getting for writing the dictionary wasn't much in the end, it was the fame that got him some wealth.A marvelous read. Giving advice about the legal profession, education: his advice - just do it; habits form early and habits are hard to break... lots of interesting views from how to conduct oneself socially (Boswell seemed in constant search of this) to political commentary (one of my favorite was his advice on being weary of those that wrap themselves in the flag)... too much to write about. Boswell, when he first meets Johnson is so filled with awe and reverance but it mellows out some, he even starts playing games with the Doctor; however, he always greatly respects him but the idolitry disipates.Although Samuel Johnson's conservativeness and strong opinions might turn people off I find it refreshing compared to the stealth tactics of politics today. Politicians don't say what they mean and that is also probably why the Doctor was discouraged from entering politics in his day by some close friends with ties in that area, somethings change only by degree. James Boswell, the author, didn't agree with the Doctor all the time but appreciated the hard, realistic way of looking at things and amusingly delivered (mostly by quirky analogies) that Samuel Johnson did.Then Boswell is a story in himself. Boswell's Rousseau-ist fever for the notions of the 'Noble Savage, Natural Man'The Noble Savage: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1754-1762was interesting also; his generation caught it and he had strong sentiments towards it despite Johnson's arguments against its reasoning. This fever also, at the least, lent cover to the American Revolution.Johnson could only afford one year of college. Received an honarary Doctorate for his dictionary.One of the books one should read before they turn 20.The best synopsis of Rousseau and in his own words is probably 'Creed of a Priest of Savoy'The Essential Rousseau (Essentials)"},{"Title":"The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

He had a temper no doubt and definitely went through periods of what sound like moderate to severe depression followed by periods of bursting with energy, joy and wit and incredibly prolific and productive in those bursts, enough so that he surprised most people with his abilities in those bursts of creative genius. I am biased as I am a psychiatric physician but it sound like bipolar disorder to me.Whatever the case may be, I drank this book up.

My active vocabulary has grown noticeably after working through this book. Even though the vocabulary in Kalila wa Dimna is often archaic, Younes has rewritten the original to use simpler, more modern words most of time time (though some passages are left in their original form for advanced students and masochists). The archaisms are thus present (and who would want to know the specific term for a male turtle--and how can you even tell the male from the female?!), but 95% of the text is language that one might find and use today.As another commenter noted, these stories also illustrate difficult grammatical forms that are not commonly found elsewhere, or that are found only in stodgy, difficult-to-read texts, unlike these seriously fun stories. The dual form of nouns, adjectives, and verbs is peppered through these stories, including the challenging loss of the final nun with suffixes. The words \\"inna\\" and \\"anna,\\" as well and \\"in\\" and \\"an,\\" are used constantly, and only now do I understand well the differences. And though the case endings are not marked, Younes's recorded oral reading of the stories puts them in, at least in the places where an educated modern reader would put them in. I finally have begun to feel relatively comfortable with the cases (especially when used with words with the masculine suffix--is it \\"baytu-hu\\" or \\"bayta-hu\\" and why is it \\"bayti-hi\\", etc.). One won't learn these rules from this book, but the stories as read by Younes illustrate these rules in a way that is MUCH more enjoyable than in the standard MSA text.This book is worth every cent of its admittedly elevated price tag. It should be on the reading list of any serious intermediate student of Arabic who wants to nail down the basics and be well-prepared to go on to the next level, whether in the Qur'an or the modern press."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"These stories are excellent for intermediate/advanced students of Arabic. The grammatical structures used are fairly straightforward, and the stories are easy to follow. I felt that reading the stories improved the range of my vocabulary and helped reinforce the vocabulary I've already learned. I think it's good supplemental reading, especially for students looking for a relief from dry textbook readings."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"Very well done and fun.A great way to learn lots of useful vocabulary and to reinforce how and where to use all the different grammatical structures is a painless way. Also an enjoyable way to improve pronunciation, reading, spelling, and writing."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"In my case, I am using it so my child will get used to hearing and eventually learn good quality Arabic. Because Kalila Wa Dimna is a collection of stories with mostly animal characters, it is very attractive for children.Having said that does not mean that the material in the book is for little kids. My child is a first generation Arab-American who already understands the Arabic language, and whom I wish for to learn good Arabic since early age. So what I do is I choose the stories that I find appropriate.The book has lots of vocabulary and excellent grammar. I am writing this review to encourage any Arab-American parent to try it for their children. The legend says that prophet Mohammad was sent to live with the Bedouins as a little child just to absorb from them correct beautiful Arabic language.I am glad that I finally found such book for my child and for me it is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"This is an excellent collection of reading materials for students of Arabic at the intermediate or low advanced level. It allows for a lot of contact with the language in small and manageable chunks and would be a great summer project for keeping up with your language skills. Note that it does not provide much assistance with the texts in terms of overt grammar review or direct translation, which may be a burden for students without the skills to use a reference grammar."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"I had the fortune of being taught by the author of this book. He told me that he requested from the publishers to make the book affordable for students, but obviously they didn't follow up on the promise (and I'm guessing he got paid hardly anything).Although the demand for Arabic continues to rise, there is still a dearth of resources for students of Arabic, especially supplementary reading material outside of standard textbooks. This is one of the best books currently in the market for this purpose.The stories are broken down into manageable portions and are followed by comprehension questions (though I rarely bothered with those). The level of difficulty is just right for the intermediate student; the prose is clear and tends to stay away from those overly complex constructions that some textbook writers seem so fond of but are quite unnecessary at this level. The vocabulary introduced in this book is quite helpful, and much of it can easily be adapted for everyday use.All in all, a fun & rewarding book that will help reinforce your reading skills."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"This book is fantastic for intermediate Arabic students because it has a lot of words that you won't find in newspapers or traditional textbooks. The stories are short and have pictures which make them fun. The CD recordings are of excellent quality which aids in pronunciation. I found that when I went to the Middle East, I remembered words from this book much better than from other more traditional reading materials. A great idea and a nice resource. Expensive, but definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"If you have been studying the language for a couple of years you should buy this. Resources of this quality are few and far between. I am even doing the exercises (which I never normally do). I also imagine it would be ideal for a group because the stories give you a good basis for discussion. The great thing is that the stories in themselves have literary merit, rather than the vapid synthetic conversations you get in most exercise books. You will also have an unbeatable stash of animal vocabulary once you've finished :-)"},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"This is a wonderfully put-together book. The audio of all of the stories can be added to an IPod and there are useful exercises to accompany each of the stories.My only complaint is that the vocabulary in these stories is not necessarily going to be very useful in daily conversation. The words are more whimsical and obscure (words for different species of birds, different kinds of gems, etc.), as you would expect from a book of folk tales. But if you are ready for that kind of vocab, this is a great resource."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"I have studied Modern Standard Arabic at the university level for four years. I was introduced to this book my second year of studies, before I had a comprehensive understanding of Arabic syntax and grammar. At the time, it was incredibly challenging and frustrating, as there were grammatical and morphological structures in use that I hadn't been introduced to (e.g., the weak verbs, the tamyiz, etc).After more or less a complete introduction to Arabic grammar (which took me 3 years), this book/cd set really started to shine as a tool to build confidence and vocabulary, and comprehension, translation and listening skills in a way that is interesting rather than boring.I do not recommend it as a way to learn the mechanics of the language, but a way to apply and build on what you've already learned from your study of arabic grammar. I would keep a reference grammar handy if and when you get stuck on a particular passage and know all the words but still don't know what it all means or how it all fits together.The glossary from the 2005 version (and perhaps others) claims to be \\"comprehensive\\" but falls far short of this claim with respect to the vocabulary utilized in the stories themselves. After much frustration, I no longer use it because it is hit or miss as to whether it actually has the word I am looking for. In addition, after you learn the root system that forms the basis for Arabic morphology, the alphabetical ordering of the glossary will be confusing. So in addition to that reference grammar (I recommendA New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language), keep a copy ofArabic-English Dictionary: The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabichandy and you're all set."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"I use this book as a supplement to continue my studies in Arabic. It has vocabulary and questions. Very good for learning."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"This is a collection of stories in Arabic that are familiar to my various friends who have grown up in the Middle East. Both a Lebanese and an Iranian friend tell me that they studied these classic stories when they were high school students in their home countries. I find these stories to be interesting and helpful in the development of both my Arabic vocabulary and understanding of grammar. I am not sure how helpful, however, that I find the CD. I believe that there is at least one story where the narrator makes a mistake--either adding or omitting words in the text. He also reads a little too fast for me to follow.One Indian friend told me that these stories were originally from India, written by a sage in the employ of some royal court for the edification of the dimwit crown prince. These stories were then, in turn, adopted by the Arabs after their travels to the Indian subcontinent."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"The book and corresponding CD's are great in hearing proper pronunciation and following up with listening comprehension tools with the vocabulary list at the end of each story and the questions to determine how much was understood."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"I also have an older (pre-CD) version of this book (to be honest, I like mine better, the illustrations in the later version are silly and I like having a hardcover book). The stories are a great aid and motivator to learning to read Arabic, as of course, you want to know how the stories turn out, and they all have a sort of lesson to impart. I wish I could find more books like this, for beginning students. One can read the stories and not be overwhelmed, and get a taste of something outside of the modern 'textbook'."},{"Title":"Tales from Kalila Wa Dimna: For Students of Arabic","review":"For 2 cd's and a workbook, it is overpriced. It is of good quality though."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Geometry","review":"This is a excellent guide in learning the fundamentals of geometry. The theorems and concepts are easy to grasp and the problems at the end of each theorem(s) make it easier to memorize. The only problem i have with this book is that some problems are easier than what can be expected on SAT II Math Level IIC or SAT I.I would suggest to buy Schaum's Outline Geometry to further your knowledge in geometry. Cliffnotes for easy explantations and Schaum's for the problems and extra concepts that are not discussed in cliffnotes. Overall, I was very satisfied to find a book that made geometry easier than I expected"},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Geometry","review":"I'm a high school freshman-going-on-sophomore and I bought this to help prep myself for a get-ahead summer course I'm taking. So far, I've learned faster and better than I have with any of my previous math teachers.Essentially a learning-by-example book, the description of new theories and postulates can be sketchy at first, but the multitudes of examples help to cement the ideas, and end of chapter tests ensure you don't forget.If I had any gripes, they would be about the elusive problem 20, which I was instructed by the book to refer to a few times. Also annoying was the fact that the answers to the problems were often on the same page, making it hard to answer of your own skill, due to a wandering eye. Other than those minor issues, however, this book was a lifesaver.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for prep, review, or even to help you pass a class if ever you're stuck with a truly horrible teacher."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Geometry","review":"I used this book to study for Middle School Math Praxis (20069) and was very pleased.

I am a 28 yr old returning student, and I'd been away from math in general for about 10 years. This was a great book for learning and reviewing the geometry concepts. I went through it quickly, in about 3-4 weeks. I just took the compass test and scored a 99 out of 100! Very nice. My one complaint is that there are a few random editing errors in the book. This definitely caused me some confusion as to why my answer was off, or how to do a problem. I've read the same complaint for other math books in their series. I am onto Algebra I next. Hopefully, I will be as succesful with that book as this one. Overall, a very good book."},{"Title":"The State Vs. Elinor Norton","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart has been called \\"The American Agatha Christie,\\" and her books, especially the earlier ones, are appealing in the same way Christie's are: very clever, interesting mysteries.But this 1934 title is a break-out novel, a dark and amazingly believable depiction of a woman from a loveless upper class home, and the choices that take her life to the precipice. Elinor's husband, Lloyd, has his own psychological damage, drawn by the author with superb insight. The interplay between the couple, as they each try to do the right thing, hampered by their demons, is the stuff great suspense is made of. Elinor's tragic infatuation with another man keeps the tension high. Once her husband dies in a hunting accident -- or was it? -- the tension keeps up as she tries to forge a life with the other man, blind at first to his flaws, and, later, as realization grows and she realizes that she's trapped. The amazing thing about this novel is the way Rinehart can make the reader understand Elinor's feelings, as a function both of her self-loathing, and of the morals of the era -- even though today most of us would just dump the jerk! But is she truly guilty of his murder?Rinehart keeps you turning the pages, in a novel worthy of discussion groups about The Modern Crime Novel!"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education -","review":"This is an in-depth analysis about the many problems in the public school system in America. While reading it I often thought of Thomas Sowell's damming account of the public school system as detailed in his book \\"Inside American Education.\\" John Stormer covers many of the same areas and expresses many of the same concerns, but John Stormer does it from a religious standpoint. Both books are very concerned about the declining academic standards in the public school system, both books are explore how children are being brainwashed in public schools, and both books are very concerned with the political agenda of the NEA.John Stormer starts off by saying that before you can decide on what is the purpose of an education, you have to think about:1) What is the nature of man?2) What is his purpose?Most public school officials have a humanist point of view about the nature and purpose of man. John Stormer points out this leads them in fundamentally different directions than most Christian want to go.John Stormer quotes a number of professional educators who over the years have declared their intent to remake society, to \\"fix it up.\\" His opposition to this appears to be what drove him to write this book. He is concerned about the declining academic standards, and the first chapter documents how each year students are performing worse and worse in math, spelling, reading, history, and so on. Most of the rest of the book focuses how in different ways public schools are trying to remake society.There were a number of interesting points made in the book. For example John Stormer points out that it doesn't take years to teach Sex Education, the basics can be taught in an hour, maybe a couple hours if you really take your time. The reason Sex Education is taught for so long is to wear down the values being taught at home. Many at public schools are looking to have schools replace the family.If you are concerned about the decline in American Education over the last fifty years, but you aren't interested in a religious point of view, check out \\"Inside American Education.\\" If you are a Christian, and want more information on what is happening in public schools, this book is a good one to check out. \\"None Dare Call It Education\\" is well written and well documented."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Education -","review":"What passes for grade school education in this country is really a conspiracy to make us subservient to government.

I felt like I had to struggle to understand a lot of the poetry and the stories. I had to keep a French/English dictionary fairly close by at all times. It could have been the class and the professor (both of which I didn't care much for either) but I really struggled in this French class to make sense of the lessons.Also, it's a fairly expensive book and you don't get too much out of it. The CD is great to listen along with to help with your speaking, but really it's just reading some of the poems in the book. If you're buying this on your own I'd suggest you keep looking for something that will help you individually. If you, like me, are using it for class buy it used or rent it.

This book is the best I've been able to find! The only problem is it's out of print. This book contains many pictures, including ships, paintings from the pirate era, old maps, coins, and letters. It contains very very factual and articulate information, alot of which is straight from the horse's mouth (accounts from people captured by pirates) about pirates, the time era, the weapons they used, the ships they used, the ships used against them, the association between them and the US colonies, and several life stories of pirates including Edward Teach, Bartholomew Roberts, and the pirate king Sir Henry Morgan. The book is well organized, and it's packed from cover to cover, waisting little space where pictures or information can be placed. I recommend this book for anyone interested in pirates for any reason."},{"Title":"The Pirates","review":"\\"The Pirates\\" commences an intricate 22 volume series called The Seafarers, by Time-Life books. I have more of an interest in pirates than naval history, but this book was so well researched that I will make time to read a few other titles in this series, including \\"The East Indiamen,\\" (ships that play a large role in this history of \\"The Pirates\\"); \\"Fighting Sail\\"; \\"The Men-of-War\\"; and \\"The Vikings.\\"The book begins with a short essay focusing on Defoe's tales. Following this are seven woodcuts of pirates: Henry Every, Edward England, Stede Bonnet, Charles Vane, John Rackam, the Bartholomew Roberts, and Howell Davis. What better way to whet the readers' gnawing appetite? Most of the six chapters are preceded by an essay that focus on the dazzling details of the pirates' lives including the ships, the treasures, and the pirates' obscene ports.Two essays stood out as they were accompanied by extraordinary illustrations. The ships are laid out in front of the reader with amazingly detailed paintings by John Batchelor, ranging from flagships to the intimidating but exquisite East Indiaman. The essay entitled \\"A brawling lair for a lawless breed\\" contains four immense two-page drawings by Richard Schlecht depicting the lives of pirates relaxing among scarlet women and traders; the refitting and conversion of a newly acquired vessel; and a fantastic battle between two ships.Douglas Botting, the author, squeezes as much as he can in the slim 187 pages. He goes through the history of the pirates, from when they slowly appeared to the surge of popularity among maritime thievery, finally giving brief but detailed biographies of many famous pirates, including Henry Every, Captain Kidd (who is correctly recognized here as a privateer-gone-bad), Edward Teach (no introduction necessary, I hope), Howell Davis who mentored \\"the greatest pirate of the Golden Age,\\" Bartholomew Roberts, and more! Botting weaves their tales through the political backgrounds, their (close) associations with American politicians and English royalty. Noblemen's distinguished lifestyles and respectability were either fortified or annihilated by their greed. The late 17th/early 18th century was teeming with hypocrisies that would later nourish some of the most exciting Hollywood films centuries later! (Naturally, period authors were already romanticizing all things piratical by this time.)Botting's writing is far from dry, and he keeps this volume as tight and exciting as it is enlightening. With enough black & white and color illustrations, sidebars with photographs of ledgers (seeing a pirate's real handwriting gave me more shivers than any tales of hanging could), and fun quirky tales and trivia, \\"The Pirates\\" comes off as an adventurous historical novel that makes a great introduction to the true but still romantic era. The book is not long, and I recommend reading it before pursuing past and present novels (e.g. Daniel Defoe and George MacDonald Fraser) to get some of the inside references."},{"Title":"The Pirates","review":"A hard cover Time-Life educational book, I think it is out of print now but well worth tracking down a used copy. It may be the best reference book on pirates there is. This book is like a walk through a pirate musuem. Simply loaded with photographs, illustrations, diagrams, and paintings (some spread across two pages) of scenes and goods from the real pirates including weapons, ships, maps, and more. There are period accounts from those that dealt with pirates and knew firsthand of their behaviour, diet, ships, culture, and methods. The book also discusses those that pursued the pirates to justice. A comprehensive discussion of pirate flags, and treasures lost. Information on islands and colonies frequnted by the pirates. Also has biographies on many infamous pirates including Sir Henry Morgan, Walter Kennedy, Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Edward Low, Henry Every, Stede Bonnet, Emanuel Wynne, Jack Rackam, Christopher Moody, Edward Teach, Bartholomew Roberts, and many others. Includes a rare mention of female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read. Oversized format, nice black hardcover with gold gilt lettering, looks like leather but its not. I recommend to all persons interested in pirates at any age."},{"Title":"The Pirates","review":"In the legacy of the excellent \\"Vikings\\" and \\"Armada\\" from the same Time-Life \\"Seafarers\\" series, \\"Pirates\\" presents a well-researched, richly illustrated, engaging, and balanced portrait of the piracy of the late Middle Ages and Industrial Revolution. Little information is to be found on either ancient (e.g., Greek, Turkish) or modern (e.g., South China Sea) piracy. (We therefore avoid some particularly nasty, bloody facts, such as that pirates convicted by Turks were slowly flayed alive.) Your favorite characters are here--Blackbeard, Black Bart, Stede Bonnet, etc. (the females seem conspicuously absent, albeit)--along with absorbing, eye-catching sidebars investigating vessels, weapons, customs, flags, coinage, punishments, and so forth. Numerous myths are dispelled, and the author offers even-handed, apolitical coverage of the topics he has chosen to explore. Notably, the author strives to present the world of the pirate from both the villains' and the government officials' viewpoints. Through all, one discerns that pirates contributed rather more to the march of mankind than one might suspect offhand, to wit: their democratic principles; their means and methods of organization; even their indirect influences upon the development of the navies of the civilized world. The book is handsomely produced; not overly long or deep, reaching to 200 pages or so; and should make an excellent gift for the older student or the armchair sea dog.Angus Kostam's \\"The History of Pirates\\" (I know not of the newer version co-authored by Cordingly) is also a solid work--of similar scope, albeit less weighty of initial affect, thanks to its paperback binding--but, what if offers by way of glossier appearance and richer color, it makes up for by lack of depth of treatment. Aye, the twain be reasonably well matched, matey, but Botting's book rates the nod, ye scalawag! Ar, Jim Boy, Ar!(The stereotypic \\"Ar, Jim Boy, Ar\\" reminds me of the funniest sight gag I've ever seen. I believe it was an \\"In Living Color\\" episode [perhaps \\"David Letterman,\\" come to think of it] wherein a pirate--replete with patch over one eye and parrot perched on one shoulder--is spouting \\"ar, ar, eye, ee, ar.\\" The camera zooms outward to reveal--THE OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE! The pirate is READING AN EYE CHART with \\"R R I E R\\" in the top row!

I. Lenin wrote this book in 1917, while he was hiding from the Russian government. Lenin pointed out that \\"The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)\\". He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book.\\"The State and revolution\\" is a very short book, well structured and not difficult to read at all. Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters, but Lenin didn't conclude the seventh, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In the postscript to the first edition he explains that, saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time, but that all the same \\"It is more pleasant and useful to go through the \`experience of revolution' than to write about it\\".The main idea in \\"The State and revolution\\" is that the State is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class (a \\"special coercive force\\" that rules through violence). The State of the bourgeoisie will disappear, but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat (the working class) will become then the ruling class, \\"capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system. The proletariat needs state power, a centralized organization of force, an organization of violence, both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy.\\"The dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to Communism (\\"Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state\\"). According to Lenin, the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels. All throughout this book, Lenin cites and examines Marx and Engels' writings, in order to explain and support his own point of view.The importance of Marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously, but I advice you to read this book nonetheless. It is certainly not a grueling task, and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many Marxist leaders believed with all their hearts. Ideas drive men, and men make history. \\"The State and revolution\\" will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas, and that is not a small feat.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"This is one of books most interesting and challenging books I've ever read.

Lenin, drawing on the works of Marx and Engels extensively, refutes many claims by both the Anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state, and corrects many common errors believed about the Marxist road to Socialism. This is a thoroughly informative read. I recommend those wondering how a Communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book; It will open your eyes widely."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"I believe this is the best, concise revolutionary analysis of the role of the State ever written.I find it very annoying that here in the US, while many students may cursorily read the Communist Manifesto in school, I have never once met ANYONE in my life who has read the basic works of Lenin except for avowed Marxists (and only a minority of these)....and being a Communist myself, I have asked several students, and often looked through university bookstores to see if any poli-sci or history professors would break the \\"no Lenin allowed\\" rule.Consequently, there are many people on the \\"left\\" who pretend to understand Marx and/or Marxism, but still make the exact same errors to which Lenin here responded over 80 years ago.For example, someone just this week argued to me than Lenin was \\"not a real Marxist\\" (!!!) because he \\"introduced\\" the notion of \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\", which was \\"alien\\" to Marx (hint: read Chapter 4 of Marx's Critique of the Gotha Programme for just one of many passages which prove this notiontotally false). State and Revolution gives many more examples of extensive quotes from Marx & Engels. One of the greates merits of S&R; is that it restores the revolutionary essence to Marx, which was obscured and watered-down by the Social Democrat reformists of the 2nd International led by Karl Kautsky. Incidentally, the concept of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" has been much distorted by capitalist demagogues and anti-communist \\"leftists\\" into something completely alien to its original meaning.To all \\"Left academics\\" and others, don't assume (or pretend) you know anything about Marx or Lenin if you've never read them...If you have to be an academic \\"armchair radical\\", at least try to get the basic facts right instead of misrepresenting what they stood for...There's no shame in not having read Lenin (join the vast majority), but it's disgusting to just pass off what you've heard about Lenin from \\"bourgie\\" intellectuals as the truth (when the truth is those intellectuals never read Lenin either most likely).There are not a few pseudo-Marxist fakers in academia, who do more damage to popular revolutionary understanding (in the name of Marxism) than do the outright enemies of socialism. NO WONDER these \\"Left\\" anti-communist professors don't assign a book like State and Revolution, they're still trying to pass off the same lies and distortions about revolutionary Marxism that Lenin and other genuine revolutionaries tear to shreds in works like S&R.;I dedicate State and Revolution to all the \\"Marxian\\" fakers who still try to paint Marx as a mere liberal humanist reformer, and strip him of his revolutionary essence."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"_State and Revolution_ is a complicated book in the annals of Marxist thinking. Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's &quot;Revolution Betrayed&quot;."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"In general I find Lenin easier to read than Marx. This, in my mind, is the main value I see in State and Revolution. Lenin who was 50 plus years Marx's junior significantly elaborated and augmented Marx's analysis of capitalism, class struggle and the workers' revolution they hoped would do away with both. With 50 more years experience than Marx with the failures of \\"democratic socialism,\\" Lenin can argue more coherently that only a workers' revolution will end capitalism and class society. He also offers a more detailed analysis of the workers' state that is to replace the shattered capitalist state and his view of the economic and political processes by which this state will \\"wither away\\" to become true communism.The State and Revolution also includes a discussion of the 1848 French civil war (which was hoped to end class society altogether where the 1789 revolution had failed to do this) and the successes and failures of the 1871 Paris commune. It also includes a scathing attack on anarchists who seek to destroy the state without proposing any form of social organization to replace it. Lenin quotes Marx in expressing his concern that simply destroying the state political apparatus wouldn't be adequate - that members of the capitalist class would be certain to launch a counter-revolution - thus the need for the workers to remain organized and armed to protect their revolution.Much of the book attacks specific individuals by name, who Lenin accuses of deviating from true Marxism. For the most part these people have been lost to history. However after 30 years of sitting in political meanings where people can argue for three hours without agreeing on a vision or statement of purpose, I find it reassuring the Lenin himself dealt with these petty squabbles 100 years ago.By Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE"},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"V.I. Lenin's, \\"State and Revolution,\\" proved a refreshing, well-deserved expose of a patently dated, dehumanising, capitalist socio-economic paradigm which--irrespective of its having been penned in 1917 (and foreshortened by Revolutionary outbreak!)--remains, inasmuch as the aforementioned paradigm persists to this very day, a relevant read (and from more than merely an historical perspective).M. Lenin, succinctly and with precision in this but one-hundred page volume, reveals the present global paradigm for that which it de facto is: \\"capitalist slavery.\\" Yet, desideratively, the author not only illustrates the imperative of destroying and eliminating an exploiting, enslaving socio-economic systematic but--further and positively--thereupon offers a viable replacement.While by no means a tome, Lenin's work is dense with topical data. A few might be dismayed by the author's (a la Marx) occasional digressions constituting refutations of then current and competing communist or Social-Democratic, etc., theories (and their propagators): nonetheless, same-said--while but comprising a fraction of the work--are often interesting and enlightening in-and-of-themselves.Respective of exposing a mystifying, emasculating bourgeois ideology, Lenin cuts to the chase in \\"Preface To First Edition\\" (August, 1917):...the problem of elucidating to the masses whatthey will have to do for their liberation fromthe yoke of capitalism...Lenin also, and rightly, describes as \\"...our first task to resuscitate the real teachings of Marx...,\\" which comprises freeing same from interpretive misunderstanding and mendacity, adulteration, vulgarisation and the blunting and distortion of \\"their revolutionary edge.\\" Of course, and in instructive fashion, Lenin dismantles generally \\"non-desiderative\\" phenomena inclusive of \\"opportunism\\" and \\"anarchism,\\" while--in addition--smashing such nonsense as \\"philistinism\\" and \\"'reformist' stagnation.\\"Needless to say, Lenin's knowledge of Marx (and Engels) is solid, as he freely quotes telling passages from the renowned collaborators' texts. In recapitulation, most of V.I. Lenin's \\"State and Revolution\\" is (dismayingly) as germane presently as the day it was published. Lenin minces not words in bringing the capitalist paradigm to its theoretical knees, elucidating the concrete indispensability thereof considering same-said systematic's inherent pauperising, alienating, false-consciousness producing tendencies. Of course, and on the other side of the coin, a failure to expunge the capitalist socio-economic paradigm would preclude an inauguration of a de-alienated, human-, actualisational-promoting communist society.

A must-read for anyone interested in knowing what are the steps that a revolutionary-minded person can take to foster revolution."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"In an introductory college course on Marxism this book is the one most likely to be recommended after the \\"Communist Manifesto\\" and Engels' \\"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\\". This is partly because it is very readable and partly because it deals with the state both before, during and after the revolution - whereas Marx showed little interest in during and after.Like Marx, Lenin portrays the state in capitalist society as the oppressive forces of the bourgeoisie. This applies as much to democratic states as any other. And what of the \\"proletarian revolution\\" that is to topple the bourgeois state? Marx mentioned the phrase only twice in all his writings, including a reference in the Manifesto. It was left to others (notably Lenin) to enlarge on revolution and the transition to communism. Lenin, unlike Marx an active revolutionary, was more conscious of the problem of how a revolution can arise from the masses, particularly in a backward country such as his native Russia. His answer was to portray the communist party as \\"the vanguard of the proletariat\\" in planning an executing revolution. Equally he seized on Engels' comments on the proletariat seizing control of state institutions followed by a period in which the state \\"dies out\\" (or withers away), to develop the notion of an indefinite period of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" whereby the communist party would rule on behalf of the proletariat and progressively liquidate all remnants of the old bourgeois order.It is during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat (length not discussed) that the state finally disappears. In an important passage Lenin writes that there may be \\"excesses\\" by \\"individuals\\" but these can be dealt with by \\"the armed people itself, as simply and readily as any crowd of civilised people, even in modern society, parts two people who are fighting, or intervene to prevent a woman from being assaulted.\\" But once exploitation of the masses is removed then \\"with the removal of the chief causes, excesses will begin to \`wither away'.\\" Thereafter, according to Lenin, all that is needed in a classless society is \\"book-keeping and control\\". When all workers have learned to do this then \\"from this moment the need for any government begins to vanish.\\"Lenin seems to be suggesting that these functions could be carried out by workers en masse. Engels, however, had specifically attacked the Anarchists for wishing to destroy all authority, arguing that people had to be in charge of running enterprises even after a revolution. At any rate Lenin shared with Marx and Engels a very optimistic view of human nature. What distinguished Lenin, and makes this book so important, is the role he gives to communist parties as a \\"vanguard of the proletariat\\" and the significance of a \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\"."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"Lenin's State and Revolution is the most crucial analysis of the Marxian theory of the state and its relation to class struggle. Lenin was a revolutionary determined to reveal the provisional government's capitulation to the forces of imperialism and to revivify the revolutionary edge of Marxism that \\"socialists\\" had attempted to obscure. Lenin writes\\"According to Marx, the state is an organ of class domination, an organ of oppression of one class by another; its aim is the creation of \\"order\\" which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression by moderating the collisions between classes.\\"In Lenin's view, the aim of the revolutionary proletariat is to overthrow the state, and in turn, use it to redistribute the wealth and seize control over the means of production.

That is not always a given with Marxist literature.If you have read Marx and Engels or even just some introduction material on Marxism, this book might help you fill in the gaps around the role of the state, which is always a tricky subject when facing a population fixated on Stalin.If you, like me, always seem to find yourself in debates with anarchists, this book will help you understand the subtleties of the Anarchist vs. Marxist rift. It was worth its weight in gold for that alone. Unfortunately though, at only 100 pages, it wasn't very heavy."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"\\"The state and revolution\\" is Lenin's most well known work, perhaps alongside \\"What is to be done\\". It was written in 1917, and published in 1918. Strictly speaking, the work is unfinished. In a postscript, Lenin explains that the October revolution forced him to discontinue the work. Famously, he then adds that it's more satisfying to actually make a revolution, than to simply write about one!\\"The state and revolution\\" is Lenin's most \\"democratic\\" and \\"libertarian\\" work. He calls for a radically democratic state, a state which is no longer a state in the strict sense of that term, a semi-state based on the immense majority of the working people, which administers society directly without a bureaucracy, while overthrowing the tiny minority of exploiters and oppressors. In other words, Lenin calls for something akin to the Paris Commune. He hardly mentions the Bolshevik Party.In reality, Lenin and the Bolsheviks created a very different kind of state after the October revolution. It became a one-party regime, over which workers and peasants had little or no influence. The state became centralized and all-powerful, expressing the interests of a new bureaucratic class. At no point did Soviet Russia resemble the radically democratic semi-state of Lenin's book \\"The state and revolution\\".Some defenders of Lenin claim that this was due to the Civil War. Even if we accept this, it's still a refutation of Lenin, since he discusses civil war in \\"The state and revolution\\". There, he argues that the armed people could conduct such a war while still keeping the radically democratic form of their state. Besides, Lenin started building the authoritarian-centralized state immediately after the revolution, not waiting for the Civil War to start. The acting Russian government, the Council of People's Commissars or Sovnarkom, may have been nominally appointed by the soviets, but in practice it was a self-contained organ ruling by decree. For most of its existence, it consisted solely of Bolsheviks. Note also that the economic centralization started before the Civil War, with the Sovnarkom appointing the Vesenkha, the administrative organ charged with running Russian industry. The factory committees (organ of local workers' control) were soon squeezed out. Thus, Soviet Russia entered the Civil War with the centralized state apparatus already in place. Admittedly, the Sovnarkom was for a short period actually a coalition government between the Bolsheviks and the Left SRs, but this was mostly a tactic from Lenin's part. The entire logic of Bolshevism pointed in the direction of centralist, one-party rule. See all other writings by Lenin!Of course, it would be silly to expect perfect democracy during a revolution or civil war. The American Civil War and its aftermath wasn't perfectly \\"democratic\\", and neither was the civil war in 1980's Nicaragua. Yet, neither the Union nor Sandinista Nicaragua ever developed into bureaucratic one-party states. The South under Radical Reconstruction came close, but it immensely extended the democratic rights and liberties of the Black population. Indeed, Blacks in the Reconstruction South had more freedom than Russians in the Soviet Union!Those who claim that the Russian Civil War tragically made Lenin's visions come to naught, downplay both his previous record as an unregenerate state socialist, and the experiences from other civil wars. The real problem starts already with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who (quite honestly) believed it was possible to combine a centralized, planned economy complete with \\"industrial armies\\" with a radically democratic state based on \\"cheap government\\" directly by the working masses and their armed militia. (A strange combo of Saint Simon and Thomas Jefferson!) Real life has showed that this combination is impossible, or at the very least very, very improbable. If the state takes over the entire economy, i.e. virtually everything, democracy usually \\"withers away\\". Sandinista Nicaragua was democratic during the war against the contras, but note that they had a mixed economy, rather than a completely centralized command economy. The South during Radical Reconstruction wasn't state socialist either. The classic promise of the Union to the Blacks was \\"40 acres and a mule\\", i.e. \\"petty-bourgeois\\" private property.\\"The state and revolution\\", being a rather straight exegesis of Marx and Engels, is also marked by their nave ideas. Lenin eloquently describes how a centralized state apparatus, controlling the entire economy, will almost immediately start to \\"wither away\\" and \\"die\\", how such a state would make state administration run as smoothly, cheaply and efficiently as the German Post Office (!), how democracy will be denied only to a small minority of former exploiters, making such a state the most democratic hitherto known, etc. On a funnier note, Lenin also attempts to exegete the rather peculiar Marxist terminology about \\"the withering away of democracy under communism\\", a phrase I'm sure future dissidents could use very much to their (ironic) advantage...Did Lenin believe a single word of what he was saying in \\"The state and revolution\\"? I for one doubt it. The work simply doesn't fit the rest of the Leninist corpus. I think it was intended as a work of propaganda during a period when the Bolsheviks needed the support of the majority in the soviets. (I don't doubt that the October revolution as such had broad popular support.) Perhaps Lenin believed in his work as a kind of ideal. The actual dynamics, not just of the revolution and the civil war, but also of the attempts to create an entirely centralized, state-run economy, made the Bolsheviks stray from the course laid down in \\"The state and revolution\\".In effect, they made a statist revolution."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"In this short book, Lenin managed to outline the Communist hatred of America, and all things Capitalist, and how they plan to take over the world, through force,and the Communist disputes with Socialism.

He focused on the relationship between the state and classes both in the past and in the future. He asserted that the government and their subordinate agencies were not impartial in handling conflicts amongst classes. For him history was largely a record of class struggle and that the state in every society pursues the interests of the ruling class at the expense of society. The state for Lenin was a vehicle of exploiting the oppressed. No ruling class allows its rule to be abolished without armed struggle therefore revolutions should be expected to be violent. He professed the working class would have to engage in such struggle if it ever was going to gain power. The objective for this struggle would be for the eradication of all class based discrimination. After this privileges and antagonisms and conflicts, which they engendered, would be eliminated classes themselves would disappear.Lenin affirmed the workers should dismantle the bourgeois state once power was seized; and then the state should be re-constructed after the bourgeois overthrow. The dictatorship of the proletariat would follow. An entire intermediate epoch would separate the destruction of the power of the capitalism and the inception of the fully classless and communist society.He believed to rid the tyrants a violent struggle was needed. Contrary to the beliefs of Karl Marx that socialist may be able to gain power peacefully. Lenin professed that the bourgeoisie state machine must consequently be smashed; this would be achieved with the removal of the standing army, the police, the civil service, the judiciary and the clergy. For him it was a campaign of through repression.He believed that the freedom established in the freest capitalistic democracies was fully enjoyable only by the rich, who were not exhausted by the material and spiritual grind of poverty. Lenin contended that the economies of capitalism prevented most people from influencing the politics of any capitalistic society. Under socialism with the inception of dictatorship of the proletariat, the majority of the population would at least gain as distinct from purely formal enfranchisement. The majority would benefit from policies ending mass poverty and would take their unprecedented opportunity to engage vigorously in politics. The means of economic production would have stopped being privately owned. Lenin denied that the material equality was achievable in the first phase of transition to a communist society. The phase would be the dictatorship of the proletariat and would be typified by a pattern of wages rewarding individuals strictly in recompense for the work done by them for society."},{"Title":"State and revolution,: Marxist teaching about the theory of the state and the tasks of the proletariat in the revolution, ([Little Lenin library, v. 14])","review":"Why should anybody want to read a book written by Lenin?

This one did nicely. It opened with a bang, with a scene that was immediately tender and smoldering (but not overwrought!). Adam and Nichole's romance was never flat, and their love story carries all the way through the book. There were excellent dialog and characterizations, and the medical scenes were done well, which is important to me when I read a medical romance. I was especially captivated by the raw emotion in this book--the pain, the loss, and the despair of war, as well as the passion. The only thing I objected to was the subplot that brought Nichole back to Adam and that kept her in constant fear of her life. I never figured out why she needed to return Adam in the first place (other than for the romance to happen, of course), and why there was so much to-do about common highway bandits. But the lively narrative more than makes up for the thin plot, and the love story shines (except for the parts where you would simply like to throttle the hero and heroine, of course! But what's a good story without some shouting from the peanut gallery, right?)"},{"Title":"The Texan's Touch","review":"I love romances, I'm a fan of them.

There is no good or bad side -- only the human side of life and love."},{"Title":"The Texan's Touch","review":"During the final weeks of the Civil War, the Gray Shadows sneak into a Union encampment and kidnap Dr. Adam McLain so that the physician can treat one of their wounded soldiers. Adam quickly realizes that the soldier under his care is actually a female masquerading as a man. In spite of knowing that he will probably be killed by his captives, Adam works on the wounded soldier. The next morning, his patient, Nichole Hayward allows him to return to his unit.A few months after the war is over, Adam returns to his family's Indiana farm. However, he knows nothing will ever be the same for him. His fiancee, whose family made a bundle during the conflict, has become a wealthy snob, who expects Adam to snub his two beloved brothers. However, Nichole soon arrives and Adam finds himself attracted to his former patient. Adam is so worn out from the horrors of the war that he just may go through the motions of marrying his fiancee as opposed to running away with the woman he loves.THE TEXAN'S TOUCH is a terrific tale that shows the healing power love grants to assist individuals in recovering from the traumas of war. The lead protagonists are a wonderful duo and the support cast adds much authenticity to the moving novel. The fabulous story line could have been a classic if Adam's fiancee was a friendly, down to earth girl, causing Adam real guilt to deal with if he breaks off from her. Still, the post Civil War romance is a winner and the audience will wait anxiously for Jodie Thomas to relate the tale of Adam's older brother.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Texan's Touch","review":"Adam and Nichole's story was the last of the McLain books I read of the three brothers but at the top of the list for favorites. Melt my heart. Adam and Nichole were a perfect match for one another. I loved how feisty Nichole was and how she interacted with all the brothers. It was fun watching them become a family and the respect the brothers came to have for Nick, as well as truly liking her almost from the beginning. There were a number of funny scenes that made me chuckle between Nick and the brothers, especially the ones were the brothers tried to make Adam jealous. You could tell Nichole was made to be part of this family almost from the beginning. These were two wonderful, passionate characters and the supporting characters were an added bonus.

The appearance of &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; took me by happy surprise because I have been eager to know what became of Duane, Karla, Jacy, and Sonny. As usual, McMurtry writes with heart and insight in the most direct, meaningful prose.But my jaw dropped in disbelief. McMurtry implies that the character Duane Moore has enjoyed the novel and miniseries of &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; which puts him in the same universe in which &quot;Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Texasville&quot; were written and filmed.

It is a measure of McMurtry's brilliance that this is so.

There, to the consternation of his family and the town, he vows to live, eschewing motorized transportation, walking or bicycling everywhere. Thus begins the internal dialogue of a man discontent with his life.

He leaves his family, gives up all motorized transportation, and tries to figure out why his life somehow went wrong. The intervening years since Texasville and their effect on the primary characters are dealt with. The story ended with me wanting more, but this is clearly the end to this story."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"In the blink of an eye it seems we can go in this The Last Picture Show trilogy from a coming of age story in the Last Picture Show to a mid-life crisis story in Texasville to the struggle against mortality during old age story here. Or maybe it is just changing from one book to another. Ya, right? There may be a space of thirty years between the action in The Last Picture Show and Texasville and another fourteen between Texasville and Duane's Depressed but it hardly a blink of the eye. It takes effort to build up to the mid-life crisis (or better crises) and then apply those lessons to the struggle against mortality that form the central idea of this novel as those of the generation of '68 and older are painfully aware. But so be it.By one of life's little quirks this reviewer is the same age as Duane in this phase of his life's story, 62. Therefore the reviewer can sympathize, understand and relate to the struggle against the vicissitudes of morality that, in the final analysis, Duane is struggling against. Duane's whole life has been consumed by the notion of duty, doing the right thing and keeping his own counsel to the exclusion of having any close personal relationships, including with his wife Karla. One day he decides, rightly by this reviewer's lights, to chuck his old life, at least the symbols of it. The tale told here revolves around that break out, the separate lost of his dear wife Karla in fatal automobile accident and his struggle to find a new place in his world without her. Along the way Jacy and Sonny the companions of his youth also pass from the scene. In an odd sense he is the last one standing.Needless to say all of this introspection is going to take a lot out of a very stoic man like Duane. Moreover, a review of his whole life means a look at lots of things that are not obvious. Probably the best little literary trick that McMurtry uses here is to link Duane up with a sexually unattainable woman psychiatrist who recommends reading Marcel Proust's Remembrances of Things Past as a form of discovery. This is a monumental work that has baffled more than one intellectual as to its meaning. Hell, on reflection, it probably baffled Proust. The trick is that Duane actually struggled to read it overt the course of a year. I suggest that the alternate translation of Proust's book is more appropriate to what Duane was looking for-In Search Of Lost Time. That, my friends, is what we all face as we face mortality. If you are going to read Larry McMurtry read this trilogy. That's the ticket."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Back to Thalia to revisit our old friends and a 62 year old Duane reviewing his life and wondering whether it's been all it should have been.

Well, the whole story is too unlikely, but, since anything can happen in Texas, it's also believeable. As usual, the description of place and people is fantastic.

They are all older and now Duane has a passel of grandchildren living in his mansion.The story starts out as he pulls into his garage in his pickup truck and decides he's finished driving, for good. In fact, he decides, he is done with life and goes off to live by himself 6 miles from the house in a utility cabin. He walks everywhere, which is unheard of in the middle of Texas. He claims to have missed too much of life while in the cab of his truck. His wife and family struggle to deal with his Thoreau-like lifestyle.Duane struggles with depression as he tries to figure out where his life went. What has he accomplished in 62 years? He eventually sees a psychologist who helps him realize his problems. Many of the prinicipals characters are also written off; they are dead or die in the course of the story.McMurtry delivers a powerful character study.

True, the character of Duane is fascinating, and there is a good deal of wonderful humor. However, Duane is never really depressed except in others' eyes, and I found that assignment almost insulting. The fact is that he shows no signs of depression, he is sort of goaded into visiting the psychiatrist, he falls in love with her almost instantly, has a flood of tears and a great understanding far too soon in the doctor-patient relationship, and in general the entire psychological development, from the &quot;walking&quot; start to the &quot;pyramidal&quot; finish, is written in an all-too sophomorish manner. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had reread &quot;The last picture show&quot; or read &quot;Texasville&quot;.

However any concerns that Mr McMurtry has lost his touch are put to rest in this surprisingly strong and touching conclusion to the Thalia trilogy.McMurtry's storytelling is always entertaining, and what makes Duane's Depressed so worthwhile is this ability to keep readers interested and involved for over 400 pages. This is certainly one of his more mature works and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"This book hit me straight in the heart. I got so wrapped up in this book, that I couldn't put it down. I did not read the first two of the trilogy, I wasn't aware that is was a trilogy when I bought it. It is not that important. The way that Duane was depicted in this book was amazing. I felt as if I really identified with him. I recommend it to anyone whose heart is searching."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"This book is a sequel to Texasville which is a sequel to The Last Picture Show. I have read both of the latter books and have seen the movies for each one. One should probably see the two movies before reading the third book in the series. Some characters are the same in all the books and McMurtry mentions other characters in the earlier books that have gone on to other lives and deaths in this latest novel.I related to this latest one in the series because it is written from Duane's point of view and he is exactly my age for the period of the book. While I am not exactly from the part of Texas where the book is set, I have been through there many times and know the area. Whereas I thought, from the opening lines of the book, that it might somehow deal directly with the issues of sustainability and more simple living, I did not find any of the catch phrases of this movement in the book. There is however, much indirect evidence that McMurtry was thinking along these lines as Duane parked his pickup, hid the keys and started to walk everywhere from then on. Duane's shrink convinced him to get a bicycle, but he was never in a motorized vehicle during this entire book. Seeing the countryside as a pedestrian or a bicyclist brought out the environmentalist in Duane. Reading this book gives one a clue to the challenges that one would have in promoting Sustainability and Simplicity in that part of the world. Issues of family and extended family are dramatized, and while the children and grandchildren are treated in a positive way at the end, in the beginning of the book, the opposite is true.The book deals with Duane's retirement and his mixed feelings about what he has accomplished in 62 years. I certainly identify with this dilemma. I believe that McMurtry developed some heart problems around the time of his publishing this book and subsequently had successful bypass surgery. In this story, he ironically, perhaps wishfully endows Duane with low blood pressure, low cholesterol and low PSA scores. In a subsequent non-fiction book, Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen, McMurtry discusses this brush with mortality. He also gives a history of his family in this part of Texas and his growing up in Archer City where he has built a library to house his huge book collection, many of which he discusses in Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen. If one is looking for a bibliography of books that one \\"should\\" read, this is it, in my opinion.What I like about McMurtry's characters is that most are not criminals, sociopaths and dysfunctionals. Most are just trying to get along in life. True he does cover the colorful characters of the west such a Billy the Kid and Calamity Jane, among others. He uses dialogue very skillfully to tell the stories, especially in the earlier parts of a book. In a couple of books, he seems to have grown weary and resorts to a straight narrative in the latter portions in order to fill in gaps and describe what happens to certain characters."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"This is the third volume in the trilogy which includes THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and TEXASVILLE.Set in Thalia, Texas, once again, Duane Moore, now 62, is beginning to feel his age and mileage. He's tired of the rat race that seems to permeate his life, so he leaves his wife and home and takes up residence in a nearby cabin. He gives up driving and walks (then bicycles) everywhere, sometimes over great distances. He builds a huge garden in which he grows just about every foodstuff imaginable, cares for it religiously 10 hours a day, and gives all the food away to the poor who come for it. He begins going to a psychiatrist in Wichita Falls who tells him to read all of Proust, which he struggles through. (Proust is McMurtry's favorite writer.) Finally, he flies off alone to Egypt.This novel is a major achievement for McMurtry, a big step up from TEXASVILLE in the trilogy. He is much more focused on his characters, and his insights are more penetrating. Some of the things he has Duane do in his search for redemption and meaning in life are outlandish (as only McMurtry could be), but he pulls them off convincingly (even when we begin to doubt the believability of things). Top-drawer McMurtry and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"In a word - surprised. This trilogy has a consistent quality that McMurtry did not even approach with the Lonesome Dove series. Maybe starting a story in the middle and working sequel, pre-prequel and then prequel and is just too hard. And the money's the same, good or bad. I did not love this as much as I despised Dead Man's Walk, but I thought that things were wrapped up well. Since you know that he's liable to kill off just about anyone at anytime, the deaths in this book while they invoke some melancholy, didn't jolt you like those in Lonesome Dove. Larry McMurtry at his best makes me laugh out loud. That happened more often than usual in Duane's Depressed."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I have read many books by this author. I enjoyed the characters and how they interacted with others. The last book in the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series and this one are both no fun and this is one of the reasons I read them. Just coming to the conclussion that old age sucks seems too easy with no real depth.Duanes interaction with his wife and his friends are absent from this book and I really don't care about the doctor's character at all. I would have been more interested in how he and his peers handle old age together."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Is it just me, or does anyone else see Duane as a modern version of Woodrow Call? I can imagine Woodrow doing everything Duane does, saying everything Duane says, and thinking everything Duane thinks. Even Duane's task of reading Proust mirrors Woodrow's hauling Gus back to Texas.I was also disappointed in that so many of Duane's acquaintances are eccentrics. Pervasive eccentricity is believable in the context of frontier Texas; it is not in modern America.And finally, Woodrow/Duane just aren't interesting without Gus. &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; lacks a Gus."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":".......and so am I, after reading this. Well, almost reading it. I gave up in the middle. Yaaawwwn. Too bad McMurtry has lost his touch. I read the two reviews preceding mine but found I totally disagreed with their opinions. I, too, had previously read The Last Picture Show and Texasville. I've seen the movies that go with the books. I adore Jeff Bridges and had always thought he made a terrific Duane. I like quirky characters as much as the next reader but I didn't connect with any of the ones in this book. The little kids were big-mouthed brats, their &quot;parents&quot; had never grown up and probably never would. I had always liked Karla and Duane but I just didn't feel anything for them. Maybe I'll just re-read Lonesome Dove, my all-time favourite McMurtry. This new book just didn't &quot;do it for me.&quot;"},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Duane has a dog Shorty for company. He doesn't really want his wife Karla or the townspeople around him. In the past, instead of rehabilitation he had taken up bass fishing. His son Dickie has returned to Thalia and Duane is ready to turn the oil business over to him. Earlier Duane had stopped driving and had moved to a cabin on his property. He walked everywhere.After seeing a psychiatrist he drank five whiskeys and slept for fifteen hours. He felt anxious, as he he did once when Karla nearly bled to death. Staying in Wichita Falls to see the psychiatrist, Duane needed to have someone bring him some clean clothes from Thalia. It is common for people to feel tired from therapy. Duane is reading Thoreau. Larry McMurtry is great, but this really is an absolutely sad book.When he returned to the cabin on a new bike, Karla came over to check on Duane. It seems that Karla has taken to watching the twenty-three MONTY PYTHON videos the couple possesses. Duane encounters the going postal fear when he tries to obtain a passport renewal form in Wichita Falls. I had forgotten that Michael Jordan started the craze for shaved heads. Duane's younger son, Jack, the wild pig catcher has shaved off the hair on his head much to the distress of his mother.The therapy is interrupted by the accidental death of Karla. The psychiatrist recommended that Duane attempt REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST in order to learn about dealing with disappointment. Duane moves back to his household filled with grandchildren and uses the couch in the den for sleeping. Proust and a big garden with surplus for poor people occupies him when his family settles down and his children step in to perform as parents to their children. In the end he does undertake a journey to Egypt."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Truly lives up to the true sense of the word.

Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of westerns and didn't know much about any of his other novels. I chose Duane's Depressed after reading the back cover, and was incredibly impressed. I especially enjoyed the beginning chapters and the dialogue of the children. But I thought the novel faltered after the death of Karla, and the reasons for his not becoming involved with Honor were unusual and questionable. I also wondered why he desired to see Egypt, of all places. All in all, a wonderful novel, and I will continue to read McMurtry and follow Danny Deck in the sequels to All My Friends, but I was disappointed with the ending to this novel."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Reading any of McMurtry's sequels is a pointless exercise. They may have literary merit, but for those of us who just want to read the next installment, they are merely one big down. His earlier novels created memorable characters we cared about; his later works dispose of them with reckless abandon. How 90's!"},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Duanes Depressed is one of the slowest and most annoying books I have read in a long time. The book was lacking any sort of reasoning that would compel the reader to want to go on!

Do not waste your time with this one. Good thing I got it at the library."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I've read and enjoyed most of McMurtry's books but found this one quite disappointing. The beginning was wonderful but about halfway through, the book turns into a boring and oversimplified advertisement for the magic of psychoanalysis.Bob Ray"},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"As the price of books continues to escalate, I find that I am continually cutting back on the authors whose books I automatically buy in hardback without consulting any reviews. As my all-time-favourite author, Larry McMurtry is at the top of this shrinking list - even though on occasion one of his books might disappoint me (The Late Child being a recent case in point). I'm glad to say that Duane's Depressed equals anything in McMurtry's recent output, with the possible exception of Comanche Moon (and, of course, Lonesome Dove just over a decade ago). I thoroughly enjoyed this book, read it in about two days, will return to it again, and recommend it to everyone, especially casual McMurtry readers. It's funny, sad, moving, and entertaining, and a wonderful closure to the forty-plus years of the Duane Moore saga. (Incidentally, I'm still waiting for that ultimate McMurtry book in which he ties together characters from every single book he has previously written!)."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"This is the 3rd &amp; &quot;Best&quot; of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; trilogy.I can't wait till tis becomes a movie!Hopefully the entire cast from &quot;Texasville&quot; can be back to give us such great comedy and drama.Those who said this is a sad story are miss reading it I beleive. I have always viewed Duane's character as more pathetic than sad. True alot of the plights and things that have occured in Duane's life could be viewed as sad. I tend to view the character as a rich guy leading the average Joe middle-class life. I find this trilogy fasciating more &amp; more as it shows us how all the story's character's past affects the future of a family's up brignning and lifstyles. How it affects Duanne is the main point. The things that happen are comical more so than sad. Yes this is a drama, yes it has very excellent depth and darkness, yet somehow I always view it more in a comical way. The story is complete and more than satisfying. THIS MUST BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!!!To not put this one on the screen would be a shame. I know &quot;Texasville&quot; didn't fare well at the box office, but this one has excellent potential to be another great success like the original. The character depth in this story (in my opinion) relates more back to the characters'study thus allowing for great perfomances and possible academys. This finale is by far the best of the three just because it tells how people come of age. It's a story about life.Jeff Bridges and the rest of the orginal actors need to be brought back for &quot;The Best Picture Show&quot;."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I have read most of the mcmurty books, and i just love this one the most. duane's problem is all our problems, and his solution is the one i would really like to try , it makes for a fascianting story, backed with such lyrical prose. one of the best books i have read in the past several years, and i read 2/5 books a week. i read the books out of sequance, and it didn't really matter."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"You will not understand this book without having read at least Texasville. Duane's Depressed left me once again wanting more. Who gave McMurtry permission to end this book this way? I beg him to write another book with these same characters. If you read this book you will know why."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Duane woke up one morning and just decided to walk. He didn't ride in a car again for about 3 years. The thing is, this was just not normal behavior for a successful Texas oilman, and everyone had a hypothesis about what was bothering Duane. Duane himself couldn't really explain it. Thus Duane's Depressed : A Novel is author Larry McMurtry's exploration into the mind of Duane.It is part light comedy, part serious reflection, and part Henry David Thoreau (you have to read it to understand).Duane goes through a LOT during the 3 years of this book. The reader will grow and explore with him.I think this is part of a trilogy, but this is the only book in the series that I read. It stands alone very well."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Enjoyed it because it is McMurtry, but not great.

Amazon kept me from wasting money.Thanks, Amazon."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Duane's Deppressed was a slow starter for me, but in shortorder became a cherished memory. For any man who has ever experienceda &quot;life-purpose&quot; crisis or awakening, you will find Duane Moore's journey to be thought provoking, validating, and worthwhile. McMurtry is a master of dialoge and a weaver of a story that will cause you to care deeply about the direction of this one man's life. Treat yourself to this probe into &quot;everyman&quot; and his reconcilation with the world around him."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I hated &quot;The Last Picture Show.&quot; Maybe it was because I had seen the film first. The humor in the novel seemed out of place, for some reason. On the other hand, the humor in &quot;Texasville&quot; was appropriate, making it a much better novel. &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; is the best of the three, mainly because it is unexpected. I had no idea what direction this novel was going to follow, especially after &quot;Texasville.&quot; Duane reads Proust, rides a bike, gives his dog to a prostitute, and sees a psychiatrist. These hardly seem to be central events of a great novel, but McMurtry makes it all work. Reminds me of Call bringing Gus' corpse back to Texas, for some reason."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Followed Abbey's &quot;Fools Progress&quot; with this little one day read.

Having felt like I've known Duane, Ruth, and Sonny since the early 70s, it was like reading about old friends. McMurtry is unparalleled with his use of the English language in the way he paints pictures with the characters' thoughts and dialogue. All of his characters are so real - perhaps quirky, but real. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments in this book as well as a couple of heart-in-your-throat ones. McMurtry fans, enjoy this one! Newer readers may want to begin with another of his masterpieces.

I loved it."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Living in the area that McMurtry hails from and writes about in the Duane Moore trilogy has made me a bit biased in regards to this series. I never-the-less found each of the books in this series to be entertaining and well written. This last book has given a fitting end to characters that we have come to love and feel for. The characters each have traits that many of us can relate too. Duanes depression and Karla's attempts to understand and the reaction of the children and grandchildren all combine to make this a wonderful story. And even if you don't find it to be a story that you would want to reread in the future, it will definately make you realize that no matter how hard to live with your own kids are, that they are not so bad compared with Duane and Karla's kids and grandkids."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"How often does one laugh outloud when reading a book?

(It was a pretty good movie as well). It really turned me on to this then-promising young author. When the sequel, \\"Texasville\\", came out years later, I read that as well. It turned out to be one of the worst books I have read. McMurtry's style of writing changed after his heart attack and his writing really suffered since shortly after \\"Lonesome Dove\\" came out. Still, I found myself continuing to read most every book of his that came out and wanting to be there when the old McMurtry showed up again.After my experience with \\"Texasville\\", I bought, but was reluctant to read, \\"Duane's Depressed; the sequel to \\"Texasville\\". As I started out with the book I thought to myself, \\"This is what's wrong with the post-angina McMurtry\\". The problem is the excessive abundance of boringly idiotic characters. They're like an influx simplistic and Americanized people out of a Fellini movie. What made me almost put the book down and quit it is the multitude of Duane's children and grandchildren who are nothing but out of control spoiled brats. If this was the only book that I encountered these type of characters, I wouldn't mind. However, they overflow in all of the modern McMurtry.As I struggled through a cast of totally disinteresting characters, I reached a point (at about a fourth of the way into the book) where the book really started to take off. We lose the dysfunctional offspring and start focussing on Duane Moore. His is a character well-developed by an author that was showing he's still got it. I found myself drawn into Duane and his life and challenges. I found myself relating to a man who was facing many things similar to what I was dealing with in my life. For the duration of the book, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. It was a truly endearing study of a man bewildered by his past, present and future. As Duane was struggling with his issues, I found myself wondering if McMurtry was being autobiographical. I know next to nothing about his private life. It wasn't until his 14th or 15th book that a picture of him was shown on any dust jacket and that's the same picture that has appeared on every book since. Maybe it's an analogy of how his life changed after his heart attack. Whatever it was, the character of Duane takes me back to the early talent of Larry McMurtry.This is a very good book that just happens to start out poorly. It isn't up there with \\"The Last Picture Show\\", \\"Lonesome Dove\\", \\"Leaving Cheyenne\\", or \\"Horseman Pass By\\". However, it IS in the category of \\"Moving On\\", \\"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers\\", \\"Terms of Endearment\\" and several others. When McMurtry's good he is VERY good but when he is bad..."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Picking up this book was like attending a family reunion. I had that same sense of visiting with people I hadn't seen in years but still cared about. You want to reminisce and catch up on what everyone's been up to. It's been years since I read Texasville and over a decade since I read The Last Picture Show. Nevertheless, I was immediately able to fall back into the rhythms of Thalia, Texas. &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; picks up several years after Texasville and once again focuses on Duane Moore and his family. The book opens with Duane's decision to give up motorized vehicles, a move that shocks the entire town and throws Duane's wife into a panic. Pedestrians, you see, are unheard of in Thalia. Typical of McMurtry's novels, the dialogue is extremely funny and true to life. McMurtry has an amazing ability to point out the ridiculousness of most human behavior without demeaning his characters. And he thoroughly captures the eccentricities of small town life. Even though this is basically a story about regrets and missed oportunities, it never becomes melancholy or dismal. This is a stronger book that Texasville, but no less entertaining. I highly recommend this book for all McMurtry fans, especially if you've read the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I havne't read the first two books in this trilogy, but I found this book engaging and entertaining. Neither being in my sixties or male, I still found Duane's struggles interesting to read. This book is about a man who wakes up one day and decides to walk away from his life, literally, and push forward in a new direction. I think anyone of any age can relate to that kind of story, where the character is questioning his existence and wondering what it's all about. I would say in some ways this is a philosophical book, but it's also very entertaining and easy to read. I was glued to turning the pages, wanting to find out what would happen next. A great read."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I am a HUGE McMurtry fan - the Lonesome Dove trilogy ranks right up there as an all time favorite of mine.

However, the jacket notes of this book intrigued me and I jumped in. I'm glad I did, too!This is a book for anyone who has thought about the meaning of life; who has been depressed; who has lived with someone with depression; who has made it to 50; who has lost someone they love; who has not quite lived up to their teen-age reputations. In other words, this is a book that anyone over 40 can relate to...you don't have to be male to understand Duane's desperation or despondency.I gave this book to my spouse to read...hope he finds as much enjoyment and enlightenment as I did.A great read and well worth my precious spare time."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I've had to put duct tape on a few papber back books; Lonesome Dove, Three Musketeers, Baja Oklahoma, Gone with the Wind, Texasville, the Good News Bible, because I reread parts of them so often the bindings wear out.

I love a book that's well written AND makes me laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Larry McMurtry delivers us the human condition again and Proust-Thoreau as a bonus. Duane cyles through depression, irritation, loss of identity, love and comes to a soft landing on a cloud of understanding. He learns a few things about contentment and Proust teaches him to see the validity of his life now -- the pyramids aren't inherently better than Texas -- IF you pay attention.Excellent book for thinking people."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Lonesome Dove is one of my favorite books of all time and I have enjoyed all of his other books (Terms of Endearment, Comanche Moon, Buffalo Girls, Anything for Billy, Streets of Laredo, etc) however I had trouble finishing Duane's Depressed. The first half of the book rolled along but the second half became unbearably slow. I felt like I was reading a character study by James Joyce.This book did not have the memorable characters characteristic of McMurtry novels. Imagine Lonesome Dove being a character study of Woodrow Call, it certainly would not win a Pulitzer. Maybe I prefer the Lonesome Dove saga better. I still recommend this book to those who love the Texasville series but for first time Larry McMurtry readers, try reading Lonesome Dove or Terms of Endearment before you read this book."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"I tried.

In contrast to many authors, McMurtry doesn't use a death to rescue the plot, but to develop the survivors' character. Bobby Lee, Ruth, Dickie, Rag, Sonny, they all live on. Could be you have to have passed 55 or so to love this novel, but for me it's 6-star.

It is a touching tale about a man on the wrong side of 60 finally thinking about who he is. You see Duane break things down to the essentials with who he is and what he needs. He gives up his truck. He gives up his fancy house. He gives all that up for something greater: Actually getting to know himself.It's one of the finer pieces of American existentialism out there.

He is a mild-mannered, aging and ordinary man whose walk to his cabin becomes a metaphor for his itch for a new life. The narrative begins with Duane surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren, as well as the trappings of a typical rural life in that part of the country and ends with a world turned upside down and without any remnants of his past. Is Duane depressed or going through a phase considered normal for a sixty-two year old? Why won't he sleep in his own house any longer and could his abandonment of his truck, in favour of walking, be proof enough that he has a few marbles loose now?As Duane progresses through a profound transition much happens that might not have made sense once, but makes for perfect congruity with the new man. The family is gone, the business is in one son's hands, the dog is gone and the lesbian psychiatrist is not likely to be kissed anytime soon. What would any man do? What would any sane man do? Fly away?Read Duane's Depressed - a book which reads comfortably without the prerequisite of its prequels - and find out."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Larry McMurtry, simple put, is my favorite author. I'm always excited to revisist his characters whether they're returning from &quot;Terms of Endearment,&quot; &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; or &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; but always saddened to find out that I've reached the end of these sequels and trilogies.For the first time, &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; didn't leave me with such sad feelings when I finished the last page. By some miracle, Duane Moore survives through this last volume of the trilogy (unlike many main character's of Mr. McMurtry's other novels) and leaves me feeling hopeful. Often funny, sometimes depressing, &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; is an excellent example of how well the author can jump back into former character's minds and tell a wonderful story. Even if you haven't read the previous two novels in this series, never fear: Larry McMurtry has developed these characters so well by this time that you won't have felt liked you missed much.I would recommend &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; among one of my favorite's from my favorite author. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"If your looking for plot,or a treatise on depression, you won't find it here. What you will find, in what is probably McMurtry's final novel, is a character study about missed opportunities (and the lack of opportunities)in a small town in Texas. If you know and love these characters, as McMurtry obviously does, you will probably love this book. I did."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"You feel as if you have grown up with all the characters.You will find yourself putting yourself and others you actually grew up with into the novel.

Some of the things that happened bothered me, but disappointing things happen in life, and this book reflected what life is about. I enjoyed finding out how the Moore family developed, but I truly relished how McMurtry showed that sadness can lead to triumph and change. First Texasville, one of my favorite books, and now this one -- thanks, Mr. McMurtry. The people of Thalia are my people, too."},{"Title":"Duane's Depressed (Last Picture Show Trilogy)","review":"Duane's sixty-two. Unhappy too. He was not educated. He can't speak a foreign language. He has not traveled. He knows nothing of the great cities of the world. He has never visited a great museum, seen a great picture, or heard a great symphony. The only book he has ever finished is Lonesome Dove. In short, he doesn't know much. One thing he does know: He doesn't want to live a single day more as he had been living, nose to the grind stone, driving around in his pickup and going through the motions of running his oil patch business that had long since ceased to interest him. No one, including Karla his long-suffering wife, has a clue about his real feelings. So when Duane stops driving and starts walking that is an earthquake. Fiction like this concerned with the marginalization of men and about masculine problems is much needed in our estrogenized world. But says Nina of page 477, &quot;Is it wrong to ask for a little precision?&quot; I listed multiple artistic quia imperfectum and 17 inconsistencies in the narrative including errors in time sequencing (Unabomber was caught in 1996 way before not after Princess Di died), character profile (Duane is a slow reader until page 414 when he recalls he is a speed reader (Read Time in 45 seconds) because he took the Evelyn Woods course), and fact (you can't shoot off your little toe and expect to have a piece recoverable for reattachment, Cairo is not on the Mediterranean Sea, people awake from nightmares realizing the dream was not real not the other way around etc.). Oh well, it's hard to write a deep book about a shallow character. Duane's interior life looks like the cab of his pickup, empty space. Don't let that happen to you. By the way, turn the cover on the side rotating it counterclockwise and you'll wee where Duane lives, a country as desolate as his soul."},{"Title":"What's Wrong With Christian Rock?","review":"In 1998 I reviewed this book when I was strongly biased against Christian rock music. Because I cannot figure out how to retract the old review, I offer this public admission that I was completely nave when I read the book.

However it is a shame that many are willing to throw the dishes out with the wash water. It doesnt take very long to realize that very few have taken Jeff Godwin on.

The bible clearly says that Satan was the angel of ALL music.Also, many of the hymns in our Sunday hymnals are based on the melodies of old pub songs. Gospel music is derived from American country/western music which in turn was derived from standard blues scales and song structure...which, ironically, is also where rock and roll comes from...LOOK IT UP.Regardless of Satan's role as angelic musician, the church has always used music as an instrument of praise. If the chuch is going to be hypocritical about music, then maybe it should keep up.As music evolves, the use of the new music styles can also be turned into instruments of praise.There is absolutely no better way to reach a fan of rock music than to use his own music as a method of spreading the word.The closed-minded view that Rock music is evil and your Gospel music is somehow holy is precisely why the people that would read this book are completely ineffective in bringing young people to Christ....oh and by the way...In high school, a \\"new kid\\" at school gave me a tape of a band called \\"The Crucified\\". That tape introduced me to Christ in a way that 16 years of sunday school never did.

Yes, Satan is very crafty indeed, but not crafty enough for Godwin not to see right thru his elaborate masquerade! This book is solidly entertaining! Bound to offend Christian rockers."},{"Title":"Dictatorship of the Air: Aviation Culture and the Fate of Modern Russia (Cambridge Centennial of Flight)","review":"Palmer's book isn't another treatise about the design of Russainaircraft or WWII military air campaigns. Instead readers will find a sophisticated treatment of original Russian sources, including newspapers, propaganda, poetry, and insitutional state directives that provides a myriad of perspectives on a single, but monumental, event in the history of mankind: human flight. The story of flight in Russia is more compelling and offers a greater understanding of Russian-Soviet life than similar histories of European and American aviation because itcoincided with another unprecendent and no less monumental event: the establishment of the Soviet Union.Palmer argues that state officials in both Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union latched on to aviation as symbol and tool of their nation's progress and as proof of their standing in the modern world. Importantly, while the Russian autocracy failed to successfuly create a nation of fliers through voluntary associations (as was acheived in Western Europe and the United States), the Soviet Union also failed to do so, and rather spectacularly. As in many other endeavors, Soviet officials refused to face the difficulties inherent in their undertaking. They sought to create both a modern state and a modern aviation culture by fiat. Palmer rather dramatically explains how thetragic story of the Soviets' failed attempt unfolded to the detriment of their citizens.The book's numerous photographs, prints, and propaganda posters as well as Palmer's original translations of poetry, literature, and state archival material make this a book that stands out from its scholarly peers. Between these fascinating materials and Palmer's elegant prose one almost forgets that this is a work from an academic press.Palmer's history is well researched and his depiction of avaition under the Imperial and Soviet regime is convincing. My only quibble is with the final chapter wherein Palmer makes a nod to the post WWII era of Russian history arguing that subsequent events demonstrate continuity with the patterns he has described for the first half of the 20 century. It is only in hindsight (and after 1991, save Robert Conquest) that onecould refer to the Soviet period of Russia's history as a complete failure. Given the obstacles and backwardness that so many historians, like Palmer, have described in the Imperial and the Soviet eras, it may be worth examining in more detail the relative success, however ugly the means, that the Soviets achieved in space flight and creating an air fleet second only to the United States during the height of the Cold War."},{"Title":"Dictatorship of the Air: Aviation Culture and the Fate of Modern Russia (Cambridge Centennial of Flight)","review":"Imperial Russia was visited by early aviators and was instantly fascinated by airplanes. Because Russia was the most backward of the great nations, its leaders, beginning with Peter the Great, sought to modernize the country to compete with other Western European nations. Could aviation give Russian leaders the right tool to spark modernization?Airplanes were sent into rural areas for the first time to be inspected by villagers. Pilots answered questions, passed out literature and gave free flights to amazed peasants.Dr. Scott W. Palmer explains how \\"rural believers were taken into the air by pilots in order to prove that there was no God, angels or other celestial spirits in the heavens. Anti-religious flights proved so successful that they quickly became standard practice.\\"Dr. Palmer describes aviation's powerful propaganda value. \\"The mastery of the airplane would make possible backward Russia's rapid transformation into the world's most advanced and powerful nation.\\"Russia's leaders were in a hurry to gain legitimacy from mastering aviation. Russia set about acquiring airplanes and manufacturing methods from other countries in her haste to build legitimacy in the world's eyes.For years, the Russian aviation industry struggled to do more than make poor copies of airplanes from other nations.Dr. Palmer relates, \\"They embellished actual accomplishments, exaggerating, and at times inventing, Russian achievements when, in fact, much less progress had been made.\\"Record setting flights were carried out to bring world attention to Russian aviation through goodwill. Soviet leaders deliberately insisted on developing the largest airplanes in the world, even if the had no practical value other than propaganda.Soviet leaders praised their air crews as heroes that flew to better their homeland and \\"benefit their fellow countrymen\\" -- not for money and fame -- like Charles Lindbergh had.With the country stuck in depression, the American aircraft industry eagerly sought sales anywhere it could. In an effort to find customers , the Soviets were invited to visit American factories. As delegation after delegation came and went, Soviet industrial spies quickly set about stealing manufacturing secrets and techniques.In the Spanish Civil War, Russian military aircraft were proved to be most inferior, and she entered World War II poorly equipped. After the war, German designers and manufacturing technology were taken back to Russia for assimilation into the aviation industry.By 1947, Russia was able to reverse-engineer a fair copy of the American B-29 Superfortress. Then, at last, Russia was able to surprise the west during the Korean War by developing the Mig jet fighter series by incorporating state-of-the-art British jet engine technology.Readers interested in aviation or Russian history will find \\"Dictators of the Air\\" a fascinating study of one area of Russia's age-old struggle to surpass the west.\\"Dictators of the Air\\" contains sixty illustrations. Dr. Palmer has included many aviation posters that incorporate specific symbols and images for propaganda purposes by the Soviets. The selection of primitive Russian aircraft photographs is very entertaining."},{"Title":"Dictatorship of the Air: Aviation Culture and the Fate of Modern Russia (Cambridge Centennial of Flight)","review":"Dictatorship of the Air is an innovative, thoroughly researched and very well-written book on a fascinating subject: the meaning and influence of aviation in Russian history. The author, Scott Palmer, uses an impressive number of archival materials and contemporary sources to build the case that the Russian approach to aeronautical modernization (combining state initiative, crash campaigns, and the acquisition of foreign technology) ultimately achieved far less than Imperial and Soviet leaders claimed. The book's treatment of technology transfer is particularly effective. Palmer does an terrific job explaining the internal economic and ideological factors that forced Russian officials to use espionage to keep up with competitors in Western Europe and the US. The book also contains (among other things) a fascinating discussion of the various \\"prestige\\" flights of the 1930s, insightful analysis of the religious foundations of Soviet-era aviation propaganda, and more than four dozen photographs and illustrations that readers will find nowhere else. This is certain to become the point of departure for future work on the history of Russian aviation. ***Highly recommended***"},{"Title":"I Love the Word Impossible","review":"I love this book.

I wish I would have read the book before my visit. The smell of almond pastries led me right up the narrow street and to the pastries and candies in her shop, and they are marvelous. The convent is just a short walk up the street from her shop, in the square. The recipes she shares in the book are uncomplicated and simply delicious. Her story is not embellished. There is no polished prose. It is as she saw it and lived it and has told it with her unique Sicilian expression. I enjoyed reading it and I will continue to enjoy her recipes."},{"Title":"Bitter Almonds: Recollections & Recipes from a Sicilian Girlhood","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. Firstly what sort of book is it? Is it a recipe book - 111 pages of its 229 pages are recipes; secondly is it biography of Maria Grammatico or thirdly is it a memoir of Mary Taylor Simeti telling how she came to be telling Maria's story. And these two latter stories cover the first 118 pages.There is a terrific story here in the life Maria Grammatico. In the 1950s, her impoverished mother sent her, at the age of 11, and her older sister to live in the enclosed and cloistered world of the local convent. There were approximately 22 people living in the convent of whom 13 were nuns, the rest young girls such as Maria and her sister. Maria lived here till the age of 25, when she left the convent. The only skills she had were how to make the delicious, dainty, delectable pastries, sweetmeats and biscuits that she had 'acquired' over the years living with the nuns. The nuns produced vast quantities of these morsels to sell to the locals on feast days and religious celebrations/ceremonies. None for the girls. It was an appalling existence really for young girls. There was never enough food, very few comforts, very little if any freedom, no celebrations or fun of any kind. The one solace for Maria was the kitchen. Now, in her fifties, she still lives in the town the convent was in - Erice - and has her own very famous and highly regarded Italian patisserie where she makes, by hand, all the delicacies she had learnt all those years ago. On You Tube there are some lovely films of Maria in her kitchen and interviews with her about her life. I would love to have had the whole 229 pages about her life, more about what convent life was like, more about what happened to her when she left the convent, how she started her business - I kid you not, it is summarised in one paragraph. Very very disappointing.So is the book then a memoir of the writer, Mary Taylor Simeti and how she came to meet Maria and write the book. Unfortunately there is almost as much about this as there is about Maria. Mary is a successful writer herself, married to a Sicilian and living on Sicily. Her books about Sicilian food and travel are highly regarded and would appear to be well worth reading. But to me, this little book, should not be about her, and unfortunately it is. She intersperses Maria's story with snippets from her own, and the thread really does at times become quite confusing.Then we come to the remaining 111 pages of recipes. And glorious they are too! From almond dough, almond cream, ricotta tart, citron jam, marzipan, fig biscuits, preserves - 46 recipes in total. And all this is marvellous to read too! But is it perhaps just a little too much?My overall feeling on finishing this book was that I felt cheated. And that Maria actually deserved more. Maybe one day someone will write a real biography of Maria's story instead of this offering."},{"Title":"Bitter Almonds: Recollections & Recipes from a Sicilian Girlhood","review":"To sit in Maria Grammatico's world-famous pastry shop in stunningly beautiful Erice, on the top of a mountain in northwest Sicily, having a caffe and eating her delicious Genovesi, is to be a little nearer to heaven...figuratively, if not literally.

This brief, but delightful, autobiography (aided by Mary Taylor Simeti, a wonderful author in her own right), along with her terrific and not particularly difficult recipes, forms a sweet read."},{"Title":"Bitter Almonds: Recollections & Recipes from a Sicilian Girlhood","review":"This is another of Mary Taylor Simeti's books which I look forward to reading.

Even translated into English, the voice is extraordinary. The story begins sad but unsentimental -- Maria's family is so poor they send her and one of her sisters to the nunnery where the nuns will feed her and she will work -- but has a happy ending with Maria grown, educated, independent, and prosperous, living near her family. The trimphant personality comes through honest and unembellished. All of the redundancy typical of real human conversation is preserved, so it seems you are listening to Maria's voice.Watch Maria make genovesi on youtube.

Except that Maria never really was, or became a nun. But she had an orphan's life in a religious institution and spent her days making sweets, which the convent sold for income. This then is Maria's story of resilience and survival, and how she ended up having the best little sweets shop in all of Erice.I've had holidays in Sicily, in a seaside village called San Vito Lo Capo. On a clear day one could almost see Erice, this ancient town on a rock above Trapani. I've run through the cobbled streets of Erice and I've eaten those delightful almond biscuits and contemplated which Martorana fruit to buy. And I am so sorry now I had not discovered this delightful book before I visited Erice, because I am sure I must have been in Maria's shop, yes, I must have tasted her sweet offerings.If you love life, if you love biography and a window on other worlds and other eras, do read this book.

The story of Maria was fascinating to me, the daughter-in-law of Sicilian immigrants to the US -- like an inside view to an ordinary, but not so ordinary life.

The Compulsive CommunicatorsAcknowledgementsIndex===============================================\\"Quite simply, the best introduction to natural history ever written.\\"These words of Desmond Morris quoted on the back cover are, quite simply, the best review of David Attenborough's Life on Earth ever written. Still, let me try mine.If you are of a religious turn of mind, you may well think the life and deeds of Jesus Christ to be the greatest story ever told. But if you happen to have scientific inclinations, you can hardly choose better for such story than life on Earth. It has an irresistible grandeur and majesty, not to mention astounding scope and virtually endless variety. My experience with literature on the subject is severely limited, yet I cannot possibly imagine a better introduction in one volume than \\"Life on Earth\\" by Sir David Attenborough.To begin with the most obvious, the book is stupendously illustrated. About half of these 300 pages or so are occupied by magnificent photographs, all printed on full page (or two) and in simply gorgeous full colour. Some of them are indeed breathtaking, like the tree frog from Panama on the cover - photographed, incidentally, by Sir David himself - which has become one of the most emblematic images with regard to natural history. Pretty much all major groups of organisms discussed in some detail in the text are supplied with photographs which are so ingeniously organised that you needn't look further from the text in question than page or two. Being so gorgeous as they are, however, the photographs have the unpleasant side effect that most people simply do not pay any attention to the text.What truly makes Life on Earth a great book is the fact that its text is infinitely superior to its photographs, amazing though they are. It is not hard to find lavishly illustrated albums with memorable wild life photos, but a narrative like David Attenborough's is a rarity indeed. His writing style is perfection itself, combining lucidity, succinctness, clarity and, occasionally, humour in a most readable and delightful manner. It is wonderfully suitable for the lay reader, provided that he is chiefly interested in the essence of the story, not in bombastic statistics or mundane details. There are neither Latin names here (except in the index), nor any of those tongue-twisted geological epochs: except in a wonderful ''tree of life'' in end of the book where one can convert those ''x million years'' into ''Cenozoic era'', '' Cambrian period'' and other charmingly obscure terms as well as some pretty popular ones like ''Paleozoic era'' or ''Jurassic period''. What is much more fascinating about this ''tree of life'', however, is that it gives an excellent overview how all major groups of organisms developed through that extraordinarily immense period of time; one can see not just when they appeared and when they became extinct, but when they flourished and when they decayed as well: pretty spectacular amount of information for mere two pages. As far as the main text of the book is concerned, just about the most scientifically specialised word is ''DNA'', and that too is explained.But the reader must always keep in mind that this book is especially designed for the general public, for reasonably intelligent and educated people who just happen to be not so well acquainted with the stupendous variety of plants and animals on earth, and especially how that variety came to be. But to search for serious and detailed science between these pages is to miss the point completely. Which is not say that the book is flippant or shoddy. Far from it. It just is popular science rather than pure science. To take just two examples - not for any other reason but because they happen to interest me very much - though the book is concerned a lot with evolution, it offers only very brief discussion of the theory and the contribution of Charles Darwin to it, but there is almost nothing about its mechanisms and what role they, presumably, have played in the origin of species (no pun intended). Another difficult question, perhaps the most endearingly fascinating and outstandingly contentious of all, is the origin of life itself in those primordial seas, and here I must say that David Attenborough's treatment is almost embarrassingly superficial and naive. But that is to be expected. These questions are books in themselves. Their missing in Life on Earth should not be used to degrade the book. Sir David had an amazing story to tell, in just a few hundred pages for as wide a public as possible, and he had to draw the line somewhere in order to sustain the high quality of the narrative throughout the book as well as to remain in the dangerous field of popular science. So he takes evolution as indisputable fact and great force which worked on life as soon as the latter appeared, however that may have happened, and he goes on to tell the story.What a story indeed! Life on Earth covers it all and it is a most unforgettable journey that stirs the imagination as few other things do. Nobody knows when the whole thing started, but that probably happened some three to four billion years ago in the seas of the still young (mere half or one billion years old) planet Earth. David Attenborough starts from here and leads his readers through the development of more and more complex multi-celled organisms, the colonisation of sea, land and air, and finally to the staggering diversity of the present day and the appearance of those who are so careless with its preservation. Yes, this must be the greatest story ever told! It seems impossible to tell it in a single volume of mere 300 pages, yet that's exactly what Sir David has done brilliantly. He never looses the main thread of his narrative, nor does he fail to fit perfectly every significant evolutionary event in the big puzzle, no matter how many millions of years may lay in between.Of course it is a very dangerous story to tell. The absorbing introduction of the book shows that David Attenborough was only too well aware of the dangers and difficulties he is bound to encounter during his work. The main danger, in his opinion, was attaching some purpose to evolution, something for which, he is convinced, there is no objective evidence. I should have thought this is something obvious, but then I reflect that, human vanity being of cosmic proportions, it must be gratifying for many people to view themselves as a special product of three billion years of evolution. As far as difficulties go, Sir David's pithy exposition cannot possibly be betteredThe condensation of three million years of history into three hundred pages, the description of a group of animals containing tens of thousands of species within one chapter, compels vast omissions. My method has been to try to perceive the single most significant thread in the history of a group and then concentrate on tracing that, resolutely ignoring other issues, no matter how enticing they may seem.What impresses me most in \\"Life on Earth\\" is David Attenborough's truly miraculous ability to compress enormously his subject without being perfunctory, careless or superficial. His chapters give me a sense of a most remarkable completeness without being in the least isolated from the main theme of the book. To my mind it is downright inconceivable how one can cover in a single chapter such major groups of animals like insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles or birds, but that's precisely what David Attenborough has done in chapters 4 to 7, and he has done it so well that in the end of every chapter I am convinced that he has said everything there is to be said. Sometimes he weaves several vastly different groups into one single chapter, showing perceptively their origins from one another; Building Bodies, for instance, is a most absorbing overview of molluscs, crinoids and crustaceans, together with several important extinct species like trilobites and ammonites.Sir David's major premise throughout the narrative is the surprisingly high degree to which living organisms can be used to illustrate the evolutionary development of plants and animals. The presence of fossils is of course obligatory, but they are by no means a dominant part. Those who want to learn more about the different groups of organisms as they are today may be reminded that later in his life David Attenborough wrote a number of books especially dedicated to plants, birds, mammals, invertebrates, amphibians and reptiles, respectively:The Private Life of Plants (1994)The Life of Birds (1998)The Life of Mammals (2002)Life in the Undergrowth (2005)Life in Cold Blood (2007)Coming back to \\"Life on Earth\\", the unique thing about the first paperback edition of 1992 is the blurb on the back cover, written by David Attenborough himself and dated ''January, 1992.'' It is a charming trifle in which the author describes briefly how the famous ''Life trilogy'' came to exist. Somewhere in the middle 1970s, after two decades of filming wild life in the tropics, Sir David's impressions had become such a dazzling, almost confusing, kaleidoscope that he decided to put the matter into some kind of order. It took him well more than a decade to finish the project but finally his now legendary trilogy of magnificent productions was finished. They explored three main - perhaps the three main - aspects of the living organisms: their diversity, their ecology and their behaviour:Life on Earth (1979)The Living Planet (1984)The Trials of Life (1990)As mentioned many times by David Attenborough, including in the book itself, Life on Earth was written in parallel with the shooting of the eponymous movie. So the two are closely related. First broadcast on BBC in the first half of 1979, \\"Life on Earth\\" consists of 13 episodes, about 55 minutes each, with very similar titles and contents as the 13 chapters of the book. Despite the great deal of overlapping, the two mediums complement each other astonishingly well: the book has the advantage of a great deal more detailed exposition and better structure, whereas the film is a visual tour de force. At first glance, the colours, the picture and the camera work may, respectively, look whitewashed, grainy and clumsy, but when I remember that the movie was made in the late 1970s - long before the vogue for digital special effects - I cannot but be convinced that the series actually put to shame many a modern documentary. There are numerous haunting and unforgettable shots in those 12 hours or so. Those memorable slow motion cameras that caught flying insects still look as state-of-the-art technique to me even today. The emerging of a mature dragonfly from its old skin and the hardening of its wings on the morning sun really look like a pure science fiction, kind of a next sequel to Alien. It is just impossible to mention all visually enthralling moments. There are hardly any others.But the most priceless asset to the movie is the same one which makes the book great: David Attenborough himself. His unmistakable voice and eloquent speech are pure delight. Also, as a non-native English speaker for whom the most difficult part of the English classes has always been the so called ''listening'', I guarantee there is no better training for that than listening to David Attenborough. His diction and pronunciation are exemplary; not only are subtitles superfluous, but one may well take a dictation under his voice. Moreover, Sir David is a man of incredible charm. He is everywhere: hunting fossils in the Grand Canyon, Australia or Wales (where he used some ''violent methods'' for that), socialising with mountain gorillas in equatorial Africa (his own favourite experience during the making of the movie), swimming through the Great Barrier Reef, criss-crossing the Galapagos islands (his favourite location) or handling carefully a huge palm thief (aka coconut crab, a most amazing crustacean that is, most amazingly, entirely terrestrial; it can live, breath and eat on land, it needs to visit the ocean only for reproduction; needless to say, this is a species of great evolutionary significance).Now, Sir David is not just everywhere, but he explains everything even when he is not actually there. His enthusiasm is endless, delightful and extremely contagious. Take fossils for example. Before David Attenborough I had thought them a rather dull stuff. Not so afterwards. After seeing his ecstasy when showing us a magnificently preserved ammonite, I often catch myself during a country walk with my greedy eyes glued to the rocks in search of fossils. And who can forget David Attenborough's opening lines in the movie:\\"There are some four million different kinds of animals and plants in the world. Four million different solutions to the problems of staying alive. This is the story of how a few of them came to be as they are.\\"Quite unlike the book, which is abominably out of print, the movie is very much available as an outstandingly cheap four DVDs set in the most gorgeously illustrated box you have ever seen, I guarantee. The series are complete - all 13 episodes - and there is even one excellent bonus: a half-an-hour documentary, Wildtrack, apparently broadcast on BBC during the premiere of the series. It contains a charming interview with Sir David with a lot of insights about those three years of work in 40 countries all around the world in the most ambitious project of its kind ever undertaken for television at the time (together with some hilarious outtakes like Sir David being smoked by a volcano on Iceland). There is also some utterly compelling, and greatly revealing, footage about the secrets behind many of the most astonishing moments, including shooting magnificently coloured sea slugs in the Great Barrier Reef, combining camera work with microscopy for some of the most amazing images of protozoans you've ever seen, and treating a huge bird eating spider from Australia as a movie star in studio. It breaks the spell a little to know that some of the greatest moments in Life on Earth were shot in carefully prepared studios, rather than in the wild, but that of course is inevitable - and irrelevant for the images are no less real or unforgettable for that. As for the series in general, watching those 13 episodes immediately before or after reading the corresponding chapters in the book is an experience not to be forgotten. Ever.The only drawback of the movie is the music. It reminds me of a very shoddy and mediocre imitation of Richard Strauss, not to mention that the sound quality is quite terrible for the late 1970s. Needless to say, this is a point of no importance. The book, within its limitations, is downright perfect. I would also venture to claim that, despite being first published more than 30 years ago, Life on Earth is not dated at all, save for few minor and insignificant details nobody but pathological nit-pickers would care about. This is a book that deals almost exclusively with the basics, and these date little through the years.Now, the fact that book like \\"Life on Earth\\" by David Attenborough has long since been out of print is one the most hideous crimes in the modern publishing history. But since second hand copies are easily available and embarrassingly cheap, I suggest you get hold of one as soon as possible and start reading. It is a most exciting and exhilarating ride through 3500 million years of life.__________________________________________________&#8203;Note about differences between the hardback and the paperback edition.Just for the record, it is interesting to note that there are few differences between the photographs in the original edition from 1979 and the paperback one from 1992. Sometimes the difference is insignificant, like in the case on pp.117-118 where a magnificent manta ray is shown in both editions (the newer picture is perhaps a bit better). Page 189, however, is a little baffling. Here both photographs are of different bird species, even though both obviously perform the same court ritual. The baffling thing is that the Great Crestal Crebes in the original edition were substituted with Gap Gannets in the paperback version, but the former is explicitly mentioned in the text whereas the latter is not. Similar difference in the species occurs on p. 241 - bonito for snapper - but it doesn't really matter here because the important thing to notice is the shoal, not the exact species. Perhaps the most extreme case of these changes in the photographs occurs on p. 241, where a Minke whale in the original hardback - one of the very few indifferent pictures - has been replaced with a magnificent two pages photograph of a hunchback whale. Anyway, these are very minor differences of no consequence at all. So far as I can judge from reading most of both editions, the text has been reprinted without any alterations.It is perhaps worth mentioning that the back of the dust jacket of the hardback edition has one compelling full page photograph not to be found anywhere in the paperback. It shows David Attenborough, camera in hand, standing on a rock beside the water and having a most absorbing conversation with a seal. By way of a little compensation, the back cover of the paperback has one small picture of Sir David laughing his head off with those cute mountain gorillas. If there ever was a man who could speak with the animals, it must be David Attenborough.I have no first hand experience with American editions of the book, but it seems that the volume was simultaneously published on both sides of the Atlantic in 1979 by Collins. Several years later, in the early 1980s, it was also published in the New World by Little Brown, both in hard- and in paperback; this edition is, presumably, identical to the original one, even though the front cover is not occupied by the trademark tree frog. Anyway, I am pretty sure it makes no difference which edition in English you will choose. You are in for fantastic adventure anyway."},{"Title":"Life on Earth - A Natural History","review":"David Attenborough is, for me, the best for the documentaries about nature. I offered this book to an english friend who is delighted.I am satisfied with the package and the date of arrival. Thanks"},{"Title":"Life on Earth - A Natural History","review":"In this unique book, David Attenborough has undertaken a history of nature, from one-celled organisms in the primeval slime more than 3000 million years ago to modern day's humans. The book presents a chronological account of the life on planet Earth over a period of 3,500 million years. Life on Earth is an astonishing array of characters drawn from the whole range of living animals the world over. Attenborough takes the reader around the world with him into jungles, deserts and remote mountains. The book's 13 chapters follow the sequence of main events in the evolution of life on earth. The book details the emergence of one-celled, then multi-celled organisms; the movement of life from sea to land; adaptation to life in the air; the development of warm-blooded animals; the transition between ground life and tree life; and finally the evolution of man himself."},{"Title":"Autobiography and reminiscences of Sarah J. Cummins","review":"This was book was written by my great, great grandmother, whom I never knew. Our family always took a lot of pride in being one of the first pioneer families to come to the western edge of the continent before it was part of the United States and before the Oregon trail was established. My great great great great grandfather Thomas Jefferson Shadden was among the first 500 Americans to venture west of the Rockies, and eventually helped found the town of McMinnville, Oregon. Sarah Cummins was from a different branch of the family, but came at roughly the same time as Shadden, and eventually the families were united through marriage. She writes about an interesting era in US history, at a time when there were few eyewitnesses. She was a personal friend of Marcus and Narcissus Whitman, and writes an elegy about their massacre at the Whitman mission near Walla Walla. Sarah's book preserves a lot of good detail of what it was like to come out west when it was truly wild. The book was first published in 1919, and then again in 1968 when about 500 copies were printed by Ye Galleon Press."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"There are two kinds of people in the world, those who divide people into two kinds and those who don't. The author is almost this; she divides two human functions(or \\"syndromes\\" as she rather awkwardly calls it). One is the \\"Guardians\\". They have an ethos similar to hunter-gatherers and can be compared to wolves becoming wolfhounds. They live by providing protection. The other is the \\"Traders\\" who live by increasing the supply of resources available. It is human nature for the two \\"syndromes\\" to live symbiotically; in fact it cannot be otherwise. The author does this study of the ethical systems proper to each and makes the interesting claim that using the ethical system proper to the one function for the purposes of the other is a cause of corruption.The Commercial system according to this theory involves, \\"Shun force, come to voluntary agreements, be honest, collaborate easily with strangers, compete, respect contracts, use initiative and enterprise, be open to inventiveness and novelty, be efficient, promote comfort and convenience, dissent for the sake of the task, invest for productive purposes, be industrious, be thrifty, be optomistic.The Guardian system is shun trading, exert prowess, be obeidient and disciplined, adhere to tradition, respect hierarchy, be loyal, take vengence, decieve for the sake of the task, make rich use of leisure, be ostentatious, dispense largesse, be exclusive, show fortitude, be fatalistic, treasure honor.Like so many \\"theory to explain the human race or some part thereof\\" books, this book is entertaining and provides insights, some of which I had never thought of. For instance the atrocious snobbery of the warrior class to the merchant class throughout history began with an understandable point; a guardian must \\"shun trading\\" because that would be a temptation to disloyalty. Of course \\"shun trading\\" requires interpretation; for instance while our country does not necessarily command guardians to shun all kinds of trading because it is not a caste system, it does often forbid \\"trading\\" that might compromise one's guardian task(a juror must excuse himself from a case involving a business partner and so on). In point of fact, and this is something the author doesn't touch on, in some Guardian cultures it is simply \\"shun gain\\". Obviously one must gain to survive, but in this context shun means to subliminate. For instance police are not allowed to take shares of anything seized in a bust. And Western-style militaries have tended in the past few centuries to renounce plunder more and more. Nelson's navy approved of prize money very much indeed. It never really considered it the main object. And modern regulations against looting, which many suppose are based on desire to minimize the trouble to civilians have another purpose; after all many forms of looting do little harm(if the previous owner is dead for instance). The real purpose is to protect the dignity and integrity of the military.One of the most interesting ideas the author had was the creative way she presented it as a philosophical symposium between a number of fictional characters. It is an inventive device and worth remembering. The characters were generally likable except for Ben who is self-righteous and perpetually angry at everyone.Several weaknesses there are. One I noticed was that the author missed the fact that of all the \\"traders\\" traders come pretty close to being guardians. That is because trade is inseparable from transport and transport is really a guardian function. It is about protecting the cargo while it is journeying to the place where it is to be traded. And this fact is hinted at by the pseudo-military discipline of merchant-ships(the hierarchy of a large merchant ship is of a different flavor from that of an office). And while the author mentions spys as \\"guardians\\" she misses the fact that the most important aspect of intelligence is analysis not fieldwork and analysts must be able to operate like scientists to some degree.But one important point is that she overemphasizes the need for separation and downplays the dangers of extreme versions of the two \\"syndromes\\". The dangers of the caste system(keeping the occupations totally separate) are alluded to but the potential for corruption is not fully explored. One of the main problems is that Guardians when they are secluded from traders, cease to regard them as human. In doing so they corrupt their own system, by changing from guardians back to predators and ultimately not contributing anything to society. In the same way, traders who are totally separated from guardians tend to become overtimid. This monstrous divorce is as horrible as the \\"monstrous hybrids\\" the author speaks of. It was not for nothing that the Founding Fathers, and the British political philosophers before them feared a standing army. The institution, can encourage traders to give up ALL responsibility for their own defense thus becoming effete. More important, it gives guardians a chance to overthrow the Rule of Law. That is not necessarily the result but it could be.Another question not explored is that traders seem to adapt to guardian roles far better then the reverse. Many of the worlds most famous warrior-peoples were also famous as traders. More then that, were made skillful at war by their skill at trade(as with the Athenian navy making Athens a match for Sparta). It is hard to think of many Guardians who turned to Trading quite as easily though that is not unknown either(as with samurai becoming industrialists).This book is an entertaining one and provides insights into the human race. Like all such things it should be taken with a grain of salt. But it is worth the read."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"Awesome discussion about the need for balance between government (the guardians) and commerce.

These are often the peasant/prol/workers that serve the groups described use, manipulate and even claim to own but from an eco/eco point of view, they have a functional syndrome for survival.

Today it has descended into a state of imperialism, corruption, with government acting to protect and enforce business interests abroad. This book explains, with one overarching theory, the reasons behind why it happened.Although people are aware that capitalism is probably not the most efficient system for an economy, most are led to believe that a free market is the most moral and benificial to the freedoms of the individual. Jane Jacobs points out the fatal flaw behind the system and the problems that can arise as a consequence. The genius behind this work is that it was written way before the Bush administration came into power. The author, in seeking to explain the reasons behind minor infractions of corruption, essentially, forecasted the current state of the US government today. The US government, as of right now, is basically Jacobs' theory taken to extreme levels.If you're interested in politics, economy, or international affairs. This book is a sleeper hit. Also, I wouldn't trust any review before 2003, during that time it was harder to see how her theory had any major relevance to the real world, today, however, the relevance is all too apparent."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"Jane Jacobs was the grand old lady of urban planning. It was delightful to read her The Death and Life of Great American Cities. She turned the professional world of urban planning upside down. Professional and traditional urban planning were once and for all discredited. In later years she elaborated on the economy of cities. Jane Jacobs was a true believer in the cultural and economical primacy of cities. In Systems of Survival she researches the moral values in society. Her form is the Platonic dialogue. She introduces two distinct moral syndromes , the commercial and the guardian. The crossing of the borders and the resulting moral dilemmas are the main issues that Jacobs addresses. It is a disappointing book. I missed the fresh insights of earlier work and thought Jacobs is drifting away from her main themes. The book lacks focus and is unclear in its conclusions. Good luck we still can cherish her other books.

Here she has pointed out an entire field for future study -- the social evolution of meme-complexes, patterns of self-reinforcing beliefs that have evolved over time in human populations. One can quibble about the undisciplined frame for the arguments, but it does make the book an exceptionally easy read (and no doubt was much easier to write than a more formal treatment would have been). I certainly recognized myself and my friends (and politcal opponents) in her syndromes, and have found the insight they provide invaluable in working with people who are &quot;syndrome-inflexible&quot; (cannot swing from one syndrome to the other as appropriate) -- especially on local development issues, where the clash of the syndromes is exceptionally obvious."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

How could these good people involve themselves in such unethical behavior? The dysjunction between their behavior and my assessment of their characters was the source of much grief. After reading Jacobs' book, I have come to understand just how tricky some of these problems can be, and just how easy it is for good people to fall into error at the junction between commericial life and guardian life. Her book doesn't solve any problems, but it certainly makes sense of much human perfidy."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"This is a most insightful book, in which the author convincingly expounds her thesis that the world uses two systems of ethics as systems for the survival of mankind: the commercial system, and the guardian system.The commercial class lives by production and exchange, primarily by means of honest, binding contracts and voluntary agreements, and where initiative, inventiveness and efficiency are prized, along with industriousness, thrift and investment.The guardian class is prevalent in governments, benevolent trusts, charity organizations, universities and schools, military and police. They shun trading and exchange, and live by taking, in the form of taxes and donations, and sometimes expropriation. They are dispensers of the good things, in the form of grants and largesse. Guardians issue commands and expect them obeyed, with courage if necessary, which they in turn are subject to themselves, for a hierarchical command structure is honored. And they use force and deception where necessary to accomplish objectives.The greatest sin, and the cause of all corruption, according to Ms. Jacobs, is when the two systems are merged in one organization. I have read several books on ethics, but this is the first that points out that there are two systems in operation in society. And it explains so much that has been a puzzle for me. For example, we are taught to tell the truth, as in the commercial system of ethics, yet a government will lie in the interests of the state, and a general will try to deceive the enemy, and both expect to be applauded for that. This can be explained only by the distinct systems of morality that guide the guardian class and commercial classes.The two systems explain the characteristics of nations too. The empire building nation is dominated by a guardian morality, and it guardian class despises the commercial morality. A good example is England, in the past, with its class system and colonial empire that puts business men and women at the bottom. You do not have to read too many Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope novels to become aware of that. To some extent this dominant guardian syndrome lingers in monarchical England to the present day, but the country is being forced into prizing a more commercial morality by an European Union led by successful, commercial-syndrome-dominated republics France and Germany.In contrast, the growing nation with plenty of territory is dominated by the commercial morality, for example the United States through most of its history, with its strong corporations and industrious commercial class. The U.S., however, is now showing signs of trending more toward a stronger espousing of the guardian morality, as its interests force it to begin some empire building abroad. But even if the commercial ethic still dominates in the United States, the guardian ethic is present and strong, and Jane Jacobs' brilliant proposition explains the never ending conflict between the two.And we can now see why communism failed. It removed the commercial ethic, and the sanctity of commercial contract. The commercial ethic, by the looks of it, has still not been reestablished in the new Russia, which explains its lack of real economic success in the modern world. I am not knowledgeable enough to dissect Japan with Jacob's thesis.Her thesis also throws a great deal of light on the thinking of novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand , whose philosophy is explained and dramatized in the novels \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"Fountainhead\\". Rand strongly espoused the commercial system of ethics, and viewed the guardian system as closest thing to evil, best eliminated to the extent possible. She did concede that guardian institutions of police, military and courts were a necessary evil, however, to be closely monitored (by the commercial class). This viewpoint probably originated with the dominant, communist, guardian ethic in the violent, disorganized and impoverished Russia that she escaped as a young woman, after the communists confiscated (a 'taking' guardian action) the family business.But if Jane Jacobs is right, then both systems are necessary. Instead of eliminating the guardian systems, as Ayn Rand seemed to advocate, we simply have to make sure that the guardian class is modest in size, no larger than necessary, and that the two systems of ethics are never allowed to mix. As a footnote, it could be argued that Michael Crichton's recent novel, about environmentalists and global warming, \\"State of Fear\\", is really about a conflict between the guardian and commercial classes.\\"Systems of Survival\\" is a must read for anyone interested in what makes the world work."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"Jane Jacobs' division of morality into two &quot;syndromes&quot;, &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;guardian&quot; has given me an enormously helpful and practical frame of reference from which to view human behavior, including my own. I especially see how I can lock into the point of view of one moral syndrome -- either one -- and judge the other syndrome to be immoral, when in fact, as Jacobs points out, immorality arises from the &quot;monstrous hybridization&quot; of the two. Jane Jacobs is one of my top five intellectual heroes, for this book and her several others on city economics."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"Our society has principles that forbid us to kill and yet our society also has principles that require it to prepare for and engage in war. Much has been made of this conflict in morality but very little light has been shed on it despite its ancient origin. Jacob's tackles this apparent contradiction and others in another of her books where her searching insight can discover ideas that have eluded others.Jacobs resolves the apparent conflict by showing that it is no conflict at all but really the interworking of two disjoint moralities that must function interdependently to allow our society to flourish.Our society functions to interfere with the liberty of its inhabitants as little as possible and yet it can restrict the freedom of malefactors and even sentence them to long terms of imprisonment. Jacob's identifies this as the interworking of the commercial and guardian syndromes of morality. These moralities are contradictory - what is a vice in one is a virtue in the other. And yet we need them both. The commercial syndrome abjures force and encourages voluntary agreement. This is the syndrome that characterises interpersonal interaction within our society. It is desirable and yet it is incomplete. Its success requires the confidence of all particpants that the principles of the syndrome. This is provided by the guardian syndrome which is based on coercion and strict adherence to fixed rules.Jacobs shows how these sysndromes must be kept separate in society for just as initiayive and industry are virtues in the commercial syndrome they are vices in the guardian syndrome. Simliarly the guardian sysndrome requires largesse but the commercial requires invenstment and efficiency. A guardian cannot make laws on his own or use his offce to enrich himself without disabling the entire society. Similarly a commericial participant cannot use coercion on others since it destroys the flexibility that gives the commercial syndrome its societal benefits.A clear example of this can be seen in present day Russia in which the machinery of government has been taken over by ogliarchs who run it for their own benefit. The commercial and guardian syndromes are intertwined and so both fail. The obvious crime here is the violation of trust by these official but another crime is that this makes the entire country poor. People can not have trust in voluntary agreements and so do not make them. The economy fails because the commercial sundrome is violated and poverty results not from the funds directly stolen by officials but from the wealth that they prevent creating.I am only skimming the behaviors that Jacob's describes in her book and cannot do justice to her ideas in this brief review. It is book full of insight and wisdom. It is well worth reading.The only flaw I see in the book is not in the content but the form in which it was written. The dialogue style is not Jacob's strength but this is only a samll flaw in an book that is excellent overall."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"A very interesting dialog on paradigms which helped me understand better why &quot;commercial&quot; types and &quot;government&quot; types so often see each other as just plain evil and can't get past that emotional reaction.The book explores two moral systems with very different ideas of honor, which is at the emotional root of how we perceive each other. Should be required reading in high school political science and social studies classes.The reader needs to look past the cardboard cut-out &quot;characters&quot; which are there only to present the arguments, and focus on the insights produced from the arguments.A quick, yet very informative read.

Suffice it to say I find that thesis highly persuasive, and I plan to put it to the test in coming months. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"This is a superb, underrated book. Ignore the \\"sophisticated\\" naysayers and read it for yourself. There is, page for page, more insight here than you'll find in almost any work of academic philosophy or sociology on the same subjects. It will, of course, strike you as \\"simplistic\\" if you're offended by the book's message, its implications, or the unapologetic clarity with which the author defends her thesis. But that's not much of an objection."},{"Title":"Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics","review":"Jane Jacobs - Systems of SurvivalWe deserve better from the woman who brought us \\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities.\\" Systems of Survival is, more or less, Jacobs' explanation of how the world works: a celebrated urban sociologist using all the insight she has gathered over the years to give us her interpretation of the foundations of commerce and politics. Sounds great, doesn't it? Except it isn't.Turns out that Jacobs' vision of commerce and politics comes down to \\"how we get stuff\\", or, in other words, the titular systems of survival. There are only two systems and they are pretty simple, either we take stuff (\\"guardian\\" system) or we trade for it (\\"commercial\\" system). Each system also comes with its own dictates, such as \\"Shun force\\" and \\"Compete\\" (the trading system) and \\"Exert prowess\\" and \\"Be ostentatious\\" (the taking system). The problem is that these systems that Jacobs deals with are little more than the \\"traditional/modern\\" society dichotomy that has been around for years and years. Consequently these systems aren't all that groundbreaking.This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that about one third of the way through Jacobs circles the wagons and refuses to add anything new to the mix. Instead of taking these systems to the limits and covering some new ground Jacobs simply keeps chasing the same ideas around and around. More specifically, once we learn that the guardian system is good for some things (like administration) and the commercial system is good for others (like distributing goods) but that a combination of the two systems never works out, the book more or less stops generating ideas. Of course this excludes several questions: why do some societies have systems performing the \\"wrong\\" tasks, how have and how will these systems change over time, how do these contradictory systems coexist, what regulates them. Also, what about ideas that aren't covered by the two systems? There are a lot of questions implicit in Jacobs' thesis, most of which go unanswered.Perhaps as a footnote to all this is the oddity that Jacobs chose to write this as a \\"Socratic\\" dialog. The dialog is chunky, the characters one dimensional, the plot is completely absent; clearly the book would have made more sense as a work of non-fiction.Systems of Survival is a decent read if you know next to nothing about sociology. If you don't fit that criterion but you still want to read it, I'd recommend getting this book from the library and skimming it."},{"Title":"The Dolls of Yesterday","review":"Book arrived in wonderful condition, fast service I am very pleased. thank youProductDolls of Yesterday by Eleanor St George"},{"Title":"Recombinations","review":"This is one of my favorite novels.

This book, however, does provide a very accurate representation on what it is like for the parents, teachers, and students of all-girls schools. From the illustrous Marlborough in Los Angeles to the struggling Young Women's Leadership School in Harlem, readers get an idea of what it is like to be a hardworking young woman on either side of the poverty line. As a graduate of single sex education myself, I can relate to these stories. But I'm a little mystified in why this book's subtitle reads \\"Single-Sex Education and Why It Matters\\" because the author doesn't really tell you straight out why it does matter, just gives you stories of girls and hopes you can figure it out yourself.One thing that is blatantly missing from this book is how boys also would benefit from single-sex education. A lot of research focuses on how girls are getting the short-end of the stick when it comes to public education, but there is certainly a case to be made for boys when you consider that boys tend to be more aggressive and violent in general (at-risk kids) and could stand to be taught to slow down, think critically, and learn how to settle arguments in a non-violent manner. If New York city doesn't have an all-boys public school by now, they should really think about getting the funds to create one."},{"Title":"All Girls: Single-Sex Education and Why it Matters","review":"THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE GOING THROUGH THE COLLEGE PROCESS. I am a parent of a senior in high school and I have never gone through the college admissions process as a parent.

Reading Karen's book made me think all along the way that what I was feeling was NORMAL. It was totally comforting to know that I was not the only one feeling anxious about not knowing which school my daughter might attend next year. Karen made me think I had a support group right here in this book. By reading it I saw a variety of people with a variety of responses to their outcomes. It really made me take a deep breath at the end of the book and realize that it will all work out in some way.

Pram is an excellent writer. His prose invokes visual representation as you read through the pages and the pages seem to turn themselves. The book is set in a time and place of which I know little yet I felt, while reading this book, that I could see it and imagine it. I haven't yet gone on to read the rest of the books in the series, so don't know how the characters develop later. Annelies' character gives me much grist for the mill with her passive inability to cope with life or meet events as an equal with her mother and husband and her obsession with what she is not - 'native'. The constant reference in the book to pure, native, half blood is worthy of further analysis. Being from a former English colony (New Zealand) I don't get the impression that this narrative was nearly as prominent there as it seems to have been in Indonesia. I wonder, is this a reflection on the Dutch colonialists or on Indonesia? In all, a good read with much to occupy the reader's attention upon completion."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"'This Earth of Mankind' is the first novel in Pram Toer's Buru Quartet, and details the life of a unique Indonesian, Minke, whose awareness of the country and the world he lives in expands due to his education and interaction with a variety of characters, whose masks and motives are slowely revealed (in this and the other novels in the BQ). TEOM opened a whole new world to me. The depiction of the culture clash is especially good, the influence of European - mostly Dutch - and Asian ideas, and how Indonesia was a plaything of colonialism for centuries. And within that are the people, and those PT has peopled his novel with are richly drawn. Thus TEOM is part history lesson, part literature.PT also has the gift of the epigram: 'pity is the feeling of well-intentioned people who are unable to act'; and 'the life of the soul and the psyche are not mentioned in offical letters'. The loftly pronouncement is often on display too: 'How can human beings be looked upon purely from the point of view of official documents and without considering their essence as human beings?' Only a man who has spent long periods of his life imprisoned could write a sentence as powerful as that - and PT has, and then some. The man has suffered.

Without hesitation (or even, if I may say, guilt to his own \\"ancestors\\") Pramoedya bared in the open those very aspects of Indonesian people that have allowed colonialists to oppress them for hundreds of years. The book is as relevant today as when it was first written about 40 years ago as Indonesia clearly has not rid itself of colonialism, albeit a home-grown one.

However, I have mixed feelings about the author, who to the end of his life was bitter that he had been imprisoned for political purposes (as he should be) but never understood the bitterness of others such as Mochtar Lubis at Pramoedya's hypocrisy.Pramoedya was a supporter of Sukarno and the communist party in Indonesia (although he didn't officially join the party), and was a strong, outspoken advocate of having other authors banned if they didn't support 'the revolution'. He ridiculed a group that called for free speech, freedom of ideas and basic human rights for all - a group that objected to art and culture being censored for political reasons (the Manifes Kebudayaan). Pramoedya called for those advocating free speech to be 'pushed aside' (perhaps only figuratively - he hopefully didn't want them to be imprisoned, but he certainly wanted them banned).One member of this group, Mochtar Lubis, spent years in jail for being anti-communist. Pramoedya never spoke a word against the way Lubis was treated. Yet when the next repressive dictator, Suharto (who was anti- rather than pro-communist), threw Promoedya in jail, Mochtar Lubis visited him while he was in exile on Buru Island and helped him to get paper and a typewriter. To the end of his life, Pramoedya was outspoken in condemning how he personally had been treated but never, as far as I've been able to find, said a word against the jailing of Lubis and other anti-communists.Another aspect that appears inconsistent is that Pramoedya seemed to blame all of Indonesia's problems on foreign ideas and foreign influence, yet his proposed solution was to adopt China's version of communism. Did he think that Marx and Mao were Indonesian? How could an intelligent, reasonable person visit China during Mao's rule and come back thinking that another country should voluntarily condemn itself to a similar system?You should read his books, since Pramoedya was quite a writer and you'll learn something about Indonesian culture. But I plan to also look for some novels by Mochtar Lubis. Lubis' book Twilight in Djakarta was the first Indonesian novel ever translated into English."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"Pramoedya Anata Toer stated clearly that his novels were political. \\"Everything is political!\\" he said. He devoted his life to political freedom in Indonesia, opposing first the colonial Dutch government then the Suharto regime. This is the first volume of the Buru Quartet, which was written in Buru prison.Pramoedya's hero is Minke, who will in later volumes become a political activist. A Javanese of noble descent, he receives a European education at a prestigious Dutch school. He makes no attempt to hide the fact that he's a \\"Native,\\" and this earns him contempt. He does better at his studies than the Dutch students and the Indos (mixed blood). His success is resented. He's also handsome and charming and wins the heart of a stunning Creole beauty and the friendship of her extraordinary mother, a rich, beautiful and accomplished Javanese concubine. This arouses jealousies all around.Astonishing adventures and misadventures befall Minke, illustrating prejudice at every level of society and oppression and unfairness by those in power. The story takes place in the last years of Dutch colonialism. Great injustices are perpetrated. Throughout, Minke exhibits superior character and talent.Pramoedya once said in an interview, \\"I don't write to give joy to readers, but to give them a conscience.\\" I found the didactic content of the novel tedious at times, especially since I'm already on the author's side on every issue. But there's no question that the Buru Quartet is a major literary event and a classic of world literature. A friend gave me This Earth of Mankind, and I'm very glad to have read it."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I had to read this for my South East Asian History class. I can say that I am glad that I did.A lot of the culture you read about South East Asia is reflected in this book, it makes it more understandable and shows what it looked like to the new elite of the time. If you are simply interested in the culture or history of Indonesian or South East Asia I would recommend this book on that alone.On top of how valuable it is in showing the culture and traditions of Indonesia it is also a REALLY good book. The story is about one of the first natives who are given the chance at Western Education in the Indies. The story follows him as he tries his best to balance his admiration of Dutch learning and civilization with his nationalistic leanings.The story of young Minke is both uplifting and heartbreaking. It makes you really want to read the rest of the series to find out what happened.I haven't read the rest of the series yet but I hear that they are also very good books."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"This Earth is set in 1898 Indonesia, colonized by the Dutch and tells the story of a young Javanese teenager, 18 year old Minke, who's a star student, attending a prestigious Dutch school, the only native there. He's challenged by his half-European, half-native (Indos they're called) friend to make friends with a concubine's daughter, and ends up falling in love with her. There's wonderful detail about Indonesian society, but it is an overtly political text.And then there is Toer himself. He was a political prisoner imprisoned by Suharto's government for 14 years, and much of the book was told by Toer to his fellow prison mates orally. When he was finally released in 1973, he took a couple of years to write down this book as well as the stories of the other characters into a quartet. The books are called The Buru Quartet. Once I read about Toer's political life as a dissident (I googled him up about three quarters of the way into the book), it was impossible to separate that knowledge from the content of his book, so it was always as if there was something larger than what was being said in those pages. Someone else on Amazon said, I think people are giving it 4 and 5 stars because of sympathy for Toer's life. I also took it to mean that some sympathy finds its ways because it's a colonial work, and by a native author.To some extent, I agree, I think it's an astute observation. The book offers a view into native people's mindsets, but sometimes the passages and the conclusions they reach seem too treacly. I've noticed this tendency among Western readers to automatically reward a foreign work with good reviews, even if something of written with similar skill from your own culture wouldn't pass muster. Colonial guilt so to speak. One other book that exemplifies this is The Kite Runner. It's on the NYT bestseller list, but I couldn't stand the second half of that book, when all the characters are busy being so good to one another."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I had always heard that Pramoedya was a Nobel worthy author. I can see why, after reading his most acclaimed book, he never took home the prize. The story is slow and thoughtful. It takes a very long while to develop. When it does come to life, near the end of the book, it explodes into a burst of action and revelation.Now, in a sense, this is the Javanese way of presenting information: frontloaded with background (no thesis revealed, no outline), and then at last one arrives at the opinion or the finding. For me, as a Westerner, that meant an overlong build-up. I should add that my Indonesian friends here in Bandung say that Pramoedya's work is vastly superior in Indonesian, and that the Max Lane translation does not do justice to the storyteller's verse. Let us hope that a better translation will one day arrive.I will also fault the novel's portrayal of women, who are relegated to rather passive roles. This is particularly true of the protagonist's wife. However, I quite enjoyed the politics of race in the book. Pramoedya weaves a complicated portrayal of such matters--this is no diatribe against colonialism. Indeed, it is an altogether more powerful indictment of colonialism in its subtlety. Despite the book's failings, it truly deserves a wide audience for many years to come."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"This wonderful book works on every level. It is the story of Minke, an adolescent in Java in 1898. He is a talented young man: He studies, he writes articles, he earns money by getting commissions for fine furniture. This is really a story about class structure, racism, arrogance, and colonialism, built around a sad little love story between Minke and Annelies, the daughter of a formidable native \\"concubine,\\" who was herself sold into concubinage and who seeks a better fate for her children. I understand that this book was originally created orally, told in chapters in the prison where the author was incarcerated for political reasons. I recommend this book without hesitation!

Then imagine Mr. Toer telling you and other prisoners a long story about a young man's political awakening, Indonesia's colonial history - years, days, places, players - and a whole host of other fascinating characters. Complete with suspense and romance, this the first of four long books that contain the whole story of Minke.

Then the review gives the idea that the novel, unlike the universal theme in &quot;The fugitive&quot;, is too obvious a polemic. I disagrees with the Reviewer to place the polemic subject as a disadvantage. The novel is supposed to make an arguement in controvertial issues especially on subject such as colonialism, which is in the very heart of Indonesia after 300 years or more of Dutch occupation. The first novel captured the social tention in this society by telling love story between a native and an Indo-girl. Toer is a master in balancing the objective of telling a good story while at the same time critizising social issues.

You'll see the beauty as well as the dark sides of humankind."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"As an Indonesian, this is one of the best book to understand and learn about our colonial history, and better still learn it from the more personal level.

This is one of the most emotional books I've ever read, and scrape away all its emotions, the objectivity of Toer's subjects remains in tact and just as beautiful. Read this book. It is better than the most epic of motion pictures."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"... would not be more exotic than this novel! \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" is only the first installment of the four-part \\"Buru Quartet\\" by Indonesian author Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and thus my review will be brief and provisional until I've had time to read the whole tale. I can't begin to guess where it will lead me. In fact, that unpredictability is a large part of the excitement of reading this book; the ordinary organizing principles of European literature don't apply. It's a first-person narrative, the self-portrayal of a young Javanese in his final years of education at the prestigious Dutch High School in Betawi (now Jakarta), where he's the only \\"Native\\" among forty-some \\"Pure\\" (European) and \\"Indo\\" (Mixed-blood) elite students. The narrator is known only by his 'nickname' -- Minke-- given him in derision by an earlier school master. Minke's family is of the ancient Javanese aristocracy; his parents have assigned him the role of acquiring European knowledge and skills without realizing that such knowledge will alienate him from them and from his proper cultural niche. The tale is set in the 1890s, at the crossroads moment of world history when modernity and ancient modes are poised for the Armageddon battle to the death of colonialism. Minke is in himself the avatar of this conflict, embodying all the ancient values of his Javanese family in total disharmony with all the values of his European education. Neither can prevail without destroying the other -- so it seems provisionally -- and demolishing the young man Minke. His struggle to reconcile the irreconcilable and to integrate his own personality is the core of the novel. But there's also a strangely perfumed love story in the novel, involving castes of colonial society and issues of cultural identity so exotic that most readers will gape in incredulity. Annaliese, the Eurasian 'heiress' with whom Minke becomes involved, is a shadow-puppet princess of impossible beauty, such that in ancient Java wars would have been fought just for her possession, but the fate of Minke's and Annaliese's Love is caught in a net of European colonial operations and laws.Minke is unlike any 'narrator' in my fairly wide reading experience. He is a divided soul, a psychological amoeba just at the point of mitosis yet unable (so far) to divide. I can't think of any other book that has depicted such a mentality from the pre-resolution stage. Most writers addressing the inner conflicts of 'mixed-mind' children of colonialism have themselves been patently already post-colonial, observing the conflicts in retrospect. The very fine Japanese writers of the Meiji era, Tanizaki for instance, who wrote about the intersection of ancient and modern values wrote from a viewpoint of either nostalgia or avid adoption, portraying a struggle past its tipping point. The same can be said about African novelists of the mid-20th Century, largely educated in mission or government schools, producing their narratives in French or English. Interestingly, Minke gives every sign of heading in that direction; his first writings for newspapers in Betawi are in Dutch and he professes to be unable to write in Javanese or Malay. Even more interestingly, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was NOT of the generation of his fictional hero; he was in fact born in 1925 and he wrote the Buru Quartet in the mid-1970s, in Indonesian with admixtures of Javanese and other languages. This translation, by Max Lane, rigorously replicates the exotic narrative manner of the original, or so I suppose, not being able to read Indonesian. Java was, and perhaps still is, a society where people address each other not by personal names but by relationship titles, that is, not as individuals but as members of social structures. That ambiguity is powerfully obvious in Minke, in his sense of himself as a Self as well as of a unit in each of two inimical social structures.I couldn't help recalling the Indonesia and the Indonesian characters in the novels of Joseph Conrad (I've read them all) written precisely in the years of Minke's narrative, and that portray the Islands as perceived by a European just a generation before. The contrast couldn't be more total!More later, when I've read the rest of the Quartet."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I read \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" on a recommendation from a co-worker that knew that I enjoy historical novels. I understand that Pramoedya Ananta Toer is an Indonesian hero and spent several years in jail as a political prisoner. Due to the fact that he was forbidden to write in prison, he transmitted his books orally to someone else to actually write them. It is not easy to read his books without having that in mind and reviewing his works strictly of what it is printed between the covers is almost an impossible task. This is a typical case that the significance of a book is way bigger than the book itself.As a non-Indonesian reader, I am more interested in the story. Although the narrative is about colonial Indonesian, a non-Indonesian reader will easily relate to the story. After all, colonialism is always colonialism and the underlying conditions that the Dutch treated the Indonesians were not that different from other European countries and their colonies. The Indonesian case, however, was quite peculiar because they were already a multicultural society with strict rules of who were natives and who were not. This is something that I learned with this book. By the way, this was the book's biggest subject and the author's main motivation: to talk about the injustices and nonsense of Indonesian society.It is almost a year that I finished \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" and I still haven't started \\"Child of All Nations\\". I don't like trilogies and the fact that I will need to read thousands of pages to know what will happen, intimidates me a little bit. I was also tired of the lecture on the significance of each one of the layers from the Indonesian society.Nevertheless, \\"This Earth of Mankind\\" was quite intriguing.

It is also a love story, a romance ripped apart by that very moment of history. The hero, Minke, falls in love with the daughter of a Dutch settler and his Indonesian concubine. The results are ultimately tragic. But along the way, the author offers the reader a glimpse into a world peopled by unforgettable characters -- rich, complex, not at all stereotypical. Using a first-person narrative that is in turn both deeply personal and strangely detached, the author allows the reader to similarly immerse himself or herself in the story, and yet stand back and observe the unfolding of the drama as a curious bystander.. a bystander who is ultimately ensnared by the characters and their plight -- and consquently tied to the book forever. &quot;This Earth of Mankind&quot; reminds one of a David Lean film, such as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; -- at once grand and panoramic, and yet at the same time warm and intimate"},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"A beautiful and fun read. This book offers an uncanny combination of escapism and romance with social, historical and cultural commentary. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. It makes you think and feel...in a very effortless way.It was fun being transported to Indonesia at the turn of the last century. I haven't read a book like this in a long time. Try it. You won't regret it. It has something for everyone."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"This book tells a very good story. It has meaning, and reason. If you liked 'Cronicles of a death fortold'. This is a book I'm not willing to let go of. No one writes stories like Toer does. I liked his stories som much, I linked his site to my web page. This a story worth the time to read. This is the only book in the world I recomend anyone to read."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I weep after reading the original version, Bumi Manusia. I hope English translation can keep its soul-touching content. I believe that everyone can make mistakes. And Pramudya tells us very human people and very, very human mistakes. It reminds me how cruel people can be, and that we must remember that history is very single-sided, depends on who write it. This book is highly recommended, it pictures perfectly Indonesian (especially Javanese) culture. Reading it without the rest of the quad is a mistake, for you will miss many more beautiful tragedies."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I read this book for my world fiction challenge, because it was getting embarrassing that I had nothing from Indonesia (the world's fourth-most-populous country!). Unfortunately, there just aren't a lot of choices available in English, so I wound up reading this even though it was largely lost in translation.This Earth of Mankind is a politically important book--first told orally while the author was a political prisoner--with a political (anti-colonialist) message. Second, it's the story, set at the end of the 19th century, of an 18-year-old Indonesian boy, nicknamed Minke by one of the teachers in the elite Dutch school he's privileged to attend (the teacher apparently meant to call him a monkey, and now that's replaced his actual identity, ooooh don't you see the damage colonialism does here?). But it's a very weird story. Minke meets a reclusive family with a beautiful daughter, and the two instantly become so enamored of each other that the mother invites him to come live at their house. Which he does, apparently finding this only a little weird. The daughter, whom we're explicitly told is \\"no more than a fragile doll\\" with the emotional maturity of a 10-year-old, becomes deathly ill whenever Minke so much as goes on an extended family visit, but he doesn't mind sticking around too much, since she's super hot after all. (This is our \\"beautiful love story\\"?) Anyway, no spoilers: the book is very slow and meandering for the first 250 pages or so, but does pick up toward the end.Toer does a good job with the cultural and historical setting, which is educational, and the characters' personalities are distinct enough. The novel makes its political statement effectively without becoming so didactic as to be just propaganda; it's certainly not subtle, but the injustices of a caste-based colonial system don't lend themselves to subtlety. The translation could have been more accessibly-written, though, and there's a lot of repetition, as if the author was perhaps too wedded to the novel's spoken form.At any rate, I can see this novel being great for courses on comparative or post-colonial literature, and am sure its virtues are much more evident in Indonesian and to people who share that cultural background. But for non-Indonesian, non-academic readers looking for a good story, you can probably give this one a pass."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"Pramoedya is one of the great humanist authors. This Earth of Mankind should be read with the other three books of the Buru quartet, though the first two are definitely the stand-outs. He gives such an incredible sense of the sweep of early 20th century Indonesian history, filling his work with historical detail, yet also managing to create memorable characters. To my mind, Pramoedya has exceptional and highly original female characters, though they are more visible in the second and third volumes. He has deep sympathy for marginalized groups, including the Chinese and Eurasians, who are rarely portrayed in other Indonesian literature (except as villains). Anyone interested in the history of Asian anti-colonialism in general, or Indonesia in particular, should read this quartet."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"This is indeed a book about mankind; our eyes and mind are brought face to face with the humiliation and the joy of the book's main character, a son of a nobel Javanese who is struggling to find an identity, despite his naivete of European superiority (the story took place at the closing of the 19th century, when colonialization was in place). The word, 'modern,' was not yet in the dictionary, and Pramoedya expands to give us an unforgettable experience of seeing science unravel its power in front of mankind, for better or for worse, through the eyes of his main character. We are forced to question ourselves of our own identity, our own deeds, our own laws that govern our land, our own suffering, and our own opression on our fellow mankind. Finally, we are once again faced with the sour reality of mankind when Pramoedya twists the story toward an unexpected and sad but brave ending.I am an Indonesian who had been educated by text books written and mandated by the Indonesian government, the new ruler on the East Indies, the land that Pramoedya's epic story took place. I am amazed, marveled, transcended by the way Pramoedya revealed to me the secret of our culture, the reasons why my ancestors submitted to colonialization for more than three centuries. Pramoedya has opened the eyes of my soul to see the things surrounding my culture and my country, its history and its effort to come to terms with colonialization more closely, more vigilantly.Pramoedya's writing is truly unique, and his insight toward mankind, cultural differences, and whatever else that has brought us near the end of this century is completely powerful. Now, almost exactly 100 years later than when the story took place, many of the wisdom and sorrow Pramoedya writes about still hold place. Truly.The first of the Buru Quartet books, I recommend this book to any man and woman, of any nation and culture."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I'm from the same village as Mr. Toer, in fact, I was born only a mile away from his family home in Blora. My uncle went to school with him, my mom went to school with his sister and I went to school with his nephew. Since his exile, his family disowned him and I only heard bad things about him. But being in the US, I'm able to get access to the ban books in Indonesia and have been rewarded from reading his books. This book is a start of an &quot;anti-christ&quot; series that exposes our bad sides honestly. This, and the following books, clearly narrates the dutch rule in the late 1800 and early 1900 that is used in the exact same manner by Suharto during his rule (i.e. oppression). It also brings out our (esp. Javanese) bad character, submissiveness, in a painful but awakening way. So, for my fellow Indonesians, read this book as an instrospect! You will be stressed out for awhile but enlightment is on its way."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"The Kirkus review printed above damns Toer's novel with faint praise when it states that the book is &quot;too obvious a polemic.&quot; Too obvious for whom? I wonder if the reviewer would take the same view of any other number of political novels which were used by their authors as a barely disguised fictional framework to attack flawed or unjust cultural values. Is The Grapes of Wrath too obvious a polemic? Of course not, and neither is This Earth of Mankind. Toer makes no effort to disguise the nature of his critique of the social and political values of colonial Indonesian society. Toer's narrative is brilliant; the characters are vivid and developed so well that we have no trouble identifying with them personally, and yet at the same time they are patently obvious symbols of the different racial and social strata in the world of which the novel is set. Toer has been accused of being overly melodramatic in this novel, and while I think that is a reasonable criticism, I have to disagree. The antagonists here are hissable characters, but Toer plays fair with them. They have a clear rationale for what they do and the justification for their actions may seem reasonable and even honorable to them even if we view it as an outrage. Toer balances this all with a tone that never comes across as angry, although given the hardships he himself has endured would make it perfectly understandable if the novel had been tinged with more brimstone. But the narrative does give one the sense of social and political displacement felt by Minke, the book's narrator, and by the family he meets in whose fate he becomes entangled. In This Earth of Mankind, Toer exposes the evils of a society based on and obsessed with castes of race and money, and in doing so has produced one of the essential political novels of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I am impressed by this English translation of BUMI MANUSIA, but the original is still more rich and colorful. I lived for a decade 30 miles from Pramoedya's home town of Blora, presumably the B____ from which Minke comes. All of Pram's books were banned then and Pram himself was in the midst of his imprisonment on Buru, but I had discovered what an amazing opening they provided to the world of turn-of-the-century colonial Java. I am a student of Javanese history and culture, but Pram's works, beginning for me with TJERITA DARI BLORA (Stories from Blora), provided a florid vision to the realities of that world for people of every caste of the colonial social structure. Every time I went into a used book shop I searched for his works. THIS EARTH OF MANKIND is in my mind an unparalleled gift to Indonesia and the world, providing innumerable images of the range of human experience in colonial Java. The Kirkus reviewer needs to know that &quot;nyai&quot; is not a person's name but an appelation applied to unofficial &quot;rightless&quot; wives of European men who were part of the colonial system. There were many of them in every town. Read CHILD OF ALL NATIONS to learn how this particular woman became Ndoro Mellema's nyai. Pram's story opens the window for us to see a whole range of human experience heretofore hidden from public view even from present-day Indonesians who were denied access to Pram's works until recent years. The subsequent novels in the quartet carry on the stunning and poignant revelations. Grievously last month when I out of habit looked again for Pram's works in bookstores in Indonesia they had again disappeared from the shelves of major stores! The story goes on."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"This is a good start to understanding how colonialism can affect culture and history.The narrative is perceptive and well-written.

For reviews and further background, see: The Nation, 2/3/92; The New Yorker, 5/27/96; New York Times Book Review, 6/9/96; Time, 7/22/96; and The Washington Post, 8/11/96."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"The most stunning thing about this novel is the fact that Toer composed it, orally, while in prison. That accomplishment alone puts him in a league way above any to which most modern writers even pretend to aspire. However, if you're looking for a book that is an easy read, this isn't it.Originally composed in Indonesian, This Earth of Mankind follows a year in the life of a young Javanese student in 1898. At eighteen Minke is a true tabula rasa - guileless, impressionable, awed by the Dutch academic institution in which he finds himself. He is a child with his feet in two distinct worlds, the world of Dutch colonialism, and the world of his native culture, Java. But even as his intellect and education appear to open doors of opportunity for him, he discovers that the fact of his birth will restrict and oppress him. For Minke is not European, nor even Indo (half European, half native), but merely a native Javanese. Like other native peoples subjugated by European colonials, the Indonesians suffered humiliating restrictions in every arena: legal, political, financial, educational and social.Although the story line is reminiscent of other classic works of drama and fiction, Toer does not invest his characters with any emotional energy. The star crossed romance of Minke and Amelie, reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, lacks the intensity that makes us weep for Shakespeare's lovers. Minke's stunned recognition of the cruelty of white man's justice is bland if one compares it to the sharp, satiric edge of Twain's Huckleberry Finn. Toer seems to be less interested in creating memorable characters than in revealing the character and history of the Indonesian people. If read with that in mind, the book is fascinating and rewarding.Toer's purpose, in the end, is political. For him, art and politics are two strands of the same rope. But his political agenda comes at a price. The story, as literature, suffers. Still, it does instruct.....especially someone as woefully ignorant about Indonesian history as myself."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"Plunged in economic, religious, social, and racial turmoil, the children of the \\"Jewel of the Pacific\\" nation today are left with a deep silent cry for the fate of their beloved land. They are stunned by the entire mumble-jumble political storm happening around them. They know their ancestors did something right by the fact of their independence from colonialism, but something is missing...Being victim of a corrupt system from the past few decades by their own government blinds and robs them from the connection with the past when their grandfathers and grandfather's fathers fought shoulder to shoulder to free the nation from the oppression of colonialist dogs that robbed, raped, exploited, and enslaved the people.Mr. Toer through his vivid depiction and powerful character projection from the missing era reconnects the children of Indonesia today with their own buried past to rekindle the fire of genuine nationalism. He drew the map to let them find their root and solidarity as a nation. Through drawing a picture of the past, Mr. Toer provides a guide for the nation's future. The tetralogy is a must-read for today's Indonesian generation while the social drama presented in his writing also provides a peek for all humanity to see its own strength, pitfalls, and potential for greatness. No readers will be left behind.I am a child of that nation that selfishly used to be called Dutch East Indies and from the depth of my heart I would like to thank Mr. Toer to endure such barbarism in his life in order to pass on the knowledge that otherwise will be buried by hypocrisy and ignorance.

It is the world's one hope.&quot; I believe one of the central ideas of this novel is encapsulated quite well in these lines. Pramoedya, whose own voice of a political prisoner and persona non grata had been silenced for years, serves as a loudspeaker of sorts through which the voice of Nyai Ontosoroh is delivered to a large audience. Nyai, an Indonesian Native and a Dutchman's concubine, by law is denied of all political, financial, and legal freedoms. Yet her voice and her very presence are resolutely powerful despite many obstacles.Exaggerated pathos aside, Pramoedya narrates a compelling story, full of revelations into the nature of Indonesian societal structure, national history, and into the nature of all humankind.A couple of years ago I had the privelege of attending a conference where Pramoedya's life and works were discussed and where he was in attendance. Being in his presence, along with dozens of others in the auditorium, was an incredible experience. I'm grateful to Pramoedya Ananta Toer for his existence, his strength, and his words. His work is an important part of recorded human experience, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"This Earth of Mankind (Buru Quartet)","review":"I loved the first three of this series.

But, in a way, This Earth of Mankind sets the stage of things to come. It gives a glance into the culture and the understanding of classes.However, I was more than disappointed by the women in this book. Minke's mother-in-law is described as this strong person who built the business, always says the right things and is incredibly self-educated. However, why did Annelies not inherit any of that? Or get taught any of it? Annelies can't stand up for herself even if her life depends on it. Why is she such a soft and pityful woman? How could her mother's ideals NOT be installed in her? And the son is incredible rude. Why doesn't she, with all her cunning, have any control over her children?

He makes grand, over the top statements about how his characters feel about each other with nothing to back it up except his pronouncements that he hits you over the head with every so often (just in case you had regained consciousness and had forgotten). He waxes poetically about his mother-in-law and how smart and well educated she is and yet spends the end of the book melodramtically wringing his hands when she loses everything because she moronically thought as a concubine she could keep everything after the death of her master (if she understands the political situation of the day as well as he claims, why did she not have a plan in the event of his death?)

Keiger's book was long awaited and is the first detailed and extensively documented biography in English of a figure whose career spanned over forty years (1887-1929) of the Third Republic. Poincar&eacute; led the republic as Prime Minister multiple times, was at the helm during WW1 (President 1913-20) and played a crucial role in the Versailles peace settlement, occupation of Ruhr (1923) and stabilization of the franc after the war. As the Viennese Reichpost remarked in its obituary of Poincar&eacute; in 1934, \\" to retrace his political career with its consequences, its honors, its triumphs, was to write the history of France over the previous forty years and that of Europe over the previous twenty\\". Poincar&eacute;, a moderate republican and cautious liberal in the tradition of Jules Ferry, aroused strong emotions among his contemporaries and has been almost forgotten by posterity. Except for Clemenceau, most of the republican notables of the third republic are hardly remembered now and the primary reason for this has been the long shadow cast over French historiography by the Annales School, which disapproved of narrative history in general, and political history and biographies in particular.Professor Keiger's well-researched study admirably silhouettes Poincar&eacute; life against the background of his times and especially through the prism of myths associated with his name from \`Poincar&eacute;-la-guerre' (\`Poincar&eacute; the war') to \`Poincar&eacute;-le-franc'. For several decades after the end of WW 1, the popular image of Poincar&eacute; was that of a warmongering revanchist and a Germanophobe (derived from postwar German revisionist campaign to shift the war's blame and adopted by Poincar&eacute;'s domestic adversaries for ideological reasons) whose actions and policy of alliances and power blocs led to the war. This stereotype has been demolished by research in the 1970's onwards partly as a result of availability of Poincar&eacute;'s private papers and is elegantly summarized in Keiger's book. Indeed Keiger himself has made a significant contribution in this area (his PhD thesis (1980) at Cambridge was titled: \`Raymond Poincar&eacute; and French foreign policy 1912-1914' and on which he drew extensively while writing his previous book -France and the Origins of First World War, 1983).The present historical consensus regarding Poincar&eacute;'s role in the policymaking as Prime Minister that led to French involvement in the War is that he was convinced that in the existing state of contemporary Europe war was inevitable and that only a strong alliance guaranteed security. His greatest fear was that France might be isolated internationally as it had been in 1870 and be defeated by a militarily superior Germany. It was this belief that led him to conduct diplomacy with new decisiveness and determination and to solidify the military alliance with Russia. As the author elaborates, by 1912 the alliance and its durability were increasingly the prism through which Paris and St. Petersburg viewed all diplomatic issues. It was the Franco-Russian alliance that helped to divide Europe into two power blocs and no man contributed more to this division than Raymond Poincar&eacute;. However a case could be made that it was not the binding nature of the alliances, but the possibility of defection, that proved more destabilizing. Vienna and St. Petersburg sought reassurances beyond the letter of the text, needed demonstrative state visits, and pursued pledges of support- and in 1914, extracted them because Paris and Berlin feared that they would seem indifferent.Using new archival material, the author traces Poincar&eacute;'s life from his birth in Lorraine, education and early political career in 1860 to his rise to political eminence in the wake of the Panama Canal scandal. Poincar&eacute; was elected a deputy in 1887 and six years later he became the youngest minister in the history of the Third Republic, holding the portfolio of education. The center of gravity of the book however is the years from 1912-20, when Poincar&eacute; took over as premiership of a ideologically split nation, serving simultaneously as foreign minister until elected president in 1913 for seven years. As a background to Poincar&eacute;'s achievements as the foreign minister, Prof. Keiger extensively chronicles the drift in French diplomacy between 1905-11, after Delcass&eacute;'s reign as foreign minister (1898-1905). The malaise of French diplomacy during this period has been characterized by absence of effective cabinet control, a narrow focus on domestic issues and constant tug of war and feuding between the senior ambassadors abroad and Quai d'Orsay bureaus (stocked with increasingly aggressive young Germanophobes) and a series of lackluster foreign ministers.When Poincar&eacute; stepped into this confusion, he played the role more of a manager rather than an innovator in foreign policy and wanted to put three fundamental tenets in practice at the core of French foreign policy: Military preparedness in the form of three year law, a stronger and more cohesive triple alliance and the watertight separation between the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente countries. As the book points out, Poincar&eacute;'s assiduous cultivation of the Franco-Russian alliance should be seen within this framework. A school of thought (the historians, Joachim Remak and Egmont Zechlin among others) accuses Poincar&eacute; of giving Russia a guarantee of support to Serbia- a \`blank-check' to rival that of Germany to Austria Hungary. Keiger however finds no evidence to confirm this accusation. However contrary to what most of earlier historical studies suggest, he points out that Poincar&eacute; was in fact more flexible towards Berlin (primarily to safeguard French interest in the Ottoman Empire). As summarized in the book, new research (for instance in the private papers of the brothers Jules and Paul Cambon, ambassadors respectively in Berlin and London) conclusively refutes two commonly held beliefs about Poincar&eacute;: That he would do anything to keep Russian support and that he was unconditionally opposed to Germany.Professor Keiger has written a social biography, situating Poincar&eacute;'s life in the political and cultural ambience of the Third Republic. However this book is not an analytical biography and does not explore some central themes in the history of the Third Republic and underlying social basis of the appeal of center-right politics at the turn of the century. For instance, in the watershed decade before 1914, fundamental changes were underway, in the structure, style, and orientation of politics in France. The ultimate result of this was that by 1914, virtually all French political parties had come round to supporting drastic measures of military preparedness against Germany and to supporting Poincar&eacute;'s call of union sacr&eacute;e of right, left, and centre. In other words, within a decade the discredited \\"old nationalism\\" of Maurice Barr&egrave;s, Paul D&eacute;roul&egrave;de and Edouard Drumont was supplanted by the popular \\"new nationalism\\" of Henri Bazire, Alexandre Millerand and Raymond Poincar&eacute;. It should be remembered that in the wake of General Boulanger and the Dreyfus Affair, nationalism was unpopular and deeply suspect in the Third Republic. The book leaves the etiology and consequences of this seismic shift in the political culture of France and its causal relations to the origins of the First World War under-explored. Despite these limitations this is a stimulating book and will be essential reading for anyone interested in the history of French politics in general and the Third Republic in particular.It is strongly recommended that this book be read in conjunction with Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Rebirioux' outstanding-The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871 - 1914 (1988) and Robert Young's sparkling biography of Barthou, another stalwart and Poincar&eacute;'s contemporary: Power and Pleasure: Louis Barthou and the Third French Republic (1991)."},{"Title":"Raymond Poincar&#233;","review":"John Keiger's biography of Raymond Poincare is an unrelieved litany of lugubrious praise in the earlier style of Pierre Renouvin and Poincare's own memoirs.

He has no trouble with Poincare's secret encouragement of Russia and his counsel of \\"firmness\\" during the July Crisis of 1914, which could have only one outcome: a European war.

And I love examining the tiny, pretty props, which are combined with flat, paper renderings of the characters. When we're not reading it, we keep it on display, as any art work deserves."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I ordered a few different versions of this storybook last Christmas for granddaughters. When I saw this, I felt like the illustrations in it were rather harsh and definately didn't want to give it to my younger grandchildren. When I read the story though, it totally touched my heart and has more than the typical princess meets prince and they ride off into the sunset.In fact, I am a writer and write a column once a month for my local newspaper, on any topic I choose.When I was thinking about this particular book the other day, a part in it inspired me for my next column and I actually had to order a copy for myself to remember the particulars.The story makes a wonderful point that a True Princess is kind and has pristine manners. So many of the princess books and movies, although touching on this, seem to focus more on the glamor associated with being a princess. I think the little girls today fall into the entitlement generation and feel that being a princess means they get all the THINGS that go with this. This story really made a point of the princess being very humble and not seeking after special attention, etc. It just really is a great book for \\"Tweens and Teens\\" and I think they would even like the off-beat illustrations. The romance between the prince and princess is also very sweet and real.I highly recommend it for older children, and the child in all us adults who needs a refresher course in how manners matter!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"My 5-year-old picked this out of the library, where the English-book section is quite small, and we both fell in love with it. I like it so much that I bought a copy to keep. The artwork reminds me of the I Spy books with the photography of miniature settings. My daughter doesn't seem disturbed by the level of language and I think the repeating words helps to build her vocabulary (especially since she doesn't hear a lot of English except from me). Even my 3-year-old loves listening to the story, although she finds it a bit long. I was happy to discover that Lauren Child has written many other books and I look forward to reading them to my daughters."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"The Princess and the Pea, is a charming fairy tale that my daughter loves having read to her at bedtime. The vocabulary is a little advanced, however I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing; it provokes learning. The color illustrations are very grabbing as they hold my daughter's attention for quite awhile.The story is a rehashing of a classic fairy tale about a price looking for a princess. When a lady shows up at his door claiming to be a princess, she is made to unknowingly take part in a small and interesting test to see if she is really a princess. The logic behind why this test is important is a little silly, but after all, it is a children's book and a very entertaining one at that. I hope you give the book a try.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"A sweet whimsical story that doesn't take itself too seriously, but the real treat here is the artwork - each scene was set in miniature and then photographed. Beautiful to look at and fun to read."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"This fairytale of the Princess and the Pea is retold with expertise. It is true to the original tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The varying font--from normal typeset to italics to large bold print--make the actual reading quite interesting for the one reading. The paperdoll cutouts used for the characters bring a unique dimension to the artwork which is more than enjoyable--it is superb. The real life diorama backgrounds are detailed. With each reading -- and there will be many! --you see new facets to the artwork that were overlooked previously. This is a truly great edition and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"Great take on the classic story wtih really unique illustrations that are multi-media looking. However, best suited for older children or moms/dads may want to give a condensed version at bedtime as this version is long; probably more than what mom or dad want to read at bedtime..."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I bought this version of my favorite childhood tale because my daughter and I are dollhouse fans. The amount of work that went into creating the scenes was worth it.

I hadn't been able to view the book prior to purchasing and a few other reviews had me weary but I loved the message and the art. Not your typical princess story. No thrown together illustrations.

I love Lauren Childs!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"This book is so much fun to read out loud. Illustrated with dollhouse rooms and cut-paper people, every page is visually interesting. The longer text makes this book interesting for older children, and the repetition and the fancy fonts give you something to work on as you read this to your family.Oh! The folding on the gowns and the draperies - artistry! And the page where the prince notices that \\"certain something\\" about the princess ... that page is lit with a spotlight effect. I love that."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"Love Lauren Child! What a fantastic spin on the original!

It still feels tacky & I imagine that it will go yellow in these areas as it gets older.I was disappointed because it is a lovely book."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I absolutely love this version of this classic tale! The illustrations/photos are simply amazing and the story is fabulous. The detail put into the artwork is amazing. My daughter, who is 3, also loves this book. We read it all the time. Your home library will not be complete without this one. It would be a great gift,too."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"My niece had a \\"Princess\\" party when she turned 5. So, I went with a Princess theme on her gifts. And when I bought the \\"Princess and the Pea\\" board game (cute, btw), I simply HAD to get a book to go with it. So glad I found this one! I confess I chose it for the mixed media illustrations. When it arrived, I read it and really wanted to keep it for myself! So gosh darn cute. This is not the 100% original tale. There's a spin. She's a more independent princess. And a far more \\"polite\\" princess---THIS version of the tale will NOT teach a lesson of complaining (about peas or anything else), because you know a \\"real princes\\" because she \\"has manners.\\" If you need a creative way to whack-a-mole the inner diva, you might try this. I'm ordering a copy for myself now. It was a hit with my niece as well as her parents."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"This stays pretty true to the classic fairy-tale of the \\"Princess and the Pea\\" though there are some slight differences.The prince must marry a princess, (happily, he'd much rather marry for love). But, he does insist that if he must marry a princess she must be a TRUE princess. As the book unfolds we learn the details of what makes a true princess: good manners, kindness (I think beauty, but it's not made out to be THE main characteristic). What I liked, was that it was never made clear if a TRUE princess is actually a princess by status, or a princess by character. As in, can everyone be a princess if she possesses these good characteristics? A nice thought for little girls, for sure!Add to this the creative, captivating and enchanting pictures. I like how the book is by Lauren Child and \\"captured by\\" Polly Borland - so perfect!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"Came very fast and was perfect, a GREAT book! Both my 3yr old daughter and my 5yr old son, love it!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"This is the fourth copy of this book I've bought. My daughter has one and we've given two to her friends for their birthdays and one to a cousin. It's such a beautiful book. I will probably continue to give it because I want everyone to enjoy as we have."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"This book is the classic tale of the Princess and the Pea, but with illustrations that would delight an older reader more than a child. Very theatrical and interesting, but not what I'd expected for my young granddaughters."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"As a children's librarian I'm ever watchful and ever on the alert for the next Caldecott contender. I like picture books with a bit of oomph and pizzaz to them. I like picture books that try to do something a little different. I like picture books, in short, like Lauren Child's, \\"The Princess and the Pea\\". I picked this puppy up with the full expectation of getting something along the lines of yet another Charlie and Lola adventure. Instead I was stunned by the fabulous art I found. From its cover (cleverly designed to look like the cut-away with the chandelier is actually a giant pea) to its final pages where the book describes the artistic process, \\"Princess\\" has everything you're looking for in a great picture book, but with enough artsy-fartsy cache to lure even the stodgiest of adults.Once upon a time there was a king, a queen, and a prince. The prince was of the right age to marry and his parents wanted him to find a suitable mate. The prince agreed to this plan but he wanted to marry for love. This would have been fine except that though he met all the nearby princesses, none of them had \\"a certain ... something about her\\". So the prince searched high and low for someone to love but no one was quite right. At the same time that the prince was getting depressed about this, a beautiful girl who lived in a treetop house started following the moon to see whether or not it was just as beautiful above and beyond the mountain as it was in her home. Of course this meant that she became hopelessly lost, but fortunately she stumbled across the king and queen's castle. And if you happen to know your classic \\"Princess and the Pea\\" story then you know what happens next. The characters in this book are all from the pen of Lauren Child but each one has been cut out, dressed up in real fabrics, and placed in very real sets. They move and dance and walk and sleep all within very real areas and are then photographed for this book. The result is luminous.I ecstatically started talking up the charms of this book to a co-worker today when he pointed out, not unfairly, that Child's use of italics in the book is a bit... much. He had a point. There's nothing wrong with the writing itself. Child uses the same easy-going unassuming (yet charming) wordplay we've all grown so fond of in books like, \\"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato\\" (winner of the book-more-adults-find-themselves-unable-to-pronounce award). Unfortunately that same set of words is fairly riddled with overenthusiastic italicizing. Every time I saw an adverb coming I felt like I had to duck or find myself over-emphasizing words that did not need to be over-emphasized. But some people won't even notice this and others won't find that it hurts the text a jot. I am in the latter category and certainly the book seems tailor-made to be loved.Actually, it was the story that caught me off guard. At this moment in time picture book publishers are in the thick of a bit of post-modernity. When it comes to fairy tales, you're far more likely to find a book updating a stodgy old classic than telling a story straight. There are exceptions to this, of course, and \\"The Princess and the Pea\\" is one of them. The story (as you can see from my summary) is pretty darned faithful to the original. I found myself continually amazed that the book didn't teach that seeking a mate purely through their blue-blooded status was wrong. I was shocked that only princesses were considered as the rightful mates to the prince and that he, in turn, had no objection to having his potential dating pool so severely cut. But Child is charming. She gives you the original tale and then renders it so nice and sweet and funny that you completely forget that you're not supposed to enjoy a story that sticks so closely to its source material. The source material being, in this case, Hans Christian Andersen.The only equivalent to this book I've seen before would be Abelardo Morrell's 1999 re-illustration of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\". In that book, the artist took Sir John Tenniel's original pictures, cut them out, and gave them a depth and originality I haven't seen the like of until now. One of the charms of \\"Princess\\" is that the back the book goes into a fair amount of detail describing how the illustrations for this story came to be. There is a mention that, \\"as in most doll's houses, not everything here is in scale\\". That may be, but if there are discrepancies then I must be blind to them. Plus photographer Polly Borland knows how to control everything from the sets to the lighting of a scene. So when Lauren Child said, \\"I love the paintings of Vermeer, his details and the way he allows you a glimpse into someone else's world\\", it was Borland's job to bring us a picture book series of Vermeer-like photographs. The result is marvelous. With an array of dollhouse furniture (including, I kid you not, a teeny tiny tureen of peas) at their fingertips the two artists have given us a book that takes an idea for a picture book like few others and manages to stab a jolt or two of gorgeousness into its veins.I'm gushing. Sorry. I mean, photography in picture books can be used for good or for evil. Evil would be something like, \\"The Lonely Doll\\" by Dare Wright. Good would be this book. It'll lure the kiddies in with its promise of princesses right there in the title and it'll improve their budding little minds with its beauty and great choice of words. A must-have purchase from 2006."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"On a recent trip to the local bookstore, my daughter picked up this book, pulled me to a chair and instructed me to, \\"Read this please, Mama!\\" The cover art caught my attention, but the title... another retelling of the Princess and the Pea left me less enthusiastic. I began to read...Each page brought another terrific and interesting illustration, and the text, well... it was fun, smart, funny. Before I knew it I was completely drawn into the story and having a ball. More than one adult shopper stopped to listen in, clearly enjoying themselves as well.Also a first grade teacher, I soon found myself thinking of how I could use this book in class with my students. High praise for a book to want to take it to work and introduce it to a class full of youngsters.I'll keep my review short, but suffice it to say, this book is a real winner! And the illustrations... oh, the illustrations! I'll admit that I also found myself thinking Caldecott Medal."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I am stumbling over what great thing to list first. The incredibly vivid format? The gorgeous and unique blend of intricate dollhouse set creation and illustrations? The deft reinterpretation of what it means to be a REAL princess (as opposed to a cloying, vapid Disney princess), to say nothing of finding a life partner? The great vocabulary and lilt of the words as you read it? The joy of reading this story with a daughter or several little girls? Lauren Child makes this tale something totally magical but wonderfully grounded. Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I orignally got this book because at my daughter's school a children's drama group came and did this play. We are big fans of Charlie and Lola so when I saw that Laura Child had written a book I knew this was the book for us. Each night my daughter chooses the 3 books we read each night and for the past 3 nights she has picked this book!We love how this classic tale from Hans Christian Anderson has been updated. I like how the illustrations are not just illustrations but are actual paper dolls made by Lauren Child with her classic prints / designs she uses for her characters clothes and surroundings. The \\" set\\" for the book is actually a cereal box and the furniture and lighting are from actual doll houses. The page of the book explains how the book was done. We also like how the Princess has Raven Black hair and the story rolls off your tougue. It's just an absolutely well done story, enjoyable for both child and parent!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I got this book after searching for the Princess and the Pea story for my 2-yr-old, who is currently fascinated with our telling her that story orally at bedtime. This looked like a cool, artistic take on it. Sometimes I kick myself for buying books/picture books online for my kids without the chance to flip through it or preread it myself. I'll admit this book is, um, unique and clever--but it was not at all interesting to my young daughter and my guess is that it won't be until she's much older--say, at least 10. Two complaints from a parent's perspective--the faces, while certainly artistic, are pinched and angry looking on every page in an aloof and odd way and the last page describes in a snarky tone that real princesses don't eat peas. Great. As if it weren't hard enough to get kids to eat veggies. So, like I said, older kids/girls might like and the artistic adult crowd--but it was read/looked at once by my little girl and is collecting dust now. True test of a great book for kids is that they go back for more over and over for days! This one, not a hit."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I adore this book! I picked it up while shopping in Anthropologie a few months ago and it's been in frequent rotation at bedtime in my home since then. I have a daughter who is four and infatuated with princesses. This book offers her the glimpse of royal life that she loves, while at the same time letting me get lost in the beautiful illustrations and quirky dialogue. You can't help but read dramatically from this book! Speaking as an artist/designer, this book has amazing visual appeal. I especially enjoyed reading how the pictures and models were made. I would love to see more from this talented duo!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"We borrowed this version of the Princess and the Pea from our library, and I had to have my own copy. This version is so incredibly unique (the king and queen are more like hippies... barefoot, beards...). The incorporation of the actual artwork with the miniature still life set ups work so dynamically against the lavishly designed text. The actual words, themselves, are meant to be read aloud, and nothing is overlooked. It's very suspensful and certainly not 'disney-ish' at all, which is a pleasant relief from so many of the children's fables and fairytales out there these days. I must admit, I bought this for myself, but my children are always captivated by this book no matter how tired they are at night!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I'm not a fan of the classic princess and the pea tale (really... the most desirable woman is one who is so delicate she can't sleep on anything but a perfect mattress?), but Child does make a few improvements (I like lines like \\"Not only was he romantic but also a little dramatic\\" in reference to the prince who decided that he would \\"live alone for all eternity, gazing at all the stars in the night sky\\"). The illustrations are what really makes this book. The colors are rich and each image is full of life. The author designed miniature sets and furnished them with real doll house furniture and then had them photographed."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I picked this book up at the library, thinking it was just another pink princess story I could read to my 5 year old. Low and Behold this was a wonderful story, no different then when I was 5 years old, but the illustrations, and more importantly the emphasis on manners was a breath of fresh air! The next morning before putting my daughter on the bus, I asked her if she was going to be a Real Princess -- and her answer with a huge smile was Yes Mommy, I will remember my manners today! Love books that help me enforce my normal nagging messages in a fun way!"},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I read this book to my child after reading a 'standard' version. It was much easier for my child to grasp what was happening in the story. The vocabulary is very 'high' for a four year old, although this book is 'recommended' for that age, I believe it would need to be supported by an easier version in order to be understood by an average four year old. The illustrations are wonderfully creative. I certainly intend to purchase this book for our collection."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I love her work and this is sooooo beautiful--it kills me! She is such an amazing artist. Have not yet read it to my kids but they will like it too and should appreciate the wonderful artwork."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I bought this book because I was looking for a fun re-telling of this classic story. Despite the other rave reviews, I found this rendition to be just so-so. I'll give it a few points for originality in artwork - but just because the pictures are unusual does not make them great (unless you like 2-D cut outs stuck in various photographed backgrounds). I did not find the pictures to be particularly compelling myself. What's more, I did not find the text to be that much fun to read. A bit too verbose for the very young listener, and definitely too dense for an early reader- it probably pleases the adult audience the most (but is that the target audience?). Even as an adult, I found the excessive change in fonts annoying to read. Furthermore, I felt the book missed the major point of the fable - it focused alot more on the looks and mystique of the princess, rather than focusing on her inner essence of beauty, not to mention her sensitivity to lumpy mattresses - which seemed to be almost marginalized in this story. Personally, I still like the princess and the pea story - I just wish I had chosen a more light hearted age appropriate version for my child."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"The story is basically the same, but my family did not appreciate the art. It was a real turn off to us. It's a little hard to explain, but it just felt strange and distracting. It's not horrible, we just didn't like it. To each their own I guess."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"I like this book and my girls seem to. But, I wouldn't put it on the list of our favorite kids books and probably wouldn't miss much if we didn't own it. It is neat in that it is unusal - the graphics are different. The story is a classic. It's so so overall though."},{"Title":"Princess And The Pea","review":"THIS BOOK IS ALMOST FOR ADULTS. I HAVE TO PARAPHRASE IT SO MUCH FOR MY CHILD THAT, AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN I'M THE MOST EXHAUSTED, THIS BOOK IS TOO MUCH WORK. MY CHILD ENJOYED THE PHOTO'S BUT YOU CAN'T READ IT WORD FOR WORD.

Because it is a beginner's dictionary, it is not exhaustive (for example, the word &quot;mestizo&quot; is not included as an entry). At the same time, the editors have made an effort to include very practical definitions. Therefore, under &quot;pin&quot; in the English section, you will also find PIN (n&uacute;mero de identificaci&oacute;n personal), and along with &quot;making out&quot; an address or &quot;making out&quot; a check, you can learn how to express &quot;making out&quot; with somebody.The dictionary includes a special middle section with verb conjugations, false cognates, and fun word games (in both English and Spanish).Though perhaps primarily intended as a resource for English speakers learning Spanish, my Mexican students of the English language have found this dicionary to be a helpful tool."},{"Title":"HarperCollins Beginner's Spanish Dictionary: The Essential Dictionary From the First Class to the Final Exam","review":"Harper Collins has a long history of providing students of world languages with dictionaries that, in addition to being reasonably comprehensive, have the cleanest, most transparent design on the market, and combine those features with affordable prices. The new (2001) Beginner's Harper Collins is no exception. Although it is a reference likely meant for first- and second-year students, and therefore is NOT as comprehensive as more advanced learner's dictionaries may be, it seems quite sufficient for that level.The two-color design makes it easy to distinguish between keywords; each new meaning of the same word is underlined and begins on a new line. Explanations are clear, and provide not just basic meanings of words, but also usage patterns - a feature which is very helpful, and usually NOT found in similar, basic dictionaries. And so the English TO DEPEND is not only translated as Spanish DEPENDER, but also includes prepositional extention (DEPEND ON = DEPENDER DE), with an example (The price depends on the quality = El precio depende de la calidad); additional meanings and prepositional usage are explained through clear examples: You can depend on him = Puedes contar con &eacute;l; DEPENDING ON in the sense of SEG&Uacute;N has not only an example (depending on the weather = seg&uacute;n el tiempo que haga) but also a color-highlighted usage note (seg&uacute;n has to be followed by a verb in the subjunctive).The authors had enough common sense (unlike those of some competing dictionaries) to list only the most usual, frequent meanings, leaving out confusing details. And so, commendably, TO REALIZE is simply rendered as DARSE CUENTA, without listing the existing, but misleading verb REALIZAR (correct, although in the sense TO FULFILL and not TO BECOME AWARE OF); an appropriate usage structure is given as well: to realize that = darse quenta de que, plus there is a sentence: Nos dimos cuenta de que algo iba mal.Usage notes scattered generously on the pages are a very helpful and unique feature; and so the entry for AN EAGLE not only gives &Aacute;GUILA, but also highlights with a blue boxed background: \\"Although it's a feminine noun, remember that you use el and un with &aacute;guila.\\" Quite impressive in a BEGINNER'S dictionary!There is a good and sufficient, although brief intro. on how to use a dictionary, followed by a few useful check exercises. The reference part includes irregular verb charts, as well as sections on telephone, e-mail, traditional correspondence, numbers, dates and telling time, and a list of common false cognates (\\"falsos amigos\\"). In the text of the dictionary all irregular verbs are clearly marked with an *, although finding the conjugation may have been made easier if they also had a pattern number listed in the entry, without requiring a second search in the the irregular verb section.I can't resist mentioning the paper, although it may seem trivial to some readers: unlike so many pocket-size dictionaries, this one is printed on good, smooth, crisp white paper, NOT the yellowish and coarse newsprint which unfortunately is the common fare of most dictionaries in this price range .... Two-color print is another visual asset, although sadly it has not been used to its maximum advantage (e.g., irregular verb forms in the conjugation patterns could have been highlighted in color,increasing the visibility, without any additional printing cost).Overall, for the first and second year students of Spanish (and equally for the Spanish-speaking students of English as a FL), this is the dictionary of choice, with little competition currently on the market among bilingual dictionaries (beginner's Spanish-only Diccionario Escolar VOX, ISBN 0844279803, ... would be a great companion to this title beginning at 2nd year level). One should note, however, that most serious students of language will outgrow the scope of this vocab by the end of their second year of (college) study."},{"Title":"HarperCollins Beginner's Spanish Dictionary: The Essential Dictionary From the First Class to the Final Exam","review":"By far this is the best and easiest dictionary for high school students to use.

The events inthat period of history, interwoven with her family saga, are re-lived inProf. Qin's recent book &quot;Heartbeats and Heartaches&quot;. The precariouslivelihood of the townsfolk in the vicinity of Shanghai at the turn of lastcentury, the socio-economic unrest in the Republican years, the hardshipsduring the harrowing war times, and the repression suffered under atotalitarian, tyrannical rule that eventually culminated in the modern-dayApocalypse are well documented and depicted with such astonishing accuracyand objectivity and in such depth and breadth as can only be compared byPearl Buck.The path treaded by Prof. Qin's family following the Communist takeover wastypical of all the intellectual families in China: from intense patrioticsentiments to uncertainties and illusions, then bewilderment andindignation, and finally disillusions as a result of sadistic politicalpersecution, as vividly depicted in the book. Chinese intellectuals maysuccumb to temporary setbacks; but according to Prof. Qin, they areindestructible and will grow &quot;eternally&quot;. The characters in the book arelarger than life. Prof. Qin's unswerving devotion to her family and career,her father's fervent scholastic pursuit, her mother's never-ending toilwithout so much as a word of complaint, her daughter's failed romance, andher husband's mishaps remind the reader of someone in his or her own family.As a result, every chapter finds a ready echo in the reader's heart.The book was written over a period of ten years with blood and tears, withheart and soul; and as such is mandatory reading for those who have similarfamily stories to tell, those who are keen on Chinese culture and history,and those who try to find out what social contexts have triggered thecurrent earth-shaking transformation in China reminiscent of the Phoenixrising from its ashes. Prof. Qin is known to me as a person ofextraordinary integrity.

Many of the authors discuss experiences when they have had to deal with fear, loss, and the difficult question of risk; they also share some of the lessons that they have learned from years of being challenged by nature and other people. Willis' compilation includes a selection of both fictional and true stories that I found to be a balanced combination of very funny, poignant, sad, and--best of all--inspiring. Reading this book really made me want to get outside! One of the convenient things about this book is that the stories are rather short, so it's easy to pick it up for a brief escape from the hustle and bustle of the city...There is also a bibliography so one can read further about any of the stories, if one chooses."},{"Title":"Climb: Stories of Survival from Rock, Snow and Ice (Unabridged Selections)","review":"Willis has a genius for searching climbing literature and coming up with gripping passages to incorporate into his anthologies. Some readers will find that they already own most of the original books, making the anthology unnecessary. However, for those who only like the exciting bits, or who don't want to collect dozens of volumes, Willis' works are perfect. The latest installment continues to incorporate writings on many different climbing styles and historical periods, both fiction and nonfiction."},{"Title":"Climb: Stories of Survival from Rock, Snow and Ice (Unabridged Selections)","review":"The book was very good. It gave me a very good time reading. It was so good I couldn't even put it down! I recommend it to everyone who engoys climbing stories!"},{"Title":"Climb: Stories of Survival from Rock, Snow and Ice (Unabridged Selections)","review":"I was interested in this book since I love reading and have been rock climbing for a couple years now. I've been really enjoying the book. Its a bunch of short stories from different climbing experiences. So far I've read like 6 of the stories. They are really well written and entertaining. Some of the writers are funny, some are great with descriptions. Some of the stories are just crazy and I cant imagine doing some of the things they've done, but they are enjoyable to read a lot. So far I've only climbed indoors and top roped outdoors, so it was neat to learn of all the other kinds of climbing. I'm learning a lot about what to do and what not to do. I really like it so far. Some of the stories I can't put down til they are fully read. Its great. I would recommend it for someone who likes climbing because it gets really into the sport, uses all the lingo of it, and doesn't talk a lot about things outside climbing. I had gotten my boyfriend a climbing book he is having a hard time getting into because the first several chapters have nothing to do with climbing but this book takes you right into the climbing and never leaves. Its excited for someone interested in the topic. If you were an adventure story person without a particular attachment to climbing I'm not sure if you'd like the book. Its crazy adventures and would satisfy that but its really about climbing and doesn't do a lot with talking of other things or character building outside that."},{"Title":"Be My Valentine","review":"by Vikky BertlingDave Barnett's life is in upheaval. He's been fired, gotten drunk and his house has been ransacked. Tyler Spencer's life isn't going to well either. A college student, she's been dumped the day before Valentine's Day and lost her apartment. Dave, in his drunkenness, gets Tyler fired from her job and she decides to follow him home until he pays her for the weeks lost wages. They find his treasures from a recent dive, a mysterious ring and some Spanish coins. Dave and Tyler decide to track the history of the ring. After a visit with his grandfather, Dave and Tyler decide to go back to the where he had found it in the ocean. It was a perfect day when they left, however; soon they are caught up in a bad storm and wake up in the wrong year. They have to give the ring to its rightful owner and find a way back to their time before a disaster strikes.Ms. Beckenham does a wonderful job with the history in her story and she paints a realistic scene of Port Royal, Jamaica 1692. The reader can practically smell the salt of the ocean and see the crowded docks and ships in the harbor during the golden age of pirates. However, more time should have been spent in developing the initial relationship between Dave and Tyler and less time in the re-hashing of past happenings between all of the characters in this book.The antagonistic way in which Dave and Tyler met does not lend itself to the ease of companionship these two seem to share. Tyler goes home with a strange man whose home seams to be a pigsty. Dave wakes up in the morning to a virtual stranger in his home. After one question about the mess in his house, Dave believes Tyler was innocent. I just didn't believe the easy relationship of the two people who never even knew each other's names until approximately 12 hours after meeting.The flow of time was also a problem for me. At one point the reader is left feeling that Dave and Tyler were prisoners aboard a pirate ship for both a long time and yet only a few days. The same feeling happens during their stay on the island they are taken to and sold into slavery.While the story is disjointed and certain actions were down right unbelievable, the history was vivid and interesting. The romance and the characters themselves, left a lot to be desired. These elements detract from the enjoyment of a potentially good story."},{"Title":"Be My Valentine","review":"Be My Valentine is a fast, sassy time travel romance set in contemporary New Zealand and Port Royal, the &quot;Sin City&quot; of Jamaica, in the year 1692. I liked the characters and the setting, which includes a shipwreck - waking up surrounded by pirates on a deserted island; and the interesting plot made it a really good read."},{"Title":"Be My Valentine","review":"Lawyer Dave Barnett had had a day from hell. He had been sacked (too many staff, he was told) and he faced a bleak future - unemployed, with a hefty mortgage and a boat.How would he manage? He finds himself drowning his sorrows in the sleazy bar where Tyler Spence works as a waitress, and inadvertently causes her to lose her job. She works nights to pay her way through university as a student of archaeology and history. The creepy bar owner refuses to pay her the money she's owed.An angry Tyler follows Dave home. She figures he owes her big-time and she won't leave until he pays up. In the morning, Valentine's Day, Dave realises his house has been burgled, but nothing of value is missing. When Tyler sees some coins he had had in his briefcase, she realises they are gold, enough Spanish gold for a lifetime.They visit the rest-home where Dave's 92-year-old grandfather lives. He's an old sailor, who also recognises the coins as gold. He picks up a ring from among the coins. \\"It's Rosa's ring,\\" he says. He tells them of Rosa, a Spanish lady whose parents would not allow her to marry a poor sailor, so she eloped to Jamaica with Ricardo. The rose ring was a 21st wedding anniversary present that Ricardo had commissioned. He drowned during a storm on his way back to Rosa, and the ring was never seen again. Until Dave found it.Dave's grandfather says Rosa's soul cannot rest without the ring. \\"Dave, go back. The rose ring needs returning. For me,\\" he whispers.Tyler and Dave are soon on his boat, on their way to where Dave had found the coins and ring. The day is bright and sunny, but suddenly a mysterious dark cloud looms over them, and a chilling mist comes from nowhere. Then a titanic wave swamps the boat and propels them back through time.They awake to a couple of stinking pirates kicking them, and they are taken aboard the Lady Rosa, named after the most beautiful woman of Port Royal, the captain says. Could there be a link here to the ring Dave had found?The ship docks at Port Royal, known as Sin City, which abounds with rum, pirates and prostitutes - and worst of all, slavery. Tyler and Dave are destined to suffer the ignominy of being sold as slaves.We take a torturous route with Tyler and Dave as they try to get the ring to Lady Rosa. Their love grows as Tyler's history lessons come to life, and they battle time to achieve Dave's grandfather's wish. Can they return to their own century before disaster overtakes them?Jane Beckenham has written a fascinating time travel and her description of life on a 17th century sailing ship is vivid and almost tangible - slimy horse stew, weevil-infested biscuits, rats, bugs in hair and Dave's whiskers. I felt myself scratching my head. This is a good insight into life in the Caribbean 300 years ago and I thoroughly recommend Be My Valentine."},{"Title":"From Peer Pressure to Peer Support: Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Through Group Process : A Curriculum for Grades 9-10","review":"I thought this book was a good book since I am a sophmore in high school. I am doing a speech on binge drinking and how to deal with it. I believe kids my age should read this book because it might help them get through any drinking problems they might have. Kids in especially grades 9-10 are under a lot of peer pressure to drink. I know. I did drink for quite awhile until I ended up in the hospital.

The author's premise is valid: Human beings who have looked at the earth from space return with a different view of of our planet not only literally, but philosophically as well. However, rather than expand on this idea, he simply repeats it. Page, after page, after page. I stuck with the book hoping the last section containing interviews with space travelers would redeem the work, but each interview was merely a copy of the first, which went something like this: &quot;When I first glimpsed the earth from space, I was overwhelmed with its beauty. I gained a sense of how everything on earth was interconnected, and I knew I would never look at life the same way again&quot;.

The process starts with the Overview Effect that turns the entire Earth into our neighborhood. It continues from the Moon, when a single gloved thumb at arms length can cover everything we've ever known. This view is the Copernican Perspective, and it exposes our insignificance and vulnerability. Finally there is the Cosmic Insight, which occurs from the outer reaches of our Solar System, and inspires us to take our rightful place in the Universe.White explains all this much better than I can in this quick review.I am very puzzled by the negative reviews of this book. Maybe these people believe that \\"if you've seen one star you've seen them all\\". My guess is that there are some important differences in metaphysical assumptions about reality that cause people to either love or hate this book.I'm not exactly sure what that difference is, but I suspect it has to do with our preconceived notions about humanity's place in the universe, and in our capacity to wonder."},{"Title":"The Overview Effect: Space Exploration and Human Evolution, Second Edition (Library of Flight)","review":"_________________________________________Speaking plainly, this is a wretched book.

Translated from German, the essay is hard to follow and uses tortured English peppered with artspeak.On the upside, this is probably the definitive Kippenberger book."},{"Title":"KIPPENBERGER","review":"The volume and range of Martin Kippenberger's artistic activities are mind-boggling. His frequently hilarious work demands that the viewer get involved in an endless network of associations, anecdotes, and confusions of meaning. This presents a special challenge for non-Europeans (Kippenberger's work often satirizes his European contemporaries, as well as European assumptions about the social role of \\"the artist\\") but is well worth the struggle for anyone who cares about contemporary art.Roberta Smith, writing in the New York Times, offered the opinion that Kippenberger was \\"one of the three or four best German artists of the postwar period.\\"This colorful book is the best introduction to Kippenberger that I've seen, although the introductory essay isn't terribly illuminating (it seems to have been poorly translated).This edition reprints and substantially expands the earlier (1991) Taschen book on Kippenberger. It is unusually inexpensive for an art book of this quality; the book seems to be the publisher's personal tribute to Kippenberger, who died at age 44 in 1997."},{"Title":"Dreams","review":"I found this book as a young child in my grandparents' library.

She and her twin were only sixteen when the Yankees invaded their small town, and Rochelle bore stunned witness to her family's dying. Carefully she weaves circumstance and opportunity into a plan to track Corporal Steven Browning through the next four years and the end of the war, vowing to break his heart rather than taking his life. Little did she expect to become tangled in her own web of passion.Steven can't help the niggling feeling that he's met this devastatingly beautiful woman before, but her denials are enough to put him off track. The instant spark of attraction quickly becomes a consuming flame, and Steven can't walk away from this beauty. As she drops in and then out of his life, her manipulations entangle not just his passion but his heart. Soon he finds himself determined to marry her, despite the obstacles. He may find himself of a quite different mind, however, when he learns of her manipulations and deceptions, given that Steven highly regards such qualities as honesty.Cassie Edwards brings great enthusiasm and vivaciousness to her newest novel, ENCHANTED ENEMY. Her account of riverboat travel complete with &quot;grasshoppering&quot; over sandbars and wildly sensual, stolen moments creates a dramatic background for revenge and love. Heated emotions walking the fine line between hate and love heighten the eroticism, making the concept of an enchanted enemy a marvelous play on words. While the plot line breaks no new ground with his adherence to formula, the characters are vividly realized, making ENCHANTED ENEMEY a recommended read."},{"Title":"Enchanted Enemy","review":"The story starts out with revenge on her mind and love in his heart.

He defends the proposition that logic must be valid because its denial is self-defeating. On the otherside, he rejected the idea that theism could be deductively proved. Therefore, he challenges Thomism's belief of a deductive approach, and finds that it cannot be validly proved.Natural knowledge of God's existence doesn't take a person very far, not far enough. Thus, he centers on an evidentialist, experiential approach. Here he latches onto systematic consitency, the lack of internal contradiction coupled with external agreement in one's experience.He proposed in other works and this that one's apologetic approach should mirror the times, as he stated: &quot;an apologist must play it by ear.&quot;"},{"Title":"An introduction to Christian apologetics,: A philosophic defense of the Trinitarian-theistic faith","review":"Edward John Carnell (1919-1967) was an ordained Baptist minister, who also served as President of Fuller Theological Seminary from 1954-1959, and then as professor of Apologetics.The keyword to Carnell's approach is \\"systematic coherence.\\" He sought to find \\"a successful union of the ideal and empirical worlds,\\" and notes that \\"every man is a philosopher of a sort, and must pass judgment upon the whole course of reality. But the only proof he can offer, both for his system of philosophy and for the actions which flow from it, is systematic coherence ... It is this framework that the Christian offers proof for his system: it sticks together ... God is absolute consistency. And the will of God has been revealed in Holy Writ.\\"As presented by Carnell, \\"Three problems wait for the philosopher's solution. First, truth, must be located. Secondly, a rational universe must be plotted. Finally, these two must be so united that they will provide a basis for trust in personal immortality.\\" \\"Having no perfect system of thought while we walk by faith and not by sight, the Christian suggests that a rational man settle for that system which is attended by the fewest difficulties.\\" However, he further says that \\"Logic can be the means by which the Spirit leads a man into faith, but it is the Spirit, not logic, which finally seals the faith to the heart.\\"He admits that \\"This is not a formal demonstration of God's existence: it is simply proof by coherence. The existence of God is the self-consistent hypothesis that the mind must entertain when it views all of the evidence which experience provides.\\"Philosophical approaches to Christian apologetics are somewhat \\"out of fashion\\" these days (cf. Josh McDowell, Lee Stroebel); but Carnell was an important figure on the scene, and a worthy contrast to Gordon Clark, Cornelius Van Til, etc."},{"Title":"Introduction to Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy","review":"Older version of FTIR, good description of the fundamentals of FTIR.

And so she does but at the same time she find that this task is not so easy as she is falling more and more in love with him a child of the world.Through it all I could completely understand Maddy's fear and reluctance to let Christian fully into her life. She was raised as a simple Quake and he was raised in all the pomp and wealth befitting his station. I loved Maddy and I found it so heartbreaking and heartwrenching to watch her struggle with herself and her fear of losing herself in Christian and his world. She loves him more than life but worries that she is not doing what is right and True under God in living with Christian a child of the world. Although some might think that Maddy is narrow-minded or weak I think that she shows her strength in her determination to stand by Christian. Yes, at some point she does want to run and she does have her doubts even after marrying him, but I think that she was only being human. Maddy had led the sheletered life of a Quaker and to step up to take on the responsibility of Christian and his foreign world of opulance and excess would be a bit frightening for a woman brought up to be frugal and plain. Yes she does look down on Christian and his attempt to regain his dukedom and his money but it is because she simply does not understand the mechanics and politics of the nobility. Chrsitian flouts money and spends it like it is going out of style so that his creditors and the world at large will retain their confidence in him but all Maddy sees is Christian spending money that they can ill afford and this affronts her Quaker sensibilities. Christian himself realizes why she is unable or reluctant to support him-she cannot comprehend his actions which to her are frivilous but are really essential to keep him from going back to the insane asylum. I won't say more but this is a must read."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book was wonderfully written!

While some areas (such asChristian's hospital stay )were too drawn out, I wish the authorwould have given us more of Christian and Maddy before his stroke. My 3 stars are strictly for christian. Wow! He was delicious(it is a romance ya know!) Even going through what he did he was one hot hero and he didn't even have to speak. It wasin the eyes! Maddie on the other hand made me nuts. A QuakerI know, but her thees/thous/cans't and prudish ways drove not only me nuts but Christian as well since he mentioned it numeroustimes. And if she whined and complained one more time to go hometo papa I would have taken her there myself! For these reasonsI couldn't see what he saw in her except her understanding and help which she grudgingly gave. No. Not my idea of love.The ending was good. Bittersweet but good. And I completed it with only a little skimming. A well written book. Except forMaddie."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"The heroine was a pious, cowardly woman I did not find likeable. Our hero has an affliction we never gain any insight into which I found extremely frustrating as all heck. The plot kept me reading, Papa Timms was a character I enjoyed, and the dogs were wonderful. However I felt the heroine was wrapped up in her own piety and the Duke just desperate and in love with the only ray of hope he had in the world, this Quaker woman. I did not find the love story itself very compelling. But the mathematics was intriguing, and the hope of finding the Duke's cure held my interest. In the ending, I was just left abruptly like, \\"oh she changes her mind again\\"."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I read this book almost ten years ago and it is still one of my all time favorites. The evolution of Christian and Maddy's relation was beautifully written and entirely believable. In some books, the reader is left wondering \\"What do these people see in each other?\\" That is never the case here.The device that Ms. Kinsale uses to illustrate Christian's frustration and rage at his condition is brilliant. Her use of language pulls the reader into the story and never lets you go.Supporting characters are used judiciously. But these supporting characters are not the standard stock figures that are quickly forgotten as soon as they disappear from a scene. They live and breathe. Although the supporting cast is important. Ms. Kinsale never forgets that \\"Flowers from the Storm\\" is about Christian and Maddy.At over 300 pages, most books would have gone wrong. Even after all of these years, I can not think of anything that Ms. Kinsale could have eliminated. I loved this book so much; I had to purchase another copy, because the first one was worn out. That is high praise from me."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book has been out for years, and I finally read it. I've got to say, it must be the best book in this genre I have ever read. It is that good. Anyway, order it and be prepared to be in awe of Ms Kinsale."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I've read this book so many times that it has become tattered and dog eared. (and I take great care of my books!) Ms. Kinsale is a savior of the romance genre. She writes intelligent, fleshed out, complex stories with deep, believable characters and this book is probably her greatest. Of those who gave it very bad reviews, all I can say is that they were probably expecting one of the light, &quot;easier-read&quot; romances that you sometimes crave. This book, however, is much more of a feast for your mind than those. I do agree that a few of her books have gotten a little too verbose and twisted up in the subplots, but not this one. And despite that, I still think she's one of the best out there."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Regency rake, Christan Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, finds himself in a living hell after a stroke leaves him unable to understand or produce speech. Commited by his money-grubbing relatives to an asylum for lunatics, Christian's salvation comes in the form of a Quaker woman, Archimedea Timms.Although this novel has a typical romance premise, a woman nursing a damaged man(physically and emotionally), &quot;Flowers from the Storm&quot; stands out from its bland and poorly written shelf mates.Maddy Timms is a Quaker, she thinks like a Quaker, and talks like a Quaker. What's remarkable is that her faith and inner conflict caused by her illicit love for someone outside of her faith never become exhausting. Instead, I empathized with her, admired her love and commitment to her religious community and and understood her hesitant love for Christian. I never felt that she was pious and judgemental of others, I noticed more her compassion towards others, regardless of their lifestyles. In one scene, for example, Christian's former lover cries on the stairs at his feet, in full view of new wife Maddy and the household servants. Instead of becoming angry, Maddy shows her integrity by trying to comfort the woman.The second half of the book really deals with how she reconciles her religious beliefs and her earthly love. Of all the heroines I've come accross, I think I like Maddy Timss the best; she's spunky, and obstinant, faithful and loving and doesn't allow herself to be trodden upon. She's a breath of fresh air compared with many novels in which I feel I can only identify with the hero.Christian is also an exemplary character, though a tad violent and grabby at times. Kinsale does an excellent job of showing the readers his thought process, how he hears speech, and finally how he begans to recover from his stroke. Although much of his fury, his violence, and his rakehell- ishness dissapate in chorus with his inability to comprehend speech, he doesn't become so tame that he looses the best of his masculinity. Even while he is breaking the arms of servants and attempting to yell at everybody, he retains a an affection for cats and dogs. At the end of the novel, even when he thnks he's lost Maddy forever, he still decides to take care of his daughter.In summary, &quot;Flowers&quot; is on the must read and must keep lists for Regency romance fans; the many layered conflicts in this novel blend together to make this a remarkable and poignant love story. Ignore the icky Fabio cover and read it!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"What a deliciously romantic story!!! OOOOOh, Girls...you CANNOT pass this one up.

The re-issue of Flowers From The Storm brings back a book that is remarkable as both a great Laura Kinsale novel and a blockbuster romance.FFTS is a joy. It takes readers places that most writers are afraid to venture. After all, love between a stroke victim and a timid Quaker girl? Fear not. Laura Kinsale makes it work with jaw-dropping style. Everything in this book jumps off the page in exquisite, engaging detail. This book reaches out and holds the reader captive until the last sentence gets it's period placed. As a reader, FFTS enthralls me. As an aspiring writer, FFTS inspires me.I envy the reader who gets to discover Laura Kinsale's work for the first time with FFTS. My recommendation? Buy several copies because you will read the covers off of this book. Don't let yourself ever have to live without this book."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I grew up reading \\"literary fiction\\" and starting reading romance in grad school when I needed something light to distract me from work. FftS is the most like \\"literary\\" fiction of any romance novel I've read. Mostly this is because of the prose. Laura Kinsale does't write sentences like \\"He wept bitterly,\\" she writes, \\"An unexpected strangeness gripped his chest. The lichens on the gravestone began to slide into the letters... He wiped the heels of his hands over his eyes. 'Maddy!'\\" (If you ever wondered what your eighth grade English teacher really meant when she said, \\"Show, don't tell,\\" that's it.)She also doesn't write generic everywoman heroines about whose choices you can always think, \\"I'd do the SAME THING.\\" Instead, she writes complex, deep women whose lives have prepared them in a particular way to manage the challenges their author puts before them. I love Maddy because Laura Kinsale compellingly realized the internal experience of this very specific character in these very specific circumstances.Reading this book after a year of science articles and ordinary romances was like sitting down at a 10 course gourmet meal after a steady diet of protein shakes and McDonalds. I've read hundreds of romance novels. This is the only one I own in hardback, and it's the only one for which I've written a review."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I've read all of Laura Kinsale's novels, and this is the one I come back to over and over again. This story has a real tragedy at its heart, and Ms. Kinsale recognizes that real love encompasses, accepts and redeems tragedy without stooping to sentiment. Her Duke of Jervaulx suffers a stroke, and in the unenlightened times is judged mentally ill. His brain no longer works right: his speech is almost completely impaired, his understanding damaged. An expert shot, athlete and outdoorsman, he can now no longer even button his own clothing. His right hand literally cannot know what his left hand does, and he cannot even explain this to people. As a result, he is locked up in a \\"progressive\\" lunatic asylum, better than bedlam and more humane, but still a cage for a wounded animal. Quaker lady Archimedea \\"Maddy\\" Timms comes to his aid; only Maddy realizes that what plagues His Grace is not insanity, but frustration: \\"He is not mad, but maddened.\\" Her patient devotion to what she sees as her duty rescues him from a hell of incarceration and brutality, and helps him regain his humanity.Laura Kinsale's genius is in the depiction of the Wounded Hero and his inner journey. She gives us a man steeped in pride and arrogance, brought low by fate, fighting his way back to dignity and humanity. Humble Maddy struggles to reconcile her convictions with her heart; like the heroine of \\"Witness\\", she is part of a community utterly at odds with the values of the man she loves. There are the usual farcical elements of deception, surprise and betrayal, but the focus of this story is on Jervaulx' fight to re-establish himself. Kinsale gives him honest motives: not just the regaining of his freedom, but his very real desire to protect Maddy from the machinations of his family. Kinsale gives him allies: his redoubtable Aunt, Lady de Marly, and two buddies who are straight out of Georgette Heyer. Most of all, Jervaulx must overcome his contempt for all that Maddy embodies, must learn to respect her humility and her steady heart. It's not the romp we imagine from a Regency romance, but a quiet, heartfelt love that grows from mutual understanding, an understanding not shared by others.Maddy herself is a unique heroine, one I loved from the beginning. She is honest, brave, quiet, possessed of an unshakeable integrity. When she gives her word, she keeps it, with a code of honor that puts to shame the much-vaunted \\"honor\\" of the aristocrats who look down on her. Her kindness and patience in dealing with outcasts and losers would make her into a plaster saint, were it not balanced by her lack of worldliness, her stubborn self-righteousness, and her almost laughable naivete about the realities of Georgian aristocratic economies. When her debt-ridden duke proposes to pile up even more debt to give a grand ball, she rebels, not understanding a society where perception, not reality, rules the day. The denouement of this fascinating novel involves princes, villains, orphans, and the clash of cultures. Jervaulx is humbled by his past; Maddy is brought low by her own people. Their ending is not a fireworks explosion of dramatic reveals or triumphant returns -- both of them lose almost as much as they gain -- but is rather played out in the quiet victories of everyday life, even if it is lived in a Welsh castle.I come back to this story again and again, both for the carnal, sensual duke and for his sweet-tempered Quaker lady. It's a heartbreaking, heartfelt story, a real triumph of literature in any genre, and a damn fine read."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"It gets 5 stars for challenging story line, well defined characters and realism. I liked how the major issue of proving Christian's competence was tackled. I did not see that coming. I really liked Christian's characterization. I had no trouble understanding what he was trying to say. I did not like Maddy that much, but I could get her point of view. Great characters. I love romances that have more than just bodice ripping, hence this book was just my kind of book.Where this book fails is in the romantic elements. I did not see the connection between the two. I understood Christian's bond to Maddy, but I wondered how he would feel when he fully recovered and realized she was not duchess material. Sure enough, as the story progressed, Maddy proved difficult and did not support him when he really needed her. I really did not see Maddy's love for Christian. She was attracted to him physically, but nothing more. I found Christian to be bending to her requirements again and again. When he stops doing that, they just grow distant.I was surprised that she even showed up at the ball when the king came. I really thought that she was going to desert him at the crucial time. This is not the kind of uncertainty readers should have about the heroine. I do think that she would have left him permanently if Christian did not show up at the Meeting. So, I did not really believe the happy ending. From the point where Christian proposed, I felt that Christian should recover with Maddy's help and should marry someone else from his soceity. This thought was only reinforced when the book progressed and the ending did not help change my mind."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is a very intense tale of a man who is plunged into madness, only to find himself in an institution for the insane (the last place anyone would want to be!) and the spiritual woman who tries to save him.The hero - a once able, vibrant, brilliant man, has been laid low by a stroke - not understood at the time. It was actually horrifying to read his struggles - tied to his bed, tossed into icy water by vindictive &quot;caretakers&quot;, treated like an imbecile.His journey to health is complicated by the desire of his &quot;doctor&quot; to keep him powerless and under his command at all costs.Not just any woman could have seen the beauty in this man - it took a very strong woman with a vast reserve of spiritual strength and great integrity to even see him inside the damaged frame, let alone help him.The heroine fights her family, her friends, and society to save the hero - a wonderful change from &quot;hero-saves-heroine&quot; type of love story.This is definitely not light reading, but it is really a brilliant work, and one of my all-time favorites!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I bought and read this a little while back and have been rereading it ever since.

Yet, they turn out to be a perfect fit - opposites attract and all that.The storyline in itself, all the little details and the other characters playing their games, was amusing and very well done. It\`s so much more intricate than most of the romances I\`ve read and one feels like one\`s brain is actually fed - not just entertained.But the book is entertaining too. It hits you right in solar plexus the way Christian and Maddy are slowly falling for each other. They are not perfect in any way. Christian is selfish and Maddy is very concerned about being an outcast among the quakers, but the way they are slowly seeing other sides of each other makes you want to crawl inside the book and watch in with your own eyes.The story was very sweet and I highly recommend it. I\`ve lent out my copy to a couple of other people and they have all been as amazed with this great story as I have been. Truly one of the best romances I\`ve ever read.

Historical romance is my favorite genre; it's a quick, easy read and the happily-ever-after love story gives me a total escape from reality. I'm always a little embarrassed to admit this because so many \\"bodice-rippers\\" are just poorly written soft porn. Then I discovered Laura Kinsale,Kinsale creates excellent three-dimensional characters in Maddie, a prim and plain, modest Quaker and Jervaulx, the selfish, imperious, mathematically brilliant nobleman. What is impressive is that she stays true to these characters throughout the book. Conflict, plot twists, the relationship between the hero and heroine, all develop credibly in keeping with the behavior and personality of these characters. So although Jervaulx, who's become dependent on Maddie through a debilitating stroke, appreciates and has an affection for his sober and disapproving caregiver, he still lies to her and manipulates her to suit his own purposes. Maddie devotes herself to the duke, despite his sinfulness, believing that she's been called by a higher power. Even as Jervaulx misleads her, she struggles to see the truth and live \\"in the light.\\"I was so impressed by this book I collected all of Kinsale's works. I've read and re-read them -- something I never do for any other author. They never disappoint. Ok, that's an understatement because I'm making an effort not to gush. She's an exceptional writer, the standard by which I've come to compare all other romance novelists. She crafts her stories exceedingly well. Never once while reading her books do I find awkwardly contrived plot devices, glaringly out-of-character behavior, tediously repetitive internal dialogue or cheap cop-outs in her conflict resolutions as I often do with other romance writers. She's subtle, intelligent and witty. Her characters are complex, often flawed and damaged. Her stories are completely engrossing, at times heart-wrenching. And the love scenes are hot. After all, isn't that what you came for?"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book gets major points from me for being so unique in presenting a hero who is not completely self-possessed, perfect and in control. The heroine is also unusual, given that she is not a teenaged hoyden. This only makes the characters all the more real, and their developing relationship has believable depth and passion.I would say, though, that although you can really sympathize with Maddy's attempt to bridge her Quaker life with the life of an aristocrat, it gets a bit annoying toward the end when she so strongly resists her marriage. This suffers a bit of the \\"forced plot\\" so common among romance novels (although I love them dearly), where the hero or heroine has exaggerated issues that they stubbornly cling to in the face of obvious happiness.All in all, though, very worth reading and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"First, I have to tell you, the cover of this book cracks me up. It's sort of a romance novel cover cliche to have Fabio on the cover with his shirt somehow unbuttoned and tucked in at the same time, and usually, it has nothing to do with the content of the book. What makes me laugh is that in this case, there actually IS a scene in the book where the hero is wandering around outside in his shirt, unbuttoned and tucked in, clutching a bouquet of wildflowers. So, aside from his stupid grin, the cover is actually pretty accurate. Whodathunk?I read this book on the recommendation of some people in a writing group I'm in who said they loved it but it was on their never-read-again list because it was just so intense. It was definitely intense. It had a lot to do with religion, and, I think, even more to do with the choice between your background and family and the man you love. I think that theme strikes home with a lot of people, especially women, because it's something a lot of us have had to deal with: Marry the man your family wants you to marry, or marry the man you love. Even in modern times, it's a powerful question.I really enjoyed the story and the characterizations, and might even be convinced to read it again someday. I also liked the symbolism. There were several great symbolic moments, the \\"flowers from the storm\\" scene being one. I love it when authors, particularly romance authors, do that sort of thing.

The story is original and solid.The romance is compelling and passionate. The characters are REAL!

What it is is intensity from cover to cover. Angst, heartbreak, disappointment--a harrowing look at recovery from ailments both physical and emotional. And it is a difficult read.Maddy is a Quaker, born to live a life of quiet servitude and to disdain wealth and liscentiousness. So when Christian, the worldly Duke of Jervaulx, elicits feelings of passion and desire in her, she questions whether her involvement in his life is spiritually ordained, or if she is seeking her own fulfillment. Thus leads to several hundred pages of emotional upheaval and uncertainty.Jervaulx is the unlikely redemption of this book. He is flawed, and complex, and real in a way that makes him far more likeable than the staid and rigid Maddy. Where in the beginning of the book her compassion for him had made her seem a very kind person, my impression of her changed toward the end of the book, when she disregarded his reliance on her to live a normal life, and distanced herself when he needed her the most. Though it is understandable that her conflict of faith made it difficult for her to submit to a life of idle pursuits and extravagence, her devotion to Jervaulx was tentative at best. While he fought to hold onto her, she reverted into silence and censure. While he struggled to maintain his precarious hold on his freedom, she admonished him for being too dependent on \\"creaturely\\" comforts. She resented him his very existence as a \\"child of the world\\", yet found herself unable to leave him.To me, it wasn't romantic. It was a story of co-dependence. A nurse and her patient who develop intense feelings of need for one another, but who are both unwilling and unable to let go of the lives they've left behind. That being said, I cannot in good conscience give this book less than 3 stars simply because it is labeled as a romance. It is a beautifully crafted story, a work from the heart which is executed quite well. And it is different than most of what you will find out there in this genre. Sure, it has a happy ending, but there is no miracle cure. There is no over-the-top bad guy getting what's coming to him. It is a study of the human response to seemingly insurmountable odds, and it is worth a try if only because it is more real than most of what you will come across."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"First off, i was not a big fan of ms. kinsale since i was disappointed with The Hidden Heart. i have never thought of picking up another book by her. when i heard how good FFTS was, i decided to brave the odds and give her another try.and to this day, i am so glad i read this book.straight to the point--this book is ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST in the romance genre. no buts, no exaggerations.it is so full of emotion and tenderness. and after reading it, i felt like i was holding a real treasure in my hands. it is that magnificent.the characters are unconventional. both the hero and the heroine had their own demons to face--not the usual just-\\"a damsel in distress\\" recipe. jervaulx's difficulty and frustration in expressing himself properly is so heart-wrenching to witness. but the beautiful thing about him is that he let his guard down just for maddy and let her see his vulnerability.and maddy is just admirable. full of courage and so much love. if it wasnt for her, christian would truly become the crazed duke everyone is so bent on believing he was. but her own torment in trying to deny her real passionate nature whenever christian's around is such a genuine human emotion that ms. kinsale masterfully depicted.i actually broke down in that part where christian was torn in anguish when he heard maddy ask for the Quakers' forgiveness for her alleged \\"sin\\". the way he spat at the word \\"fornication\\" that maddy claimed, saying that it wasnt that at all, but instead, his love for her. it was simply one of the most beautiful declarations of love in any romance novel.i appreciate the fact that christian did not totally recover from his difficulty in speech, since it really shows that the end does not have to be perfectly packaged, like in fairy tales, but just perfect for its genuineness that one can truly experience it in life."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"The premise was terrific, the setup was lovely, the heroine was the most annoying, milk toast, un heroic woman I have ever had the bad luck to read about. At 91% read she was still running away. The story gave her many opportunities to rise and each time she wilted.more concerned with her own version of spiritual comfort than with actually doing the right thing. I couldn't even finish this garbage."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"First, I'll say that I only checked out this book because it came so highly recommended. It's been voted as a great romance (a keeper). I'll have to disagree. I didn't want to buy the book because the whole story just didn't sound appealing, so I checked it out instead. I was willing to give it a try.I finished it up last night and what a huge disappointment. I guess I expected great things...don't get me wrong, it's a good story, but I don't know how many more times I could stand \\"plain\\" speaking (e.g. thou, thoust, thee, thy, etc.). It just PLAIN got on my nerves (I think it got on the hero's nerves too). The heroine...I could go on for pages about her. She's an absolute nightmare. She kept running away from a good thing and was such a wimp!The hero...sigh...he's the stuff dreams are made of. Those two were just thrown into a situation and the story resulted from that situation. Personally, they should have gone their separate ways and he should have found someone else. Likewise with her.Bottom line: It's a book you either love or hate. I'll never read it again. If it looks good to you, check it out from your local library and then decide if it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I too, like others, bought this book after seeing it on many \\"Best Romances Ever!\\" lists. It was my first Kinsale, though not my last (I have read one or two others that I picked up at Goodwill).I honestly can not think of anything positive to say. The book is a struggle to read. Kinsale writes a good story, her prose is her best feature, yes, she paints like Monet with words. So, if you like lots of pretty words, descriptions, complex plots etc, then this book is for you.But as a reader, I never felt engaged or excited. I never cared one iota for either character. Maybe the excessive prose got in the way.... I honestly don't know. All I do know I kept thinking \\"OK, any minute now, this book will get great! I just know it!\\"The characters? Maddy was far too strident, inconsistant and as passionate as a ....bowl of warm oatmeal. She has the letter of the law, but not the spirit. I hever could understand the why and how of her. Only that every page with her on it was a greater ordeal to read.And honestly, I found it nearly impossible to believe she loved herself, much less Christian. She was actually mean to him right up until the last 3 pages (a Kinsale trademark I'm coming to see). IOW, you have misery and misunderstanding and then an \\"I love you!\\" ending. So the reader never gets their time with the couple when they are happy and at peace.Whoopy (not). That, again, appears to be a trend of the 80's that is long gone, thank goodness. If I struggle with a couple through all their miseries, I want to share some of their happiness. So the book lost points big time for the \\"All Suffering All the Time\\" ending.Christian I felt for, yet at the same time I found myself going down the \\"Why did a man so young have a stroke? Genetics? Alcohol? And what part of his brain was damaged?\\" Path instead of actually seeing him as a 3 D human. Yes, he was a rat and a scoundrel (we read about that for umpteen pages, thankyouvermuch). In addition, his speech patterns were such that I found myself more frustrated or thinking \\"No stroke patient I've ever seen talked this way!\\" instead of having my heart break. Or feeling moved or touched. It was one constant jolt after another of 'this is incorrect' or downright \\"where did she come up with this!\\" Times have changed, there is more information out there etc, but again, this dated the book and made it more annoying than enjoyable.I'm not saying she didn't do her research, simply....neither character rang true as a real person. I simply never felt anything for them because they were too unreachable. Mostly, I never got my time with them in love and happy...the best part of the story. When the book was over, they were gone, the book put down never to be read again. And I as a reader found that the only thoughts that were being provoked were \\"Ok, how do I get 5 hours of my life back?\\""},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is the best romance novel I've read. It's truly a great read for any genre - the heroine's religion (Quakerism) is beautifully portrayed."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"It takes some effort to understand the character \\"Maddy,\\" as she was steeped in her own morality and hopelessly narrow-minded due to her upbringing. In other words: an easy target for criticism. We see that her greatest fears are to be rejected by the Society of Friends and to be outside of God's imminent will. If one cannot see through her eyes, she will appear quite rigid and contrary. I would not recommend this book to those who have no understanding of or interest in spirituality. Such will find \\"Maddy\\" impossible to identify with. To understand her reluctance, one must realize the Society is the only family, the only TRUTH, she has ever known. Her internal struggle mirrors anyone's struggle over marriage outside of the family's will and beliefs: a common and impossible dilemma, as history has expressed. But, as I've said, if any notion of spirituality turns you off, don't bother reading it. I respect Laura for delving into such a character and bringing her to life, as so many authors would have shied away from such a courageous task, knowing that many would find her, shall we say, not so likable? I personally tire of the cliche heroine---and no one, as Christian said, would have stayed by his side like Maddy. It takes tremendous skill to create and bring to life someone truly original, even at the expense of some disappointed readers. Hey, if you want cliche, I wouldn't recommend any of Laura's books. It's what she's known for.I adored this book, and I think it earned the title, \\"One of the World's Most Cherished Romances of All Time,\\" one hundred percent. It was original and the characters were vibrant, witty, and surprising! Laura has a way of making you think. She writes for the shrewd reader, leaving it to them to read between the lines. I love that. So many authors write so plainly that the enigmatic aspect is destroyed. Or the characters are too analytical, leaving nothing to the imagination, and the pages are full of monotonous reflection versus action.Some have said the plot was slow... Well, I will say it is challenging (as are all of Laura's books), with the thee-thou language being the least of it! (Try reading For My Lady's Heart). I would not call it slow, however. The fact remains that this is a great novel apart from all the hype many other authors try to stuff into their books to hold the reader's interest. Be warned, this book is no attempt to appease such a reader. Laura writes her CHARACTERS' story, with little regard for the petty criticisms she may receive for writing outside of the box.Intriguing, poetic, unforgettable. SOOO much more than a mere romance or an entertaining read. This book is an EXPERIENCE. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I have just re-read this wonderful book for the umpteenth time...The story allows us to witness the evolutionsof Jerveaux and Maddiegirl which are richly told with deep emotive sequences, which make for a believable development of a love relationship. Not like other romance writers that write stories where 'baddda bing-badda boom' the characters are in love.I find the book is like a kaleidoscope- with parts and details ever changing tobring a different read depending on the reader's mood at the time.In re-reading the book different elements of the story will speak to you that you may have not noticed the prior reading. For example: Jerveaux may seem more dark and manipulative. Re-read the story again and he becomes a man redeemed - through a series of events which are as we all have, good & bad, to bring us to where we are in our lives today. He becomes a man transformed by love.Similarly with Maddie... sometimes she seems blind and overly malleable, then reading again you see a calm confidence with great bravery.Love transforms these two and we have the privilege to bear witness and revel with them and glimpse at their new beginning!Thank you thank you thank you to Laura Kinsale for her remarkable writing!

I love this story!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I just finished this novel for the third time and this amazing story of Kinsale's just gets better and better with repetition. Each time I've read it, more levels are revealed to me. Kinsale has consciously or unconsciously loaded it with subtle and dramatic story elements that at first can stun you and leave you off balance due to the heavy drama. But after that, the conflicts and challenges for the two main characters twist your heart and mind into knots. Then they resolve in a way that reveals how, in the midst of terrible troubles, where all one's courage and strength is needed, true love is so beautiful it makes us weep. (Also, I'm a licensed psychologist and she did a really fine job on the hero's condition. And the heroine's path is better than the best church sermon.) Kinsale is, in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, romance writer out there because of the complexity of her characters and story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"while i admit, i almost gave up on this book by page 10 [the language is like a mountain to climb at first, but you will be amazed by how quickly you adjust], it is well worth sticking with. this was a truly thought-provoking romance novel. truly. i was simply blown away by it, and hope anyone who comes across it, gives it a chance. i loved these characters so much, and was stunned to actually respect them both. no really. characters in a romance novel. wow. without a doubt, kinsale's magnum opus."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I read this book years ago,and was looking for it, forgetting the title.

But honestly....what in the world have I missed? For as long as this book was, I didn't really care for H/H one way or another. There was more script devoted to describing things then allowing us to get to know the characters. I found myself skipping over the excessive descriptions more than once. I found the heroine, Maddy, more annoying then anything else. She was very inconsistent and I felt bad that Christian was \\"stuck\\" with her. She was great in the beginning of the book, but just annoying as things progressed. Nothing but hope for major recovery kept me tuned into this book. I really did make it through only hoping that the next page will offer a break through in the story, but nope...

She is a pious Quaker and also the daughter of a brilliant mathematician. Christian, Duke of Jervaulx, is your typical rake, whose life is turned upside down when he has either a seizure or a stroke in the middle of a duel. The episode leaves him speech-impaired and unable to use his hands properly. As a result, he's sent to an insane asylum. Maddy becomes Jervaulx's savior. She eventually comes to care for him and helps him overcome his disabilities.While Jervaulx struggles with his disabilities, his brother-in-laws are conspiring to have him declared insane and thus stripped of his title and estate. Meanwhile, Maddy agrees to help Jervaulx and is swept up in this intrigue. Her growing love for Jervaulx becomes a struggle for her as she seeks to balance it with her piety.Both characters are, of course flawed. Jervaulx, used to being in control of his life, struggles with his rage and frustration. Maddy feels torn between two worlds: The Quaker community, the only place she's ever known where she feels safe, and Jervaulx's world.Maddy is a very frustrating character, especially toward the end when she is ready to have her marriage to Jervaulx annulled because it didn't \\"comply\\" with her religious beliefs. She is sometimes judgmental and self-righteous and other times, she's compassionate and loyal.I can't say this is the best love story I've ever read. One of my favorites is Jude Deveraux's A Knight in Shining Armor and I'd have to say that Flowers from the Storm pales in comparison."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Good story, I couldn't wait to read because of all the recs as being \\"Favorite Book of All TIme\\" in an Amazon discussion.

I love a flawed hero and Christian, the Duke of Jervalux, delivered! Like a more recent Christian, Flower's Christian was also a tortured, mentally messed up soul who behaved and loved violently. But, unlike 50 Shades of Grey, the Duke shined in his transformation. By the nature of his affliction he had to learn and grow, and watching his character arc up from the dregs of lunacy, solitude, abandonment, and ridicule was heart-breaking, gripping, awe-inspiring and just wonderful reading!...Maddy got on my nerves in the middle.

The heroine is the only one to help him, even when everyone else has given him up to the insane asylum."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Kinsale did an amazing job with her hero in this one, portraying a man who underwent a devastating stroke. At times when the story was told from Christian's point of view, I almost felt as if I had to work as hard as he did to try and figure out what the people around him were saying and what was going on. His frustration with himself and his situation were brilliantly written, and for a good 7/8ths of the novel he was one of the most sympathetic heroes I've ever read.Maddy, though, is a bit harder to love. She is wonderful in her patience with Christian and her determination to do whatever she could to help him. Her rigidity of faith, though, was disturbing. She was constantly at war with herself over what she wanted to do for Christian and what she believed her religion would find \\"right\\", and it caused her to say and do very hurtful things at times, both toward Christian and toward herself.Of course it all comes out well in the end (if all a bit abruptly) and the prologue is delightful, and really, for much of the book I would have said it was a solid 5-star read. Both Maddy and Christian have some less-than-stellar moments toward the end, though, and behave in ways that just seemed a bit over the top to me, so it got bumped down to four; but still, it was a wonderfully written book that will definitely have me looking for more from this author."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book starts out pretty slow. I think it starts to get better after page 50 or so. I don't know If I would consider this 'one of the greatest love stories of all time'though. And I do try to respect other people's religions and beliefs but sometimes the main character Maddy or Maddygirl as she is often called really got on my nerves. I could not help but love and feel bad for Christian/Jervaulx. Sometimes I had an urge to shake Maddy and yell at her to SNAP OUT OF IT FOOL!!I usually had a hard time liking and understanding her. I also wanted some justice for things that happened to Christian. But anyway, aside from all that, I did enjoy the book. I recommend it highly and I consider it a keeper and would most definitely read it again. \\"TO ME\\" Jamie & Claire of OUTLANDER was one of the greatest love stories of all time...Also Whitney My Love by Judith Mcnaught and Knight In Shining Armor by Jude Deveraux are among my favorite love stories."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I am forever searching for a romance novel to blow me away, or leave me feeling sad when I finish the book, and have to leave the characters behind.

So many romances, are forgettable, predictable, shallow, contrived, and leave me wondering why I even bothered, But alas I am addicted to romance, and this one left me pleasantly surprised and satisfied. I have a feeling, if your looking for a romance that is a little bit more intellectual and in depth, go for it. You won't regret it.

Laura Kinsale paints a beautiful picture with words. This a unique story with unique characters, I liked that a lot. Christian's friends were fun and interesting secondary characters, as was Maddie's dad.Christian has a stroke at a shockingly young age and does not recover to his former self - not a perfect ending, but a realistic one and the reader could feel for him. Maddie, a Quaker, was deeply conflicted by her emotions and staying true to her religious upbringing, which made her actions/reactions difficult to sympathize with.On the down side: Maddie did seem to care for Christian, but not in the love sort of way. The reader is left in the lurch about how certain matters that actually drive the story resolve. What happened about the second hearing and the deal Maddie struck with his family? What happened at the Meeting for 2 hours when Maddie comes out ready to love Christian and be with him?This isn't the best I've ever read, but I enjoyed enough to recommend."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I read this book over a month ago but have had a difficult time writing a review. So instead of telling you about the plot or characters I will share with you my personal response.There are a limited number of books that uplift me, that help me desire to be a better person, to love more and keep up the fight many of us are engaged in; keeping our marriages alive. This book has done that for me.As I read Laura's interpretation of how a mind racked with the assault of a brain hemmorage might function I sat back and gasped. Each excruciating, blissful step forward wrenchs Maddy and Christopher souls onward in their quest for sublime unity. And it comes, despite or perhaps because of their imperfections.This book is about unconditional love. It is about unselfishness and faith. Not only for Maddy but most assuredly for Christian as well. And it is about never, ever giving up. Ultimately this wonderful story is about hope against all odds. Wonderful, beautiful work Laura and I thank-you! 5+"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Ah, what a lovely book. I came upon it by accident in a bookstore, and spent the last 6 bucks I had on my Border's gift card... mostly because I was in a mood for some silly mindless entertainment. Well! Just like its jacket claimed, this turned out the best romance novel I have read, hands down. So good, in fact, that I am almost embarrassed to call it a romance novel.Save for the silly title, &quot;Flowers&quot; is much better than most romance novels out there. Kinsale clearly has a talent for language and weaves gorgeous imagery into an unusual plot with realistic characters. (In fact, it seems that all those who did not like the book, thought this was precisely the problem--they may have been too realistic for some romance readers' tastes.) That, notwistanding the fact that Jervaulx is a wealthy young duke who is hit by a stroke (seems to be a stroke, since his right side is paralyzed and he cannot talk, nor think clearly)during a duel, and that Archimedea, Maddygirl, is a Quaker. Not the most usual pair, but Kinsale truly makes it work--she builds a wonderful foundation for their relationship: compassion and care first, passion and love later. The paradox that Jervaulx encounters before meeting Maddy--he is thought an idiot and treated accordingly, locked in his mute body, humiliated and abused--and from that, he becomes all the more violent--such a vicious circle is awful to read about, but, once again, it makes perfect sense.The Duke is a lovely character, and Maddy, whom I found a bit too severe, is interesting in her own right; certainly unique among the romance heroines. Jervaulx' indomitable aunt, Lady de Marly is also a lot of fun as a character, a veritable dragon, as are Jervaulx' easy-going friends, Durham and Fane. I found the love scenes beautifully written, realistic (a true rarity in romance novels), and exciting--not boring at all. The plot is engaging enough, except for one tiny snag in the end--certainly not enough to take away a star--namely, that Maddy never takes up the subject of the &quot;hired yokels&quot; with her husband--that we never find out whether that was true.The book spoiled me. I want another one like this... :("},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"A great romance novel is a very difficult thing to come by, and an even more difficult thing to write. These days it is rare to find one that is truly a love story, a story about the love between a man and a woman in the face of whatever difficulties may come their way. Indeed, too often romance novels are shallow, oversexed, and cliched, so that when you've finished reading them you feel a sort of wry cynicism rather than a renewed faith in love.'Flowers From the Storm' is not one of those novels.Laura Kinsale is, simply put, a genius. She writes with sensitivity, humour, and a depth of understanding that will have you laughing and crying and sighing. The woman is fearless. She courageously tackles the topic of a mental disability. . .where we see something uncomfortable to be avoided, she sees an opportunity for romance. She even uses topics such as religious and class differences, as if one major conflict weren't enough. But that is what makes her books so realistic. And even better, not once does the novel become about issues rather than love. This is a love story from start to finish, and you won't be able to forget it.There are enough reviews here already that I don't need to give you a summary of the book...the back cover would tell you enough anyway. All you need to know is that this book is an entertaining, touching, lingering work of art to convert even the most jaded soul into a lover of romance and (good) romance novels.Read this, and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I read a lot - sometimes 4 to 5 books a week - and I read a lot of romance novels. \\"Flowers From the Storm\\" just blew me away the first time I read it - I have read it several times since. The characters of Christian and Maddy are so compelling that you become totally engrossed in their story, their struggle and their love. This amazing story makes you laugh and makes you cry - what more can one ask of a truly incredible book? I have read about 80% of Laura Kinsale's books and just finished \\"The Dream Hunter\\" last night.

This novel is a mature love story centered around believable, well-developed characters. Christian, a profligate duke used to arrogantly controlling his world, succumbs to an illness not understood in his day and is labeled as &quot;mad&quot; and shunted off to an asylum. Maddy, a Quaker assisting at the asylum, takes a special interest in Christian when she recognizes him as not only the duke, but as the man who shared a passion for mathematics with her father. Maddy has an immediate affinity towards Christian, believes that he is not &quot;mad&quot; and begins the process of assisting him to escape the machinations of family and business associates who are quick to wrest from Christian his title, his money, his very being. But Kinsale's story is not a predictable one. Maddy comes to love Christian but it is love complicated by its conflicts with her strict religious tenets and by her doubts as to Christian's true nature. Christian's illness and his relationship with Maddy makes him recognize his debauched past and want to become a better man, but just how much of the &quot;debauched duke&quot; in Christian is what attracts Maddy despite her protests to the contrary? As Maddy and Christian conspire to keep Christian from being declared incompetent by the courts, they interact with a host of wonderful characters including Christian's old drinking buddy Durham who turns out to be a clergyman, the good Quaker man Gill who Christian has reason to be jealous of, and Christian's aunt who has her own reasons for accommodating Christian marrying a Quaker. Interwoven in the tense plot are scenes so poignant that the reader's heart goes out to Christian as he struggles with himself and his love for Maddy. Christian's illness has left him unable to speak complete sentences, yet Kinsale imbues his few halting words with such depth of feeling that they speak volumes. The book is over 500 pages and yet I wish it had gone on for 500 more. If only I did not despair that it will be a long time before I find another romance novel that is equal in stature."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This has to be one of the very best historical romances I've ever read. It's the first Laura Kinsale I've tried, based on all the good reviews she gets for this book. The novel is a good length, about 470 pages in the Avon paperback. I really liked this as I prefer complex plots and characterization which do need that extra length, along with the attention to finer details.The novel is set in England in 1827. The duke of Jervaulx, a rake and a brilliant mathematician, has a stroke which sees him incarcerated in a lunatic asylum. There he meets again Maddy, the Quaker daughter of a mathematician he has been collaborating with. She becomes his only hope of escaping the hell he has found himself in. Maddy belongs to a different world to that of Jervaulx's, in class and religion. Under normal circumstances, it is unlikely these two people would have got together. However, Jervaulx's stroke makes him dependent on Maddy, his nurse, and romance gradually creeps up on them. Both have to deal with the consequences of a relationship in which each share very different world views, along with the social disapproval meted out by Jervaulx's aristocratic family and Maddy's Quaker community.Is it hard to understand dialogue in parts of the book? Not really. You just have to work a bit harder at it. Maddy's Quaker way of talking was easy for me to understand and in regard to Quaker dates I found the information on the internet (First Day is Sunday, etc and January is First Month etc). I didn't get some of the dialogue where Jervaulx is hearing speech from his stroke-impaired viewpoint, but that didn't really bother me as obviously Jervaulx is not understanding it either. I prefer more complexity in my reading anyway, and I like books that tackle more serious issues."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I was intrigued by Laura's writing style, not from her books, but from correspondance online. Because of this, I decided to pick up one of her books, and she recommended this one. I was not disappointed.Her portrayal of Maddy's conflict with her religious beliefs and upbringing was superb, and the accuracy of the Quaker belief system was quite good.This was one of the most romantic books I have ever read, and the fact that it focused on actual romance rather than just sex was quite refreshing. To those who complain about the lack of communication: I believe it is the struggle to communicate that drew me into this novel so much, and sometimes it is the struggle, rather than the words, that are the most powerful sign of love."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"From where I sit I can see five books by Laura Kinsale on my shelves. I love re-reading them. I find her characters interesting, and hope she has some more books out soon.I would like to say something in Maddy's defense. I like her, and understand that for a devout Quaker there would be a bone deep conflict of life styles, religious doctrine, and personal beliefs, in many ways large and small between her and Christian a member of the Church of England. The Plain Folk, Quakers, believe in a simple life. They do not believe in military service, preachers in church, personal adornment, or titles. In a marriage even small differences over saying grace at dinner, or not, can cause trouble.For Maddy to commit to a lifetime of alienation from fellow believers, to be shunned, by her life long friends is no small matter."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"My second Kinsale novel after SHADOWHEART (***), Laura Kinsale's novels are always a challenging reading experience, but I thoroughly enjoyed FLOWERS FROM THE STORM. The ending was icing on the cake; in fact, the ending was cherry on top of the icing on the cake. Why are her novels so challenging to read? Well, because Kinsale hits you hard with her own dose of brutal honesty, and the stories aren't rosy, 2-dimensional surfaces, but three-dimensional, very complex, very intense. Written well before SHADOWHEART, I found FLOWERS FROM THE STORM's (1992) prose and settings inferior to SHADOWHEART, but its characterizations and story superior. Have I mentioned I loved the ending in this one yet, epilogue and all?There's many themes and stories in FLOWERS FROM THE STORM, but I find myself drawn to one in particular: the brutal consequences of the lifestyle a blackguard and libertine chooses. A carefree, depraved lifestyle leading to an account of the lowest lows. A lot of regency romances depict a chaste, virgin heroine rescuing a rakehell from a dissolute, worthless life. But I haven't read any which chronicle the consequences of this dissolute lifestyle in quite such a brutal way. More often than not, rosy regency romances sugarcoat the hero's dissolute lifestyle as a prerequisite to his Master of Seduction title, ably deflowering our virgin. In a way, FLOWERS FROM THE STORM is a spin on this same'ole-same'ole storyline: a virgin heroine saving the blackguard hero, but in so many others ways, it's so honest, so brutal: both in the delivery and in the execution, and therein lies this particular story's beauty.For myself, the journey from a blackguard hero's horrible, nightmarish lows to the salvation he discovers from his heroine represents the heart of the novel: flowers from the storm, if you will. Even though the heroine Maddy saves her hero, I thought novel firmly belongs to its hero, the Duke of Jervaulx (pronounced Sher-VO) Christian Langland.FLOWERS FROM THE STORM takes the virginal-heroine routine to its extreme where we have a Quaker heroine from the time period (\\"Friends\\") shunning materialism and worldly notions as a result of their puritan, spartan upbringing. The hero, however, is materialistic and licentious to the extreme on the other end of the spectrum. In this way, the characters in this novel represent caricatures, symbols from opposite ends of the spectrum. You really get a true sense that their arduous journey to discover common ground represents no small feat: the entire ordeal very arresting, very resonating.On the downside, I felt the story was very, very slow developing. SHADOWHEART was one firecracker after another while the 533-page FLOWERS FROM THE STORM languishes in places quite a bit, especially the beginning 2-300 pages which feature the blackguard's lowest lows. Still the story wouldn't be the same without this accounting. I also felt the prose and setting were far weaker than Kinsale's more recent SHADOWHEART. Obviously, her writing has evolved but showed promise from the start.Although slow moving overall, the finale was grand once you get there. And very heartwarming. I thought both Jervaulx & Maddy acted honorably and maturely, even with Jervaulx's tricks. Maddy surprised me time and time again during situations and circumstances prime for a cliche regency-romance-heroine run and gun.Anyhow can't say enough how much I really enjoyed this novel. An entertaining and heartwarming take on regency romance to the extreme."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I bought this on the strength of some VERY good reviews on amazon.co.uk and amazon.com... and they undersold it. This book is just brilliant!The basic story is the Duke of Jervaulx, a womanising rake with an unexpected genius for mathematics, suddenly becoming unwell and ending up in an asylum. Our 21st century eyes tell us he's had a stroke, but I suppose in the 19th century these things weren't understood and his inability to communicate meant that he ended up incarcerated.Our heroine, Maddy, is a quaker girl who looks after her father - also a mathematician - and through her father's work with Jervaulx she first meets him, before his stroke, when he is the darling of society. He barely notices her initially, although he is charming when she and her father spend some time with him at a meal.Then his stroke, he disappears and with that his promise of a mathematics chair for her father at a seat of learning, causing Maddy eventually to have to take a job working in an asylum to make ends meet. Where she meets Jervaulx again.Some people have commentated that it's tiring trying to understand what he's saying and what he understands Maddy is saying in this part of the book. Indeed it is, that's the whole point. The frustrations that a very intelligent man must feel when reduced to almost child-like abilities is brilliantly portrayed. His vacillating emotions, his anger at Maddy when she doesn't understand him, are beautifully written.I thought that most of the book would take place in the asylum but no, Maddy helps Jervaulx to get well enough to go home - at least to have his sanity officially questioned so that his grasping relatives can try to get their hands on his money. The story twists and turns in unexpected directions but is throughout so well written that we are carried along with them both, rooting for them to find a way to exist together in an unfriendly world.This is a love story which is gently drawn and the two main characters come from utterly different social backgrounds and ways. Laura Kinsale has done a brilliant job of portraying Maddy's Quakerism and how that affects her relationship with Jervaulx. Several portions of this book brought tears to my eyes, and that doesn't happen very often.It is clear that Laura Kinsale is very familiar with her historical period - there were none of those awful errors that American authors often make, such as carriage journeys round England taking just half a day. She knows London of the time and none of her characters do anything which isn't right for the period. Bravo!What would have really ruined this book was if Jervaulx got completely better. He doesn't, but it doesn't matter. He has been shown as a man whose utterly heedless life is completely turned around and who understands far more Maddy's worth in comparison to his own. He was a duke and she a nobody, but he learns to understand her true value and the valueless nature of worldly rank.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Flowers From The Storm\\", and it was difficult to put the book down. Maddy made an interesting heroine. I can honestly say, I've never read a book about a Quaker before. And Christian made a great rogue. I enjoyed his slow seduction of Maddy. My favorite part was probably the scene where he enticed Maddy to play with the litter of kittens. The author also did a great job at helping us understand what Christian was going through with his illness. It definitely helped me to feel compassion for someone I may not have liked all that much otherwise. If there is anything not so perfect about this book, I'd have to say that I did grow a little impatient with Maddy and her stubbornness to really believe in Christian. But that was only a minor irritation. By the end of the book, I really felt like I knew the characters and I cared what happened to them. This was a well written book. I will definitely read more by this author."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This books is definately memorable and certainly the first book I read from this author. She is a very good writer so the book is up to literary standards. I think the main characters are very memorable and believable -flawed and courageous. The only part of the book (which is also what makes this such a great and touching book) is that Christian (the alpha male turned handicapped) becomes more of a patient then lover. When I read this I imagine Christian once handsome and powerful is rendered into a child-like state. Maddy talks to him as if he was a 5 year old - I agree that this is touching but its hard for me to imagine how a grown man acting somewhat like a child can be romantic - I see the romance don't get me wrong between patient and nurse but if anyone have ever seen someone suffer through a stroke and is recovering it is not romantic at all. The person makes quasi-motto look attractive. I mean its beautiful that she fell in love with him despite this but she is not falling for prince charming. I think this book was beautifully written and it took courage to write a touching story like this. Bravo Laura."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I really loved this love story... could not put it down until the very end... I had to know what happened to Christian and Maddy because I was not sure how it would end. I also wasn't sure how I wanted it to end. I empathized with Maddy's struggle to overcome her own strict religious community environment. I wasn't sure for most of it if Christian really COULD love her. I also wasn't sure I believed he could change from what he was into the kind of man worthy of her. But I was convinced by the end! Wonderfully written and intricately woven story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It is enthralling, outstanding and inspiring. I read it over and over and have several copies on my keeper shelf. It's difficult to put into words how fantastic this book is. It is a masterpiece, a work of art, and Laura Kinsale is a master who transcends the genre. Her writing is lyrical and poetic, her descriptions brilliant and shining with emotion. This book is so much more than a romance. It is an experience that is not to be missed. It has profound depths and incredible subtlety. It isn't a light read. You must pay attention and *think* as you read it. The complexities make you work for the fantastic rewards. It will tie you up in knots, and make you relish each tiny nuance. And let me just say that I love Maddie. She is a strong and wonderful heroine. Though she isn't the typical historical romance heroine, she is a product of her time and her culture and very realistic. Of course it goes without saying that Christian is beyond awesome. My favorite of the imperfect heroes. I also highly recommend SHADOW AND THE STAR by the same author as an equally outstanding book."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"What can I say? This is my absolute favorite book of all time. Kinsale is incredible at character development and thinking outside the box. A brilliant, powerful man humbled by his own body and a restricted, virtuous woman drawn into the greatest challenge of her heart and life. This is no light read but if you are looking for a book you can sink your romantic teeth into, this is it!!Out of stock, you say? At Kinsale's website she has promised a re-issue of this incredible book (sans the Fabio cover!) which is due out on May 27, 2003! Order this one, I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is the first Kinsale book I read... It's truly a page turner. The story is very compelling and emotional. Christian Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, suffers a stroke and everyone considers that he is mad. He was sent to an asylum where Maddy tends to him and helps him get out of it and nurses him back to health again. Maddy is a very practicing Quaker. As she falls in love with Jervaulx, she struggles to fight between her commitment to her way and her true feeling toward Jervaulx. The story made me love and cry, it depicts a true love that bonds two people so tightly that nothing can do them apart. Ms.Kinsale adds lighthearted humors to reduce the intensity of the story by Jervaulx's two dogs - Devil and Cass. This is kind of story that will have a part in your heart forever."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I don't normally review Kinsale's books because I think they are just too perfectly written for my meager attempts at review, but then that's not fair, is it? So, I'll attempt to put my admiration for this book into words...Jervaulx, the hero of this book, is as flawed and perfectly loveable as all Kinsale's heroes tend to be. And Maddy, our prim and proper heroine, is the typical Victorian miss -- except for her strong spiritual sense and her impressive reserve of courage and integrity.She is truly an inspirational heroine, in her quiet, unassuming way.One of the things I like best about Kinsale's couples is that the sense of belonging is right there, from the very first meeting. The conflict is most definitely there, but that irrepressible down-deep knowledge and acceptance of the other exists for the heroine and hero both. This is what really makes a romance novel click for me - the ultimate truth of the &quot;rightness&quot; of the relationship, despite all the things that are telling the hero and heroine that it must be &quot;wrong&quot;.Of course, the dialogue, the narration and the plot are very smooth. Just as one would expect from Kinsale, the characters are intense and very real.I've read this one four times so far, which means the cover is about destroyed, and I'm going to get another copy very soon.Highly recommend for all admirers of romance."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book is the poignant story of a cavalier duke who is suddenly beset by an unexpected illness which lands him in an asylum and the Quaker turned nurse who becomes his only means of communication. Christian and Maddy's story brought tears and frustration as well as smiles and warmth. It deals with love at the physical, parental, familial and spiritual levels. It portrays real life conflict between doing what your brain says is right versus what your heart feels is right and the choices one is forced to make as a result. Once started, it was difficult to put down. If you enjoy novels that have a credible plot, but evoke emotion and provoke thought, then Flowers from the Storm is definitely for you"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is obviously a \\"love it or hate it\\" sort of story - and I loved it. Christian, the Duke of Jervaulx is a dissolute rake with a brilliant mind for mathematics, Maddy is the daughter of the Duke's collaborator on mathematical papers. She's also a prim, starched Quaker girl with nursing skills. When the Duke is felled by a stroke, Maddy becomes his nursemaid. The two grow to love one another despite many setbacks in their trust for one another.The way that Laura Kinsale gets into the mind of a stroke victim and writes from his view is just brilliant. Christian remains a smart, virile young man trapped by his inability to speak coherently. Initially, the scenes from his point of view read like some stream-of-consciousness work by Joyce. As Maddy draws him out, his thoughts become more ordered and more comprehensible. He in turn draws Maddy out of her emotional reserve, teaching her to enjoy and appreciate physical pleasure.Some other reviewers complained that the hero and heroine are \\"nasty\\" to one another - to say that misses the whole point of the book and the characters. The Duke speaks harshly because that's all he's capable of; Maddy responds sometimes with reserve because she's been raised to think that everything he is, is a sin and an abomination. She loves the man, but is repelled at first by his material wealth and political power. I didn't see nastiness between them, or cruelty. I saw two very realistic, very flawed human beings trying to find a way to compromise in order to be together as man and wife. I found it beautifully written and very moving."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Simply said, this book is a Keeper.The story is fresh and involving. An absolutely new take on the Marriage of Convenience. The characters are realistic and continually evolving.There is Suspense and Romance. Can the heroine save the hero from incarceration in a madhouse? Can she stay true to her Quaker religion and community?The hero, a typical, arrogant product of the aristocracy finds himself at the mercy of his own treacherous health and his avaricious relatives.The cultural, legal and personal conflicts that beset the Novel's characters are never less than interesting. Can Christian persuade Maddie to marry him, can he recover from the debilitating effects of a Stroke, can he retain control of his person and his Estate? Can he convince Maddie that loving him and his family is the right and honorable thing to do?The characters act consistent with their beliefs and their Social Class. The ease of losing personal liberty and the limitations of medicine during this era are clearly portrayed. These two horrors make the necessity of a marriage between two unlikely amd conflicted individuals very understandable.This is a very emotional, poignant novel. A purchase you will not regret."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Like a painting you keep adding more and more paint to, this just got muddier and muddier. The author should have ended the book way sooner.I liked the story that the Duke suffers some type of spasm (never says what, I thought he was drugged) and his subsequent care. Most authors will not write about things like this; they should. We get the Florence Nightingale effect by proxy, so instead of Superman Duke like other romance novels, we get loveable, regular guy Duke. Main character Maddy is a religious zealot of the Quaker cult. I call it a cult not to insult, but simply because family that is non-cult are cut out of their lives. That being said, it was very frustrating to watch this main character work against herself and her relationship, with a man she totally didn't appreciate or deserve. Fun, laughing and sex with her husband left this leading lady in the constant throes of guilt. The Duke seems to pick unsuitable women, the main character Maddy being no better than the mistress in my opinion. I kept turning pages wondering what this fanatic would do next and it didn't get any better as the relationship seemed to erode Maddy to a sniveling wreck, dependent on her fellow cult members to decide her and the Duke's fate. I do not like giving bad reviews on someone's hard work. Should have been a shorter book, and stopped before Maddy got too loony. I felt sorry for the Duke."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I was so very disappointed in this book! I read all the reviews and ordered the book. Whatever I paid for the book was way too much. I just could NOT like the heroine. I tried, I really tried. However, she just never gave up her pious, better than thou, cans't love anything attitude. I love books with imperfect heros and heroines, and I just KNEW she was going to come around. Sadly, no. I finally gave up reading it and started skimming it around 3:30 a.m. What a wasted evening. This was my first Laura Kinsale book and I am very hesitant to try another."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"The first half of this book is so dark and gloomy that it was torture to read. Not to mention the actual physcial torture the patients received at this institution. Sadly, this is probably how stroke victims were treated.The characters were not likeable in any way. The author delved way to deep into Christian's mind and some of the things he thought were startlingly scary. I just don't think a mental institution is the place for a romance even if the patient isn't really insane.Maddy was so consumed with guilt that everytime a rare romantic moment did appear it was ruined by her thoughts of God. I found her extremely annoying.There was absolutely no witty dialogue of any kind. How could there be? An extremely religious Quaker woman and a man who could barely talk. I just didn't like this story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I'm really not sure why so many people seem to love this book. The hero is mean and selfish, and not in any sort of endearing way at all. The heroine is a hypocrite with absolutely no personality. He has a stroke, she nurses him through it, then is forced to marry him and they fight about a million things and don't even seem to care about each other. After all this they somehow live happily ever after at the end. Oh also he totally doesn't care that a former mistress of his had his baby and wants him to take care of it. The end. Most cherished love story of all time my [...]. Try writing some characters that aren't completely annoying and flat first.I only give this review 2 stars because for some reason I finished the book. At an unnecessary 533 pages it was pretty painful."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book got off to a great start. Christian and Maddy are as different as night from day but sparks flare between them when they meet. Christian is every girl's dream, a man who can see beyond the surface of a woman to her soul (and still find something to admire). Maddy is shaken by her attraction and unwilling admiration for Christian who she had come to think of as amoral, unlike her strict Quaker self.However, the story quickly degenerates after Christian is struck by an illness that leaves him impaired. Maddy shows initial strength in character when she sticks by Christian when no one else is willing to. Unfortunately she proves to be lily-livered and frequently bends under the pressures from Christian's greedy family and her Quaker friend.It is also clear that Christian's love for Maddy is born from his gratitude and continual dependance on Maddy. Maddy is continually torn between sticking by Christian and her Quaker life. Had someone better come along who was willing to have him, I'm sure Christian would have dumped her in a heartbeat. It was that kind of story and really quite pathetic.If you want to read a better story about a Quaker woman who battles the limits of her faith for love, read Penelope Williamson's &quot;The Outsider&quot;."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book was on the top of my wishlist forever and when I bought it I was sooo excited. After the first 120 pages or so I was so bored I didn't want to keep reading the book.It dragged on and on with tedious details and the main male character at first pulled at my heart strings. But then you just realize he is selfish. And when they declair their love it seams so stupid. She cares more about religion then him and he is just a selfish man who wants someone to take care of him.Very dissapointing."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I bought this book because of all the 5-star reviews.

It didn't. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish this book. What a waste of money!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"A great portion of this book is Maddy as a Quaker nurse caring for Christian who is a Duke. Christian has had a stroke and has been confined to an insane asylum. There are sweet and emotional interactions here but their time together in the asylum went on and on and on and on. We get the point. Maddy is Christian's \\"rock\\" and he comes to depend on her. Christian helps bring Maddy out of her confined Quaker world and she feels romantic love for a man. These two are codependent on one another for pages and pages and pages...... Soooo boring.It is also not terribly romantic watching a young , handsome man attempt to recover from a stroke. It made me wonder about the depth of illness in the Duke. It is not that common for a very young man to have a stroke without having some underlying vascular or cardiac disease. Not exactly what good romance stories are made of."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"It took me some time to reveiw this novel and i still cannot come to a conclusion of wether i love orhate the book. This book was a struggle for me to read and i felt like slamming it shut so many times but something kept urging me to continue. And still i was left with mixed feelings. It's the most agitating thing ever!Reasons why i wanted to slam the book shut:-Though most ppl may adore this style of writing, i hated it. It was far too poetic for me and not so easy to comprehend. There were times when i had to re-read passages atleast three time to understand whats's happening (just like reading poetry!). I like to just read, comprehend and move along when reading novels, the extra work i am just not up for. So if your not some master at literature or have some sort of degree in English i guarantee your gonna have a hell of a time reading this novel. Trust me i was irritated!-The heroine, oh my word she was annoying! She is the worst heroine i have ever read about! Yes, i know she was pious, but jeesh!! Maddy was so annoying its not even funny. I curse so much and just felt like giving up on this novel due to how annoyed i was!-Too wordy, too many descriptions and the chapters--of which there were 37 of them--were far too long(This only bothers me when a novel is not that engaging and i wanna get it over with.)Reason why i kept reading:- I fell in love with Jervaulx from the very prologue and after getting a stroke i kept wanting to know if he would turn out ok. Yes, he was selfish but i loved him all the same. Following closely behind Michael Taggert from 'Sweet Liar' by Jude Deveraux, this is my second favorite hero. Heros i wish i could just steal from the novel for myself! lolSo yes, the hero is the only reason that got me turning those pages.It is very very hard for me to regard this novel as a 'True Romance/Love Story. For the very reason Jervaulx only got attached to Maddy because she was the only one who undertsand that he was not mad and he could use her to his advantage. Also she was deceived into marrying Jervaulx and was basically just a 'do as i say' heroine. I would have been a little more convinced if somewhere in the book Jervaulx became fully recovered and was then again wanted by the many beautiful ladies who adored him--we know Eydie would not have made such a scene had she known Jervaulx was ill--and even then proved he was indeed inlove with Maddy for who she was.It is actually two and a half stars, not three."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I was very excited to get this book because it rated so well, but I quickly became very disappointed.

The author is a very talented writer.The characters of Christian and Maddy are extremely well portrayed. This love story is heartwrenching, frustrating, and very touching. The hero and heroine come from two completely different worlds; he from a long line of nobility and she from devout Quakers. Unlike other novels, the hero is not perfect. A tragic stroke causes Christian's relatives to place him in an insane asylum. Due to a twist of fate, Maddy becomes his caregiver. He learns to trust her completely and they fall in love. Not to give away anymore story lines, I'll just say that the relationship seemed to be doomed from the beginning and there are many challenges. There are parts of this book that caused me to be an emotional wreck, but it will definitely be a book that I reread many times."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"One of the best historical romance novels I have read. Laura Kinsale offers exceptional character development, story development, and prose."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is my first book from thia author and I love it. I will have to read more of her work.I will not go into the plot as many reviewers have done so. I like this book is because the conflicting emotions of the heroine: her love for the hero and her religious beliefs. To some, her beliefs might be silly but the author stays true to the situation.Often than not, we read romance novels with heroines easily giving up their beliefs for the sake of love. Here, Kinsale actually showed us the inner storm that Maddy had to weather. Torn between her love for Christian and her upbringing, she had to make some hard decisions. Luckily for us, she chose the right path. (Well, in a romance novel, it can't be another way :))"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is a novel that deserves reprinting, and a much more sophisticated cover treatment! Everything about this story is outstanding, thanks to the top-notch writing of Ms. Kinsale. Many a romance has a handsome man and beautiful woman falling madly in love. This is one author who isn't content to dish up a traditional fluffy fantasy. Instead, she gives us a reckless playboy of a nobleman, hardly admirable in any way. A sudden seizure leaves him with the behavior of an apparent madman, fighting for his life and his sanity. Not your ordinary hero! His salvation comes in the unlikely form of a devout Quaker woman who couldn't be more removed from the kind of world he struggles to return to. These characters actually develop and grow in the process of discovering their need for one another. With powerful characterizations, remarkably authentic dialogue and rich sensuality, &quot;Flowers from the Storm&quot; is truly an oustanding romance from an exceptionally talented author."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I first read this book in 1993. Since then, I have re-read it four times, given away 2 copies to friends, and have purchased every other book I could find by Laura Kinsale. Her writing style in &quot;Flowers&quot; conveys the frustration and confusion of a stoke victim as if you were the character. She also shows a subtle sense of humor-- I love the dialogue about the &quot;good wife&quot;!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"As a bookworm and a selective, but avid, romance fan, I finally caved into the hype and bought this book as a treat to read over the holidays. Eek. It irritated the heck out of me and I was seriously disappointed and amazed that so many people wrote this was the best ever romance book!!! There can't be an interesting and rewarding love story without TWO interesting lovers to cheer for--and there was only one.Yes, I agree with the other 1-star and 2-star reviews, the female character \\"Maddy-girl\\" (and didn't that phrase began to be endlessly irritating!) was an unpleasant read. Of course she possessed \\"normal intelligence.\\" But she did not have wisdom, of which even little children possess in some measure. Her spirituality seemed a constant internal posturing and jockeying for position--it seemed to be all about her. Her reactions, her thoughts, her judgments (on herself and others). Initially, Christian (the male hero) was her shot at spiritual greatness in the book. She was very excited by this. The book clearly states she felt God had spoken to her and given her this mission. Hand in glove with this, was the fact she was physically attracted to him. This fact existed independent of any seductive behavior on his part. So the attraction on her part was 2-fold. But it was not love.On the other hand, Christian seemed to develop a deep emotional attachment to her very quickly. (Besides his need for survival via her assistance.) Therefore, obviously he was going to be made to suffer, contingent on a return of similiar feelings on her part.Maddy's warmth and compassion was minimal--in proportion to the circumstances--and came across as more strongly prompted by her wish for spiritual greatness than true love for another. She was incredibly self-involved and limited in her vision and determined to live up to the standard of her (Quaker) peers, rather than living up to an internal standard developed after much soul-searching (\\"Truth\\"). In other words, through much of the book, she was incapable of independent moral and emotional honesty. I just wanted to dropkick her. She verbally attacks her tortured husband calling him names, reviling him for his faults -- spendthrift, liar, savage -- and thinks she is so much holier than him. Yeah, yeah, a real saint. The rave reviews talk about how \\"loyal and patient\\" Maddy is throughout. Huh? Patient is one thing she is not. She is constantly poised to leave him or berating him and his world.The male character, Christian, would have been an interesting character, but it was painful to read hundreds of pages detailing his torments, including Maddy's unpleasantness, the one person his very existence depended on, unfortunately.There were large sections of the story that were terribly slow to plow through. One always knew it would follow the pattern of: Christian can't communicate in crucial situation, Christian starts to blow up out of frustration and fear, or threatens to shoot someone -- hold your breath and see if Maddy will get her chicken butt in there and intervene or will Christian go the length, wreck all the furniture and get consigned back to the madhouse again. And of course, the constant dithering of Maddy whether to commit to her lover or if that comes between her and her halo. While in the end, knowing they had to end up together. The story just disinterested me as the pages continued to turn, knowing that we were just marking time and unpleasantries until Maddy decided to truly accept Christian.For people that like lots of suffering and demeaning circumstances in their romances, I guess this would be up their alley.I prefer love stories such as \\"Lord Of Scoundrels\\" and \\"Not Quite A Lady\\"(Loretta Chase) or \\"Slightly Dangerous\\" (Mary Balogh) or \\"Marian's Christmas Wish\\" (Carla Kelly) where the characters may have serious problems, including ones that are deeply psychological, but there is no question that their hearts are involved and that the connections run deep, if not always smoothly."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Do not miss this book! It does not have a word out of place. The story is gripping, emotional, enlightening, powerful, and sexy. Christian is strong, beautiful, arrogant and extremely vulnerable as a result of his stroke. Maddy is the only person who can help him. I cannot put into words what a wonderful book this...it is simply the best! I finished it and then re-read it immediately...a first for me. Laura Kinsale is amazing. I also recommend THE SHADOW AND THE STAR."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I must agree with some of the previous reviewers. The heroine made me want to throw the book across the room. I honestly did not understand the buzz about this book. It was just OK."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Lord, save us from the Archimedea (Maddy) Timms of the world! (Where does Ms. Kinsale get these names)? This book is worth more than a 3-star rating, but I gave it 3 stars because of Miss Timms: the most arrogant, irritating, proud, judgmental, wilful, ungrateful, female I have ever had the misfortune of reading about! I thought that Elena ('Shawdowheart') was unpleasant and sadistic, but I'd take her any day over this female! What the poor Duke saw in her, I know not! Physically she was interesting - with her long, long, hair & eyelashes and golden eyes - however that was overshadowed by her narrow-mindedness, in my view. I just could not warm up to her! She got my back up. She was unwilling to try and see what it was like for the others who did not follow the Quaker way of life. In my opinion, she got off far too easily in the end. Sure, she does the right thing, the decent thing and spoke and acted truthfully (after the Duke dared her to be truthful and say what was in her heart!)- but only after she caused him much hurt and grief! The man suffered a stroke and spent months in a lunatic asylum being tortured by sadists - her uncle being chief among them! When he defends himself against a vicious attack in the yard, she immediately blames him and passes judgment on him. It must have been his fault; he attacked and beat the other man for no reason whatsoever; he has a violent nature, because he's a nobleman & is used to getting his own way! He's a rake! Licentious! He's \\"indecent\\" because he makes love in the daytime. He's \\"creaturely\\", and \\"carnal\\"! Yep! He's a man not of the 'Light', so, to Hell he goes! He's a nobleman, wasteful and insensitive to the needs of others! He's 'of the world' - ergo he's corrupt. Going to go to Hell - because he's got too many 'nice' things. Spends too much money. Got too many luxuries etc. etc. \\"Call me \\"Mistress\\" not \\"Your Grace\\". I will not answer to that name\\"! \\"Do not bow to me! \\"I will not, cannot, curtsy to the King\\"!!! On and on she goes. Falling in love with him; loving him, and all the time unwilling or unable to see the truth that she is so very fond of talking about & berating others about. She denies him at every turn! She refuses to act in the dignified way required when meeting the King of England. She refuses to wear nice clothes,(\\"I will not\\"!), which is necessary when you're a Duchess, for pete's sake! A century of tradition, sneered at! Poor Christian. I loved his character! He was flawed, yes, he was after all, a Duke - used to having 'nice' things. He was a gentle soul, unsure of himself and his place in this strange new world, where friends were suddenly an unknown factor. Those one should count on were suddenly the ones to be feared. Needing help, feeling so lost and vulnerable, but not knowing how or who to ask, for he was not used to asking - just directing. Knowing that there were those who were just waiting for one wrong step on his part, to use that as a reason to send him back to the hell of chains and straight jackets; icy baths, and having his head held under water until his lungs wanted to burst! Of being beaten with clubs and chains; of being humiliated and having all one's dignity and self worth stripped away for all the world to see! But this book balances these grim scenes of life for the unfortunate souls who found themselves in these establishments - whether or not they belonged there! One of the best parts in this book is on page 500, when he meets his infant daughter Diana, and she smiles at him! And the plot was very unique - not too often one meets a hero who is less than perfect: the Duke had suffered a stroke, and was afflicted with impaired vision and speech, and of course his motor skills were also affected - although he performed quite admirably, in, er, certain areas! Ahem! For a brilliant mathematician, which he was, you can imagine how frightening it was for him to wake up out of a coma and find your world had so totally, drastically changed! Hard to come to grips with his changed circumstances. They thought him mad! His own mother had them take him away to the nuthouse! To top it all off, his financial empire was at risk of toppling; and his in-laws (sisters' husbands - the nasty men!), were the ones doing the pushing. Thank goodness for his aunt old Ladyde Marly. Bottom line: This is an extremely well written book - full of details about life as a Quaker, full of \\"thee-thou\\"s as Christian would say, and the story is interesting and unique. I just had a very hard time getting past Maddy's judgmental, narrow view of anything that wasn't Quaker. One felt that she felt superior to anything / anyone not Quaker. The book describes her as 'gentle' - not so! Witness how quickly she turned her back on him and their marriage and ran back to her 'Friends', all the while denouncing him and their marriage as being \\"false\\", in a \\"false\\" church, by a \\"false\\" priest. Just when he needed her most. Oh well. Perhaps I'll have the good fortune of one day reading a Kinsale novel and actually LIKING the heroine. (Didn't like Elena in 'Shadowheart' either! Too manipulative and vicious! And at such a tender age)! Look, despite my reservations about Maddy Timms, or, maybe in spite of them, I couldn't put this book down. Ms. Kinsale is a formidable writer - no doubt about that! By the way, I love the Duke's friends - Col. Fane and Mr. Durham. What a pair! Devil & Cass (the canines) were a delight as well. Get this book. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"For almost 15 or so years I have heard about this book. It has frequently shows up at the top of many readers' favorite lists. It has blurbs galore that hail it as one of the best romance novels of all time.Whenever I come across a recommendation of author or book that gets as much as ink is this, I am usually all over it. So strangely, in the past 15 or so years, I have never really felt compelled to pick this book up.But this week, that came to an end and I read it.It is definitely well written and can agree that there is probably no other romance novel like it -- what, with the hero who has a stroke and the heroine who is a Quaker and all.However, I didn't get the \\"ahhhhh\\" feeling from it after I closed the book. The relationship between the two main characters was not the stuff of romantic romance, imo. Maddy was too disdainful and judgmental. And while that can sometimes be a staple in the romance novel, I don't feel the author managed to thread feelings of tenderness or longing or love in with the judgment. Jervaulx was much more sympathetic. Not because he spent the whole book struggling to learn to talk or to not be chained up like a lunatic in an asylum, but I thought the author did a much better job of conveying how much Maddy meant to him than the other way around. Too bad, with a better heroine this might be a 3 star review.I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"You'll find this one in the romance section, but it's primaryappeal isn't as a romance -- I actually found the heroine tobe very UN-likeable, and wanted to smack her a number oftimes. But although this took a point or so off of myrating, it doesn't prevent this from being one of Kinsale'sbest books, and with Kinsale that's saying a lot.The hero is a wealthy nobleman who's also a brilliantmathematician. Overcome by a stroke, he finds himselfin an early 19th century madhouse, where the treatment isbrutal and he's left with his helplessness and frustration.The stroke has taken away his capacity for language -- hecan think, but he can't speak or understand language. (Incomputer terms, the CPU is fine but the I/O port is shot.)Trapped inside his own head, controlled by people who treathim like a crazed animal, he finds, with the help of theheroine, that one thread of communication has been left tohim -- mathematics. He can communicate with mathematics,and though this is rather inadequate for requesting sausagefor breakfast, it's enough to convince her that he _can_still think, and reason, and that there's still a humanbeing in there, no matter what it might look like on theoutside.She helps him escape from the madhouse, and they discoverthat the relatives who will inherit his title and fortunehave been working to have him declared legally incompetent.He has to become legally functional in time for the competencyhearing, or his life will be gone. A judge who knows him iswilling to grant him some extra time, andthey work frantically, battling his disability and all thefrustration and anger and passion (not always romantic)caused by his struggle to break free of the prison his ownhead has become.As usual, Kinsale's characterization genius rests largelywith the male of the pair. Her heroines are often less thanfascinating, but this one is particularly annoying. I thinkthe main problem is that Kinsale has made her a devoutMethodist, and although she's very steadfast in her devotionto her faith in the midst of the wealth and frivolity of thehero's world, in the end she has to choose between herbeliefs and her love, and, since this is a romance, shechooses her love. It's necessary for the genre of the book,but it diminishes the integrity of the character herself.All through the book, this conflict between their lifestylesis constantly before the reader, and it feels as thoughKinsale knew, at least subconsciously, that the heroine wasgoing to have to cave in. Or rather, it's as if the heroineherself knew -- she comes across as a narrow, evil-temperedgirl much of the time, as though she knows the author isgoing to force her to renounce her faith at the end of thebook, and she can't help but express her anger ahead oftime. She'd have been a wonderful character in another typeof book, and one has to admire Kinsale for taking on thedifficult task of using her in a romance (no one everaccused Kinsale of taking the easy way out), but in thiscase the experiment just hasn't worked.Despite the character problem, however, this is still anexcellent book. Kinsale takes us into the head of the hero,forcing us to feel his frustration and terror. Thepossibility that he might never regain his ability tocommunicate invokes real horror, and fear which strikescloser to home than any splatter-tale of a slobberingslasher. And his slow and painful recovery, one maddeningstep at a time, is inspiring to the reader, as well asinvoking empathy.Even if you never read romances, read this one. Ignore theFabio cover -- it's hideous -- but don't pass up the storyinside. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Oh what a love story! Brilliantly written, beautifully told,and most of all, evocatively gut-wrenching. Kinsale not only conveys a story, she enlivens it. Every sentence heightens your senses to the point where you no longer feel you are a reader looking upon a story but a participant who embodies the book by vicariously living and breathing every syllable.For me, the hero Christian Langland, Duke of Jerveaux-a brilliant mathematician, and a reckless, handsome nobleman suffers a stroke that renders him speechless and an inability to understand written or spoken speech, which is misinterpreted as madness by his family, hence his imprisonment in an insane asylum-stole my heart and made this book so incredibly disturbing, intense and highly palpable.The Heroine, Archimedea Timms-a Quaker who transcribes mathematical patterns and equations for her brilliant blind father and heart-achingly called Maddygirl by Christian when she decides to save him and be his personal attendant-was the most unlikely heroine I have ever encountered in a romance novel, but strangely contributed to this fascinating tale of two vastly different souls merging to become one.True, she is not the most liked heroine I have ever read, but she is real and deep but frustratingly stays true to her Quaker beliefs even after her love for Christian is evident. Twenty-eight years of pious Quaker-life was not easily erased from her conscience, which I respected yet antagonized me towards her at the same time, however the feeling was evoked in a positive way that kept my interest in the story and their relationship to a fever pitch.I will not divulge anymore of the story-line for it would ruin the story for you. But it is safe to say that it will remain &quot;one of the most cherished love stories of all time&quot; in my heart and soul, for Christian found his Maddygirl in the most unlikely places, in the most unlikely circumstance and in the most unlikely love they could have ever imagined!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"A beautifully written love story. People who dismiss &quot;romance&quot; without ever reading it should read this before making generalizations. Strong characters, well developed, interesting conflicts. The historical research is top notch and Kinsale is a master of well written dialogue. I wish the publisher would put a more realistic cover on it. I will admit, finally, that I wonder if the medical details are accurate, but overall it's so well done that I can put this question aside."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I liked this novel. A lot. Yes, it's refreshing something different in a romance.It's very interesting to see how a stroke was seen in the 19th century.I have no real problem with Maddy. She has her convictions. Loving Christian means leave everything she has ever known. It's like loving someone... I don't know, from Congo or India or any remote foreign land, wouldn't you have your doubts? Specially if you cannot go back if something goes wrong... I think it's not one of the weak points of the story, but one of the good ones. Because Maddy doesn't sound hypocritical to me but true, sincere & candid. She really believes and tries to act that way.Of course, it's easier to like Christian. He is attractive, rich, handsome and really intelligent. Only with a 'minor' physical problem that he will get over with time.I should say. It's not a perfect romantic novel. But it's a very good novel. You should try and read it, and form your own opinion."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is one of, if not the best novel I've read in a long time. No sappy, unrealistic love story here. There are laugh out loud moments and bawl your eyes out moments.

I will warn you that it starts off a bit slow (at least in my humble opinion), but given the rave reviews I pressed on, and by 15%, I was figuring how to clear my schedule for the next day because I knew there would be no putting this book down.

Her command of language--in this case several kinds of language--is impressive and a joy to read.If you're not a romance novel connoisseur, but would like a taste of it, this is the book you should read.

This is my favorite romance book of all time so I re-purchased the book for my kindle. The characters are not all tied up with a pretty bow like most romance books (they are stinking unlikable at times). The book really allows the male character to have a real vulnerability but still allows for him to be a strong leading man. The leading lady is smart, tenacious and strong. The book is deep and raw and just awesome. If you are looking for a frilly read, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I finished this book several weeks ago......then read it all over again because I couldn't let it go. This was certainly one of the best books I have ever read. I am having difficulty finding the words to do it justice.As a nurse, I found the story of Jervaulx's recovery from his stroke so utterly compelling. Maddy's personal struggle with her religious conviction and her honest love for this man is heart-breaking. The dialogue is phenomenal. I read and re-read scenes several times. The ending is probably one of the best I have ever read.You just have to read it- you won't be disappointed - but be prepared to cry, cry, cry! The only bad thing about this book is that it ended.....Gosh, what a winner.Later, October 31, 2012Amazon won't let me add a second review, so I am going to add to my original one:I have just finished reading this book for the 5th time in the past year, and I still consider this the best book I have ever read.With each re-reading, I ask myself why I love this book so much, and why it is so special. I read a ton of historical romance, and while many authors in this genre have their own particular talents, I think Laura Kinsale is the best! Each sentence, each phrase, each scene is so deliberately and beautifully written. Nothing is fluff, nothing is nonessential.What I love best (besides the romance!) is how flawed Christian and Maddy are - flawed to the extent that they are very human. Neither is perfect- some reviewers even find Maddy rather reprehensible in her seeming lack of sensitivity toward Christian. On the contrary, I loved Maddy for her devotion to her faith, even if I could not share her passion. Here is a character who is true to what she believes in- she talks the talk and walks the walk. Her struggle is when the rigidity of her faith clashes with what her heart tells her - and she is not prepared for this. This was a very real and very touching dilemma. She seeks to do right by another human being, motivated by the actual constructs of her faith (to care about others). In the process, she becomes emotionally bonded with her \\"charge,\\" while at the same time she struggles with the conflicting belief that loving Christian is incompatible with her faith. I love how she works through this. It was such a satisfying result.Christian is as arrogant as they get (he can really be a schmuck), and his journey is equally moving. He is felled by a physical infirmity that humbles him beyond belief, and while he can no longer command others to do his bidding, his arrogance is also his strength, as he refuses to be subdued. Christian is a survivor- and his recovery from his stroke is so inspiring. But he cannot do this without his connection with Maddy, and connecting with her he certainly does! Amazing to think it was truly a chance encounter, and he would have certainly died in Blythedale if she hadn't happened along.I loved how Christian and Maddy worked through their trials. They don't become perfect people and they don't have the perfect romance. Instead, they show us how the strength of their love and their caring for each other helps them to forge ahead and face whatever, one step at a time. (And Christian is no longer a schmuck at the end.....) Now that's love!Oh, if only it hadn't ended........"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"At first I didn't want to read this book because of the self-centered personality of the hero. But then a friend convinced me that I would love it, and she was right! This book has me sobbing at the end. Perhaps my favorite scene of declaration of love is found near the end of this book.I've also discovered that while I may not like a flawed character, if it is one invented by Laura Kinsale, I will learn to absolutely love that character. Kinsale writes with pure magic - the way she puts words together and describes characters thoughts and emotions has completely captivated me. I can't wait to read all of her other books. At the same time, I don't want to speed through them. It's like eating the richest dark chocolate. It's soooo good, but I want it to last."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Flowers from the Storm by Laura Kinsale is my favorite by the author and in my top ten of all time! The reader cannot help but empathize with Jervaulx's suffering after his stroke. The dialogue that exists between Jervaulx and Maddy is touching, frustrating, and amusing (sometimes all at once!). For those who value the strong and independent heroine, Maddy represents a woman whose strength is not a sign of her being bull-headed and naive (as is the unfortunate case of some infuriating heroines) rather she is able to compromise where necessary, while always remembering herself and her values. Her passionate adherence to Quakerism is unusual for a romance, but Kinsale manages this theme wonderfully. Not always a fan of the \\"hero must be handicapped before giving the heroine a second thought\\" story line -- Kinsale constructs this one perfectly -- the hero and heroine truly meet half way in their journey to each other. Definitely worth reading once, twice, heck, even three times!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"After I read and loved Jennifer Ashley's book, \`The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie', a friend recommended me another historical romance with a highly irregular hero.Laura Kinsale's historical romance opens predictably enough. Duke Christian Jervaulx is an unrepentant rakehell, and when we meet him he is in the middle of a tryst with his married lover. All is going according to rakish plan, until his mistress's husband comes home... that's when Kinsale flips this historical romance on its head. Jervaulx experiences a minor stroke, unbeknownst to him. It isn't until a few days later, when he is called out in a duel that Jervaulx suffers a second, greater, stroke that renders him literally speechless. But, according to medicine of the time, Jervaulx is merely mad. He cannot form proper sentences, he yells and rants and becomes abusive. He cannot write, nor remember the name of simple objects... he is mad, and so his family send him to a mental asylum.There, he is nursed by the Quaker woman Maddy Timms. Maddy recognizes the Duke from her father's mathematical society meetings, though she was never one to socialize with the hedonistic Duke. But at the asylum Maddy discovers some shocking news... the Duke is not mad. Through a series of mathematical codes and equations, she realizes he is in fact still of sound mind... though, for some reason, his body cannot communicate it. Maddy takes it upon herself, under the guidance of God's light, to be the Duke's helpmeet. She will rescue him from the mad house, restore him to his estate... and along the way, give him her heart.This book is incredible. I thought Jennifer Ashley was revolutionary in the historical romance genre for writing a hero with Asperger syndrome. But Laura Kinsale really takes the unconventional hero to whole different level in this book.The story is told from both Maddy and Jervaulx's perspective, so that you get an all-encompassing view of the duke's changed character. From Maddy we read how much this man has changed; once lauded in London's tattle pages as a tempting bachelor, Maddy watches as this infamous man is bought to his knees and abused emotionally, and physically. From Jervaulx we read the most heartbreaking narration of all - as readers we can interpret the disconnect between Jervaulx's sane thoughts, and the actions Maddy and the asylum wardens witness.You really have to trust in Laura Kinsale. For a long time I was left wondering if the Duke wasn't half-mad. Intellectually I know that stroke victims are not \`insane', but Kinsale keeps readers (and Maddy) guessing for a long time whether or not Jervaulx has lost his mental properties. For a long time his internal monologue is hazy and muddled, to the point that he can only think to label Maddy as \`Cuzz-mad', because he can't think of her name or to simply label her \`woman' or \`nurse'. Then we read his slow regain of speech; stop-start words and half-formed sentences as Jervaulx wades through the murky waters of his mind. Kinsale writes intense and fantastic dialogue and inner monologues that weave a twisted tale of a lost mind. Brilliant.I will warn that \`Flowers from the Storm' is not a book of smouldering sex... But it is a brilliant and epic love story. Maddy perseveres and believes in Jervaulx when everyone else is happy to abandon him to the mad house. With Maddy's compassion and patience, Jervaulx is able to shine a glaring light on his past corruptions and womanizing ways - and he becomes ashamed of his past. There is some sex - but Kinsale writes them with the utmost tenderness and sweetness, especially considering all that Maddy and Jervaulx have to do to get to that point of intimacy.For a long time I felt a little adrift in the story, wondering how a romance could spring between Maddy and this mumbling, clumsy \`mad' duke... but Kinsale makes it work. The romance is in how Maddy helps pull Jervaulx out of his mind's darkness. It's a love story of grand emotion and unforgettable characters. \`Flowers from the Storm' is unique and glorious, a not to be missed historical romance."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"FLOWERS FROM THE STORM is a very serious novel which is difficult to categorize as it is more than just a romance - in fact, the romance while it does become touching is almost secondary to the plot which takes place sometime during the 1800's. While extremely powerful, I found this was not a very relaxing read which at times left me very disturbed over the inhumanity that oftentimes is visited upon the sick and defenseless.Christian Langland, the Duke of Jervaulx, is the hero of this book. A self-indulgent rogue, handsome, rich, powerful yet is also a brilliant mathematician. The heroine, Maddy, a Quaker, is the daughter of a blind professor of mathematics living simply in the Quaker way of life. As the two mathematicians work together to produce a paper on a new mathematical theorem, Maddy as her father's assistant and eyes would come in contact with the dissolute duke, despising his lifestyle so different from the devout Quaker. The day after the two co-authors presented their paper to academia, Maddy would hear that the duke had been killed in a duel.Some time later Maddy and her father would come to live on an estate converted to a hospital of sorts, better known as an insane asylum for the very wealthy. Her cousin offers a position to Maddy in return for her help as a nursing assistant. It was here that she would come to realize that the duke was in fact alive banished by his family unable to speak, and thought to be mad. Because of the inability to communicate Jervaulx's frustration was exhibited in anger, thus these patients were thought to be mad, dangerous and treated little better than animals. Not only was the sickness miss-diagnosed, but his greedy relatives were attempting to have him declared insane in order to take over his fortune. This entire aspect of the book was heart-wrenching to say the least - including the abuse that so-called care-takers were heaping upon him.Maddy recognized him and saw that there was intelligence in his gaze and that he was not insane. She came to understand that it was his inability to communicate that sparked his anger. While she was initially afraid of him, she slowly began to help him to remain calm and effected changes that brought him some measure of peace and soon as her cousin saw her calming affect on him had her assigned to his day-care. As the competency hearing approached, and he along with Maddy to calm him, were transported to the city, she began to realize that if he were sent back to the asylum he would never leave it. Through some harrowing events, they would both escape the doctors, and his family and find their way to one of Christian's friends. Eventually, the friends were able to convince Maddy that only by marrying him would they be able to override his family in the ultimate decision regarding his care.This was an absolutely heart-wrenching story as Maddy and Jervaulx tried to prove that he was sane, just couldn't communicate - but the ignorance of the powers to be couldn't be brought around as his family tried to have him being declared insane. Christian's strength was remarkable as he battled his way out of the haze of a debilitating stroke. He was a marvelous hero and one has to admire his strength. Maddy was a different matter as she was so into her religion that she wouldn't admit to the feelings she had for a man of the \`world'. She was in some respects an angel of mercy for Christian, but she held so much emotion back from him and from herself that she caused even more agony for them both.I would have given this a much higher rating if there was more romance to it, but it was so heart-breaking through the majority of this 550 page book that when they finally came to the romantic and very sensual part (one must remember that he was a rake before the stroke) I felt too drained to enjoy it. I have to say that this is a powerful book - extremely emotional in its scope and an excellent read for the author to have the ability to cause the reader to feel so caught up in the story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I am among the few reviewers who really don't see what the hoo-hah is over this book. This book came highly rated by several websites but it is really beyond me why people like this book so much. I don't remember disagreeing with so many people on the characters that I simply cannot identify with.In a novel that is over 450 pages long, Laura Kinsale gave hardly any space to the character development of Christian before his stroke, other than that he got a married woman pregnant, jointly discovered a new mathematical formula, and fought a duel with the married woman's husband.There was only one meaningful encounter between Christian and Maddy before he was impaired, when he was describing her features to her blind dad. Their next encounter if I am not mistaken was when she saw him again at the asylum her cousin runs.It's hard to ignore that Christian probably fell for Maddy because she is the only person protecting him from an abusive asylum warden. And considering that he later agrees to marry a woman that his aunt has chosen just so he does not have to go back to the asylum just reinforces the point.And while I understand that Kinsale is giving us the perspective of a man suffering from a stroke, it really gets quite tiresome trying to understand what Christian is thinking page after page. I've read several other romances involving people with disabilities, including Catherine Anderson's Annie's Song, and I never had the impatient feeling to skip over the characters' thoughts and feelings.Still, other than the parts of his thoughts and speech that I wanted to rush through, I must say that I like Christian's character throughtout the book (basically because I like rakes, the more \\"rakehellish\\" the better!)That's more than I can say about Maddy. Her Quaker character adds more complications that needed in a story that is already has so many hurdles for the hero and heroine to overcome. She takes care of Christian because it was a command from God. She unwillingly escapes with him later even though he needs her. This to me is not love, it's a duty she undertakes unwillingly.I think this story could have been much more than what it is, and I am really perplexed at how so many people enjoyed this book when I probably won't even read it again. My copy of Flowers From The Storm is better off with someone who appreciates this so-called love story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Our heroine, Maddy, is Quaker, restrained, servile, not beautiful or flashy, dedicated to her beliefs and to her mathematician father. Our hero, Christian, is gorgeous and flashy, rich, upper class and dedicated to his own pleasure and to mathematics. Put them in Regency England and the rubbing of values and beliefs begins long before the rubbing of flesh. When Christian has a stroke which is construed as insanity, Maddy has the chance to care for him as an inmate in a putatively humane asylum. The meaning of freedom comes to Christian as he loses his wealth and privilege because he can no longer speak, read or move as he could. He becomes like a child in his performance level, but with advanced understanding that frustrates him tremendously. Too late he learns his dependence on his family, and he is in danger of their sending him back to the asylum where he will die. His loss of power allows Maddy an unwilling exploration of her own power. By caring for him and understanding him, she unleashes her own desire for formerly unwanted things. He becomes dependent on her and then they dance back and forth in the one up/one down dance of dependency. In this dance they gain new autonomy. She mutes his life with her restraint in a way he absolutely needs to survive. He brightens her life in a way that frightens the beejesus out of her. This book is about different kinds of pride and how we hold on to them for survival, then experience deliverance when we go over the brink and lose our pride. In this story, through learning and fruitful conflict and perhaps good luck we eventually have a happy ending. But to her credit, Kinsale makes her characters- and perhaps her readers-- struggle for it.Of all my favorite Romance writers, Kinsale portrays the nuances of conflict best. She makes the cognitive frames and the sociological slice and dice very convincing. Then she portrays it in appropriate colors. She deals more in emotion and thought than action and description, so some people may find this book inaccessible or uninteresting. I can heartily recommend her book \\"MY SWEET FOLLY.\\" On the other hand, I was repulsed by \\"SHADOW HEART,\\" although I admired her risk taking in exploring sadism and masochism. I do not know her other works.\\"FLOWERS IN THE STORM\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. I've read a lot of Romance and all the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. I think they would have enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"What doesn't start out as a love story but as a tragedy is truly one of the best love stories ever. Christian, the Duke of Jervaulx, is a compelling character, and his recovery following a stroke is enough to break your heart. Christian is almost totally dependent upon Maddy, who is not very dependable, dwelling too much upon her own needs at times when Christian most needs her.I recognized the \\"flowers from the storm\\"--following a thunderstorm, Christian picked some Michaelmas daisies for Maddy and she threw them on the ground.Christian has to battle not only his illness but his family as well--along with his banker, his manager, the \\"doctor\\" and the Lord Chancellor--and Maddy's mood changes, and she is not always there to help him.This was a long book but I was sorry for the story to end.I rated it with five stars because I'm glad I read it and will never forget Maddy's and Christian's love story."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I took this book on a cruise and found myself returning to my cabin to read it....if your looking for a book full of sex this is not it...if you're looking for a true love story this is your book. This book takes a look into the horrors of early mental instutions and the mistaken notion that these people were useless throwaway members of society. This is a true love story in its purest sense. The heroine isn't seduced into love, but loves the heart within."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I've read a LOT of historical romances. This is one of the very few that do equal, delightful justice to both the history and the romance, with very real characters that were *not* made for each other, *without* a romance that's telegraphed from the very first page. Nothing about the outcome is certain until the very end. The device of the hero's stroke, which transforms him from careless rake who sneers at another's difficulties with the pronounciation of his own name, to helpless hero unable to remember or pronounce his own, is briliantly executed over a realistic and fascinating narrative."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This had to be my all time favorite book, I have read. I read fairly diverse material and happened to pick this one up since I was all out of my favorite authors and in need of an new one. Never in a million years would I have thought it would be this fantastic.Like my other reviews, I won't bore you with the details of the book which you can read from the excerps or other reviews but I will tell you what I thought and why. Not only was it a great story, different from typical romance novels, but it was an extremely well written story. The dialogue, Quaker use of thee/thou, and use of internal musing, Duke during his infirmity, were well thought out and easy to read.I particularly liked the characters. Maddy's nature was critical to the Duke's recovery. She was pure, honest, loving and somewhat simple in her desires. The Duke before the transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke, he was brilliant, arrogant, sexy - a true duke! Afterwards, he was dangerous, still brilliant, still sexy yet childlike and sweet. Only under these strange circumstances envisioned by Kinsale could these characters have a chance at developing a relationship. From two completely separate worlds, they created mutual need for one another that evolved into love. I believe that there was probably an element of attraction between the two before the Duke's stroke, however neither would have acted upon it. But afterwards, the Duke was stripped of his dignity and life as he knew it and the only one who seemed willing to stand by him or understand him was Maddygirl. So it was inevitable that a relationship develop, especially with their mutual attraction.But not only was the story line wonderful to read, the description of life as a Quaker, the horrors associated with the lunatics asylum and the greed of the families seemed so real, so believable. Kinsale has a unique ability to weave a story together that you never want it to end. You want to know more about their lives beyond the story. What their lives are like when they have children, get older etc. Rarely do I want or think that more could be exciting about the hero and heroine after the last page, but these characters are so real and likeable that I want to know more about their lives and where they go after the end of the book. And I think Kinsale has the aptitude to weave the story long after the last page.So if you have never read one of Kinsale's books, I highly recommend it. In fact, I'm giving this to my husband to read next. Or if you have read other Kinsale books, you probably know exactly why I'm so impressed with her writing. But either way, the time spent reading \\"Flowers\\" is well worth it and immensely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"After reading \\"Flowers from The Storm,\\" I realize, with some chagrin, that I have meted out prior five-star ratings too easily, for \\"Flowers\\" surpasses them all.Maddy, a devout and humble Quaker, and Jervaulx, a profligate, amoral duke, have absolutely nothing in common and no earthly reason to have ever even made one another's acquaintance, save that Maddy's father and Jervaulx share a gift in mathematics and become partners, of a sort, on a certain theorem. Jervaulx shocks Maddy's sense of propriety and Goodness, while the duke takes little notice of the prim and proper Quaker lady.After Jervaulx's and Maddy's first face-to-face meeting, Jervaulx suffers a debilitating stroke, and the haughty duke is reduced to a man unable to speak or even buckle his own bootstrap, his memory vague and fleeting. Jervaulx's extreme frustration and confusion at his situation lead him to violent outbursts, and his greedy mother and sisters have him sent away to an asylum while they seek to gain control of his fortune.Enter Maddy again. She has come to her Quaker cousin's \\"institution\\" in order to assist him while his wife is closeted away with their newborn. To Maddy's shock, she recognizes Jervaulx, and is deeply moved by his situation. Only Maddy can see that the duke is not the mad savage the others believe, but that he is ill. She feels this so strongly and certainly, that she believes it is a revelation from God and that it is her duty to help this once proud man. To Jervaulx, trapped like a caged animal and at the mercy of cruel, unfeeling jailers, suffering every possible humiliation and degradation, Maddy is his hope, his light, his salvation.This moving, lovely novel is gripping and poignant. Maddy and Jervaulx's relationship begins as stark, desperate need and evolves to an all-consuming passion and abiding love. Jervaulx is, at times, so vulnerable that one aches for him, and yet we see glimpses of that proud, self-willed duke. Maddy struggles deeply to reconcile her Quaker beliefs with the \\"carnal\\" creature she becomes when she is with Jervaulx.From reading other reviews, I had expected that the reading would be somewhat difficult, but Maddy's Quakerish speech is not at all difficult to understand, nor is it intrusive; likewise, Jervaulx's somewhat impaired, fragmented speaking is not hard to follow.\\"Flowers from The Storm\\" is in a class by itself; superbly written, powerful, poignant, and passionate, and well worth a read...and then another."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book totally blew me away! I expected it to be good from the reviews I read but I couldn't realise how unbelievably amazing it truly was. I made the mistake of getting the book the day before an important exam. I couldn't wait to read it, so I read part of it but then all the while I was away I could NOT stop thinking about it [I don't want to know how badly I did for the exam!]. It just astounds me how Kinsale's characters just totally engulf you in their web - I've read all her books and I find them on my mind for days after I've read them!The characters of Christian and Maddy were just spectacular, so intricate and beautiful. This book had me laughing one moment then crying at another - I loved how deeply Christian loved &amp; needed Maddy. I could practically feel his frustration on not being able to express himself - in the most basic manners that we take for granted and being so lost &amp; alone in his world. Maddy was perfect - strong but yet unsure of herself. Her Plain Speech annoyed me a little at the end ('thee' 'thou') but I cannot expect her to drop that instantly - would be too unreal.I loved that when Kinsale wrote from Christian's point of view, she actually wrote the words out just as he would hear it. Its a great story, I definitely recommend this book - its one of the best books I've ever read (and just not in the romance genre). I think Laura Kinsale truly transcends that, her writing is just so good it unbelievable that its supposed to be a 'simple' romance novel. She's definitely my favorite author."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Let's admit it: a lot of &quot;romances&quot; on the market are only minimally about love and a are lot about sex. This is one of the most romantic and love filled stories to be found in the entire genre (and yes, there's plenty of eroticism, too). What is so touching about this story is that it is real in-sickness-and-in-health love, the kind that people who have been in long-term relationships know, rather than the firecracker explosion-and-fizz-out of simple sexual attraction. In addition, the author indirectly raises some very important questions about family and religion. This is a literary read that far surpasses the usual claptrap of the genre."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I don't think you can get into too long of a discuss, especially online, with romance novel enthusiasts and not have this book listed as a favorite. It also has one of my favorite conceits in the world -- a flawed hero and/or heroine. It's frankly amazing that I just read it last week.The story, the love for the story, tip-toed behind me and took me by surprise. It was one of those books that I didn't know how well it was working until the last couple chapters -- when I cried.There were solid reasons for the hero and heroine not to communicate. The hero has a stroke that altered his use and understanding of language. Yet I still wish there'd been a scene or two more in which they shared their increasingly romantic feelings. He communicated other matters to her. She had no impairment. Neither seemed to want to tell the other person anything real beyond his fear of returning to the mad house. The author had a way with words, but her characters seemed mute at too many key moments. We get their private thoughts, but too much silence.However, at the end I discovered that Laura Kinsale had made me care about these people and perhaps one of the reasons I was so moved was simply the feeling of \\"at long last.\\" I rooted for them, because they were impossible not to root for -- a main with an impairment and a woman raised to deny her passion.I understand why this book is loved and recommended to people who might be wary about romance novels."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This would have been five stars, if not for Maddie and her obsession with her religion. She started out more open minded, then became less so, which I found strange, since she was supposedly growing more in love with Christian the farther along in the book. Sometimes she's also a little too mean for my liking...I just felt so bad for Christian, I wanted to protect him and put him in this little bubble of safety. I seriously felt his pain as if it were my own.This is one the most UNIQUE romance novels I've ever read (if not in the world). Which I really liked. I was skeptical at first, because I thought it might be too depressing, and I have to admit, there were points I was crying and wishing I could jump into the book, but I got over it. I know Christian wasn't the most admirable of men before his stroke, but honestly, seeing him struggle with simple speech made me just LOVE him. I've never in my life wanted to give someone a big reassuring hug so much in my life, since no in the book was going to do it for me--and never did.I loved Christian's two friends and how they were willing to do anything to protect him. That really makes a book for me. I don't like when either the hero/heroine has no real friends or family, other than his/her partner, so I was happy about this. And I loved his dogs too. I always love a guy who likes dogs.The ending made me want to give Maddie a punch or twelve. I understand that things were different back then, and that her whole life was about her religion, but...I still couldn't help but believe that love should be more important, that the man she loved should be more important, because that's how I would feel about it. It worked out well in the end, when both of them realized (in a matter of two pages) that they love each other and that they need to treat each other better...I think the ending could have been better, but we got the epilogue, so I was satisfied."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"When I started reading this story, I had my doubts - a religious Quaker woman and a rich, rakish duke?? For the first few chapters, I was just resigned to the fact that I had bought ANOTHER silly, boring romance book that I would read, but would be wasting my time. Was I ever wrong!I don't think I have ever championed anyone as much as I did the Duke. Laura had me falling madly in love with him (he is now my favorite romantic lead of all the 'numerous' romances I have read), even though he was overbearing and selfish. His 'growth' from self-centered egotistical man to letting Maddy go for her benefit had me falling more in love with him as each page was read.Because Laura did not make Maddy into a hypocritical religious zealot, I came to sympathize with Maddy and even felt bad for her religious plight. Maddy I came to admire and respect immensely.Somehow, Laura Kinsale made it work. She had me believing at the end that this romance could have happened and worked! I'm now off to Amazon.com to download the other two Kindle books by her and then to order the others she has written. This author has 'captivated' me and if her other books are even one-half as lovely as this one, I will be so pleased. It's so seldom I find a book that totally immerses me.

I can't get this book out of my head....the leading man is so appealing, irresistable and strong despite his disability. When things get really tough for our Duke, the ususal competency hearing, swarming relatives trying to take control of all his affairs from him,lack of confidence from his thee/thou Quaker wife and other life consequences - it is HE that rises to the occasion and shows more plain ole guts, courage and knowledge than anyone including Maddygirl thee/thou (who always seems to remember she's a Quaker at the darndst times).I chuckled often at the duke's thoughts which were clear in his head but never expressed in the same way.

Could you imagine her query letter to agents? \\"My hero has a stroke and the Quaker heroine is his nurse.\\" This is so deeply felt and exquisitely written. If you're a reader who strictly wants the cotton candy of romance novels, to be entertained, to have a couple of laughs, to enjoy a romp between the leads, do not buy this book. Those books are a cotton candy read; they're fun and a quick, effortless read. \\"Flowers\\" takes some effort to follow, especially after the hero has his stroke and can't follow what people are saying. The deep POV (point of view) of these two characters is incredible - the reader can't wholly understand what people are saying to him, either, so we \`feel' his frustration and rage.The book is not the standard historical fare of \\"florid\\" but like a garden, you walk into it and feel your own roots inside these characters. Literary and powerful, intensely emotional, \\"Flowers\\" tracks us from the hero's beginnings as a rake, almost a stereotype, if not for his mathematical genius, which to me, makes him much more interesting. All his whims, his affairs, his carelessness, come back to bite him when he is vulnerable. It is through his suffering that he becomes stronger. He feels he a shadow of his former self, but his hardships make him a better man, and with \\"Maddygirl\\" by his side, he overcomes serious obstacles.Many younger women, those under 35, weaned on \\"kick-a*s\\" heroines who are tough and as aggressive as men, will not like Maddy, the heroine. They'll see her as weak and compliant. Not so. She's strong, believes in her faith, will not waver from what is right. My grandmother worked a hard day's labor, and at night, hand-stitched quilts, sewed, always kept busy. Was she weak because she didn't curse at her husband or kick his butt in some way? No. Maddy is adorable and endearing, full of integrity, to be shaken to her religious core and realize that her love for Christian (the Duke) has a godly quality, too.The best novels have characters that suffer and evolve, on a deep level.

It had a lot more going on for it than most romance novels, but you can read about that in everyone else's reviews; I just want to give a tip of my cap to the way Kinsale portrayed the leading man's illness and mental deficiencies. Mental illness is one of my literary fetishes and Kinsale pulled it off effortlessly.The down side of this book is that it is too long. There is nothing I would have taken out or shortened, per se, but about 100 pages before the end I would have been fine skipping ahead just to see what happened and moving on to my next book."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I had read this book years ago when it was first published, and it's remained in my mind as one of my favorite romance novels of all time. I re-read it recently and I was reminded how much I had adored this book.It's not for everyone, so if you are not a patient reader, I would probably skip it. Between the Quaker language and the post-stroke language, there are moments when the book is almost indiscernible.Essentially, a brilliant mathematician /Duke has a stroke and is committed to an insane asylum where his nurse is a Quaker lady. His family is plotting to have him declared incompetent so that they can take control of the family money. The Duke (Christian) and the Quaker lady (Maddy) form a bond. He coerces her into running away with him and then into marrying him, in order to hold off his family and to try to regain his empire. Christian struggles to understand words that he hears and to see words clearly on paper. As a reader, you hear what he hears and you are forced to try to decipher words as he hears them (essentially gibberish). He really is recovering from a stroke and it's not easy. Meanwhile, Maddy speaks like a Quaker (thee/thy, etc...) and is none too clear herself at times.To add to that, Maddy is constantly resistant to anything \\"worldly\\" and judgmental of things she doesn't understand (essentially Christian's entire world). Her innocence and ignorance kind of grate after a while, so I can't blame a reader for giving up on the book. (I swear, I'd like to read just one romance novel where I didn't want to strangle the heroine at one point or another.)However, if you stick with it and you like heartwrenching books, then this may come to be one of your favorites, too. The love scenes are hot and the emotional conflict between the H/H is believable. The secondary characters are great (either as believable villains or witty friends) and the threat of Christian being declared incompetent is very real. I was scared for Christian through the entire book. It is also a more action-packed book than I expected. There are quite a few will-they-or-won't-they-get-out-of-the-scrape moments. It all makes Christian's ultimate triumph more satisfying, IMO.Kinsale keeps you hanging until the end, though, so don't expect much lightheartedness in this book. It's emotionally draining, but ultimately fulfilling in the end. I loved it.Flowers from the Storm and The Shadow and the Star are Kinsale's best works, IMO."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"After reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure I was going to like this book, but am so glad I went ahead and read it. A Quaker heroine and a \\"stroke victim\\" hero?? It worked!! I really felt as if I got to know the characters. I was able to feel Christian's frustration for his situationand the need that he had for Maddy, that developed into love. I also thought Maddy's struggle within herself over her feelings for Christian versus her Quaker upbringing was very believable. There was enough action in the book to keep the plot moving forward, and I was kept engrossed in the story. Overall, a very unique book - it wasn't the classic overbearing hero and simpering heroine so prevalent in romance novels. If you are looking for something a little different, I would definitely recommend this book. It has me searching out other titles by this author.Also, I didn't have any problem with the thee/thou speech in the book as some other reviewers have mentioned, it seems pretty self-explanatory what Maddy means. There are some times when we are \\"hearing\\" things from Christian's point of view when he still is not understanding what is being said, that I had to reread passages a few times to get the meaning and that was annoying at times."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Laura Kinsale's books but this one will always be my favorite. I felt the characters were very real. Christian's plight moved me totally and Maddy's inner struggle between her love for Christian and her religion was handled beautifully. I have re-read this story numerous times."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"The hero and heroine could not be more different. Christian is the Duke of Jervaulx - rich, powerful, arrogant and possesses the charms of a lady's killer. Maddy is of modest birth, deeply religious, prim, prudent and loyal. An unexpected tragedy brought both of them together. However, what sarted off as a patient-nurse relationship soon developed into something deeper and stronger. As in most romances, I know that the story will crusie towards the happily-ever-after path, but several unexpected sub-plots kept me glued to the book. In addition, it seems almost impossible that Christain and Maddy, whose characters are so different, would become true lovers. Along the way, Christian remains arrogant and inconsiderate; in fact, I find nothing admirabeble in him. Maddy is the true heroine all the way, remaining loyal and patient, standing by him even as she realises the deceit surrounding their marriage and is caught between her beliefs and religion, and her deep passion for the man whose world seems to be out of her reach. The author makes no excuses for Christian's fault- in fact he tells Maddy more than once that &quot;he does not deserve her&quot;; no simple solutions to Maddy's delima. In this way, the author brings the message soundly across- love overrules all. That's what makes this book likable."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This story happens to be the best one I have read so far. As I was reading the story I found myself crying and strongly disliking the relatives of Christian. The only one in his family that loved him was his aunt. If it had not been for Maddygirl, he would have been lost in that mad house. I thought the heroine was the right woman for him, but through no fault of her own, she was so steeped in her religion. She was experienced enough to be his &quot;caretaker&quot; because of her father whom she had tended for 18 years. On the negative side, she was quite annoying battling her devotion to her religion and her love for a wonderful man who needed her support. I loved this book. I thought the story was so sad for too long. I would like to have seen Christian recover completely. In reality some people do recover without any indication of ever being sick. As I was reading this story I thought about &quot;My Sweet Folly&quot;, as it relates to &quot;Robert&quot; who was being poisoned and was almost left to a world of darkness. Overall, I liked Christian and Maddy and gave this story two thumbs up"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book was difficult to read and the characters were such opposites that I didn't feel their connection even to the end of the book. The setting did not draw me in in the least which was about a man, named Jervaulx, who was put in a insane home - a woman, Maddy, who was a quaker, or is described in a way to make you think \\"amish\\" - and they get together. She basically helps him escape and somewhat recover - even though his speech still never fully recovers. There was continous talking like a 2 year old, which made it difficult to understand and got tiresome. Maddy never gave up her beliefs, which she shouldn't have - but the two just didn't seem ment to be. I did feel the connection Jervaulx felt for Maddy, how it was because of her he became \\"alive\\" again, and I felt his passion and love for her, but she just didn't give back to him how he deserved. This was just an okay book for me. After reading so many of Judith McNaught's novels, I have been spoiled for life and will continue to search for another author who can live up to her stories."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I definitely fit into the category of readers who think this book will be considered a superb, well written book for many years to come. It is intense and not a light read but well worth your investment in time and emotional connection.Maddy and Christian are total opposites. He is a rake, a scoundrel (he has gotten a married woman pregnant) and the world is his oyster. He's rich, well liked and the head of his noble titled family. But how quickly all those things were stripped from him and he literally was left with nothing. His own family considered him insane and had him committed to an asylum. Luckily for him, money did talk, and he went to an institution which was quite progressive for its time. I enjoyed learning more about how mental illness was handled during Regency times but found it distressing to read about the frustration Christian was going through. The problem was that he was not insane, he had had a stroke, but because of his inability to speak the people around him did not know how to communicate with him.Maddy was a Quaker. Her faith was the center of her life. She was thrown into Christian's world but only on the very fringes. He and her father met while working on a new mathmatical formulation and Maddy was the one who delivered messages from one to the other. What she knew about Christian was extremely unsettling to her and she would have preferred that there be no more contact. Once she actually met him she was uncomfortable finding that there were many sides to this man and she could not help admiring some of his kinder qualities. After hearing that Christian had died fighting a duel she was very surprised to find how sorry she was that he was dead. Imagine her amazement when she went to work in her uncle's asylum and there found Christian. Maddy was the one who could calm him and then learned how to communicate with him.The road was never smooth for these two people. How could it be? They did the best they could to learn how to cope and in the end did an excellent job of it, but nothing came easily to them. This novel requires the reader to make an investment in time to read it. It also requires that you allow each character to be who they are all the way through the book. If Christian had suddenly recovered from all symptoms of his stroke, his character would have been just another rake. If Maddy had given up her faith and beliefs, she would have been just another shallow heroine willing to forgo everything for money, marriage and position.Highly recommended. It is worth all your time and all the emotions you will invest to get these two people to the conclusion."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Flowers from the Storm is an excellent book. The writing is sumptuous. At times it feels like prose poetry. The book takes place in England around 1825. Kinsale addresses the issues of treatment of mental illness, the repercussions of inaccurate medical diagnoses, the power of families during this period over disabled people, and the remaining lack of tolerance between Quakers and The Church of England.The protagonist, Christian, Duke of Jervaulx, begins the story as a licentious, dissipated aristocrat. What is obviously (to us) a stroke is misdiagnosed as insanity. The first part of the book takes place in a upscale, but probably typical, draconian insane asylum. The asylum belongs to a Quaker, Edward Timms. His niece, Maddy, comes to work there and discovers Christian. She has met him before and quickly realizes he is disabled, not insane. She takes over his care to protect him.Eventually, Maddy is able to get Christian released. The rest of the book revolves around still disabled Christian's struggle to defeat his family's plans to reincarcerate him and take over his fortune.Early on in the book the protagonists, Christian and Maddy, marry to prevent Christian's family from reincarcerating him. The marriage is not merely one of convenience. Both have fallen in love. But religious issues have not been thoroughly understood or addressed.To me one of the most interesting aspects of this complex book is Kinsale's depiction of the tension between Quaker, Maddy, and Church of Engand, Christian, Duke of Jervaulx. Although the wars between the Puritans (Quakers are an offshoot) and the Church of England are long over at this time, they are not tolerant of each other.Throughout the book, Maddy behaves, talks, and thinks like a Quaker. There is great pressure for her to eschew all that she believes. But it is not easy to throw one's whole belief system out the window. The Quakers, in turn, pressure her to abandon her husband. She is alone and in pain.To Christian, Maddy's behavior and beliefs seem silly and cute. One gets the feeling that he is always waiting for her to stop playing and get serious. Gradually he does make concessions to her needs. His concessions feel big to him and small to her. As the book ends the religious tensions are decreased but not totally resolved.I enthusiastically recommend this book."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I grew frustrated with her lack of emotion and goody two shoes thee/thou nonsense.

This is a classic. No other book compares. The story is so unusual. The language and words so authentic. The characters so real. I bonded with Maddie immediately, as I am a nurse and a christian. I felt compassion for Christian also. The way stroke victims are so misunderstood. Communication is so difficult with them. The research for this book must have been well done as I could picture the asylum trying out those aweful methods to shock patients into responding. Wow! Very memoriable. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I have been reading romance novels for 35 years. Regency and Georgian novels are among my favorites. I have never read a book quite like this one. Laura Kinsale challenges you to go beyond the popular genre and I found myself re-reading whole paragraphs and entire pages to make sure I wasn't missing out on a single word that might be relevant to the story. An absolutely great read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is *not* a comfort read, nor is it a conventional romance. For one, the romance takes decidedly second stage to the illness and recovery (if it be recovery) of the hero. The hero is a dissolute young nobleman who thinks nothing of getting a married woman pregnant and then fighting a duel with her husband. On the other hand, he is also a brilliant mathematician who is co-authoring a paper with a Quaker mathematician. It is this capacity that he meets the heroine, although she makes only a small impression on him, given his other concerns.We meet the hero again in very different circumstances, when he is confined to a lunatic asylum, and where the heroine Maddie is trying to get him to respond to her. She discovers that he can still understand mathematical formulae, but that his language skills are gone - he cannot understand words nor speak making any sense. No wonder his relatives think him insane. We also learn that although this particular asylum is relatively benign (it has been founded by a Quaker cousin of Maddie), there are still darker elements, stemming from the love of power and brutish ignorance shown by the keepers of the patient. Laura Kinsale draws this portrait pitilessly (compare her portrait with that of the insane asylum in Putney's WILD CHILD) - and asks us to consider what happens to people who are not insane but who are then placed in an asylum with all their freedoms taken away. For the hero, there is some justification to think him mad, but there were surely many women placed in asylums by their relatives for being too independent, too &quot;unruly&quot; or exhibiting behavior thought deviant for that time.The story is about Christian's struggle to regain his personal freedom and to keep his legal freedom (he has not been formally declared insane). To this end, he is ruthless - he forces Maddie to marry him using strategems that are revealed to her much later. Unfortunately for her, this marriage means expulsion from the Quaker community, a punishment that means much to her and far more than any material wealth and rank she might gain by this marriage. What is worse - is that Christian's wealth and freedom are based on tenuous foundations.The denouement is brilliant. By the end, Christian regains some power of speech and some control over his actions, but he will clearly never be the man he once was. Which might not be such a bad thing, considering some of his past actions. Maddie's decisions through the novel are impelled both by consideration for Christian and his feelings, and her own feelings of charity for all humanity, stemming from her strong Quaker faith.The major problems with this book is firstly that it is so complex that it might put off people expecting a straight-forward if angst-ridden romance, and secondly that the style of speech affected by the heroine and her father (Plain Speech) can be even more off-putting.Finally, this book is not really a straight romance, and should not be classified as such. Unfortunately the bare-chested man on the cover does nothing to dispell that illusion - which is unfortunate. People picking up this book for its cover would receive a shock when they open the pages. I wish the publishers had been more honest and have chosen either a neutral cover or a more honest cover. Laura Kinsale should sell on her name alone, not her covers.I rate this book on average at 4.5, since there are some slow and puzzling parts which keep it from a higher grade."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is truly an excellent book. Even if you don't always like the characters, you really do feel for them, because they're so well-written. Maddy and Jervaux are much more than the average romance book couple. One of the best books I've ever read - not just romance."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I've been in a rut lately, and this book is a refreshing change from the books I've been reading. I found the writing style interesting. The author had to convey the thought process of a man who no longer has a sufficient vocabulary or the physical ability to speak. I'm sure this was a challenge, but I think she handled it very well. The fact that we have the hero's perspective and can feel his struggles makes him more endearing. The conflict for the story is unique (at least in my reading experience). The heroine is pressured by her religious beliefs throughout the book. Even though I could not relate to her sturggles, I felt that it made her a stronger and more interesting character. I found myself reading every word rather than just skimming. I even found that for a point in time I wasn't sure what was going to happen at the end of the story or how it would be resolved. This is a must read for any romance reader who needs a change."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Flowers from the Storm is my favorite love story! I have previously mentioned that Passion by Lisa Valdez is my favorite historical romance. They are just so different. So they tie. I love them both for different reasons.

I actually found myself yearning for these two characters! I couldn't wait until I could pick it up again! Maddie Girl! Wow! Jervaulx, how I FELT for him! This was not a light hearted, fun, easy read. For me, it was an emotional, transfixing, worthwhile experience. Simply perfect.

It isn't your normal boy meets girl, they hate each other, have sex, etc. This book has substance and feeling. Yes, the book has a very dark side for awhile, but to me that is what makes the love story so much better! As Maddy tends to Christian and learns to communicate with him, it just draws you in, and at the end, I had a hard time reading the words because I couldn't see them too well through the tears!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I'm not going to say that this is a great book, but I'm not going to say it's a bad one either. What I am going to say is that its billing (on its own back cover) as 'one of the greatest love stories of all time' is definitely a massive exaggeration.The storyline behind this book is excellent--very complex and appealing and creatively thought out. The characters are well developed and believable, not to mention loveable in their own ways--both of the main characters are strong and yet achingly vulnerable, especially Christian, whom I dare any woman not to want to cuddle and nurture and probably more. The research that went into this book is frighteningly good, probably better and more thorough than any I've ever undertaken in my own writing. (My only qualm with it was that I was under the impression that Quakers running asylums at that time were trying to minimalise the use of the types of mechanical restraints that were often and freely used on the character of Christian. But maybe I'm wrong--I wasn't there.) Moreover, it would have taken a surfeit of patience and dilligence for the writer to commit to completing such a lengthy, detailed book--I know from experience that the work involved in such a venture would have been mind-boggling, and I admire the writer for sticking with it.And yet, all accolades aside, this book is still dramatically flawed. At 533 pages (of small print) long it is an absolute monster--the romance genre's equivalent to 'War and Peace'. And it's heavy going, too--slowly paced and cumbersomely written, which makes it seem even longer. In fact, if you're planning to buy this book as a 'holiday read' then be warned, it will take you your entire holiday to read it, leaving you with little time to do anything else! The sad fact is that the book shouldn't have had to be this long. With a little judicious editing, cutting out many annoying repetitions (for example, did we have to hear quite so many long-winded, oft-repeated descriptions about the aesthetic qualities of their eyelashes? What was the point of that? It wasn't sensual or poignant, it added nothing to the plot, and it went on and on...), trimming all the pointless fluff and filler, and just writing it in a better, friendlier, more economical style, it might not only have been cut down to an easier-to-digest four hundred pages, but also would have been a far better read, too--or at least in my humble opinion.The book starts slowly, and takes a while to warm to. I must admit, at times I almost wanted to give up on it. There were many reasons why. Here is one of them, as an example: the author's knowledge of mathematics was impressive, but the fact that she spent CHAPTERS discussing mathematical equations left me thinking, 'Enough numbers already! Get to the interesting stuff!' And that's not to say that I don't like or understand maths, quite the contrary; I just didn't want that much of it! This is supposed to be a romance novel, not a text book.Another big problem I had with the book is that at times it is very poorly worded. The author spends too much time on some details, repeating them over and over until they are almost grating, and yet annoyingly skims some others. She is also a little ambiguous. One can see what she is trying to say but her words don't quite say it. One example of this is when the book says that Maddy's Papa has not smiled exhilaratedly since the day her mother died..which of course makes it sound like the last time her Papa had a really good smile or a laugh was actually BECAUSE her mother died! Shouldn't the book have said, he had not smiled exhilaratedly since BEFORE her mother had died? Okay, yes, I'll confess, I'm a picky reviewer, but I'm of the opinion that every word matters, and that one should always say what one really means to say, and not be lazy about wording. I hold my own writing up to a high standard and expect other authors, especially such lauded ones, to do the same.I'd urge you to read this book, by all means. Its triumphs definitely outweigh its flaws, and the final two pages are deliciously, subtly clever--the destination makes the long trip worthwhile. But lets call a spade a spade here, people, and not be under the delusion that it's the greatest love story of all time. Because if that were so, then it doesn't speak well for all the other love stories that are out there, does it, because it would mean that they were worse than this. And I KNOW that there are better books than this!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the \\"love conquers all\\" typical ending."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I ordered this book because the reviews suggested that this was a great novel.

She realizes his mind is okay and makes efforts to help him. As their relationship strengthens its turns to love though his aristocratic family and her Quaker friends detest that this couple belongs together.FLOWERS FROM THE STORM is a reprint of one of the best Regency romances of the past decade. The tale provides the audience with a different look at the era then normally seen. The lead characters are the keys to the gripping plot. Amanda struggles between her deep faith and her prohibited love for an outsider. Christian behaves like a stroke victim frustrated with his inability to communicate especially verbally. Amanda talks (and listens) like a Quaker and Christian's thoughts reflect his trouble comprehending what someone says and his frustration with his failure with language. Though that adds authenticity, readers need to adapt to the communications of the lead duo that is worth the effort.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Flowers from the Storm was such a wonderful and heartbreaking book. As many other reviewers have already said, Christian suffered a stroke and his family hid him away in a mental asylum. He was completely capable of rational thought but had a hard time communicating. Words were jumpled in his head and he had a hard time understanding things. The reader is also able to read, through the dialog, what it is that Christian hears when other's speak. It makes his frustration all the more understandable. The author doesn't shy away from his troubles.Maddy, whom Christian had met briefly before his stroke, shows up at the asylum and Christian clings to her. He is eventually able to leave the horrid surroundings but things are constantly happening that threatens to send Christian back. He is slowly getting better, but it's still really difficult.This book was so wonderful in so many ways but one aspect ruined a five star rating. What was the author thinking with this woman!? I've read the reviews that said how horrible she was but I so wanted to read about Christian. He is a wonderful character and I'm glad I read it and I will still recommend the book because of it's wonderful uniqueness. But Maddy? How horrible can a character be? She is a devout Quaker, annoyingly so. I don't know why Kinsale decided to make her so uptight about her religion. She literally had to be forced to keep Christian from being sent away by marrying him. She cared for him, but she was pathetically worried about her dear little Quakers looking down at her. Her Quaker-ness definitely got in the way of a good story. The book wouldn't have been so long if the author gave Christian a half decent heroine. Her never ending worry and weakness was pitiful. She was so weak! I wish Christian had a female lead that was stronger and more loving. She redeemed herself a bit at the end but it was too late. It's a 500+ page book and by then I already hated her. She was selfish in her reasoning for helping him and completely self-righteous.The biggest positive about Maddy was that she didn't look down or demean Chrisitian while he struggled to cope. She helped him when he asked and saw nothing wrong with him. But she was such a blank character, with no emotions. She did it, but without any feeling.There are so many moments that I know I'll reread over and over. Christian doesn't recover a 100 percent, which is refreshing in this genre, but he does come so far. Kinsale doesn't insult her reader's intelligence by making everything so perfect and wonderful at the end but her idea of female leads is simply horrid. I most certainly felt no love or romance from Maddy's part.I still recommend reading this book. Your heart will break for Christian and he'll make you wish you were there to help him. Maddy, though... just ignore her. This would have been a very strong 5 Star book without her."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"You know a book has a lot to live up to when you read things like \\"One of the world's most cherished love stories!\\" and \\"Probably the best historical romance ever published\\" and \\"One of the greatest love stories of all time\\" not to mention \\"A watershed in romance fiction\\". This book and this author (whom I've never read) seem to be much revered by readers and authors alike, so when this book was re-issued in June, I was glad of the chance to read it and see for myself what all the fuss was about. And let me tell you I was not only blown away, but I'll be searching out Ms Kinsale's other books for sure! A great book, compelling characters and a story to make you smile and weep and worry and hope that all will be well in the end!When first we meet Christian Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, he is too handsome and charming for his own good, dissolute, completely reckless and full of hubris. He also happens to be a mathematical genius. He is working on a paper detailing a new mathematical theory with an unlikely partner - blind Quaker John Timms whose daughter Archimedea (Maddy) is his eyes and caregiver. Maddy is both fascinated and repulsed by the duke and his wild, worldly ways (he actually flirts with her!). When word comes that he has perished in a duel, both the news and her reaction to it shock her, as she weeps for this man she thought she did not even like!Months later, Maddy and her father find themselves at Blythedale Hall, an insane asylum for the well to do where Maddy will assist her Cousin Edward who runs the place. On rounds to meet the patients, she is stunned to discover a disheveled, wild-eyed Jervaulx among the inmates! Before the duel could even commence, Christian was struck down by a stroke and is left unable to communicate, with damage to his motor skills and memory. In his frustration, he lashes out like an animal but when he recognizes Maddy, he calms. She is allowed to be his daytime caregiver and he latches onto her like a lifeline. His fear and frustration were nothing short of heartbreaking and the treatment and humiliation he endures from his \\"attendants\\" borders on cruel and masochistic - simply horrifying.Maddy devotes herself to easing his fears, helping him to communicate and, when she learns that he must face a competency hearing (instigated by his greedy brothers-in-law) or lose his title and his freedom for good, she resolves to do what she can to prepare him. But all sorts of misadventures, manipulations and deceptions follow with Christian keeping a death-grip on Maddy while Maddy is torn between helping Christian and keeping to her father and her faith.I won't say more about the plot, but the characters are so well written that they will make you laugh, cry, and bite your nails with anxiety for them. This book must have been exhausting to write! The author deftly conveys Christian's frustration, broken language and motor skills as well as his needy attachment to Maddy as it grows to love. And Maddy is so devoted to Christian that time and time again, she tests the bounds of her faith against what she feels is right. This is a truly moving, wonderful story that I highly recommend to those looking for more than just sex and light romance. This book is an investment in time and emotions - not a quick, easy read. If you like more complex books and authors like the Bronte sisters, George Elliot, Julia Ross/Jean Ross Ewing, Mary Balogh early Woodiwiss and maybe even Liz Carlyle or Gaelen Foley, I think you will like this book. Very highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"&quot;Flowers from the Storm&quot; is a most unusual romance. Indeed, take away the silly cover and it probably could be placed in the literature shelf. The book certainly includes the growth of a relationship but it is so much more complex than 99% of the romance market. Indeed, it was a bit more of a challenge than I wanted at times (I read it while ill) but I'm glad I stuck with it.The challenge lies mostly in the language of the book. For many authors it would be enough to have a Quaker character with all of the &quot;thee/thou&quot; language. Kinsale starts with not only the Quaker language but Maddy's struggle to be a Quaker falling in love outside of her faith. THEN, Kinsale creates a most unusual hero - a regency rake who's a mathematical genius. THEN, our hero has a stroke and we spend much of the book looking at (and hearing) the world through his impaired facilities. Both his speech and his hearing are damaged and the reader has to guess at what he says and hears. It can be done but it requires careful reading.Bottom-line: An unusual romance that is worth the extra effort - but it is important to go into this reading experience prepared for a different experience."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I read Flowers from the Storm after reading about 20 other romance novels. What impressed me about Flowers was that for the first time in a romance novel, I encountered an author who assumes that romance readers have intelligence. Not only does she challenge her readers to follow the Quaker thee/thou speech, she also puts her readers inside of Jervaulx's mind and forces us to see and hear the world through his stroke-damaged perceptions--a world where simple English words have little meaning. She then takes this one step further, challenging us to follow along with her, by letting us feel Jervaulx's frustration and rage and letting us hear what he hears as he tries to understand Maddy's thee/thou Quaker speech. Ingenious! I've read somewhere that Kinsale's greatest skill is in taking a hero that no one could love and making you want to lick his boots by the end of the story. This is never truer than in Flowers from the Storm. This book needs to be reprinted!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"First, Kinsale can write with depth, complexity, beautiful language--and all this from (dare I say it) an English professor. I rarely read romance or mystery, only by recommendation. I have read this particular book three times now, and each time I read it I find more detail, more of Kinsale's fine characterization, more nuances I glossed over at first. The tale is the story of two characters becoming through unbecoming, and the smart reader will notice that Kinsale foreshadows much of her characters' fates all throughout the novel, in splendidly subtle asides. The novel, though it alludes to classic romances, such as Jane Eyre, never becomes a parody itself, and the story is heartfelt, emotional, and satisfying. A duke, both a rake and a mathemantical genius, suffers a stroke when he encounters the husband of his lover in the husband's own hall. The duke manages to present a breakthrough geometry he has authored with a blind Quaker before his collapse. The Quaker's daughter, who has helped her father with this paper, is told the next day that the Duke is dead. Later, she encounters the self-same duke at her cousin's asylum, where the duke is taken for mad. Naturally, a cautious relationship ensues when the Quaker girl realizes that the Duke is not insensible, only aphasic, or damaged in his capacity for speech. She becomes his &quot;nurse&quot;.

This very unusual and well developed romance between a notorious rake and a young Quaker woman in post-Regency England deeply explores situations and emotions that are rarely present in romance and does so with great feeling and sensitivity.Christian Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, lives a dissolute life of pleasure. His only constructive pursuit involves his love of mathematics, which he shares with Mr. Timms, a blind older Quaker man who is nearly as great a mathematical genius as Christian is. Together they are collaborating on work to present to the London Analytical Society, of which they are both members.Mr. Timms' daughter, Archimedea, nicknamed Maddy, does not care for the Duke, whom she sees as reckless, extravagant and utterly worldly. However, she is disturbingly impressed by his energetic presence and intensity when she finally meets him, and later when she hears that he is dead, she feels surprisingly affected by the loss.Unbeknowst to her and to many others, Christian is still alive. After inexplicably experiencing a collapse (stroke?) that renders him unable to speak, to write or at first even to think clearly, his family sends him to a country asylum run by Mr. Timms' cousin Edward.Having run out of funds, the Timms' go to live at the asylum where Maddy helps care for the residents. Maddy is extremely attached to her father and would rather spend most of her time caring for him, but one day she is astonished to encounter Christian, and surprisingly she is the only one who can calm his frustrated rages. She then experiences a spiritual \\"Opening,\\" a strong deep intuition that God wants her to serve as his nurse. She would rather not spend time with such a worldly man, but she feels she must do her duty.The slowly developing relationship of trust, respect, affection and eventually love between Christian and Maddy is beautiful to experience. Kinsale uses such brilliant detail and lovely writing style to bring her characters to life that they leap off the page as fully developed, breathing human beings.It is fascinating to enter the mind of Quaker Maddy, to really understand and to sympathize with her feelings and beliefs. Her deep struggle between her life values and her growing feelings for Christian generates a deep soul searching and riveting, entertaining plot twists. Until almost the last moment, the reader hangs in suspense, vitally curious as to how Maddy will be able to do justice to her two seemingly irreconcilable worlds. This problem only intensifies when halfway through the book she has to marry Christian to save him from his avaricious relatives who want to declare him incompetent and steal all his property.It is equally fascinating to enter Christian's mind, to see how he grapples with the confusion and heart wrenching frustration of being unable to make sense of language. As his ability to understand and to speak slowly returns, we admire his struggle to take control of his life and his increasing tenderness for his \\"Maddygirl\\". The fierce loyalty, appreciation and overwhelming love he develops for Maddy creates a fervent passion that deeply touches the reader's heart.Flowers from the Storm may seem a bit long at 471 pages, but all the detail and exquisitely rendered scenes (each with its own quiet drama) are necessary to build the overall rich story edifice that is so rewarding to the patient reader. The novel is packed with many scenes that shine like gems. For example, the simple scene early in the book where Christian describes Maddy to her blind father, who has not seen his beloved daughter since she was a child: the reader is nearly in tears from the dramatically charged and beautifully understated handling of this scene.Laura Kinsale is a master of historical romantic fiction, and Flowers from the Storm is pleasurably required reading for any lover of romance."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"When I read the first few pages, I thought this would be the typical rake-meets-prude type of story, riddled with all the typical cliches. I was proven wrong. The plot just kept getting better and better, and I could not put down this book.The heroine is just the perfect mixture of innocence and mature grace, which is unique among other romance novel heroines who tend more often than not to be annoying. The hero *is* rakish, but his ailment makes him endearingly vulnerable. They suit each other perfectly though they at first seem to be complete opposites. You'll want to root them on.One other good thing about this book is that Kinsale's secondary characters are not flat and some of the parts with them in it are in fact very funny.I say give this novel a try. I savored every page, didn't find any parts boring that I should scan over them. The ending is gratifying although a tad bittersweet--just be prepared with a box of tissues."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"His name is Christian Richard Nicholas Francis Langland, or simply, The Duke of Jervaulx. To the ton, he is a notorious rake with a list of women as long as his full name. Lacking moral restraint, he is hedonistic, arrogant and dissipated. But the duke is also brilliant - a mathematical genius that can solve the most complex equations.In the glamorous and materialistic world of the English society, she is a nobody. A Quaker who wouldn't get a single glance from the wealthy and haughty. But Archimedia \\"Maddy\\" Timms couldn't care less for, as a Quaker, she has been brought up with the belief of living a simple and uncomplicated life devoted to keeping herself pure and unaffected by worldliness. But for all her strength and strong belief, she finds herself fascinated by the dissolute duke. So the day after meeting him for the first time, she found herself weeping upon hearing the news that the duke was killed in a duel.Unbeknownst to most, the duke actually suffered a stroke and has been sent by his family to an asylum thinking that he has gone insane. So it was to Maddy's shock when, after getting a job at Blythedale Hall, she comes face to face with Christian. And Maddy knew straightaway that despite what everyone says, the duke is not mad but maddened. Therefore she decides to be his own personal nurse and see to his recovery barely knowing she would be in for a roller coaster ride.FLOWERS FROM THE STORM is a compelling and very moving story with complex characters that exude such powerful emotions that one cannot help but be moved by the story as it unfolds. The intricateness of the story is so captivating and provides us with the biggest irony of all, for on one hand, you have Christian who is extremely sensitive about the pronunciation of his title that when caught with his pants down by the man he was cuckolding, he was more concerned about the mispronunciation of his name, that for him to lose the ability to speak properly is almost unkind in some ways. Then you have Maddy, a strict adherer of her society's belief in Plain Dress and Plain Speech, who falls in love with the very person she calls indecent, the one she thought was the devil incarnate himself. But I believe that what really makes this story so compelling is the emotional battles that the hero and heroine go through. You can truly feel their anguish and frustrations and I found myself crying just by the mere description of their feelings, especially Maddy's confusion. Some scenes are so heart-wrenching that I had to put the book down to get some tissues. My favorite cry-your-eyes-out part is when Maddy has been summoned by her congregation to condemn her actions. When she reads her letter of apology and refers to their relationship as sinful, the way Christian became so livid at hearing her mention the word \`fornication' was utterly provoking. And when he continues to say it was love for her, I was gone.If I may express a couple of quibbles about this book, it is that the beginning was a little slow that it took me a while to warm to and I found the whole mathematical terminologies and equations a little too much. Yet then again it does show the depth of research that the author has done, and in some ways added to Christian's brilliance.Now, do I consider this one of the greatest love stories ever written? Truthfully, I am not certain of that. But if you ask me if I thought this book was great, then I would answer yes in a heartbeat. This has got to be one of the most provocative and captivating novel I have read so far. And after reading this book, this is how I interpreted the title: \\"Flowers\\" stands for the triumph that Christian and Maddy are finally blessed with long after the agony that they endured from the \\"Storms\\" which are their tribulations. And at the end of it all, that triumph is the love that they found in each other's arms."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Flowers from the Storm caught me totally unaware. Never have I seen romance written like this without frills, such a serious plot, solemn characters, and heart-wrenching situations. Don't let that scare you away. This is an excellent book - it is the most unusual romance I have read to date and it really left me gravely considering - not a romance - but the plight of a stroke victim in the 1800s.Christian Langland, the Duke of Jervaulx, is the hero of this book and he has the typical rakish traits as most historical romance heroes do. He is young, handsome, very smart, rich, loves women, AND is a mathematical genius. The heroine, Maddy, is the daughter of a collegiate professor of mathematics who works closely with Christian on discovering a mathematical theorem. Both Maddy and her father are devout Quakers. They live a simple life and are very influenced by the Quaker community.Maddy first meets Christian when she is assisting her father in their mathematical quest, because he is blind. Maddy knows of Christian's reckless regard for life, outside of academia, and has a typical Quaker response to him. She believes him to be totally decadent. She knows they have absolutely nothing in common and sees little hope for his redemption from his dissolute existence. There is no magic in the air when the leads first meet. It is just plain good sense to know that they are extreme opposites and neither takes the time to even speculate about the other.Flash forward some months. Maddy and her father have moved to an old country estate where her cousin has opened and is operating an asylum for the mentally ill. The cousin proudly uses only the most progressive techniques in treatment of their patients. For this time period, the treatment truly would be revolutionary - with one exception. Maddy discovers a patient chained to the wall - a very handsome young man who cannot talk or understand attempts to communicate with him. His family believes his sinful life has finally caught up with him and he has gone mad from all of the decadence in his life. This patient chained to the wall tends to have fits of anger and is difficult to control. Maddy stares in disbelief as she recognizes the chained patient. It is none other than Christian Langland, the Duke of Jervaulx. Maddy had been told he died. But he has had a stroke. Of course, his family and caretakers don't know this. Imagine the horrors of living in a time in history that you were believed to be insane if you lost your ability to speak, could not communicate or understand your situation, and acted out your frustration in anger. Christian's circumstances and condition is most heart wrenching. Maddy immediately asks for care of Christian - identifying him as the Duke of Jervaulx. She quickly concludes that Christian is not mad and begins working with him and makes great progress. She is most certainly an angel of care.This is a very deep and moving book. It is not really romance writing. Reading Flowers from the Storm can be exhausting because it is rarely without serious problems encroaching the characters all around. You cannot rest even a moment. Once a huge problem is dealt with, several more as big or bigger would come along in a matter of only pages. This was a problem for me - as I read the book - because there was never a time to relish progress and no respite from the ever-threatening foes.Christian is certainly a different type of hero. Never have I read a hero that could have such a disability and still seem so attractive. Recovering from a stroke of his magnitude is not something that just goes away. Not only did Christian have to learn to live with certain disabilities from the stroke, he also had some major life issues prior to this tragedy that he needed to work out as well. At times, I felt like I was going to break down mentally for Christian. Although Maddy was an angel of mercy for Christian, her upbringing as Quaker limited her in her ability to understand or trust men such as Christian, who were considered morally debauched. As he recovered little by little from his stroke, Maddy knew less and less how to deal with him. She still considered him a rake. I could go on and on about the many obstacles they had to face. But don't take this wrong - despite all of this - the book is fascinating and you want to consume it fully before putting it down (which is probably not possible).This book is redeemed by the sheer tenacity of the hero but even more so by the romance. This is romance writing which means things do work out in the end. One reason I read romance is for that happy ending. This romance however, must grow. The title is very appropriate for the story. This truly is a story of finding the good (the flowers) out of the tragic events (the storm) in your life. I believe romance is really secondary here. This is a story of illness, upbringings, morals, recoveries, and many, many more of life's lessons. There are some sensual scenes but they are few and unimportant. They would rate about a 2.5 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines).This couple needed to spend time just getting to know each other. This would be my second complaint - they needed more time together. This is a long book - 471 pages. More of this book should have been spent on some mutual happiness. I wanted the couple to be able to relish their relationship. I found it disturbing that they could not.In the end, I could not rate this five stars because there was just too much agony. Problems were always rising and I got a little tired of the burden. I did not relax as I read this book but as I look back on it, some three months later, I still remember the story details, the emotion, the phenomenal handling of a very serious subject matter and I tell my friends, &quot;I have just read one of the most incredible and heart wrenching stories.&quot; I think that says it all."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Exploring love between a quakeress helping a nobleman after a debilitating stroke, this is a compelling tale with an original take on a rake's redemption. Unlike most most authors who take a ridiculous amount of \\"creative license\\" with their medical plot devices, Kinsale is spot on in her medical treatment of the hero(which is refreshing for me as a physician). I can testify both from professional and personal perspective of watching a friend survive a cerebral aneurysm (the type of stroke Christian has)that Kinsale accurately describes this type of condition from coma to almost full recovery months later. But what I really love is that she does this in the setting of a 19th century English romance novel in a way that is both emotionally compelling and satisfying."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book left me torn. I really enjoyed the first half. Christian, Duke of Jervaulx, is a rake, but not THAT bad of one-he drinks, gambles, has affairs with willing married ladies. He is also a genius. One day he suffers a horrible stroke that leaves him unable to speak or understand language. His nasty family sends him straight to the madhouse, where he is beaten, humiliated &amp; misunderstood.In comes Maddy. She realizes that Christian is not mad, but is trapped inside his own mind, unable to speak. She has some sort of ephinany that it is God's Will that she help this man. So she does. Sort of. Christian sees that she is the only one who can help him, and is desperate for her. But she seems too scared to really be helpful. She is constantly letting other people tell her what to do &amp; how to do it.They take Christian to a competency hearing, trying to take away his title &amp; money &amp; lands. He fails. His aunt says she won't send him back to the madhouse if he marries some stupid young girl. Of course he agrees, but ends up running away at the wedding, taking Maddy with him.This is where I started to hate Maddy. She is a self-righteous, narrow-minded, weak, stupid woman. Christian needs her help badly, but all she can do is condemn him for his past actions, criticize him for the way he lives, and try to get out of her decision to help him. She claims to love him, but she won't compromise one little bit on anything for him. She consistently tries to leave him, even after they are married-by her choice-while Christian stuggles with everything. He can barely speak or write, and he's lost his sense of self. But he does his best to deal. His family wants to send him back to the asylum, his bankers &amp; lawyers have decided on their own that he is incompetent &amp; won't give him his money, his mistress from before the stroke causes all sorts of trouble, and all Maddy can do is complain about him and cry and whine about how she never should have married him. Ugh.She is the worst sort of hypocrite. I'd have thought that her faith would make her strong &amp; compassionate, but it just seems to make her judgemental &amp; weak. Christian loves her, needs her more than anyone else, and she keeps turning her back on him. In the end, Christian has become a better man, but she is still the same.All in all, loved him, hated her. The story was well-written, and Christian is one of the most memorable characters I've read. But the heroine ruins it. I couldn't stand her, &amp; don't think she deserved Christian's unwavering love."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book is the one I have recommended to friends all over who are looking for a good romance that is also a terrific love story. So far no one has made it through the book other than myself. Flowers From the Storm starts out a bit slow and Christian's speach impairment is difficult to read at first. Give it a chance and allow yourself the freedom to get to know these characters and I'd bet you'd fall for it too. There is so much depth to these characters and you are left with the feeling that the love Kinsale has built between them will be served well. Outstanding!!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This book is a different kind of historical romance. It's one of the few books that I reread on a regular basis. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Published in 1992, this historical romance moved the genre forward in a way others had not. Set in the late 1820s, it deals with the subject of physical malady leading to apparent (but not real) madness and the recovery that gradually restored sense and communication. It also involves the mind of a Quaker woman dealing with her growing feelings for a man she would otherwise find reprehensible.Named for the great mathematician, Archimedea Timms (\\"Maddy\\") is, at 28, a Quaker spinster who lives with her blind father helping him with his equations. It was through him, Maddy met \\"the mathematical duke,\\" Christian Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, for whom she has nothing but disdain. A rake and reprobate at 32, who lives his life as he wants, he also has a charitable side that would found a university where he invites Maddy's father to teach. And then in a duel, while not wounded, he suffers a stroke that sends him to a rest home for the mentally unstable, where he again encounters Maddy who is working there. Having lost the power of speech and of understanding words, all but Maddy think him mad.This story is very well written with meaningful dialog, richly drawn characters and an intricate plot. It deals with two worlds that come together in tragedy. The rakish duke with a life of opulence would not have found Maddy the Quaker girl so appealing, and perhaps she would not have found him so sympathetic, if not for his stroke. It makes for a very different romance. Some of it was slow and difficult to read, not that the writing wasn't good, but his struggle to speak and be understood, though brilliantly done, was still difficult to read. I agree with the other reviewers who reacted negatively to Maddy's unkind treatment of Christian, made all the worse for her being a woman of faith. She criticized and belittled him, often failing to support him in his hour of need. It took her an awfully long time to see the Truth. As one character said, I didn't care if she was a Hindu; she had a wonderful man who loved her and she kept resisting a future with him. I just wanted to slap her. But it is truly a compelling story and I recommend it.If you liked this one, I highly recommend to you Penelope Williamson's THE OUTSIDER."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"4.5 stars. The author's talent for writing is showcased in this book. Not only are the story and characters unique for its genre, the consistency of Christian's evolving understanding and use of communication was amazingly written. This will pull at your heart strings.This held my interest from beginning to end. Characterization was just excellent, especially in the case of Christian. The beginning of the book was a great opening to introduce Christian for the way he was (all smooth and arrogant), a jarring contrast to what he became after his stroke (confused, frustrated and very angry), which occurs shortly thereafter. It was amazing to see how his speech and his understanding of speech evolved throughout the book, starting out as gibberish and then slowly evolving, the change throughout the book was gradual and subtle, a testament to how well written this book is. His thought processes were always clearer, highlighting his frustration and anger in his failure to be able to communicate, leading to his violent reactions (the cause of his incarceration into an asylum).I liked Maddy, but she also frustrated me a lot, I think I would have been able to relate and understand her better if I was religious, as it was, a lot of what she does and the choices she makes are driven by her upbringing as a Quaker and I often wanted to strangle her for being so blind to Christian's needs and the way he felt about her. That said, his world and her world are so different, that it is really understandable that she just doesn't have an inkling of the intricacies of Christian's enterprises and the workings of the beau monde, especially since he can't explain it to her due to the levels of his communication at his mastery (or rather, lack thereof). I was constantly in real fear of what she would do that would cause Christian to lose everything he had. That again I think is another point to the author. Despite this being a historical romance which must come with the requisite HEA, the story is written in such as a way that it really makes you doubt whether there will be that HEA. Maddy's inconsistency with her actions are a direct result of how torn she is between what she feels for Christian, what she felt was her duty to protect him due to some form of enlightenment, to what she believes is the right thing to do under her upbringing and trying to retain her sense of identity under that same upbringing, which she feels she is giving up by being with Christian and accepting the world that he lives in.Loved the interactions between the characters. Again, the first meeting between Christian and Maddy (before his stroke) highlights the difference in him after his stroke. Despite Maddy becoming the calming effect to Christian's rage and violent tendencies and her caring for him as an attendant, the author always manage to create a tension between them and the relationship never felt like that of a dependent/caregiver.This is a pretty long book for this genre, and it is masterfully written with a lot of suspense. I never felt this dragged on and thoroughly enjoyed being engrossed in it, the plot keeps thickening and keeps you guessing until the very end. The last part of the book is an especially rough emotional rollercoaster ride, and Christian's impassioned speech in response to Maddy's paper condemning her actions with Christian (spoken in a Quaker community meeting) was heart wrenching. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"A timeless, defining work for the genre with a solid plot and depth of emotion rarely conveyed without stumbling into purple prose or lapsing onto the crutch of endless physical encounters. All the main characters are multi-faceted, eminently human with clear voices that ring in a reader's mind. For all of the challenges (physical, social, emotional, even spiritual) to being heard and understood the dialogue is rich, taunt, plentiful. Jervaulx and Maddy's example while extreme still resonants with what we all desire: to be seen, heard, and valued for ourselves, not our wealth, physical features, titles, or position.Now I understand why Jervaulx is reverantly, rabidly nominated for any 'best duke story' list. At the same time Maddy's faith shines brighter than any I've read by faith based publishers. The spare elegance of her spiritual crisis, plain speech, and stumbles set her apart from many heroines, much like a swan among ducks. There is no question that this may be infatuation or lust for either of them, even in the epilogue they are working to maintain their bond, no complacent soft-focus HEA.Am only sorry I didn't read this book sooner than 20 years after publication; will reread it again in the future. Here's hoping a digital edition is released soon."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"I'm starting to see that this author throws in an usual-for-the-genre gimmick in each of her books and counts on the readers' intelligence to get them through it. While the execution may not always work so well I approve of the intent. Her books are at least different and memorable and much more something to sink your teeth into than most romances.Our hero is a brilliant mathematician and shameless womanizer who has a stroke while dueling the husband of his latest bed-buddy. Because of the damage to his motor skills and language ability, he is put in an asylum, where he meets up again with our intrepid heroine, his Quaker nurse. (They had met prior to the stroke because he was collaborating with her blind father on a mathematical theorem.) She becomes his lifeline, helping him to learn to talk again and preparing him for a competency hearing that will determine whether he is allowed to keep his title and fortune. Love grows between his dependence and her understanding, but neither is suitable for the other: she because she is a Quaker and poor; he because he is not a Quaker or a particularly good man. And there are assorted other complications that pop up as a result of him being a scoundrel and now considered a madman.The language here is also some difficult going, between the thee/thou Quaker speech and the hero's stroke-damaged hearing and slurring, but it didn't bother me as much as the Middle English that Kinsale used in For My Lady's Heart. There seemed to be more point to it this time around. You can actually use it as a gauge for his recovery process and emotional state, which is pretty neat and some great attention to detail."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"And I was completely wrong. I just finished this book, and want to immediately start over and read it again. It deserves its reputation, times ten.I looked through some of the other reviews and saw some criticisms of Maddy. Was she perfect? Was Christian? Oh, no, neither of them were. He needed her so much that he would have done anything to attach her to him, completely ignoring her reluctance. She loved him despite herself, and felt as if she were losing her identity - and she was. She lost what she most valued, her identity and position as a Quaker, a Friend.Christian was completely right. She *was* a Duchess. Her struggle in its own way mirrored his. He lost his sense of self - so did she. Both had to struggle through deep water to find themselves, whole, but changed. As Christian said, she made him a better man. As Maddie finally accepted, as the Duchess, her life and decisions were infinitely more complicated, her walk in Truth harder, but she was able to do much more good with her wealth.The supporting characters are wonderful. I am so fond of Papa, Denham (the oddest clergyman you'll ever encounter), baby Diana (I could see her little forehead wrinkle), and especially Lady de Marly and a certain gray staghound at the end.This book is perfect, and I am blown away by Laura Kinsale's talent."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"This is my first Kinsale book.

The characters are extremely well written in this thoroughly engaging dark plot, full of twists and turns that kept me fully engaged till the very last page.

Basically, I think it's a very good book...that I probably won't read ever again.The ending is wonderful and a tearjerker, but I did not feel like I could relate to the characters, Christian and Maddy, in any way. I'm not saying that relatability is a requirement (um, I know I'm not a 17 year old virgin debutante who changes gowns three times a day), but their personalities didn't grow on me, despite my being sympathetic to the difficulties inherent in the hero's situation. The descriptions of his frustration in not being able to communicate are rather heartbreaking. The way their story is portrayed is rife with details and realism, but I didn't see their relationship as very romantic (notwithstanding the ending scene).Generally, it's too angsty for my tastes, and although I recognize the skill in crafting these lives, I don't necessarily feel compelled to visit (i.e. read about) them again."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"Amazing.

This is the first romance novel I have read where the main character is a stroke \\"survivor\\". I felt ever one of his hard earned accomplishments.

I was confused by the effusive praise for this story, thinking it just another dime store romance... judging by the cover. Never has that cliche hit home so strongly as when I started reading. Ms. Kinsale has taken an ordinary historical and completely turned it into a deep and riveting story with a richness seldom seen in this genre. In fact, I think the publishers have done a huge injustice to such a fine book by lumping it among the common. It is so VERY much more.The main reason \\"Flowers\\" rises so far above is the subject matter itself. Kinsale has taken a young, prolific and unrepentant jaded rake and thrown him into the nightmare of experiencing a massive stroke, 19th century-style. She then adds a circumspect Quaker girl as his nurse and only hope for sanity or redemption in the asylum he is imprisoned in. The reader is led to see the horrific opinions and practices employed in that era before understanding, as we experience all the emotion, frustration and desperation felt through the eyes of this highly intelligent young man battling to re-learn how to think, talk and move again, all as the world labels him an imbecile and a lunatic.We also experience the struggle of a young Quaker girl thrust into the rich and materialistic world of the aristocracy. Fighting to live her faith and keep her integrity as she unwillingly falls in love with this tortured Duke. The principles of honesty, frugality and total abstinence from carnal temptations seem totally nonexistent in the world she is thrust into.Both stories are told with amazing compassion and unbelievable depth in understanding. Two subjects so common, yet so overlooked are addressed so well that I literally ached and cried along with the characters. Most important, I walked away from this story a much better person for having read it.

Unlike some of the other reviewers I think the author understood the situation Maddy found herself in and wrote her more \`true to life'. Maddy was faced with changing her whole life--not an easy thing. Sometimes, in romances, the heroine is so swept away by passion that the decisions she makes are not realistic--and even though it is fiction, some realism is a good thing. This book explored her loyalty--to herself, her faith and her love. I really appreciated that the decisions she was faced with were difficult and therefore the handling of them was important. I also loved Christian. The frustration, desperation, and confusion were vividly expressed. I hurt for him, but understood Maddy. Give this book a try---it will make you smile and cry a little, but it truly expresses the feelings of the characters. A really fine romance.

The reason Kinsale is my favorite romance author is because she transcends the genre so delightfully; if anyone's work could be labeled as \\"literary romance,\\" it would be hers. I have never known an author who lends more emotional credibility and complexity to her characters, and this is something I hunger for when reading romance novels.I did find the primness and resistance of Maddy to be frustrating; however, this makes for adequate sexual tension and a terrific novel, and it does seem that the wanton woman (like me) does not win the hero's heart. :) This novel was very emotionally wrenching and almost hopeless and depressing at certain moments, though this could also have been my mindset at the time. It seems as if Maddy and Christian might be forever doomed... Christian, in his vulnerability, desperation, and frustration, becomes such an agonizingly beautiful character that the novel is almost painful to read during segments.No one can match Kinsale for language and metaphor regarding love and sensuality. For example, describing Maddy's climax with words such as \\"...she came... with little feminine cries, like an unquiet dreamer...\\" One must read Kinsale for the poetry, at least. I desperately wish she would undertake an epic project of morbid intensity... The outcome would be astonishing."},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"The book was beyond wonderful.

What really would have happened to a stroke victim in the 18th century? As maddening and confusing as it is in the 21st, can you IMAGINE what it would have been like to have your brain, your very self, muddled by this mysterious illness in a day when mental illness is considered \\"moral failure?\\"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here ~ Maddy got annoying. I liked that she was willing to take a risk and get outside of her safe little world, but her waffling and self-righteousness grew irritating. She needed to learn to trust and have confidence in her husband (and her God!) even when things didn't make perfect sense to her (although, that is not uncommon in the romance genre and one of my biggest pet peeves).However, the really phenomenal part of this story is Christian's ability to battle back from the frustration and bewilderment and take charge of his life again. His character, while always charming and likable, went through true changes, through trials of fire and water, and became a better person. I just wish I could have sent a 21st century doctor back in time to him!I completely recommend this book if you want to give up your next few nights and days and be completely absorbed!"},{"Title":"Flowers From the Storm (LARGE PRINT, LARGE PRINT)","review":"For me this book is a Keeper with a capital K...

(Especially the one near the end, Christian's speech at Maddy's church, and their talk together afterwards...I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it, but those who have will know what I mean.)

In most of his books, he makes history an enjoyable romp, writing books that are engaging and hard to put down.However, this book is one of the biggest rip-offs I've seen. It has a price from Fantasyland and the text is about as detailed as the leaflets you pick up from a museum. For example, the 'Chapter' on Pagan Temple architecture has a total of 488 words. It has over 100 pages only because there are full-page title-pages introducing each section.Considering this is supposed to be a book on Roman Art, the text tells you nothing, and the price is so high you think you are getting something of quality, rather than a hardcover museum leaflet. Michael Grant should stick to books on historical figures, (Eg. Nero, Cleopatra etc) and leave Art History to the experts."},{"Title":"Incident Command System/With Portable Field Operations Guide (Ics-420-1)","review":"IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT OUR SOCIETY IS COMING TOGETURE IN REGARDS TO RESPONDING TO DURING AND RECOVERY OF AN EMERGENCY BY USING ICS.

It's about one of the most fascinating and effective and least written-about business executives in the world, Dee Hock.Hock is the founder and CEO Emeritus of Visa. Visa is an organizational form unlike anything anyone had ever seen or, for that matter since. It combined the efforts of organizations that were normally at each other's competitive throats. But that's not all.In the process of getting Visa to work, Hock and the other folks that he worked with, also managed to create the payment system that is Visa. To realize how big an achievement this is, consider the fact that the check-clearing system in the Federal Reserve still does not work with a fraction of the efficiency of the Visa-approval and payment-clearing process.I'd known about Dee Hock for years, and I was fascinated by him and by the process that must have gone into establishing, actually inventing, Visa. I snatched up this book when it came out hoping that it would contain the story of Hock and the Visa adventure. It did. That story is compelling and well written.But there's more to this book than that story, and the \\"more\\" includes lots of bits of value and many bits of frustration.Take the title. Birth of the what Age? \\"Chaordic.\\" Try looking that up in the dictionary. It's not there. Do we need a brand-new word to describe what Hock is describing? Maybe, but I'm not sure.I'm quite sure I don't need some of the other strange things that he does with language in the book. There is, for example, \\"Thee Ancient One.\\" That turns out to be a tractor. Then there's \\"old monkey mind.\\"Old monkey mind is the term that Hock uses in several different ways throughout the book. Sometimes it's used to refer to logical, linear, left side of the brain. Sometimes it's used to refer to old thinking patterns. Sometimes it seems to be a kind of alter ego for Hock with whom he has conversations.That kind of language is cute but it's more appropriate to a book of whimsy. Here it gets in the way of understanding. And there's a lot here to understand.Whatever else Dee Hock is, he is certainly one of the most fascinating intellects that I've come across. He's clearly a man of principle. He's had an amazing life, starting from poverty, rising to heights of business where he created one of the great financial institutions in the history of the planet. Then he walked away from that achievement with less ongoing compensation than Jack Welch's apartment rentals. Hock's mind is supple and rich and dips into sources that span time and geography and cultures.Hock's life and the story of Visa are fascinating, and it pulls us along, but there's real meat in his observations about organizations and how they work and how they ought to work. There are penetrating insights into the ways that organizations have an impact on the Planet, on the economy, and on individual lives. There are insights and observations about what it means to be human.In the end, I think this is really two books. One book is a story that goes from start to finish. It's the story of Dee Hock. It's the story of Visa. It's a fascinating story, filled with lessons and examples. It's worth buying the book that's between the cover for.Then there's the other book that is a collection of bits of observation and thought. They're not presented in a coherent way, just plopped down into the story in separate chapters throughout the book. This is a book with less organization and more random insights. It, too, is interesting and worth the price of the book.In the end, you can get two books - both wonderful, for the price of one."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"Sorry, but this is not a another book on how to make more money in business.

What he accomplished at Visa was revolutionary, and his insights on organizations and management are nothing short of genius.

Therefor it came as no surprise that he decided to organise his company, VISA International, following the structures of nature. The resulting enterprise showed flexibility and ingenuity, being able to rapidly respond to changing circumstances. The people it attracted grew a strong sense of responsibility and pride in their contributions. The interconnectedness and mutual trust laid a solid base for creativity and daring. Given the circumstances all were leaders at times and followers at others. A shared passion or spirit of relevance drove them further, growing VISA to a multi trillion business in the process. A beautiful example what can happen if we align ourselves with the forces of nature."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"Simply put, Dee Hock is a man of conviction and courage. In establishing an organization structure that is far from most business hierarchies, he has given us a method to emulate for today's rapidly changing business model.As an information technology team coach, I found Dee's examples of having a well defined purpose as the center in promoting creativity and productivity right on target. His MiniMaxims are a throwback to the humor and insight of Will Rogers.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in an alternative to common business structure."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"Like many others, I bought this book because of the outstanding article written about Dee Hock in one of the first issues of &quot;Fast Company.&quot; So I waited...and waited...and waited for Hock to come out with this long-planned volume (replete with many publishing delays).The result. Yeech. I couldn't stomach more than 10 pages or so. In the future, let's keep the writing to others writing *about* Mr. Hock. This book reads like someone who's been cooped up in the study a bit too long. In the original article, there was an exciting thesis about creating organizations in which power was pushed away from the center. And Visa, Hock's brainchild, was a brilliant manifestation of that principle.But the book is about...ummmm, what? &quot;Old Monkey Mind&quot; musings? Who can follow these meanderings? Readers of the article are bound to be disappointed. At least we get a little insight as to why the author is no longer at Visa. Tough to imagine that a man with this sort of obvious brilliance could function trying to run the nuts-and-bolts of an increasingly static (and less chaordic) organization."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"In this wonderful volume, Dee Hock chronicles his lifelong struggle to understand the very nature of organization, information and the role of wisdom. Dee believes deeply that we must learn how to allow organizations to exist on the knife-edge between order and chaos -- chaordic organizations. Dee's passion goes far beyond a desire to see continuous improvement. He tells why he believes this new worldview is necessary to avoid global institutional failure.I believe in another 100 years Dee Hock's name will still be on the lips of innovators as one who pointed the way when we found ourselves increasingly lost. I love this book...and believe it is very, very important."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"I really recomend this book. It's a letter for FUTURE organizations. How the &quot;way of doing things&quot; are not working anymore, and how we should find a more &quot;equal and ecological&quot; way, re-thinking every relation and seeing all inter-relations.

Chaordic is a poor buzzword. A HOLONIC approach to the balancing act between hierarchy and heterarchy as well as self-organization and autocatalytic evolution is most appropriate. Do a web search if you want more on holonics. The reulting science of such behavior was 1st published by Auther Koestler in his landmark book &quot;The Ghost In The Machine&quot; (c)1967. Appendix 1 of this work is something that would serve to cleanse this authors apparent lack of scientific prowess. This author says it all and I quote; &quot;I do not believe that VISA is a model to emulate.&quot; pp282. It is obvious that the success of VISA and therefore this book are suspect and miss the mark. It is amazing that the Chaordic Alliance was ever funded. The book is close, but no Cigar!! One star gives credit to the sis-boom-bah rhetoric that this book is peppered with.

It is also the author's personal quest for understanding the nature of society today and the reasons for the failure of so many organizations. He presents his ideas about the birth of a new age filled with accelerating change and disorder which requires organizations that can operate at the thin edge between chaos and order.Hock introduces the concept of chaordic, an adjective referring to the behavior of any self-governing organism, organization or system which blends elements of order and chaos. Chaordic organization is one able to maintain a harmonious order-disorder balance, characterized by principles of evolution; its nature includes being self-organizing, self-governing, adaptive, and nonlinear.Hock uses his business experience as a springboard to put forward ideas about chaordic organization which include: they have no destination or ultimate being-only becoming; they incorporate inherent paradox and conflict; they are driven by a deep conviction and shared understanding of the Purpose of a community from which all else flows (profit is not, according the Hock, a Purpose); and they apply principles that are an expression of behavior in the pursuit of Purpose.The full scope of Hock's thinking encompasses the environment, society, and individuals. This book is a mixture of subtle concepts, insights into organization, and a well told tale (in detail) of the evolution of an idea into a major business enterprise. Hock's deeper insights are intriguing.The book will be immensely rewarding for those interested in delving into reflective thinking about the evolving nature of organization. Highly recommended.

More precisely, he created the organization/system/environment that allowed and encouraged the creativity and passion of thousands of people to create VISA. Hock has coined the term &quot;chaordic,&quot; meaning chaos and order at the same time; the harmonious interplay of both is necessary for all vital, adaptable systems. He makes the critical distinction between control and order. Control is imposed, an attempt to eliminate chaos, and stifles creativity and the human spirit. Order arises naturally out of a shared purpose that engages people at the core of their being and brings forth the best they have to offer. Hock states it exquisitely, &quot;Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple, stupid behavior.&quot;Hock offers a new way of organizing human activity, one that can alter our headlong rush toward social and environmental disaster. It is not merely theoretical but imminently practical - applicable to all sizes and types of organizations from individual to global for-profit and non-profit endeavors of every kind. This new chaordic understanding nurtures the human spirit, the biosphere, and a sustainable future. And it comes just in the nick of time. Maybe we CAN create a livable future for all of the grandchildren."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"If you are interested in the best way for people to work together in organizations, you must read Dee Hock's account of the founding and development of Visa. His thinking has played a key role for those who are trying to apply chaos and complexity theory to organizations, and to seminal thinkers like Peter Senge and Arie de Geus. Now, you can read the simple, humble thoughts that can turn ordinary people into extraodinary combinations of effectiveness. I loved the aphorisms interspaced through the book and the down-to-earth way that Dee Hock shared his experiences and thoughts. Think of this as the opposite of Chainsaw Al, and with greater results. Anyone who wants to move beyond the command and control culture that tends to dominate in most organizations should read Dee Hock's account of Chaordic Organizations in the new Chaordic Age. If you liked The Fifth Discipline, The Dance of Change, or The Living Company, this is must reading for you."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"Reading this book is like reading three books at the same time. It is a part story of VISA, part reflection on life's lessons and part textbook on organisation theory. Depending on what the reader is looking for, it can either be a great book or a lousy one.If the reader is looking specifically for a story on VISA, he will find the story superficial, lacking in details and excitement.If the reader is looking for a new organisation theory, termed Chaordic Theory by the author, he will find that the book explains little on the theories (no more than ten pages) and even lesser on how to apply it. The example of how VISA applied Chaordic theory is superficial and I doubt anyone can apply Chaordic concepts in their organisation just by reading the book.If the reader is looking for life's lesson as experienced by an extraordinary man, if the reader is willing to plough through the book for such lessons, the reader will find the book full of such life's lesson. I found one such lesson most valuable. The author wrote that men must always keep the beasts of Ambition, Avarice, Ego and Greed at bay. I thought that was a valuable lesson indeed.Reading this book demanded much of my concentration. Interspersed in the story of VISA, are reflections of how certain thoughts and theories were developed. Such reflections not only break the flow of the book, but also tend to be much more philosophical in nature. To add to the confusion, there are little boxes of mini-maxims (as the author termed it), throughout the book. While I like the touch of the mini-maxims, it again breaks the flow of a normal read. The author certainly is serious when he wrote in the beginning of the book that this book is chaordic in nature. If you ask me, it was some kind of relief when I finally finished the book.The book ended with a disguised plea for donation to the Chaordic Alliance. Somehow, this did not feel right to me. I guess the author should have stuck to what he wrote in the book when he said he never ask for donations from others."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"'We are living on the knife's edge of one of those ... momentous turning points in human history. Liveable lives ... hang in the balance.' So begins a compelling, passionate, deeply practical and radical exploration of a way forward for our society and for business. Compulsive reading.I have been waiting for the book to come out since hearing Dee Hock speak at a conference in 1996. It is well up to my highest expectations. This is a book to experience rather than to summarise or analyse. I can not recommend strongly enough that you permit yourself the experience."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"Dee Hock interweaves his experiences growing up and founding VISA with his thoughts about how to address the decline of community and of modern institutions. He perceives a general breakdown in the social order, fueled by an overemphasis on monetary values and greed, and perpetuated by institutions committed to old methods derived from ideas about machines and structure rooted in the Industrial Revolution. Now, businesses need a more dynamic, flexible organizational structure based on a clear sense of &quot;purpose&quot;. This purpose should be rooted in contributing to the community. It must be based on ethical principles and values. This process involves developing &quot;chaordic organizations,&quot; those which balance chaos and order. Hock uses examples from his life and from the development of VISA to show how this process works.This is an excellent, thoughtful book. Hock's fascinating story about founding VISA provides a good context for his meditations about the modern need to develop more chaordic, flexible organizations. At times though, his writing can become somewhat ponderous and wordy, particularly when he tries to express fairly complex or abstract ideas."},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"I have two regrets after reading it. One that I can't give it more than 5 stars, and that I did not read it a long time ago. I read this book to learn more about Hock's views on complexity and organization, what he describes as a \\"chaordic system.\\" While I met that purpose, I also discovered much more.The personal narrative about failure and disappointment before Hock's leadership in the creation of VISA is something I needed to read years ago before I went through frustrating set-backs in my own career for related reasons.What's more, Hock's understanding and recommendations for harnessing the power of complex systems is brilliant. If you could read only one book on leadership and complexity, I would strongly encourage this book to be it.Part of what I find so amazing is that Hock is able to express a great deal of cutting edge philosophy and social science thinking as he tells a business story.Read this book and share the ideas within with others!"},{"Title":"Birth of the Chaordic Age","review":"As a leader in a religious non-profit organization Hock's maxims hit home with me.

He relates a large part of that personal history in Birth of the Chaordic Age even though, he claims, this is not a story about him, nor about VISA International, although both figure prominently in the tale. The book is not so much a story at all, but a passionate manifesto for the future of business and society as a whole. If almost anyone else had written a book of such grand - perhaps grandiose - pretensions, we would quickly dismiss them. But Hock is known as the founder and former CEO of VISA International. He explains that he founded the organization on \\"chaordic principles\\". This business now connects over 20,000 financial institutions, 14 million merchants, and 600 million consumers in 220 countries. That's a compelling argument for allowing the man to speak.Hock's book is a masterfully written broadside against the dominance of today's command-and-control institutions. He is far from alone in the outlines of his historical perspective. According to this, over the last three centuries we have increasingly sought to structure society according to reductionism, specialization, more technology, more efficiency, more linear education and processes, and more hierarchical command and control. The goal has been to create an organization in which leaders can pull a lever and reliably produce a desired result.Hock goes further than most who share this perspective when he talks of the \\"dominator organizations\\" that have ordered resources and people so as to produce large quantities of uniform goods. Instead of the expected results, claims Hock, what we have produced is \\"obscene maldistribution of wealth and power, a crumbling ecosphere, and collapsing societies.\\" This apocalyptically gloomy view may be trendy, but has only a passing resemblance to reality. (For a brief alternative view, see \\"The Truth About the Environment\\", related to this review.) Readers need not share Hock's assessment of today in order to learn from, agree with, and help to implement his alternative vision of chaordic organizations - those that are simultaneously chaotic and orderly.The positive vision expounded on in Birth of the Chaordic Age sees organizations of the future as being the embodiment of community, based on shared purpose calling to the higher aspirations of people. Hock puts this general description into more specific form by explaining how a chaordic organization is formed by attending to six elements in the proper order: Purpose, Principles, People, Concept, Structure and Practice.Hock claims that VISA was formed according to this description - the unusual organization is owned by its member banks, which combine competition for customers with cooperation by honoring each other's transactions across borders and monetary systems. If this is true, then you may persist in reading the book for its vision, despite some annoying peccadilloes, such as Hock's talk of \\"Old Monkey Mind\\" (his rational thoughts)."},{"Title":"THIRST: God and the Alchoholic Experience","review":"An insightful book about the connection between spirituality and addiction.

The heart of the vision stands clear and unencumbered.Most of the poems are personal. Ms. Garren writes about what she knows and what she feels, but she does so in such a way that a broader context is conveyed to the reader.

DH"},{"Title":"The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion","review":"As a visitor enters the nave of the Episcopal church I attend, his gaze is immediately drawn to the stark pentagonal brick wall behind the raised altar, and to the large cross on it with a life-size statue of a crucified Jesus, naked except for the loin cloth about his hips to satisfy the normal decency criteria of the Church. Although we do know that crucifixion victims were stripped of all their clothing, and that the Bible specifically describes the Roman soldiers gambling for Jesus' garments, good taste forbids us to show Jesus naked. Yet there was a time when this was not true.This book examines the Renaissance period (14th to 16th century) when artists presented Jesus either completely naked or covered by a simple loincloth that accentuated a rigidly erect member. Three hundred beautiful plates show this state of undress of both the baby Jesus and of the dying or resurrected Christ. What caused the artists to break the normal decency codes, asks the author, and he advances various theories to answer his own question. The first half of the book was written in 1983 and is divided into two parts: the main analysis and 39 excursuses (appendices to you and me) that amplify various points made. The second half was written thirteen years later and presents the author's newer thoughts plus a detailed refutation of the arguments put forth by his critics.The paintings examined in the book relate to three periods of Jesus' life: his infancy, his baptism, and his crucifixion. Those depicting his infancy show a progressive diminution of worn apparel with passing time: in the 12th century Jesus is shown covered completely by a long philosopher's tunic; in 13th century paintings he appears in short child's dresses; and in the next two centuries he is painted either completely nude, or wearing short, sometimes see-through shifts, that are pulled up by either the baby or his mother to reveal his genitals, while the actions of the surrounding figures direct the viewer's attention to them. Whether it is Mary's mother poking at them (in Hans Baldung Grien's \\"Holy Family\\" 1511) or a magus staring at them intently (in Monticello's \\"Adoration of the Magi,\\" c. 1470), or even the baby himself holding or pointing to them, these treatments of a baby's, let alone baby Jesus' genitals seem to transcend good taste.Steinberg explains it as an effort by the painters to bring to the viewer's attention Jesus' full humanity, and to remind us that as a true Jew he shed his first blood for us during his circumcision. It is, \\"I, your Creator, have come to share your humanity\\"; or, \\"See how I have not delayed to pour out for you the price of my blood.\\" The Magus's almost indecent examination is just an effort to certify the sex or the circumcision status of the child. St Anne's poking, in Grien's woodcut, is explained away as some type of the artist's preoccupation with fecundity and miracle-working spells.The manner in which the adult Jesus was painted relates to the beliefs regarding original sin held by the Eastern Orthodox and the Western Catholic Churches. The Orthodox Church believed that there was no sex in Paradise, and that there never would be. \\"God did not need marriage to fill the earth,\\" preached St John Chrysostom. The Church maintained that Adam and Eve had been created sexless and it was only after they sinned that they were endowed with procreative organs. The author presents an 11th century Spanish drawing showing Adam acquiring a penis after he sinned. Since Jesus was not subject to the original sin, he resembled the original man having no genitalia. So this is how he was painted in Medieval times (12th and 13th centuries); during his baptism, or on the cross, he was shown naked and sexless. Since there were no sexual organs to give rise to feelings of shame these naked paintings of Jesus could be freely exhibited in and out of church.In later years, the Catholic Church in the West was influenced by St. Augustine's theory of original sin. According to him Adam and Eve were created with all their genitalia intact, but after they sinned God punished them by removing from them conscious control of these organs. Instead of performing the procreative act in a calm and emotionless manner, they were now subject to the vicissitude of their lustful emotions; Adam could no longer control the erection status of his member. (Charitably the author did not mention St. Augustine's sexual history: as a young man in Africa he took a concubine and produced a son; then he turned to his childhood boyfriend Alypius; and finally moved to Rome where, with five other friends, he took a vow of celibacy, upon which his concubine took his son and left.) The question then became, how did this affect Jesus since he was not subject to original sin?Michelangelo's response was \\"Risen Christ,\\" a work more resembling pagan Greek and Roman works than Christian Church statues, a completely nude Christ holding onto a cross. It seems, however, that Michelangelo was not very interested in this work since he had one of his pupils finish it. Even so, at least seven copies of it were produced during this period, but in all of them Christ was suitably covered. So why did Michelangelo produce such a statue? Before they sinned Adam and Eve had walked naked in the Garden without feeling shame. It was only after they sinned that they became ashamed of their private parts and covered themselves. By this reasoning, since Jesus was without sin he did not need to feel ashamed and cover himself. Most other paintings of the period, however, do not show this much frontal nudity. Although Christ's naked body may be shown removed from the cross, one of his hands is usually placed strategically to prevent exposure. This can be explained, argues Steinberg, by the common belief that a dying man often tends to place his hand on his groin.Perhaps more shocking to the viewer are those paintings where the dead Christ's loincloth clearly shows a massive underlying erection. In the first part of the book, the author advanced various explanations for this practice: in pagan days the phallus was equated with power; in the Egyptian Osiris myth the erection and resurrection motifs were almost combined. But by the time he wrote the second half of his book the author had come up with his Theory of Penile Erection. Since, according to St. Augustine, after the Fall man lost his ability to control this member of his body, what better way for a painter to show that Jesus is unaffected by the original sin than to depict him in control of his erections. And to dissociate it from any sexual involvement, and thus sin, these erections occur either after his death or during his infancy.All in all this is a very interesting book that can be appreciated by even non-artistic types like me. It obviously contains much more that I have space to comment upon. The only thing that I failed to understand was another reviewer's description of breaking up with hilarity while reading it. Perhaps it is because I am neither an artist nor a trained theologian but, with the possible exception of Joos van Cleve's \\"Holy Family\\" where Joseph is portrayed reading a book with his spectacles on, I didn't see anything particularly funny in this book.(The writer is the author of \\"Christianity without Fairy Tales: When Science and Religion Merge.\\")"},{"Title":"The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion","review":"Several art historians of my acquaintance, experts in the period, say that this is the best art history book ever written. I'm not an expert, but I can say that it's terrific, and one of the few academic books that, at first reading, had me lying on my back on the floor with my feet in the air, laughing hysterically. Steinberg had the audacity to wonder, looking at a Renaissance painting, why is it that Jesus's male member is so, well, *prominent*? Instead of averting his eyes (which is what most of us would do) he started looking for other paintings with which to compare it, and lo and behold, he discovered lots of them where indeed the painter seems to be deliberately *accenting* a part of the anatomy which normally one would expect to be concealed. He concludes that the painters were trying to show that the son of God had become Incarnate as a man in the most literal sense. In that sense, what seems scandalous to us is simply a manifestation of Renaissance humanism.Beyond the screamingly funny prose lies a serious argument, about the Renaissance, and the way to do art history. Finally, Steinberg teaches the reader's eye how to look at a painting."},{"Title":"The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion","review":"this book remains timely for the student of theology or one who wishes to expand the mind beyond the mundane .

I highly recommend this book to those who are tired of cliches and formulas. I'm glad I found this little treasure."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"Mr. Jeffrey Lent the Author of, \\"In The Fall\\" was the only person who supplied a comment on this book's jacket. And that was enough reason for me to get the book, as, \\"Into The Fall\\", was one of the best books I had read last year, and I hoped, \\"Gabriel's Story\\", would approach that work in quality. The book does not, the story does not, and the writing does not.I liked the premise of an emancipated family settling and beginning a new life in Kansas, and I looked forward to the Author providing a fresh perspective on the theme. None of this happened as the portion of the book dedicated to the Family's experience is minimal prior to Gabriel leaving his Family for, \\"higher adventure\\". The majority of the book is Gabriel playing witness to, and hearing stories that are clich&eacute;, brutally violent, random, and basically pointless. A sampling of events includes multiple murders for which there is no motivation other than a thirst for blood. Rape is second on the list but only because there is less opportunity for it to be committed. Victims are not simply killed, they are disemboweled with great descriptive detail, and castration while the victim is alive is another light touch. Staking a person on an anthill is also another form of amusement.Every nauseating historical prejudice is discussed at length, with extended drunken and sober monologue dedicated to racism, and the explanation of why the extermination of the Native Americans is not only correct but also necessary.The very brief description of the book on the jacket should have been a sign of how little was contained within. Gabriel is described as a youth, which is appropriate for a 15 year old, but then becomes a man a paragraph later. You can attempt to place all manner of meaning on this bloody trip across a portion of America, or you can take the book for what it is. This is about a kid who runs away from home, is taken in by and follows a group of serial killers, rapists and racists, and then loops back around and comes home once again. If the runaway theme seems familiar it is, for it has been written dozens of times and almost all better than this example.Trying to raise this to the level of a, \\"Prodigal Son\\" story, or a coming of age story just does not work. The time that passes from beginning to end is not long enough for any accumulation of knowledge. Merely witnessing mindless violence does not qualify as a profound trip through life, lasting just over one year's time.The most interesting character does not speak until three quarters of the book has passed. And when she does the talent the Author may have in later works is shown albeit briefly. When a book lacks an endorsement from even one reliable press or literary source, and relies on an Author with one book to his credit, the blame should fall on the buyer if he or she is disappointed. I made this mistake once before when I accepted a well-liked Author's opinion only to be subjected to mediocre work, I will not do so again. And that's unfortunate, as many new Authors don't always come with endorsements. They were no accolades for this work. They were appropriately absent."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"The widowed mother of Gabriel Lynch remarries and the family is moved from the sweet setting of a brownstone to the harsh lands of Kansas. Gabriel hates his new home, which is practically leaning and falling down at its seams, and the land he is forced to help till. He equally dislikes the man his mother marries, who unlike Gabriel's father, was a former slave. Gabriel goes off, into the wild wild west of a blue yonder with some rather rambunctious outlaws in search of something better than life on a little prairie. It is a coming of age story beautifully told within the realms of greed, violence, and all other kinds of maladies that made the wild west, or that general direction, infamous. This journey exposes Gabriel to an ugly world, one that trumps the hard work required on a farm, but in the midst of it, he learns the true value and strength of family.The novel is not a fast read, nor a slow one but just right - so savor it!

But Durham's decision to present certain portions in italic with no names given to the people in them--even after we have been introduced to those people--struck me as striving too much for some mystical effect.

There's just one guy who dissented, but I guess there's always gonna be one that doesn't catch on. For my part, I'd like to join in the chorus of enthusiasm for this novel. It works, and it works on many levels. At the simplest level it's an adventure story. Woven into that is a coming of age tale. Layered on that is a dialogue between good and evil, between the best and worst in men's natures. Add the back and forth between the life of homesteaders and that of cowboys, two dual and sometimes dueling aspects of the American frontier experience. There's a young black man discovering the natural world and relating to it in a way I've never seen in African-American literature. There's the turmoil of a mother watching her young sons become men, for better and worse. There's the anguish of a man who's family has died tragically. There's the strange legacy of slavery as manifest through two characters who don't even understand how they fit into that tragedy.All this and more can be found in this exceptional novel. I guess not everyone will engage with it so completely, but if any of these themes sound interesting to you I encourage you to delve into this book. It's all there, and an attentive reader will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"I picked up this book after reading the USA Today review, which was essentially an unconditional rave. I decided to give it a try, but figured I'd probably be disappointed, as few books live up to the praise heaped on them. But GABRIEL'S STORY was a pleasant surprise. It begins with vivid homesteading scenes - all the toil and the poverty of it. Makes me glad I wasn't a homesteader, and it made it reasonable that Gabriel would want to run away from it. The journey that he sets off on is truly engrossing, well-plotted, with beautiful language and great descriptions of the Western landscape.It looks like the novel is being compared to Cormac McCarthy's work. There are some similarities, but GABRIEL'S STORY is a bit more hopeful than McCarthy's work. The world is still harsh and dangerous, but Durham seems to have more faith in humanity, in family and friends. Also, I thought it was interesting that the reviewer in USA Today said that he was a city-dwelling white guy that still got into this book about a black boy in another century out on the plains. I felt the same way. Yes, the main characters are black, but their racial identity is only part of the whole world of the story. They're black like James Joyce's characters are Irish or Faulkner's are Southern - it matters, but it doesn't change the fact that anybody can connect with them. Altogether a really good novel."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"The prodigal son always comes home. Iin life, in parable and in literature.And he has returned once more in &quot;Gabriel's Story,&quot; a haunting debut by David Anthony Durham. In this incarnation, the wayward youth is a 15-year-old African-American boy in the empty middle of a continent, caught between youth and manhood, naivet&eacute; and wisdom, family and flight.Fleeing racism in Reconstruction-era Baltimore, Gabriel Lynch travels with his mother and younger brother to his stepfather's hard-scrabble homestead in 1870s Kansas. As with the Biblical story of the prodigal son, Gabriel finds the &quot;outside&quot; world less exciting and more threatening than he dreamed. He returns to Kansas wiser and chastened, prepared to take his place behind the plow and, more importantly, at the family hearth. &quot;Gabriel's Story&quot; is a classical bildungsroman -- a novel about the moral and psychological growth of the main character -- told in masterful prose reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy.His is not just a startlingly poetic African-American voice (Durham is the son of Trinidadian immigrants), but a welcome new voice in the rich spectrum of American letters, where authors should -- and must -- be judged in different shades of black and white: The color of words on a page."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"Attention, readers who admire Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry take heart.

And he strikes a balance with his characters. He has some vile ones but also a lot of noble ones. He let's the vile ones speak. Sometimes the things they say aren't pleasant, but that just serves to put the noble characters in bolder display. And as far as I can tell, the book is getting plenty of accolades.

One, does the author have a story to tell? Two, does he or she have the skills to tell that story compellingly? As far as &quot;Gabriel's Story&quot; is concerned, the answer is yes on both counts. The story is strong both because it has a tight spine along which the narrative progresses and because the author picks up on an under-acknowledged feature of the American West, namely the role African-Americans played in its history. The novel educates, but it does so effortlessly, so that a reader is transported along on an adventure tale, probably not even noticing how much the novel adds new dimensions to writing about the West. As for the author's skills... He's got it. The narrative reads like some combination of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot;, somehow spliced together with a cinematographer's eye for horizon-lines, with a soft heart for the family scenes and a keen eye for the violent passages. And it even has a satisfying ending. That's rare these days and seems especially hard for first novelists to pull off. Congrats to the author."},{"Title":"Gabriel's Story","review":"Here is my reaction to one of the best books I have ever read. The book is &quot;Gabriel's Story&quot; by David Anthony Durham. The action takes place in the 1870's. The protagonist is Gabriel, an African-American youth who has just turned 16. The other characters are his brother Ben, just turned 14; his step-father, Solomon; his mother, and his uncle. Gabriel's parents were freed slaves. After their freedom, they lived in Baltimore, where Gabriel enjoyed the big city life. Then his father dies, and his mother decides to go west to Kansas to join and marry her first love, Solomon. The two were separated by slavery. Gabriel doesn't realize that they were in love before this time. Gabriel resents his mother's remarriage and the hard life homesteading on the Kansas prairie. He has all of a teenager's resentment of everything with something real to pin them on. He makes a friend, an African-American orphan his age whose name is James. Together the boys decide to join a group of cowboys and help them drive some horses west to Texas. What the boys don't realize is that these are very bad men they have fallen in with -- the very worst men there could be. As the trip begins, Gabriel and James gradually discover what these men really are, and now their greatest desire is to get away from them. The rest of the novel contains their picaresque travels with the men, trying to leave the men, and trying to return to Kansas. The author has done a marvelous job with this book. The plot is exciting and adventurous, with many twists and turns. The characters and their relationships are complex. The description is wonderful. I felt I was with Gabriel every step of the way on his journey. On Sunday I read in a frenzy from 2 to 6 because I couldn't stop until I finished this book. At times my heart was pounding and I almost stopped breathing as I said aloud, &quot;Oh, no!&quot; I was so involved in this. In addition, the author's writing is beautiful and eloquent. I wouldn't have predicted that I would fall in love with a book one might call a &quot;Western,&quot; but this novel defies categorization. The aspect of African Americans homesteading is unusual and interesting. I immediately wrote to the author to thank him for this book, and I hope other people will enjoy it as well. It might be a good one to recommend to teens."},{"Title":"Deep Blue: Stories of Shipwreck, Sunken Treasure and Survival (Unabridged Selections)","review":"As a collector of the entire series, no one awaited this book more than I. I feel let down. Of the 13 stories, (and it's only 318 pages, not 352), seven are fiction. These were not well chosen: selections from Treasure Island and Moby Dick are not even set at sea, but are the land-based openings of the books. The non-fiction does not live up to the billing of the editorial reviews that preceded it on this page. There is not much shipwreck or survivial: several are more like philosophical essays as opposed to stories with an edge. The story on diving the Andrea Doria is perhaps the best in the book, but many of us will have seen it elsewhere, as it is recent. Why a fictional account of the Titanic and not a true one? For a book on treasure, why nothing of Mel Fisher and the Atocha? If you want sea adventure, the earlier book in the series, Rough Water, delivers a bigger punch.

A friend gave me this book at the height of my failure portion of my life. I was divorced, raising four children on little money and my self esteem was low. I knew one thing, I loved my children and I wanted more for them. This book shares stories of people who, ended up realizing their dreams.

We really enjoyed the story in Captain Raptor, we look forward to the next installment in his adventures."},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"My five year old son LOVES this book. He's a HUGE Star Wars fan and adding dinosaurs into the space mix is a no fail combination for him. It's such an intelligent and original children's book--I just can't say enough about it. The book is written a bit like a comic book but much more readable for a younger crowd. It's such a fun read--I definitely don't have that \\"Oh boy, not THAT book again\\" feeling when he reaches for it for the 800th time. I hope this turns into a series!"},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"I always thought that it was kind of neat that kids grow up liking dinosaurs and spaceships, \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" as it were, because it has them looking both towards the past (history is a good thing) and the future (the best is yet to come). In \\"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery\\" author Kevin O'Malley and illustrator Patrick O'Brien combine both of those interests, so this book is going to have a basic appeal for a lot of young readers.The story is set on the planet Jurassica, which is in an uproar (ha ha) because an unidentified flying object has crashed into the mysterious moon of eon. Obviously, this is a job for (insert fanfare here) Captain Raptor, the \\"hero of a thousand space missions; champion of truth justice, and dinosaurs in space throughout the galaxy.\\" So Captain Raptor takes off in the USD \\"Megatooth,\\" his massive spaceship along with his crew: navigator Threetoe, professor Angleoptorous, and Master Sergeant Brichthorous.The story is told in something of a serial format, so that you get to cliffhangers every couple of pages (\\"Could this be the end of Captain Raptor and his brave crew?\\") but you only have to turn the page and not wait for next week's chapter. Then there is another big crisis (\\"Could THIS be the end of Captain Raptor and his fearless crew?\\"). There are even some underwater adventures, which is interesting for a book about dinosaurs in space. Plus the answer to the mystery should appeal to young readers as well.O'Brien's illustrations are down using watercolor and gouache on paper and apparently it was his idea of putting dinosaurs in spacesuits. However, it was O'Malley who came up with the interstellar hero Captain Raptor. The story is fun enough for your readers, but it really is hard to go wrong with the idea of dinosaurs in space because it is like throwing peanut butter and chocolate together: it is just a great idea. Hopefully there will be future adventures that will flesh out some of the supporting cast because there is more fun to be had here."},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"My 6yo son checked this book out from the school library. When he took it out of his backpack and I saw the title, I said \\"Wow. That looks fun.\\"Oh, my word. It is SO much fun.He has asked for it as a bedtime story every night for the last two weeks. It's not the best for bedtime, though, because you'll find yourself using ACTION HERO VOICES and gesturing wildly.When we had guests over for New Year's Eve, he grabbed it, and demanded that a friend's date read it to him. She did, and when she was done, she ran into the kitchen and said \\"That book is awesome!\\". This caused other adults to go and look at it, and everyone agreed that it was an absolute blast to read aloud.We have to return it on Tuesday. I'm really hoping the school has the other book in the series. If not, my son may get them as an early birthday present (not that early...he turns 7 at the end of January)."},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"This book and the sequel,Captain Raptor and the Space Pirates, are my 6-year old son's favorite books ever. Combining dinosaurs and space makes it just magical for him, and the books are top-notch in execution. The artwork is really good, and adults will get a kick out of the 1940's adventure serial style.

That was two days ago, and we have now read this book at least ten times, either us reading it to him, or him reading it to himself. He can't get enough of it! And we really don't mind reading it. It is brilliantly written and illustrated in graphic novel/picture book form, able to entertain all of us enough for the frequent readings. Written in the style of the old-time, suspenseful action comics (\\"Could this be the end of Caption Raptor?\\") complete with \\"Zap\\" and \\"Ka-boom\\", this book is wildly entertaining and fun for read-aloud time. Captain Raptor, a space dinosaur, is a strong hero figure that the reader loves to root for. Told from the point-of-view of the dinosaurs, who later meet strange aliens (humans), this book is great for teaching perspective, as well as teaching good values - helping one another. I am grateful to O'Malley and O'Brien for creating the dinosaur-science fiction-hero-adventurer-good guy, a brilliant combination that is an obvious hit with many kids. I see there's another Captain Raptor book out there; I plan on buying both and hope this will evolve into a lengthy series so we can enjoy many more Captain Raptor stories. Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated in watercoler and gouache, this book should be a part of every adventure-loving child's library."},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"My son found this book at the library last fall and kept it so long I finally decided to buy our own copy.

We have read it probably 100 times and he has the whole thing memorized! In this day and age when young children are exposed to way too much violence and fighting at a young age, this book provides an exciting adventure without that stuff....noone dies, even though there are \\"weapons\\" there is no violence, there is nothing too scary, and all the \\"dangerous\\" situations get resolved quickly. It's a witty book that is fun to read and has a great twist with the \\"aliens\\" being human. The two species are helpful and kind to each other. We love it. I sure hope Captain Raptor will have another adventure...the ending leaves the possibilities wide open! Well done!"},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"My 3 year old loves dinosaurs and space so this book seemed like a no brainer. However, I was very surprised to see such sophisticated comic book style artwork in a book for children. The writing was cool because it will remind parents of the original Star Trek and that only makes it more fun to mimic the Trek cast and dazzle your child with \\"your\\" ingenuity.At first I read the book in installments, every couple of pages has a cliffhanger like an episode of the live-action Batman series, so that we wouldn't be overwhelmed by the long story before naps. But he quickly caught on that the story would continue if he helped me turn the page. He immediately started requesting the story for almost every nap & bedtime placing this great book in his top 5.Hope to see more from this author & artist!"},{"Title":"Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery","review":"The students at my K-5 school LOVED this book.

Dinosaurs in armour driving 50's style rocket ships, what could be better? The concept seems stupidly funny but still oddly intriguing.

Here, Henry Porter proves that there is rich ore to be mined in the post-Cold War, post-Northern Ireland era. While the \\"Troubles\\" are an essetial part of the plot's background, the story is driven by a set of fascinating characters. In fact, Commander Kenneth Foyle of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Unit is a prime candidate for a series. Wathcing Foyle take hold of the case even against the wishes of his own service and the active enmity of the Security Service is an interesting story in itself as we watch the Security Service implode from its own intrigues and attempts to impede the main investigation into the bombing that killed Lindow's brother and implicated Lindow only because the authorities were protecting themselves from other revalations.Kirsty Lainge of the Security Service is an especially interesting character, although in some ways it did seem obvious what stance she would ultimately take and what the outcome would be for her. The question of Mary's relationship to all this is answered early but the fate of one of the injured bystanders is an interesting twist at the end. In fact, the last line of the book was very appropriate.I look forward to \\"A Spy's Life\\" with an assurance, from reading the reviews, that Henry Porter has not faded much, if at all, from his first effort. \\"Remembrance Day\\" is simply a great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"A good tale, well told. Well-developed characters are set in an intriguing plot, with a nice balance between procedural detail, descriptive material, and suspense.Unfortunately the lack of proof-reading [at least in the US, Simon &amp; Schuster edition] results in innumerable typographical errors, which were extremely distracting and spoilt the reading pleasure.Had the publisher made any effort in this regard, I would have awarded 4 stars.I hope that Mr. Porter will write more books of this ilk, and that he will take note of this deficiency. END"},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"Remembrance Day is a truly remarkable first novel. There is a depth and richness in plot and characterization not often seen in first time writers. The plot is intricate enough to keep readers happily and compulsively turning the pages. However, a problem with the book is the needless repetition of explanations from one character to another. This serves to slow the book down considerably and adds to the already overblown length. Nonetheless, it remains a compelling thriller and an excellent summer read. Larry Gandle Tampa, FL"},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"In this debut novel, Henry Porter provides the grist of more seasoned spy thriller authors: a plausible and twisted plot, a worthy villain, protagonists with real-life depth and flaws, and scenes rich in detail in the Clancy or Ludlum tradition. The self-serving hypocrisy of government agencies becomes the villain's arch angel, as often occurs in real life tragedies such as 9/11. The only thing that prevented a dreadful tragedy in this novel was the tenacity of the detective who was determined to solve the crime on his beat no matter what, a woman's belief in the system she worked for became greater than her personal ambitions, and the victim of police &quot;profiling&quot;-- if your mother is a terrorist, you are automatically a terrorist. A stunning first novel and an absorbing read. Porter joins my growing list of favorite spy thriller writers. I now look forward to reading Porter's next novel, &quot;A Spy's Life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"Impossible to put down once you start. Fast plot, but believable well-rounded interesting characters. Avoids the boring stereotypical tough male hero outwitting the forces of evil. Great read"},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"It's odd to say about a book published only 10 years ago, but the main plot device seems a bit dated. Sadly, IED's and the various methods in which they can be detonated are in the news almost daily. The novel seems to have two main characters- Con Lindow and Commander Foyle, the latter being much more interesting. Foyle's dedication to his duty as he sees it is inspiring, and watching over his shoulder as he races against time to prevent another terrorist attack is thrilling stuff. Con Lindow doesn't seem fully fleshed out as a character. For example, he's injured in a bombing, wrongly imprisoned and interrogated, and then a day later- after learning of his brother's death- he's making eyes at a complete stranger who obviously has an ulterior motive. Lindow seems rather emotionless through all these developments. Oh, and spoiler alert: there is no \\"steamy lovemaking\\" depicted in the novel. Perfunctory, yes. Steamy, no."},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"Irish born molecular biologist Constantine Lindow left Boston for a research job in London. Con waits for his brother near an Underground station when a bomb explodes. Many innocent people die and Con lands unconscious in the hospital. When he regains consciousness, Con realizes the police suspect he set off the bomb, working as an agent of the IRA.REMEMBRANCE DAY is a non-stop thriller that brings terrorism into the twenty-first century with the use of the telephone to set off a bomb. The story line is exciting especially when Con and Kenneth separately work on the investigation. Though some of the subplots add little to the main story line, they too generate much excitement and energy. In his debut tale, Henry Porter freshens up the terrorist thriller with a classy believable chiller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Remembrance Day","review":"Were Remembrance Day simply a thriller I would rate it five stars. It is fast-paced and some neat science is woven into a suspenseful plot. Its deadly pyrotechnics and interesting locales suggest that its targeted market is viewers rather than readers.Its great defect is in its misrepresentation of the Anglo-Irish conflict. It assumes that the reader is fully disinformed by Brit propaganda. In reality, Ireland's 834 years of Brit rule has been one long genocide varying only in its intensity. Liz I, Cromwell and Victoria each murdered more than half of Ireland's population. The author presents ex-IRA-man Lindow as an ex-terrorist. He depicts Lindow's Irish mother as evil to the extent that she is a patriot. As antitoxins to such gross propaganda buy Ten Men Dead or Eye-Witness Bloody Sunday or (Sutton's) Index of Deaths From the Conflict in Ireland. Author Porter is refuted by the official murder record. For example; wwwdotterrorismirelanddotcom shows that, of the 173 child-murders in this post-1969 phase, 20 were by Irish forces; 153 by Brit forces - the actual terrorists."},{"Title":"Simple pleasures: Recipes for gourmet entertaining when you're short of time","review":"Easy to follow recipes,with many handy short-cuts to producing tasty dinners, lunches and even breakfast menu items.

The poetry of Rumi gleams and sparkles with meaning for modern times ... amazing as it was written in the 1240s A.D. The natural imagery used is always surprising. He never fails to capture human emotions and the human condition, using original and sometimes highly provocative but very 'on-target' terms.The subject matter of each poem is varied, although the theme of the book is 'work' ... it really is about much, much more than work. I can not praise the themes of the poems and contents of this book enough. One outstanding poem uses \\"grapes\\" as imagery. Rumi describes for the reader, \\"How It Is with Grapes\\". When they are immature they jostle competetively in the bunch ... after maturing, the grapes soften, the skin rips open and become one juice. Rumi reassures us, it is just the same with humans. We are also told some grapes grow stone-hard but the secret to that sour tightness remains hidden. What is more important is ... that we grow ... with each breath ... through the help of the heart master.Another poetic masterpiece is \\"Die Before You Die\\". We are told about a riddle, that the opener and that which is opened are the same ... Rumi states, \\"The day and the daily bread that comes are not to be worshiped for themselves. ... That it is the ocean inside the fish that bears it along, not the riverwater. ... The time-river spreads and disappears into the ocean with the fish.\\" \\"Be one of G-d's fish who receives what it needs directly from the ocean around it - food, shelter, sleep, medicine.\\" In conclusion, \\"A seed breaks into the ground. Only then does a new fig tree come into being. *That's* *the* *meaning* *of* *die* *before* *you* *die*.\\" This is truly phenomenal poetry that has been tested over time. It is 800 years strong and still filled with enlightenment and human insight into the phenomenon called \\"Life\\".Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Rumi: One-Handed Basket Weaving : Poems on the Theme of Work","review":"A great collection of Rumi's poetry from 7 different translators, some with a very literal, scholarly style of translation and some with a more free-verse style.

Braudel strikes a balance between these approaches, at one time examining the economic point of view (and related theoretical controversies, such as the ideas of Schumpeter on innovation), while searching for historical examples that support or obliterate them. He is a true master scholar.This volume adds to the first, moving from living standards to the establishment and functioning of trading and banking systems, both by capitalists (holders of sufficient resources to manipulate markets) and the merchants and craftsmen who operated within these markets. It is a crucial distinction that demonstrates how simple-minded the ideological argument of &quot;free markets&quot; can be: the rich can and do design economic systems to function to their advantage. You follow the development of international trading networks by Italians, Jews and Armenians; the evolution of banking and the handling of paper money; and even the influence of social hierarchies on economic growth.While Braudel concentrates almost exclusively on Europe in this volume, which lessens the universality of his approach, it is utterly fascinating from page one. The economic systems he analyses were somewhat incomplete, though evolving rapidly. An additional limit to his approach is the exclusive focus on econimic life. At times, he views the building of chateaux and the commission of great works of art from the Reanassance to the 19C as a reflection of the lack of wealth-generating investment opportunities during a time of economic revolution!And that is just a few of the issues covered. Each section of the book is like an essay on some basic economic notion. As such, the book assumes a great deal of historical knowledge in the reader, though Braudel often explains what he refers to briefly. For me, this added to its appeal and density, but it is often hard going. However, the book is leavened by wonderful and fascinating illustrations, which eases the task of getting through it at times.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wheels of Commerce","review":"In The Wheels of Commerce, Fernand Braudel deftly blended history and economics with the result that neither suffers. His goal in this book, the second volume in his Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, was \\"to analyse the machinery of exchange as a whole, from primitive barter up to and including the most sophisticated capitalism\\" (21). In the process of examining this machinery of exchange, Braudel also proposed an ambitious thesis concerning the origins of capitalism. The book itself is a monumental work, an impressive combination of statistical analyses and illustrations from primary sources.Braudel's first two chapters, \\"The Instruments of Exchange\\" and \\"Markets and the Economy,\\" investigated the role of circulation. In chapter one, he concentrated on the mechanisms by which goods (and money) were traded. Braudel explained that markets and shops were at the bottom of the world of commerce. Markets took place once or twice a week, and shops were open everyday. Fairs, the wholesale markets, were on the higher level. Participants traded large amounts of goods and settled their accounts at the end. Braudel pointed out the importance of fairs in the development of capitalism: \\"The fair itself created credit\\" (91). If one merchant had a negative trade balance with another merchant, he would either offer a bill of exchange (a promise of payment on another exchange) or defer payment with interest until another fair. Additionally, these bills of exchange could be sold to a third party if necessary, introducing speculation. The trading mechanisms of the fair were eventually consolidated into the large exchanges of cities like Amsterdam and London, and eventually these exchanges grew into the stock markets. Chapter two investigated the manner in which merchants engaged in trade. Braudel stressed the importance of trading circuits and the use of paper (especially in the form of bills of exchange) for profitability. One of the key ideas in this chapter is the role of distance on price. Price was not set solely by supply and demand, but was also affected by the distance the product had to travel. His insight into system was helpful. \\"Any capitalist market has a series of links in a chain, and somewhere near the middle there is a point higher and more remunerative than the rest\\" (193).The next two chapters, \\"Capitalism Away from Home\\" and \\"Capitalism on Home Ground,\\" dealt primarily with issues regarding production. Chapter three dealt with what could be considered the lower world of production. One of the key issues that Braudel explicated was the role of fixed and circulating capital. The fixed capital that was invested in production was tied up in equipment and other items, while the circulating capital was more liquid and included wages. Braudel also investigated the role of land in production and capitalism, noting: \\"The great landowner was not a capitalist, but he was a tool and a collaborator in the service of capitalism\\" (271). He also focused on the peculiarities of production in these pre-industrial years. In chapter four, Braudel investigated the higher world of production. His explanation of the development of banking practices, which would fund production, was illuminating, as was his discussion on the development of companies from private family business to joint stock companies.Though the book focused on capitalism's development in Europe, Braudel integrated discussions on other geographical locales as well. Braudel did not present Europe as arriving at its capitalist system in a vacuum. He noted the role that other cultures had in aiding the formation of the European model, not just through trade, but also through Europe's adoption of foreign innovation. However, Braudel surprisingly downplayed the importance of double-entry book-keeping to the emergence of capitalism. He asserted that the practice did not spread quickly and was not universally adopted, giving notable examples (574).Even though successful merchants were found all over the world during this time period (especially in Islamic lands that provided them with a favorable status), full-blown capitalism developed first in Europe. Braudel attempted to provide an explanation as to why this was the case. His thesis regarding this matter is the raison d'&#65533;tre of the book. Braudel believed that three conditions were necessary for the emergence of capitalism. The first was a \\"vigorous and expanding market economy\\" (600). Braudel noted that many regions fulfilled this qualification. The second necessity, which hindered many prime candidates, was a strong hierarchy was necessary. This hierarchy encouraged the accumulation of wealth. Landed positions were not hereditary in India, China, and Islamic lands making the nobility's position precarious and the accumulation of wealth difficult. Braudel only mentioned two areas that fulfilled these first two necessities: Europe and Japan. However, Japan closed herself off to world trade, the third necessity. Braudel noted, \\"Long-distance trading ... was the only doorway to a superior profit level\\" (601). Braudel's case is a compelling one that must be addressed by anyone investigating this topic.The Wheels of Commerce is immense, but immensely readable. Braudel portrayed for his reader a heady, exciting Europe, one in which the prime goal was to spend money faster than it could be made. However, even during his descriptions of the dizzying pace at which money was circulated, Braudel did not lose sight of his objective. His scope was large, but he remained precise in both style and purpose, obviating the befuddlement of the layperson (which I confess to being). The book is a balanced work, exhibiting a variety of historical methods. Braudel made extensive use of statistics and mathematical models (the book contains a plethora of charts and tables), but he also included numerous narratives regarding business practices of the time (demonstrating an astonishing knowledge of the primary sources). Because of the attention with which he supported his claims, historians of all stripes can admire this book.Finally, the student of economic history should not overlook one of the finer aspects of The Wheels of Commerce. This book contains over 120 excellent illustrations from the 15th-18th centuries. The pictures, which vary from woodblock prints to oil paintings, depict the lives of those involved in commerce at the time. Not only do the abundant illustrations make this book a more attractive read, but also they provide the book with a certain level of completeness, giving the reader more tools by which he or she can comprehend the emergence of capitalism in Europe"},{"Title":"The Wheels of Commerce","review":"There are various pretenders to the throne of explaining globalization, such as Thomas Friedman's recent The World Is Flat, but all such efforts seem shallow and pallid compared to the masterwork of the genre, Fernamd Braudel's trilogy Civilization & Capitalism, 15th - 18th Century (The Structures of Everyday Life (Volume 1), The Wheels of Commerce (Volume 2)and The Perspective of the World (Volume 3)I do not lightly suggest tackling almost 1,800 pages of reading, but there is simply no substitute (short of a master's degree) if you aspire to a true understanding of global trade's role in the social, political and economic history of our world. It is not a boring read--anything but, for Braudel's depth of research, breadth of knowledge and his appreciation for the limits of current scholarship are matchless. Where authors like Friedman incautiously grind whatever axe they set out, drawing upon work which supports their thesis, Bruadel is ever-cautious about drawing hard-and-fast conclusions from the data he has culled from archives' dusty pages.What Braudel reveals is a world which has been disrupted by far-reaching trade for hundreds of years. Capital has flowed across the great oceans of our globe for far longer than most people realize, destroying local industries in favor of distant ones in the process. It is impossible to summarize such a rich, vast work, but reading even one of these volumes will give you a deep insight into the long history of globalization, and how entire industries and financial centers have been displaced time and again in the Arab Levant, in Asia, and in Europe. You will also come to understand the rise of European economic dominance, and how it cannot be so neatly attributed to guns, steel and germs, as appealing and powerful as Jared Diamond's thesis may be.Braudel does not work to create over-arching explantions so much as present the archival facts he so assiduously assembled. (The books were written in the late 1970s; Braudel died in 1985 at the age of 83.) For example, he shows that prosperity, since at least the 1400s if not earlier, is inevitably found in those cities and regions where prices are highest. It is counter-intuitive at first--since shouldn't money go farther where prices are low?-- but the same is obviously true of our era. The most prosperous nations are those with the highest costs, and the poorest are those where prices are lowest.At a minimum, this sheds light on the centuries-old exodus from rural to metropolis, and on the nature of prosperity itself. I recommend these volumes not just for their vast erudition but for the enjoyment gained from his unparalleled mastery of everyday life in distant lands and distant times. Not much has changed, it seems, except the speed of the ships and the communication between traders."},{"Title":"The Wheels of Commerce","review":"Wow, by far one of the best books that I have ever read. I usually do not like history because I prefer to be more proactive and immersed in today's world. But the clarity on our society's current situation that this book gives by examining the roots of the movement to capitalism is incredible and was so worth my time that I had to take a week's vacation off work in order to make sure that I could focus to read this. The writing conveys only one thing - complete clarity into the world today. It is an incredible opus; I loved it.There is no easy answer to the challenges we humans face in organizing and creating a shared activity to enable the greatest overall productivity and happiness. The evolution of humanity during the early Renaissance years provides the explanation for where and why we are organized in this way today. Understanding this time in this way (through the lens of the economics of that time period) gives a much greater appreciation for the world today that we have constructed. The most core problems of humanity - social mobility, equitable distribution of resources, stability, and collective cooperation, have never (and may never) become solvable. This book explains these dynamics so eloquently that I wish I had time to read it again and again - much like a great adventure novel that as a kid you just wished would never end and felt a real loss once it did and you had to re-emerge into the real world around you.Braudel is phenomenal in his depth of understanding about how society of the 15-18th centuries operated.

Volume two of Civilization and Capitalism really gets the ball rolling. Or as much as anything ever gets rolling in a Braudel book.This is fascinating stuff. But it is not easy going. The language is straight forward, but Braudel wanders around his subject, giving us mountains of specifics and following various side currents to their ends. The basic point of the volume is to outline, first, the difference between the market and capitalism, and then to trace the creation of capitalism in the markets centers of Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries.Unlike many historian of this period, Braudel is more concerned with the world of finance than the world of production, which I find fascinating and innovative. If you care to know how the financiers of Amsterdam dealt with getting a ship in the ocean and bound for America or India, this is the place to look.While not being an economic determinist, economics is at the center Braudel's work. Unlike many other economic historians, Braudel does take the time to deal with how culture (there a section on fashion in the first volume!) religion and other factors play into the shaping of an economic and social system. This makes for a deeply convincing argument when he demolishes Weber's idea of the protestant work ethic, but is less informed or convincing (and sometimes borderline racist) when he is dealing with non-western cultures.I appreciate that Braudel didn't assume that by \\"civilization and capitalism\\" one can only mean Western Europe, but his sections on the rest of the world I found lacking. They did not have the erudition he exhibits when taking about Western Europe.I found the book fascinating, but I think Braudel could have done with some editing. This book is not going to lay out point by point the creation of capitalism for you. You'll need to discover the steps through the examples Braudel gives. It's riveting if you're an econ and history nerd, but complicated and meandering work, which could have used a co-author (or a better team of research assistants) to handle the non western areas he covers and a editor to tease out the string of the creation of capitalism that subtly floats through this work."},{"Title":"The Wheels of Commerce","review":"This was the most interesting, to me, of Braudel's classic three-volume history of the age when vernacular culture first faced off against the predecessors of industrial culture.

The second volume deals with the market economy, while the first volume, &iexcl;Structures of Everyday Life&iexcl; takes on infra-economy or material civilization. As I said on the review of the first volume, in the pre-industrialized societies, the market system is not the only form of resource allocation. The material civilization is the first layer of economy on the bottom, the market system is the second layer located above the first layer. The exchange or commerce was not natural economy but artificial economy in the jargon of the 18th C economics: Market is premised on the separation of production and consumption. Such a division is not natural, but is developed over long time. In this vein, the market is not natural at all. The market is the point in which material life and economic life meet each other. The market is the network. It links region to region, national economy to national economy. The form and scope of market has been evolved over time. When we track the forms of market, we could paint the history of capitalism. Nonetheless, Capitalism is often regarded as synonymous to market economy. But market is not unique to capitalism. But it goes without saying that capitalism can&iexcl;t exist without market. All economic activities under capitalism are carried out on the market. Changes in the form of market signals the changes of capitalism. When, for example, we talk about globalization, we have in mind the change of market based on national economy to global market. The second volume is about the topology of market. Based on the scope of space the market serves, we could trace out the path of capitalism since the 15th C. But market is not capitalism. To understand this point, you&iexcl;d better check the third volume, &iexcl;The Perspective of the World&iexcl;."},{"Title":"After dark: A novel","review":"This is a collection of stories held together by a central narrative (think Canterbury Tales) But don't bother downloading this free book.

Inevitably, if a Modern Library hardback version of some book that I want exists, I'll end up buying it. I really don't know why. Anyway, case and point: Edgar Allan Poe.The benefits of this edition are evident:a) All the short stories--yes, even the uproariously funny ones that most paperbacks leave out, as well as Poe's bizarre \\"hoaxes\\" and inexplicably contrived \\"articles\\" that don't really pass very well as storiesb) All the poems--including poetry written in childhood as well as posthumously discoveredc) ...and a couple of essays--most importantly, \\"The Rationale of Verse.\\"However, the book still lacks most of Poe's criticism and other essays. I suggest you purchase Dover's little paperback _Edgar Allan Poe: Literary Theory and Criticism_ (kind of a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection of Poe's critical work which, in reality, spans over 1500 pages) to complete your library. There you will find the great classic \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\" accompanied by dozens of ingenius (and at times ascerbic) reviews of books you may know from elsewhere. It's an invaluable resource.Moreover, the same Modern Library problems afflict this edition--thus, herein lies another reason I cannot explain why I must keep on buying and reading Modern Library hardbacks:A) There is no textual or intertextual editing, nor are there any critical footnotes. Moreover, there is no critical introduction by a Poe scholar. This bytes.B) There is no margin room. There never is in a Modern Library hardback. This gets really annoying when you're reading \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" and you're trying to tie together pieces of evidence (all part of Poe's perfect conceived \\"totality\\" of content) to form a of cohesive, critical interpretation of the story with about a centimeter of margin room in which to write! Your handwriting will quickly show itself illegible, and your hand mercilessly cramped.C) Modern Library hardbacks are customarily printed on cheap (although smooth and aesthetically pleasing) paper. Thus, when you write in your book, the ink is very likely to bleed over onto the converse page. Also quite annoying.However, however, however--I must not forget that the goal of Modern Library is not to print the best book possible, but the best _affordable_ book possible. And at $18.00, this 1000 page hardback is hard to beat.So, if you have the money, do actually buy _the best_ edition: the Library of America edition. ISBN 0940450186. It's over 1400 pages, is printed on paper that will last forever, and is edited by a prominent Poe scholar--but it's almost $40.00!But, more importantly for those of us on budgets: This edition is in direct competition with both the DoubleDay and Castle editions of Poe's collected stories and poems. Under no circumstances would I recommend the other two editions due to their typesettings. I know that may sound ridiculous, but a humane typesetting has a lot to do with the pleasure and utility that a book can and will proffer its reader. The print on the other two editions is inordinately overloaded (too much packed on each page) and serves to burden the eyes. For sooth, the Modern Library version is packed too--but it's a huge improvement on the other two editions.If you've got $40, get the Library of America edition.

Poe's work has had enormous worldwide influence: French poet Charles Baudelaire was an early champion and translator, Poe's 'William Wilson' (1839) haunts the pages of Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' (1890), and several stories look presciently ahead to work of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.'The Collected Tales and Poems of Edgar Allen Poe' (1992), which also includes humorous pieces ('The Devil in the Belfry' is a hilarious tribute to the father of American literature, Washington Irving), detective fiction (Irving's 1838 story-cycle 'The Money-Diggers' stirs fluidly beneath 'The Gold Bug'), and early examples of what would come to be known as science fiction, brings together most of the author's important work.Two general narrator (or protagonist/character) types emerge. The first is meticulously rational, calm, and 'objective'--like Dupin, the amateur sleuth who coolly solves the mystery of 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue.' The second, best represented by Roderick Usher in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,' is psychically haunted, deeply subjective, acutely sensitive in every pore, and barely able to repress the hysteria--at best--simmering just beneath the surface of his consciousness.Both general types are isolated and obsessive in their own way--the first perhaps imagines he has found salvation by holding the world at a kind of hard cerebral remove, while the second surrenders his will in increments and sinks obliquely into emotional, spiritual, psychic, and physical fragmentation. The second type (found in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,' 'Berenice,' 'The Black Cat,' 'The Pit and the Pendulum,' and 'William Wilson,' among others) dominates and defines Poe's work.Poe occasionally offers readers a combination of both types, as in 'The Imp of the Perverse,' in which the narrator, after a lengthy, meditative, and 'objective' discourse on the self-destructive aspects of human nature, briefly tells his own story: compelled to commit a pointless murder, he then finds himself equally compelled to publicly confess it.Fatalism and perdition are key characteristics of the author's work: death may await everyone, but, in Poe, death impatiently reaches forward into men's lives, sickening, exhausting, and corrupting them, thus hastening fragile humanity's end. Poe's protagonists are once healthy, now dire, everymen surrounded on every side by hostile, malevolent, and destructive forces which dominate every plateau, division, and category of existence that man has methodically--and rather naively--mapped out. Human instinct proves to be 'red in tooth and claw'; the senses betray; the mind collapses; the borders and boundaries of civilization are violently breached; the natural world reveals a harsh, predatory, and incomprehensible face; physical laws prove unreliable; loving relationships sicken and fester; all agents of stability prove false and slip away.Most of Poe's work suggests that there is no escape for anyone (--\\"dead to the World, to Heaven, and to Hope!\\"), and, as several of the tales underscore, including 'The Fall of the House of Usher' and 'Ms. Found in a Bottle,' even the cessation of life may bring no solace for some. However, reprieves are possible: the narrator barbarically tortured by the Spanish Inquisition is freed by the arriving French army at the conclusion of 'The Pit and the Pendulum,' the sailor who experiences 'A Descent Into the Maelstrom' survives to tell of his ordeal, and the vengeful dwarves in 'Hop Frog' apparently escape at that story's conclusion.Remarkably, because of the skill with which he illustrates his view of man's utter lack of genuine choice or ability for self-determination, Poe manages to make most of his characters likeably human, despite their illnesses, eccentricities, and perversions. Though the tales team with toxic bloodlines, incestuous relationships, premature burials, rioting lunatics, marauding plagues, 'tormenting' doppelgangers, parasitic spirits of the dead, animated corpses, \\"ghoul-haunted woodlands,\\" and a fair variety of additional supernatural tableaus, Poe remains is a remarkably rational, balanced, and economic storyteller, since the ultimate horror lies not in the external threat, but in the narrator's realization that what he is experiencing is the genuine nature of life itself.Poe's tales suggest that, if all of mankind lives within a perpetually collapsing, cannibalizing universe, the most one can hope for is that, in the present, it is collapsing on someone else."},{"Title":"The Collected Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (Modern Library)","review":"This book is another release from the \\"Leather Bound Series\\" of books by Borders Group,Inc(aka Borders).

Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing."},{"Title":"The Collected Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (Modern Library)","review":"Beautiful.

Packed well for shipment. just as advertised.Very convenient and good communications."},{"Title":"The Collected Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe (Modern Library)","review":"All of Poe's work is in this volume. Until reading this from cover to cover, I was under the assumption that Poe's work consisted mainly of poetry. I was suprised to see that the vast majority of his writing is in the form of short stories. Each is quite unique, with clever, twisting endings. I particularly enjoyed the one novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. Not the greatest piece, but interesting and well told. You will note that Poe's ship reaches Earth's equator at exactly midway through the novel. Poe thinks of these things, tiny little quirks. Hardback, well structured.

For whatever reason, this book truly clicked. The scientific basis offered for what we generally think of as magical thinking concretized and elucidated this topic like no other discourse I've read. I was skeptical, thinking that Chopra must be yet another silver-tongued snake oil salesman. Having read this book, I think he's the genuine article, the real deal, and a wise teacher.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This book has some great explanatory material about the quantum physics behind intention, as well as chapters going into the detail of meditation, mantras and sutras. I also found some of the personal stories about Deepak very interesting and revealing of himself.These are some key learnings for me:- We are energy fields and when we interact with other people, other energy fields, they merge and separate leaving parts with each other. This explains how we can be so affected by other people's energy and encourages separation from them.- The soul is part of the non-local consciousness which is the everlasting, eternal part. This is the part we can touch in meditation, and where we should seek to spend more time. In meditation, we can transcend ego and reach the space in between thoughts. ( I have only just started to find this space after 6 months of meditation, but I can see it coming!)- Synchronicity is messages from the Universe directing us and helping us towards the goal for our life. Sometimes we may focus our attention on what ego wants, and therefore not attract this. We should focus instead on our purpose in life, and synchronicity will show us the way.I enjoyed the book, and suspect it will also improve on second reading."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I LOVE this book! I have read it three times, and each time I learn something more. Deepak gives tons of information based on quantum physics to help teach you how to fulfill your most powerful life desires. It really does work. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys reading books with a slant towards \\"getting what you want\\", \\"law of attraction\\" types and \\"new age\\" or spiritual type self help books.This book deals specifically with \\"coincidence\\", describing how many people don't realize there are reasons behind these synchronistic experiences. This book informs you how these events are not JUST coincidence, and how there are ways to fulfill your desires and create the life you want by paying attention and acting on them.The writing is an easy comfortable read, is very much in-depth and there are suggested exercises for those who like to put action to what they read.---*** THE BOTTOM LINE ***---This is a must buy. I have read only four of this author's many books, but this is my favorite by far. I have re-read it many times.This book is very in-depth and is just as applicable for a \\"newbie\\" to this genre or someone who has \\"read them all\\".You will not be disappointed in any way if you get this book."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"If Chopra sounds a little older and not as upbeat on this audio book than on his first few, you can hopefully get past it as I did and enjoy this. Perhaps it's mellowing and enlightenment. The first half is a little heavy, delving further into the molecular science that he's touched on in the past; but the latter, more practical part is worth the wait. And, to his credit, he does occassionally remind you not to worry if a concept seems a little dense at first. He certainly makes a strong case--citing examples from nature, such as birds in flight changing direction of a single mind--for the synchronicity to which we all have access. The power and daily accessibility and practicality of the mantra and sutras to which he introduces you will hopefully make it as invaluable to you as it has been to me. Great explanation of the differences between mantras and sutras (at least to my beginner's brain) and great exercises."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"While it goes without saying that it's unlikely that a person could achieve enlightenment through a single book, I think this work is an excellent introduction to manifesting your desires through Unity Consciousness. This book has good, practical advice on Meditation, the use of Mantras and Sutras, and the utilization of the Vedic spiritual tradition as a mean of becoming aligned with universal intention. I have yet to find a book that gives an understandable account of the link between Quantum Physics and manifestation of personal desires. This book makes a good effort and is interesting, but I remain, sadly unenlightened. Maybe it's more about the journey than the destination."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I love the optimism that this book convincingly emanates. I enjoyed the explanations on consciousness with scientific affirmation for these experiences. I am relatively well read on this subject matter but still found some new perspectives however I am not sure how easy this all is to grasp in general. Chopra does make it more tangible in the second half of this book by providing meditations including ancient Sanskrit Sutras, or Mantra's with meaning, that have been reverberating since veritably the beginning of time, that we can practice some or all of.Most importantly, the message presented in this book is essential to our creating shared happiness and peace in this world which somewhere behind the wall of delusion, self-centeredness and materialism, is our true shared goal. That is, we need to realize our connective-ness in this world, the universal energy, power, consciousness, Spirit, God, whatever name we call it, which connects us to each other and to all living things (including the fewer and fewer trees left that we've not cut down!) This is not about religion; to deny the Spirit because of our disillusionment with religion is also a falsehood.Each of us needs to actively focus our attention and intentions on the greater good to bring about positive change; change happens one person at a time. If you feel lonely or depressed please realize that the solutions we seek are not found in material goods, legal or illegal drugs or the bottle; we create solutions when we center our attention and intentions on the greater flow of the universe. Mere words are not enough to describe this important message; read this book and the ones recommended by other reviewers until you understand the message and then live it!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This book really got me thinking. Highly philosophical as well as elegant, Dr. Chopra puts into words something really hard to explain... the soul, spirit and mind. Really loved the chapters on local and non-local intelligence.

Dr. Chopra has a way of expressing himself that is truly heaven-sent. His sentiments, his phrasings, the hope in his teachings -- they all combine to bring us so many blessings. Here's one example: \\"When you live your life with an appreciation of coincidences and their meanings, you connect with the underlying field of infinite possibilites. This is when the magic begins.\\" True, and well put. Dr. Chopra's comments on \\"mind, matter, and spirit\\" and his advice about synchronizing all three are well worth the price of the book alone. In almost every paragraph, hope in the form of appreciation for what it means to be a creator in human form leaps off the page. There are a few passages about how the \\"ego blocks synchronicity,\\" and I disagreed with those. Teachings about the ego, currently popular, and originating in revered \\"Course in Miracles\\" texts, may be structurally correct but they are misleading. Rather than lead people directly to love, they seem to encourage a detour onto a side road of self-hatred. The door to love opens easily when appreciation is present. Seeing the ego (or any other part of the human makeup) as a culprit which is blocking synchronicity (or anything else) produces the opposite effect. Nonetheless, even with the currently popular teachings on the ego included, Dr. Chopra's book is a tour de force.

These tapes were listened to so many times that I just about wore the tapes out. So I ordered this CD set The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire\\", and I was even more impressed.

I have the audio book for it and also got the book to reference. It helps us see how we can harness energy to help us accomplish many things that we want. The more I look into this the more I see it happening in my life. Some people can say it is just coincidence but whether it is just that or luck or fulfillment of my prayers, I feel that I can trust myself and the universe more to help me through things that come up. By trying to not over-react when things don't go my way, I find that usually something even better comes along. I am Christian and believe in God. My true take on it is that I trust in the Lord to help guide me when I ask for his help. Many times, the answer is not what I really wanted, but in the end, I am always better off.Whether this is related or not, my husband surprised me with a creative studio for me to write, paint, meditate, relax, read and be creative in. It was a total surprise, he had told me he was turning an empty room into a game room and he didn't want my help. He put a lock on the door and three months later when he opened the door, I expected to see a pool table or ping pong table. Instead, it was like being on Extreme Home Makeover. He created a truly wonderful retreat for me. On the wall when I first walked in he put in 12\\" black Capital letters the word IMAGINATION. My name is GINA and it was in gold letters. I have had it now for close to 2 years and I still feel the love and excitement that I felt the first day.One day I was just sitting reading and I realized that this was the room that I had imagined as a kid. We had a 2 story colonial with 4 bedrooms. Some had another bedroom over the garage and ours did not. I pretended that I had an imaginary room over the garage that I could go to and be creative to sew and pretend to be a teacher and paint and do all the fun things a grade schooler might dream about. I never told anyone about that imaginary room. Not even my parents or friends or my husband. But there I was sitting in it 30+ years later.Coincidence? I think there is so much more going on around us in our live and if we can tap into it, we can have a great life."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I have the unabridged audiobook. It starts off slow, with about 2 out of the 6 CDs talking about quantum energy. It looks like Chopra wants to \\"convert you\\" to this concept. In my opinion, if you bought this book, you don't need all those lenghty explanations, because you know/agree with most of it. After that, by CD number 3, things get hot: he is reading sutras, commenting on them and reminding essential concepts like, without mastering your emotions, spiritual growth is not possible. This is very important.My favorite sutra is \\"Moksha- I am emotionally free\\", but you will benefit from each one , depending where you are on your path.Then he talks a little bit about a spiritual practice involving archetypes.This is a little tricky because, if you don't know a lot about archetypes, it may not be all that rewarding. That made me, for example, start looking about some serious written work on archetypes, which is not easy (I stumbled on Carolyn Myss- big mistake-but now I started from scratch with Carl Jung, a classic in the area).Anyway, he ends his book with saying that we are ultimately \\"fields of intelligence\\" which is obviously true.His book is very encouraging for those who are on a spiritual path, to stay on it and progress, since so many easy techniques are provided. Even if you are not aware of being on a spiritual path, this book may help you realize it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"\\"Through synchrodestiny, you can finally become the person the universe intended you to be--as powerful as desire, as creative as spirit.

I loved it! So I was really happy that I could have this book to read over and over again. And for anyone who likes the book, I recommend that you take the class, it is phenomenal!There are so many things that I like about this book. Perhaps the most valuable for me is in learning to recognize life's little signals - those messages that show us we're headed in the right direction. It's about awareness, and recognizing that these are not random coincidences, but signposts we should stop and look at.This book, and &quot;The 7 Spiritual Laws of Success&quot; are two books that I will always keep and refer to often. Thanks, Deepak, for sharing your profound wisdom with us once again!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"In his latest book, Deepak Chopra tells us to be conscious of the messages that we receive from the universe. I did not find a lot of new information here, but enjoyed the method of presentation immensely, so I recommend it. I also recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, a superlative universal book to accept and let go of what is out of our control and OPTIMIZE what is in our control and create our best life. I also recommend The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People which gives you a solid path to effectiveness and to get along with others."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Each of us is immersed in a network of coincidences. We are synchronized with one another through a conspiracy of coincidences. This synchrony is choreographed by a great pervasive intelligence that lies at the heart of nature. We discover that by applying attention and intention to these coincidences, we can create specific outcomes in our lives. We consciously shape our destinies moving closer to enlightenment. This is the miracle of Synchrodestiny.The universe is an on-off phenomenon. The continuity and solidity of the world exists only in the imagination. In reality, we are all flickering in and out of existence all the time. The sensory experience of al living beings is a purely artificial construct created in the imagination. There is a Zen story in which two monks are looking nat a flag that is weaving in the wind. The first one says, \\"The flag is weaving.\\" The second one says, \\"No, the wind is weaving.\\" Their teacher comes over and they pose him the question. The teacher says, \\"You both are wrong. Only consciousness is moving.\\" As consciousness moves, it imagines the world into existence.Without consciousness acting as an observer and interpreter, every thing would exist only as pure potential. That pure potential is the Virtual domain, the third level of existence. The first two levels are the Physical domain and the Quantum domain. It is nonlocal and cannot be depleted. It is unending and all-encompassing. Tapping into that potential is what allows us to make miracles.There's a deeper level of reality,\\" says Chopra. Science calls it quantum reality. Quantum in physics defines the smallest indivisible unit of information and energy. So a quantum of light is a photon, a quantum of gravity is a graviton. Our thoughts are also units of information and energy. When energy has a pattern, it becomes information.\\" To improve on Einstein, \\"energy and matter and information are interchangeable.\\" In the quantum world we are inseparable, interconnected. Gautam Buddha said: \\"We are inter-beings that inter-arise in the inter-isness.\\" We had known for thousands of years that at another level, the quantum level, we are inseparably connected. We are fields of energy and information in the universe of energy and information, where everything is happening at the speed of light.When our body cells are caught in the same field of resonance, they are all dancing to the same music. Stomach cells are making hydrochloric acid, immune cells are generating antibodies, the pancreatic cells are manufacturing insulin, and so on. Biochemically, certain changes in our body correspond to the movement of our planet. All of nature is a symphony, and we are part of it. We are all patterns of nonlocality pretending to be people. In the end, it is all spirit.Considering our physical bodies, we are really, a collection of recycled molecules. We are constantly remaking, regenerating ourselves. Our emotions are just recycled energy. They come and go depending on situations, circumstances, relationships and events. Our thoughts are recycled information. Every thought we have is actually part of a collective database.We can never understand the how, where, and when of anything, even something as simple as boiling water. We have to surrender to uncertainty, while appreciating its intricate beauty. What we call personality is built on a foundation of relationships and situations.Meditation happens. Sleep happens. It is the same with intention. Intent is a seed in conscious-ness, or spirit. Intention's infinite organizing power orchestrates countless details simultaneously. We, as human beings, are capable of creating positive changes in our lives through intent. So, why do we lose that ability? The ability is lost when the self-image overshadows the self, when we sacrifice our true self for the ego.Usually we see only cause-and-effect relationships - linear trajectories. Yet, beneath the surface, something else is happening. Invisible to us is a whole web of connections. Intentions are woven into this web, which is much more context-bound, much more relational, much more holistic, much more nurturing than our surface experience.Consciousness orchestrates its activity in response to both attention and intention. Attention activates the energy field and intention activates the information field, which causes transformation.This wonderful book, the New York Times Bestseller will change some skeptics who think that Deepak Chopra is yet another silver-tongued snake oil salesman. Chopra uses his verbal gifts to bring ancient East Indian teachings to a 21st-century audience.He clarifies many scientific proposals and theories - Minkowski's Eight dimen-sional hyperspace in pp 50.On pp 49 ff., Deepak illustrates beautifully the fantastic, fabulous and mind boggling experiment of physicists - a charged, unobserved beryllium atom was capable of being in two separate locations at the same time! It is the observation alone that turns possibility into reality.On pp 52 ff., he describes the Einstein-Podolsky Rosen Paradox which proves that nonlocal communication or connection is a reality.On pp 99 ff., he illustrates nicely how in the universal \\"I\\", everything is not only possible, it already exists, and simply requires intent to collapse into a reality in the physical world.Part II deals extensively with meditation, mantras and seven principles of Synchrodestiny.This is one book which I would like to take with me when I shuffle off my mortal coils and leave for another world"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I have not only read this book twice, I have listened to the audio-book version more times than I can count. This is one of Deepak's best works yet - and every time I listen to it I learn something new that I had not picked up earlier. It really is a wonderful work that in a way brings together Deepak's many years of study and practice in the world of mind-body connection. It starts with a review of the foundation of his philosophy, which is the quantum world - it updates and expounds on his prior works on this subject with the most recent discoveries and findings by the worlds leading physicists. He explains the interaction of the human conciousness with the quantum world in a way that is very understandable for the average person. From there he takes the reader into meditation techniques, architypes, and sutras, that lift one's understanding of expanded conciousness to new levels, and then goes into how to use these practices to accomplish wonderful things with your life. This book prompted my wife and I to attend one of his lectures, which expounded on both this book, and his most recent work \\"The Book of Secrets\\". Even though it is based in eastern philosophy, in general the work is religion-neutral, that is to say that it can be applied to anyone's religious convictions. All I can say is that we have found both books to be life changing."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Deepak Chopra reviews the evidence that confirms we are all linked together in a web of consciousness. Going well beyond this basic fact, he weaves a marvelous thesis suggesting that there are no coincidences. Every single event is pregnant with meaning. The challenge is to open ourselves to become aware of the invitations in what appear to be coincidences - to waken to our participation in the web of ongoing creation.The more we are in the flow of the universe, the more often and the more profoundly our inner desires and wishes can manifest into outer realities. This is not to say that our every whim will be granted to us.This reviewer was concerned at first that Chopra's suggestions could be misinterpreted by readers as an invitation to activating the powers of manifestation for selfish desires. Chopra quickly dissipated that concern.Chopra presents a helpful series of exercises with each chapter, inviting readers to journey into experiential understandings of synchrodestiny. These include centering, meditation, clearing oneself of negativity that can lead to projections on others, and moving into deeper spiritual awarenesses.This engaging book is warmly recommended for seekers on the path of spiritual awareness and healing ways of contributing to a world that is sorely in need of healing."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"If one is familiar with Chopra's former works, one is likely to have come across some discussion of the ideas discussed in the book.Essentially, this piece speaks of the importance of clearly focusing the mind on an intention/desire (NB: writing down one's intention, goal, etc. is crucial), releasing the desire to the natural laws of the cosmos, then awaiting the arrival of coincidences as an indication of the unfolding of one's desires.Chapters 1, 4,5, 9 and 11 are particularly intriguing and interesting. I rate the book 4 stars (instead of 5) because I found some chapters (the aforementioned ones) more useful than others. The other books I have read by the author have been extremely useful from cover to cover. Having said that however, it may well be the case that after applying some of the knowledge from the chapters I found the most relevant, I may well realize that other portions of the book are of equal usefulness--such is what can occur through growth and development. I would recommend this book for the \\"scientifically spiritual\\" individual."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This is the first work of Deepak Chopra I have been exposed to and I completely enjoyed it. It helped me deal with some personal issues with myself, my relationship with others, and my understanding of the universe on the spiritual and scientific level.Deepak Chopra explains everything in a way so anybody can understand it. If you are at a crossroads in your life, trying to deepen your understanding of how people and energies interact, or just curious on how life's energy affects us all, this unabridged recording is ideal.I would have rated it a 10, but the stars only go up to five."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This is one of my most dog-earred books. Long before the so-called-secret came around, Dr. DeePak Chopra was writing about the science of vibrational levels, about the frequency of objects, about the power of thought and meditation. For many decades Dr. Chopra has lived the life, walked the talk and written the volumes from the most acceptable viewpoint of a scientist. He seems to be ahead of his times with a large portion of the planet certainly coming to the same focus. This book truly is an act of courage and an act of love. The reader will ponder life from a wonderfully fresh perspective, and will soon realize there is no such thing as coincidence. Coincidence is but a mirror we draw to us through our individual frequencies of the law of attraction. This book deserves far more stars than 5!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This is for the audio version. Chopra shows new ways of thinking to help us down our path of enlightenment. His thoughts are wise, in line with other masters yet with a new perspective, doable. In this audio book he has practical and interesting excercises to help you realize many of the perscriptions he reccomends. It is a bit frustrating to rewind on the iPod to get to the correct section to do each excercise but worth it since his voice aides in acheiving the meditative outlook he often suggests. As a listening expereince, he reads his book with clarity, interest and emotion - very well done and very enjoyable. Overall this was an excellent experience."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I loved this book and when I finished reading it, I was so astounded at the number of coincidences occuring in my life that I realized were actually messages.

I hightly recommend the book to anyone who feels that they have lost their connection to the universe."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Deepak Chapra's series of books is possible one of the most beneficial series of books in regards to increasing your spiritual awareness that has ever existed. Every word he has ever written seems to be geared towards improving other people's lives, and this is yet another world class book from the man himself.The knowledge in this book focuses on the idea that coincidences aren't merely coincidences, but they are in fact signs from the universal spirit that is telling you that you're on the right path. There is a ton of scientific information in this book as well which Chopra ties into his theories nicely. He relates the human mind to quantum physics and while it seems to intense to understand, he simplifies it to make it easily understood.His big concept in this book is Synchrodensity. A beautiful concept which allows your subconscious give you answers to your biggest questions in life. You pose the questions from your everyday mind then allow your consciousness take over and do the answering. It takes a little discipline and some practice but boy does it start producing.On top of all this, Chopra's writing style is flawless and makes reading a breeze. His elegance with words makes you want to understand everything he says so you can begin to think with the beauty that he thinks with. If you haven't ever been blessed by the grace of his writing get this book and enlighten yourself."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"This is one life changing book!

As soon as I finished reading it, I flipped back to page one and read it again! This second time I took notes. The only part I did not care much for was the chapter on Archetypes. If all desire springs from the virtual (nonlocal) domain, why would we need to conjure up \\"heroes\\" for spiritual guidance (Robert Downey Junior)? Relying on the ego and the personal \\"I\\" for guidance seems contrary to his teachings, but maybe I missed something."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Deepka Chopra wrote the book long before Rhonda Byrne's wrote \\"The Secret.\\"I admire Chopra's belief that if we go with the flow of the Universe and listen and look for clues that appear all around us, we will have a happier and more fulfilled life. However, he doesn't claim that if you visualize getting a diamond necklace, you will get one. \\"The Secret\\" is hogwash."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I cannot begin to say how much I enjoyed this book. I will most likely be reading it many more times. I really like the way Deepak writes by simply presenting very complex concepts. I think this book explains life and our existence in a beautiful way.

I see this book as a reference to remind us about what our purpose in life really is.Beautifully written. I highly recommend Deepak's books as a present to a family or a close friend, or just about anyone who's had it rough and needs encouragement. I truly appreciate his writing and hope everyone else will too.. Thanks Deepak!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I bought this book and put the meditations into practice almost 3 years ago.

I don't know."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"In my continuing quest to unearth the best authors who impact the mind, body and spirit, Deepak Chopra has become a favorite. I received the CD set of The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire some time ago and zipped through all five CDs. I remember telling a friend that the CDs seem like Deepak is speaking Farsi (the national language of India, his home country). A few weeks ago I continued listening to the CDs and all of a sudden, ILLUMINATION! I can actually understand the powerful messages from the author, WOW!As you focus, Chopra's message to the listener is consistent: Pay attention to the signals in your life to manifest your true destiny. The author provides basic guided meditations, unique prayers and stories interwoven into his narrative to inspire the listener to look within for all answers, for this is where GOD dwells.This five-CD set requires acute attention, interaction, intention and action to reap the most benefits. Much work is required and the benefits gained will be immeasurable.

If so, this book is for you. In The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence by Deepak Chopra, he breaks it down to understand the interconnectivenss of our universe.Dr. Chopra comes from a medical scientific background but he merges that thought with spirituality and faith. As he notes this book was written \\"to guide you to a way of seeing the profound truth that lies behind the illusion of everyday life, and by doing so to discover your true destiny- and how to shape it.\\"In a conversational style of writing, you venture into from the quantum level and beyond into the nonlocal reality."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I saw this book about 7 years ago on a bookshelf and liked the title. I had never heard of Deepak Chopra and knew nothing of him before reading the book. I really enjoyed the book the first time I read it. I recently decided to re-read it, look at my archetypes and follow the 7-day meditation and contemplations in the second half of the book. It is so incredibly positive and positively influential in my daily outlook and experience of things. I love this book, and highly recommend it.The first time I read this book I had been doing yoga for a few years. I don't think I recognized how much the book interleaves yogic concepts at the time. Now 7 years later, I have a much deeper yoga practice and study of yoga, and I am astounded at how many yogic concepts are in the book. I suppose sure this is part of my own experience of synchrodestiny. So if you have any inkling toward yoga, you will probably enjoy this book even though it is not specifically written about yoga. :-)"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Great CD's!!All of the information needed to take you to the next level of spirituality."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I agree (now) with the editorial review, but I had to see for myself, since I am a Chopra fan. Editor said &quot;Although Chopra's theories are expressed in a confusing and repetitive manner, the techniques he advocates may prove interesting to those who enjoy his humanistic, if convoluted, approach to self-help.&quot; Yep.There are better books on the market, including one I just finished from a NDE survivor who educates without the confusion, and theres two chapters on technique that humans can understand! Psychic Gifts in the Christian life by Tiffany Snow. Other books you should look at is the (not kidding) &quot;Idiot&quot; series, which lay a good foundation for several disciplines, like &quot;Meditation for Idiots&quot; or &quot;Psychic Awareness for Idiots,&quot; etc. The Power of Coincidence is a bit flat.You expect an author to generate a shift in consciousness, and excitment and method of beneficial change. This book didn't do it. I hope his next one is better. I see him on TV, etc, and I know he's getting better at marketing, but what about the writing? Maybe he's just too busy now for us regular people. Where is the old Chopra I knew?

In this book he gives you more ways to look at your life and how your can enrich it."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"In any systematic book (and Chopra does attempt to describe a system of synchronicity), you expect an author to employ a powerful set of concepts (a), use them in delightfully unexpected ways (b), to really reveal a world that is not only fantastic (c), but _applies well_ to your everyday life, causing a shift in perspective (d).Addressing these general points:(a) The concepts used in this book are not powerful.(b) These concepts are in fact well-worn, and pretty much cliche, as are their connections to each other: &quot;Soul&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;archetype&quot;, &quot;coincidence&quot;, etc(c) The world of &quot;synchrodestiny&quot; does not exist to the degree that the author describes... Even after faithfully executing the (very pleasant) exercises, I exist still as I have... in a simply nice, meditative life, but one which does not endure, nor surprise.(d) We'll just see. I still continue to reside in the normal world, which is wonderful and miraculous in itself... but I have to strive really hard to remember Mr. Chopra's points as I live within the minutes of my day... his practices just aren't resonant enough.Mr. Chopra simply oversells.I have a feeling that Mr. Chopra has spent so much time &quot;in his head&quot; on his proprietary notion of &quot;synchrodestiny&quot;, that he really doesn't understand how to relate it to a real person. He instead writes for one of his &quot;average readers&quot;, someone who has (1) retired from work (or never had to work, better said), and (2) has not read a serious book in their lifetime. We know who these people are.A real shame, too, especially for such a diverse mind. Unfortunately, he has little to say to those _with_ minds. I sense that Chopra was reluctant to even include a half-serious examination of 'nonlocality', the only concept that was unfamiliar, novel, and potent. He reigned in even that topic, and left this reader completely unsatisfied.If you want to run a seminar on the topic of... of what? 'spirituality' I guess... I suppose this book, read outloud, may generate the applause you're looking for. Beyond that, it's simply an interesting amalgam of old Hindu spirituality, semi-serious physics, dubious case studies, and vague modern generalities.The -true- world of coincidence is obviously beyond our current spiritual comprehension... it's certainly beyond the abilities of Mr. Chopra, at least in the book he has presented as his 'statement' on the topic.I'm sorry to have to be so harsh, but I expected more from a great mind (and I still do). You will read the first half of this book, then you will skim the second half, and within six weeks the entire essence will be a memory.Maybe Deepak Chopra will awaken one day, and begin work on a book that will endure beyond his next slate of seminars."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"very efficient seller- very happy with the condition- was just like it was posted- and very happy with the book! will purchase from seller again! Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"Chopra's success follows his expert use of \\"market-formula\\" writing. His market consists of readers who are (a) unacquainted with the mathematics of probability, and (b) easily led into unsupported assertions and nonsequitors. Note this publisher's promo comment from the back cover: \\"You think of someone you haven't seen for awhile, then the phone rings and there he or she is.\\" His fans are impressed by such observations, not understanding that since people very often think of individuals they haven't seen, once in awhile one may then call. This is well known in science as confusing sequence of events with cause and effect.Now note another publisher's promo comment: \\"You come up with a creative solution, to a life-challenging problem, then your best friend has exactly the same idea at exactly the same time.\\" The gullible reader, instead of recognizing that often best friends are best friends because of similar interests and thinking, leading to similar ideas and timing, this gullible reader allows Chopra to hang a mysterious meaning into this nonmysterious phenomenon.While honest and competent investigators world-wide question the existence of \\"soul,\\" Chopra simplistically brushes aside their honest inquiries, asserting an old-saw vedic claim that the honest and competent have been aware of for centuries, but that hasn't answered their honest investigations. Chopra glibly asserts the existence of his brand of soul, blithely telling us (p. 76): \\"Once we define the soul as ..., becomes remarkably clear.\\" Well, of course. Once one tosses out a definition of something nonconfirmable, something else one then writes that's consistent with that definition seems clear. This clarity of consistency between definition and assertions is perceived by the gullible as \\"truth\\" -- a process that has been used throughout history to define and assert all the thousands of conflicting, contradictory \\"truths\\" that float around the world.But Chopra also includes valuable and valid teachings, such as pp.199 ff. where he presents, \\"Your Inner Dialogue.\\" He is correct, and it is demonstrably true, that a person's internal self-talk is very important in molding attitudes and direction. And, in pp. 219 ff., Chopra presents, Harness Your Emotional Turbulence. This is also excellent material, which, ironically, is made more acceptable to his readers because his soul-teachings and supporting mythology are precisely concepts that help his readers to calm their emotions and focus their learning into productive directions.On pp. 238 ff., Chopra tells us, \\"You transcend death. You are the spirit that always was ansd always will be.\\" This is of course another of his unsupported assertions, but his readership is far more into feeling good than closely analyzing whether his assertions are intrinsically valid or just pragmatically beneficial. What makes readers feel good isn't looked at closely.One of Chopra's valid observations is a rewording of the old \\"knowledge is structured in consciousness.\\" Chopra says it, \\"Knowledge is different in different states of consciousness.\\" A key to Chopra's success as an author and speaker is that he successfully brings hearers and readers out of \\"stuck\\" states of awareness, into freer perceptions of new possibilities. This helps his readers, many or most of whom are not aware of the manipulation Chopra has used to accomplish this beneficial transition. Chopra and Wayne Dyer are similar in their ability to inspire readers in this way. Preachers of hundreds of religions have done the same for their followers for thousands of years. Complete honesty, though it may be truthful, may not be so inspiring -- uplifting. Chopra uses his verbal gifts to bring ancient East Indian teachings to a 21st-century audience. This is why he has been able to author so many successful books."},{"Title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence","review":"I agree with the other interview here.

He includes encounters with Native Americans including historical characters who aided or impeded the settlers. The plot develops around a brother and sister orphaned by an Indian raid on their homestead and follows them through several generations with succeeding books including Tap Roots which was made into a movie in the forties or fifties. Street writes compasionately about the custom of indenture, relations between Native Americans and Africans, the struggles of ordinary people to establish a life on the frontier."},{"Title":"Oh, promised land,","review":"James Street's novel, recently purchased through Amazon, was exactly what I had hoped to receive. This is part of a series relating to the old South and a fascinating glimpse of those past years. My goal is to own all these books.

Still need copies of Tap Roots and Look Away.My introduction to this author and the series of books came through a lady steeped in Old South tradition. Her family was of early settlers in Mississippi. During WWII she met a Yankee, fell in love, caused a major upheaval when she married this man and moved North, of all things.

However, Fanon's \\"wretched of the Earth\\" could arguably be the ultimate manifesto, or bible of Third World liberation. Fanon was no Gandhi, though. ; he makes his strongest point to suggest that all solutions to decolonization lay on violent revolution by using the Frech-colonized Algeria as a model and his Manichean (Good Vs. Evil), or bipolar portrayal of the endless antagonism that naturally arises between the colonized and the settler.Fanon describes the conditions that emerge to allow for a war of liberation to take a foothold, the wave of repression unleashedby the occupying army to put down the rebellions, and most interestingly - because it is what has taken place ever since - the prospects of continued exploitation by the established relationship between the new \\"revolutionary\\" bourgeoisie and the former colonizer country after the nationalist struggle and pressure at home had forced its withdrawal.Fanon gives psychologycal analyses to testimonies given by his Algerians and French patients during the war period, and who had been affected directly or otherwise by the war. Cases involving French soldiers and police's torture, selective asassinations, surviving a mass killing, and gang rapes of rebels' wives by the French are some of which Fanon describes with chilling detail in the appendix.\\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" remains an invaluable document that testify to the often overlooked argument made by numerous armed movements of the 1960s as revolutions broke out throughout the ex-colonized World."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"This is a very useful book to anybody interested in understanding colonialism and its effects in Africa. Colonialism was a military project, and Fanon explained that clearly. Fanon does not shy away from suggesting the use of force, if necessary, to achieved freedom. But this book is not about the use of force/violence to achieve freedom, and should not be regarded as such. It is a book that explains western attitudes towards the colonized world, their willingness to use violence, their assault on African culture, and the curruption of African leaders after independence. Do not forget that independence came to Africa, after the French, the British and Belgians were given a clear warning about the fate that was awaiting them in other parts of Africa by the FLN (in Algeria), the MAU MAU movement (in Kenya), and the very aggressive movement for indepence in the Congo and Ghana. Europe was distoryed after World War II, and their armies could no longer sustain their military projects in Africa. This vulnerability was exploited by African leaders. That is why they failed in maintaining direct colonial control of their former colonies. When you ready this excellent material, you will appreciate Fanon's foresight:-his warning to Africans(and every colonized country)to take their destiny into their own hands: saying that every generation must out of relative obscurity, find its mission, fulfill it or betray it. A warning that most Africans ignored after independence. To anybody interested in the works of people like Dr. Walter Rodney, Aime Cesaire, Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, and Basil Davidson, this book is a \\"Must Read\\". Please read other Fanon material: Toward African Revolution, Dying Colonism, Black Skin White Masks. Interesting reading! Every African must read Fanon's books!"},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Those reviews that castigate Fanon for &quot;glorifying violence&quot; ought to be ignored. Fanon is writing, among other things, a phenomenology of anti-colonialism. It is meant neither as a recommendation nor a condemnation but as a description of the objective truth of a historical condition. That is, for Fanon reverse racist violent nationalism is a stage in the emergence of a political consiciousness that will eventually overcome and, indeed, renounce its own beginnings. What is remarkable is that people at present are so manifestly incapable of reading a dialctical unfolding such as this. The violence of the Algerian War had already largely taken place at the time of Fanon's writing and, let it be recalled, it was primarily the murder of Algerians by the French, for whom African imperialism is still a profitable if somewhat unsavory business.While Fanon tracks the stages in the evolution of a radical anti-capitalist consciousness in the underdeveloped world, there is no question of his endorsing or advocating violence. One has only to read the final chapter on the psychological effects on both the colonizer and the colonized to see that Fanon is acutely aware of the brutality for all concerned of the Algerian War, even or, indeed, especially, for the oppressors themselves. There is certainly no question of his endorsing the indiscriminate horrors committed that were committed by the FLN against their oppressors.The other thing, of course, that the petulant, anti-intellectual, ahistorical reactionaries who have shared their opinions here conveniently ignore is the violence inherent in the settler colonialism Fanon was addressing. As for the comparison with India, it is indeed illuminating, and one might profitably develop Fanon into a critique of the post-colonial India elite. After all, the real thrust of the book is its attempt to push anti-imperialism in a genuinely democratic direction, insofar as this was even possible for a largely peasant agricultural society caught within a much larger capitalist cosmos. At any rate, contra one reviewer, in the much-vaunted democracy of India, were peasants substantially liberated by the Indian National Congress from their indebtedness and from coercive labor practices? For his part, Fanon is not content with such liberal eye-wash as the talk of &quot;Indian democracy&quot; achieved through non-violence. In stark contrast to many other romantic commentators, he is keenly aware that there is nothing save radical democratic organized politics that can prevent post-colonial societies from a descent into poverty, despair, and the reactionary resurgence of &quot;leadership&quot; and virulently post-traditional &quot;ethnicities&quot; and &quot;religiosities&quot; though, in the face of the further defeat of the radical left in the West, most likely there is nothing to prevent the implosion of the Third World and the exhaustion (and extermination) of progressive energies there. Pages 95ff. in which Fanon discusses the terrible brutality of the very attempt to create industrialism in a country such as Algeria, and the awful irony of &quot;independence&quot; from the wealth of the colonizer are powerful and utterly ignored by most &quot;radicals&quot; who refuse to see that the resources already exist for the world to enjoy both opulence and sustainability.Another thing - Fanon is inconceivable without Marxism. It informs his every argument, even if his point is only to criticize actually existing Marxisms. Therefore, the claim that &quot;Fanon is great, except for the Marxist bit&quot; is absurd and puerile. The real problem is that that entire intellectual language and with it the vast majority of the history of 20th century social hope is being actively forgotten. The nuances of so much of Fanon lies in the way he handles, refashions, and pushes up against the limits of the Marxian legacy as it came to him. (The idea that Fanon is a &quot;genius&quot; and that there are none else like him is similarly an indication of a tragic social and political amnesia, and this is not meant to detract in the slightest from the incredible achievement that is both this work and youthful masterwork &quot;Black Skins, White Masks&quot;).Finally, to uncritically drag Fanon into the American context, as some other reviewers want to do, is, it seems to me, potentially extremely misleading. Far more so than &quot;Black Skins,&quot; &quot;Wretched&quot; is a book of its time and place. Certainly, any comparison with Malcolm X, who was no leftist and certainly no Marxist, is hopelessly misguided. Never mind the fact that Fanon's project of a liberated Algeria can scarcely be compared with the project of black American radical activists. American blacks were not colonized but forcibly transported and enslaved. More importantly, American blacks live within the heart of capitalism and Fanon's recommendation to the New World descendents of slaves would never be so crackpot as a separatist black nationalism.There are many good grounds for criticizing Fanon, but since few reviewers seem capable of even approaching those matters, a more basic commentary seemed necessary."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon is among the few thinkers who successfully wrote about emerging post-colonial nation-states. Many prefer to delve into the psychological implications of his work but I would rather view it as a warning againt the new tyranny that has its roots in the national struggle. Indeed, many nationalist movements became the new proxy for the departing colonial power thus ignoring the fact that fighters do not by default make good politicans. The dicourse of national struggle became the harbinger of the national dictatorship despite the evidence pointing to the outskirts and villages as being the impetus behind the drive for independence and not the educated classes as many claimed. I am not claiming that national struggle is bad but it has to be viewd objectively and its role must therefore end with independence to allow for genuine restructuring or else a political neo-imperialism emerges to replace direct military colonization. In both cases the winner is the colonizer who has returned in the form of the new nationl government mainly those who were educated in the West during colonization."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Frantz Fanon is a great Pan-African writer and theorist. He was a psychiatrist who was born in Martinique in the West Indies in 1925. He is one of the foremost writers and intellectuals on black liberation from racial oppression and revolutionary armed struggle. Fanon was not just an armchair theorist with an incisive mind but a practical man who elected to get involved in the fight for freedom in the Algerian war of independence. He participated in the Algerian Liberation movement, the FLN, in the Algerian war of independence against the French in the 1950s.Fanon's thinking was influenced by his analysis of testimonies that he got from Algerian and French patients that he treated during the Algerian war that had been traumatized by the war. The testimonies included the French troops and police torturing innocent civilians, mass killings and assassinations and rapes of defenseless men, women and children.The Wretched of the Earth is a classic book written in the Communist framework that analyses the psychology of colonized people and eloquently explains their anger and frustration. He explains the techniques that imperialists use to subjugate the colonized peoples. Fanon discusses the social and economic basis of colonialism. He highlights the willingness of colonial powers to use violence, their attack on African culture and way of life, among other things. He concluded that violence was the only way to free the oppressed people. His views are in direct contrast to those of another great historical icon, Gandhi, who preached non-violent means to end oppression. The \\"Wretched of the Earth\\" has been very influential to all the subsequent liberation wars on the African continent, the civil rights movement and black consciousness movements worldwide.Fanon was very prophetic as he attached post independence disenfranchisement of the masses by the ruling elites as well as tribal or religious clashes. Leaders of the newly liberated nations would have done well to heed in advice and avoid corruption and violence against their own peoples. He saw the need for a liberated country to have a national culture and national identity to ensure that there is unity that welds the nation together against various forces bend on its destruction.Although Marxism has largely collapsed worldwide, this book is recommended reading for anyone wishing to learn about colonialism and its impact in Africa. The book now has an important historical value in the current largely decolonized world. The book will help the reader understand how revolutionary movements worldwide have justified the use of violence to achieve their ends. Readers from countries where the people are oppressed and wish to put an end to their plight may find this book to be still very relevant and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Frantz Fanon was an extraordinary man. Passionate, charismatic, brave, deeply moral, profoundly intelligent and exceptionally perceptive and sensative. Those qualities infuse all of his books and its no surprise that all over the world so many good people refer to Fanon's work as &quot;my bible&quot; or &quot;our bible.&quot; Everybody should read The Wretched of the Earth. The world has changed since the book was written. The wretched have far less hope now. But Fanon's insights into the nature of oppression and resistance and especially the promises and dangers of nationalism are as fresh and enlightening as they have always been, Most of the 'great' European philosophers thought that it was appropriate to use violence to resist certain types of oppression. Yet John Locke or Karl Marx are not routinely referred to 'apostles of violence' and their work is never reduced to their support for armed resistance to certain types of oppression. It's clear that a lot of people are still horrified at the idea of a black man with a gun - even if he's resisting oppression. Fanon's reception in the West tells us a lot about his continued relevance. This is one of the most important books of the last century. Everybody should read it. Everybody should learn from it."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon describes the situation of those livng all down under of humanity who have nothing to lose but their chains and they can get rid of their chains. What I found extraordinary interesting was to compare Frantz Fanon to Ayn Rand: Those whom Ayn Rand regards as &quot;social parasites&quot; are e x a c t l y the same that Frantz Fanon describes as &quot;The wretched of the earth&quot; . So if you read &quot;Atlas shrugged&quot; and &quot;The wretched of the earth&quot; in a row, you'll get two opponent perspectives of the same world."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"I read Frantz Fanon's \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" in college in the early 1960s. It was an assigned reading in my only sociology class so I can't claim any credit for discovering the book on my own. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and into more recent times, \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" has been high on the reading lists of every Social Science and History department of every significant university in the USA, in the rest of the Western Hemisphere nations except when the universities have been closed by military dictatorships, in Europe, and of course in the post-colonial nations of Africa and Asia. Che Guevara read Fanon. Ali Shariati read Fanon. Malcolm X read Fanon. But so did Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Barry Goldwater read Fanon. So did Bill Clinton and George Herbert Bush, I suspect that George W Bush was assigned to read Fanon but chose the 'classic comic' version instead. In short, \\"everybody\\" read Fanon, usually \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\", and the mere reading of Fanon has never been sufficient to justify labeling the reader as an advocate of violent revolution. If you've never read Fanon, by the way, it's not too late; his writings have never gone out of print, however much they may seem 'dated' in content.Fanon was born in Martinique in 1925, of a middle-class 'mixed race' family prosperous enough to send him to the most prestigious high school in the former slave-owning colony. When the pro-Nazi Vichy French government began its campaign of racial abuse in Martinique, Fanon escaped and joined the Free French Forces. Later he enlisted in the Gaullist French army, joining Allied forces in Casablanca, and eventually seeing combat in in Alsace. After the War, Fanon studied medicine and psychiatry in Lyons and Saint-Alban. In 1953, Fanon was appointed 'chef de service' at a psychiatric hospital in Algeria, where he practiced until the French colonial authorities ordered his deportation back to France in 1957. During his years as a psychiatrist in Algeria, Fanon focused his practice and research on socio-therapies which too account of his patients' cultural backgrounds, a radical concept then but standard among psychotherapists in hospitals and clinics of the USA today. In 1954, Fanon also aligned himself with the FLN, the anti-colonial liberation front. The vast majority of Fanon's writings deal with Algeria's struggle for independence, but the common impression that they are all manifestos of violent revolution is false. Chiefly they are sociological analyses of the mentality of people, specifically the Algerians, after decades of colonial oppression. Fanon was not a methodological academic sociologist or anthropologist. His writings are intuitive, founded principally on his own experiences as a person of color and a scion of colonialism.The Wretched of the Earth has always been Frantz Fanon's most famous work. It was written during and regarding the Algerian struggle for independence from colonial rule. Fanon explored the psychological effect of colonization on the culture of a 'subject' people, and the implications of that mindset both for building a movement for independence and for establishing a polity after independence. A controversial introduction to the text by Jean-Paul Sartre presented Fanon's work as an advocacy of violence. This focus derived from the book's opening chapter \`Concerning Violence' which is a caustic indictment of colonialism and its legacy. Defenders of Fanon's legacy argue that Sartre's comments have led to a limited approach to the text that focuses on the promotion of violence. Further reading reveals a thorough critique of nationalism and imperialism which also covers areas such as mental health and the role of intellectuals in revolutionary situations. Also important is Fanon's view of the role of language and how it molds the position of \\"natives\\", or those victimized by colonization. Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth has become a handbook for political leaders faced with decolonization. It is still read in the Pentagon today as advice on dealing with the conflict in Iraq.I'm reviewing this book, which I read so many years ago, as a small response to the current book by Dinesh D'Souza -- The Roots of Obama's Rage -- which attempts to \\"tar\\" Obama as a disciple of Fanon and thus filled with obdurate hatred for the colonial powers, including the USA. Obama certainly has read Fanon, and refers to him once in his book \\"Dreams from My Father.\\" But, as I said before, \\"everybody\\" has read Fanon. I would hope that a substantial number of Republican Senators and Representatives have read Fanon; if not, our Congress is more woefully undereducated than I assumed. Even Philip Roth has read Fanon, and refers to him in his novel \\"American Pastoral\\".Dinesh D'Souza offers an intriguing example, in himself, of post-colonial mentality. He was born in Mumbai in 1961 -- the very year that Fanon died of leukemia -- but his parents were from Goa, the ancient Portuguese colony on the west of India. D'Souza was raised as a Roman Catholic but came to Dartmouth, where he was prominent in ultra-conservative activities. He began his career as a writer, so to speak, by publishing the names of \\"gay' Dartmouth students, without their consent, in the \\"Dartmouth Review\\", a publication subsidized by rightwing organizations not affiliated with Dartmouth. He was also a vociferous critic at Dartmouth of affirmative action. He has gone on to be closely associated with the Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institute, prominent reactionary think-tanks funded by ultra-conservative business tycoons. He now professes to be an \\"evangelical Christian\\" after having denounced th American catholic Church for 'pacifist' stances. His vociferously expressed opinions include anti-feminist diatribes, rejection of Darwinism, the assertion that 'some cultures/races are innately superior to others as demonstrated by their historical accomplishments, and the notion that secularism and secular morality have led to the unfair suppression of \\"conservative\\" thought at American universities. Considering that D'Souza is patently a 'product' of colonialism and post-colonial reaction, one might suspect that his vehemence is partly fueled by defensiveness, and his ideological rigidity by over-compensation."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Frantz Fanon was a lucid writer with a knack for turning a phrase. Philcox butchers Fanon and strips his words of their power. Do yourself a favor and buy the earlier translation by Constance Farrington. It is the next best thing to learning french and reading Fanon's words in the language in which they were written."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"I wasn't enthusiastic about this book to begin with. Maybe that made me less receptive to Fanon's ideas. I can see why disconsolate university types would get into Fanon, he can dish out the bitter slogans with ease. He does not, however, illustrate that the ends he wishes to achieve with the clarity that could justify his violent means. Thus I see this book as philosophically suspect.Romanticizing the rural mass and then marginalizing their ability to coherently rule themselves, Fanon justifies propagandistic manipulation, nationalized education and infrastructure, marginalization of ethnicity and cultural diversity; essentialy what he advocates is the construction of a technocracy that garbs itself in &quot;revolutionary&quot; euphemisms and uses the rural quantity as a check on the independence and economic and educational flexibility of urbanized elites. My professor saw my perspective as skewed, and perhaps it is.At any rate, given my suspicions about the ends Fanon sees as his structure, I consequently have contempt for his reasoning enunciating violence. First, he eloquently and passionately illustrates the techniques of imperialism in subjugating the colonized. This is his book's greatest strength; however, many readers enamored of this aspect seem incapable of critiquing the rest of the book.From his economic and social analysis of colonialism, Fanon is able to racialize a state of conflict between the oppressed and oppressor. This constructs social identity in a way that is useful for his arguments for violence. What would be called indiscriminate terrorism in many contexts becomes logically justified by Fanon's racial construct. It is the artifice of identity based on race that allows the justification of violence perpetrated on the basis of being black or white.Some would argue that despite Fanon's racialization of the conflict, Fanon always sees it as an economic relationship. Thus, his justification of attack on the urban black and the acceptance of the sympathetic white makes sense. Others would argue that this is just a bone thrown to the theorists that ultimately means nothing to the application of violence. I, however, see it as a verbose argument for terrorism committed on black people without removing the racism from his theory. In essence it is a smokescreen for calling the urban black pursuing economic security as an &quot;oreo.&quot; Thus terrorism committed on the independent shopkeeper is an attack on the proxy of the white man; while the white sympathizer is a propaganda tool.In essence, Fanon's theory is a justification for violence based on race; and for the control of people through propaganda and terror while spouting democratic themes. In practice we see this sort of technique used by regimes that prey on their own people and finance their repression with drug smuggling and corruption (re: Myanmar, FARC, the Taleban).If you read Fanon and find this sort of thing making sense, take a good long look in the mirror. It is important to at least be honest with yourself before becoming enmired in hypocrisy. Fanon clearly despised himself; unfortunately he transferred that emotion onto an entire society."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Theorists of revolutionary violence - that side of Marxist \\"evolution\\" purely miltary and strategic - always managed to betray chilling detachment from the underclass they claimed to champion. In their discussion of \\"decisive moments\\" and \\"critical acts\\", loss of life is never as important as conjectural impact of violence, or academic theory surrounding its value. Destruction and death are abstract, mere ingredients within larger strategem. I suppose they are as long as I'm not the one suffering the horror, and my loved ones escape the bloodbath, as well. Leftist revolution never lost its university coffee-house underpinnings - that passion, educated perspective, and utter lack of empathy for designated victims. As the 20th century recedes, it telescopes; its passage is compressed and sometimes events become clearer, sometimes blur. Fanon's theories now seem product of a time when Marxism's pseudo-religion still seemed viable. As it was put into practice on wider scale, its impossible flaws became apparent. With exception of North Korea, there are no Marxist regimes today, only mislabeled husks of them."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"This book was recommended to my book club and boy oh boy it really was like digging through the \\"Wretched of the Earth\\" to read it.

A must read for those wishing to understand the psychology of the oppressed, not only in other parts of the world, but here in Amerika.ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE"},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"I find that most reviewers have based their evaluation on their agreement or disagreement with the ideas of the author. Although I liked many of his ideas, this book was very poorly written and contained very little new thinking, so I give it the rating it deserves.Fanon doesn't state his idea and then support it, he just rambles on and beats around the bush and it's up to the reader to figure out what he's trying to say exactly. The result is that he uses a great many words to say very little. This makes for a very frustrating read.The ideas he presents are not original either. Most of them can be found in Gandhi's \\"Hind Swaraj\\" (it's easy to download free English translations of this work off the internet and I stronlgy recommend reading it; plus it's much shorter than Fanon's book). Considering that \\"Hind Swaraj\\" was written almost 50 years earlier than \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\", the ideas Fanon presents were already old by the time he wrote the book!Although Gandhi advocated non-violence while Fanon believes violence is inevitable in anti-colonial struggle, there isn't much that Fanon says that Gandhi hadn't already discussed. For instance, Fanon is often credited for predicting (or warning about) the fact that the intellectual and political elite of newly independent countries may simply replace the foreign oppressor. Gandhi had already warned his people about that, when he said that the leaders who overthrow colonialism by violence will also govern by violence. The example if India, which is one of the few colonies that gained independence by non-violence and which is one of the few that has been and remains democratic, proves that Gandhi's predictions were better than Fanon's since Gandhi also knew that violence was not inevitable in the fight for independence and that non-violence was the best way to avoid a simple substitution of the opressor.In other words, if you want to read well-writen work and interesting ideas about anti-colonialism, don't waste your time with Fanon, read Gandhi instead..."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"There are 40 pages describing the psychiatric work of Dr. Frantz Fanon.

Themindset of the oppressed and the culture of an oppressed people is written veryplain, universal language (thanks in some part, no doubt, to the translator)and there are themes and ideas in this book that ring true today because ofthis style of writing.Fanon writes about the need for having a \\"national culture\\" and the promotionof national identity in order to provide a cohesion to people exitingcolonialism into the more covertly cruel world of free markets, totalindependence and possibly neo-colonialism (such as what goes on in a lot of thepoorer Asian, African and South American countries today with sweatshops,plantations and diamond mining). This idea that a national unity and recognizedcommon interest is not an option, it's totally necessary, if a group of peoplewants to truly take power for themselves can be applied to all types of groupstoday: gay people, the impoverished, the political Left, those in occupiedcountries, religious minorities worldwide, etc.So why would I only give the book 3 stars? I feel that while a lot of thephilosophy in the book is timeless, it takes lot of wading through datedaccounts of 1960s African politics, Fanon's psychiatric conclusions (one-fifthof the book is devoted to this) and some mediocre round-about philosophizing.The back of the edition I read claimed that \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" hadsurpassed other books of the era about colonialism and become more than just ahistorically interesting artifact. By the last page however, I got the samefeeling I did when I finished \\"The Rights of Man\\" by Paine a year earlier for auniversity assignment; there's simply no need to go through so much irrelevanttext to get to the core of the argument, which could be found in some of theauthor's essay complilationsinstead."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fannon's Wretched of the Earth is an interesting look at the relationship between a colonized country and it's colonizer. He also discusses the inevitablity of the overthrowing of the colonizing government by the people it rules. He states that this uprising must inevitabley be violent, For while the colonist is profiting from it's oppression of the colony, it will not willingly give the ruled country up. Fannon approaches his subject matter from a neo-marxist perspective. That is to say, the colonizer (in this case France) holds all of the means of production, and seeks to maintain it's power over the Colonized (in this case the Algierians). However, according to Fannon, the Algierians will eventually become aware (or, since this was written some time ago, did become aware) of their oppression, and will rise up against their oppressors.Fannon also discusses the difficulties, and inherent problems in replacing the deposed government. He discusses the struggle for power that follows (different groups scrambling to gain the means of production). He also, describes the proper course that the country should take in order to rule itself properly. In doing this, Fannon seems to have a fairly realistic view of government struggle. He points out that the transition is going to be difficult. But he has high hopes for Algieria taking it's place on the world stage.It's also interesting that Fannon is writing for Algierians. This isn't some manifesto aimed at France, or Europe in general (although he does criticize Europe). So, perhaps this book might be looked at as a handbook for many of the countries that threw off the shackles of colonialism around this time (perhaps even today). So,in some sense, it might be looked at as an attempt at Praxis.The latter portion of the book consists of a series of case studies concerning the effects that the end of Colonialism had on the people within the country (both French and Algierian people). Basically, this section is an example of the human reaction to the atrocities commited both by the colonial regime, and by the revolutionaries.In all, I would recomend this to anyone interested in seeing Marx's ideas in a more contemporary context.

Seemingly, it has only historic value in today's decolonized world. But as I read the book, from its beginning to its end, I could not help finding parallels to many current world issues. Wherever there is a situation of oppressed groups trying to put an end to their oppression - the words of Fanon are relevant and enlightening.Fanon helped me understand the attitudes of the oppressed (found today mainly in Africa and Asia), and the pitfalls of the national liberation struggles. Reading this book explained why so many countries replaced colonialism with corrupt dictatorships.This book shows that Fanon is one of the sharpest and most truthful intelectuals of the 20th century.I know I did not manage to convey the full impact this book had on me. The impact may become clear when I say that this book must be translated to every language, taught in every high school system, and discussed at every academic and political level."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"I pulled the title of my review from page 130, which states, \\"This lumpenproletariat is like a horde of rats; you may kick them and throw stones at them, but despite your best efforts they'll go on gnawing at the roots of the tree.\\" One of my favorite lines of many from Fanon that still, and perhaps now more than ever, resonate in the magazines, newspapers and op-ed pages of the West today.\\"The Wretched of the Earth,\\" along with Dubois' \\"The Souls of Black Folk,\\" was a book I found repeatedly mentioned both in the \\"Autobiography of Malcolm X\\" as well as the writings of Black Panther leaders Huey Newton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver. I couldn't quite understand some of the ideas of these great black activists until I read Fanon's \\"Wretched.\\" Now I see that they took many of Fanon's observations and revolutionary theories and applied them to the plight of the African-American of the 1960s. For example, when the Panthers would decry the police as \\"fascist, gestapo pigs,\\" and demand their withdrawal, they sounded much like Fanon, who writes,\\"In these poor undeveloped countries (or the slums of Oakland, Chicago, New York), where the rule is the greatest wealth is surrounded by the greatest poverty (the horde of rats), the army and the police constitute the pillars of the regime; an army and a police force(another rule which must not be forgotten) which are advised by foreign experts.\\" This is one example of many of Fanon influence of these men. In the Congo dissidents or opponents had their hands cut off. In Guinea they had their lips pierced and padlocked shut. In Oakland the Panthers were confronted with billyclubs, bullets or bars, and again, they drew the analogy. \\"Colonialism only loosens its hold when the knife is at its throat...it is violence in its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence.\\" The Panthers, who viewed themselves enduring 500 years of colonization, took up arms.\\"Individualism is the first to disappear,\\" a line seen early on in the work that was echoed by Che Guevara in his heyday, key to coming together collectively, the only means of having a chance at throwing out the imperialists. I don't know which is more beneficial, to read works like the biography of Che, some of the Panthers' biographies, and then Fanon's \\"Wretched of the Earth,\\" or vice-versa. Regardless, \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" is the Machiavelli of revolutionary theory. I am still, unfortunately, not very versed in African politics and revolutionary movements. However, switching to Latin America, reading the \\"Wretched of the Earth\\" feels like being in the hills of Cuba with Fidel. It's practically a play-by-play, giving one greater appreciation for the struggle and the sacrifice.Particularly impressive if Fanon's analysis of the developed versus the underdeveloped world, and the former's contempt for and repression of the latter as the underdeveloped world tries to climb out of their hole, moreso he himself being not a native African, but a Frenchman, knowing both sides equally well. It seems as though there is never any alternative, on the subject of revolutions, to colonialism or communism. Either business continues as usual (colonialism), or nationalist governments are hit with labels such as \\"upstart,\\" in that time becoming part of the great international conspiracy, in our time anti-capitalist. Fanon is right on when he cites the colonialists as saying,\\"If you wish for independence, take it and go back to the Middle Ages...since you want independence, take it and starve.\\" The application doesn't end with the '60s but continues on in our day, when the world's major financial players are offering assistance only in exhange for the right to \\"exploit.\\"There is so much more to be said for this book. Admittedly this is a poor review, unworthy of Fanon's brilliant presentation of how to revolt and succeed doing so.

Of course the actions of the bourgesse was something that dates back to the beginning of civilization. The stong have always taken advantage of the weak, using them weak for trade and servitude.Although this book concentrates on the Arabs in nothern Africa, it most certainly occurred on all of today's continents. It has not been limited to any class, race, or religion. In many cases the people allowed themselves to be indentured servants to get out of poverty.Fortunately, the free world as we define it no longer believes in such practices.

It is a tremendous achievement even after all these years (and even though many of Fanon's ideas have been discredited)."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon describes the character of (European) colonialists, the colonised Africans (the \\"masses\\" - rural and urban, the elites, the nationalists, the tribalists) wonderfully. The book is wonderfully written - Fanon must have been a good writer.Fanon is a psychiatrist, and worked in Algeria as psychiatrist, but he many have travelled other African countries too. His book shows his deep knowledge of both African and European sociology, psychology and politics. The book is still relevant; his analysis as to what will happen after the liberation of African countries is amazingly valid. He is in a way one of the most important African (though he is born in Latin America) sociologist and political scientist.Fanon's book starts on \\"violence\\", he doesn't shy away from prescribing violence in the struggle for liberation. Some find Fanon advocating violence, but that is not the case. He puts in perspective the violence perpetrated by colonists against the resulting reaction that culminates in the violence of the colonised. His clear analysis demystifies the violence that still grips Africa.Unfortunately Fanon seems to put all European in Africa as colonists. Many cases from South Africa show that that should not be the case. But his views may be due to the brutal repression he has to witness and experience in Algeria by the French government and French citizens there."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth is a seminal work. What this book adds to the human and historical perspective of colonialism is invaluable. There is no other work that enumerates quite so well what colonialism does to the human being suffering under its yoke like this book, and it is this point which makes this work so very powerful.What strikes the reader very early on in this reading is the raw emotion. Each page is dripping with rage and anger of the dispossessed, but while this anger is palpable and real the book does not suffer from that emotion. In fact it is enhanced by it. The writing is very matter of fact which gives the emotion this eerie feeling of naturalness as if this anger and hatred for the colonial system is nothing but the logical outgrowth and conclusion to that very system. This is the human perspective at its most elementary. While this work is very lucid and intelligent, the author does not hide the ugly realities behind any veneer of scholarly wordplay. There is a quote from Aime Cesaire's Les Armes Miraculeuses that is brutal and haunting that expresses the violent impulse to cast off oppression when the chance arises no matter what form that oppression takes. It is this brutal honesty and the matter-of-factness with the violence that does so much to expose what the colonial system does to human beings.The historical perspective is equally important because it gives readers a chance to see the evolution of resistance. Fanon allows readers into the very mind of the resistance, and let's us see the dehumanizing affect of this horrible system and its inevitable end point. His discussion of revolutionary movements and the impulses behind them is invaluable for the historian. He offers a psychological analysis as well as an historical analysis. That's why this book is so vital to understanding the whole of colonialism, or at least as close to the whole as anyone can come.I do have some criticisms as well. I found the book to be an extremely difficult read. The reason for the difficulty is the narrative style. The book is written almost as a stream of consciousness. The book feels as if the author just sat down and started writing his thoughts down and that became this book. The work cries out for some sort of organization or structure; something to delineate Fanon's thoughts and to map out for the reader just what they are reading at a given time. The style of the writing is excellent. It is only the narrative that I found so difficult.Even with my criticism this book is still an important read. The perspective it offers is like no other, and it is this that makes the book so valuable. If you really want to know what colonialism is and what it does then this book has to be read. I highly recommend this bok."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"This is the only truly revolutionary manifesto of the 20th century. Fanon excoriates colonialism &amp; post-colonial nationalist governments. As a psychiatrist, he is one of the original theorists for the social origins of mental illness. Was this guy radicial?

So Sartre wrote this book's foreward."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon among all freedom fighters I know of provided an anthropology of racism--religious resisters like Bonhoeffer had of course their own--but Fanon--even if his anthropology proves wrong--only history can say did a remarkable thing--he esplained oppression in terms of the human person not just economics (which certainly is a reasonable thing to do) but he went firther--this is a very great book--i would take out sartre's preface--he was a coward possibly worse i am trying to work that up"},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Certainly if one merely observed empirically the thrust of revolutionary activity in the post-World War II period one would have seen vast national liberation struggles of colonial subjects from Algeria (Fanon's revolution) to Cuba to Vietnam and everywhere in between to become free from the fetters of empire. And see, see in general, the relative decline of revolutionary activity by the Western working classes. Thus Marxism, or the parody of Marxism, was turned on itself to proclaim that new third world forces would create a new type of socialism (one based not on plenty since not frontal assault on the imperial centers after liberation was contemplated for the most part, but rather some ancient forms of societal existence, if any) led by new types of revolutionary organizations not tainted with the smell of sell-out Western and urban-centered communist and socialist parties or their colonial adherents, and creating a \\"new man\\" culture. But first the liberation, and the ethos of liberation.Obviously such theories, based as they were on dismissal of the historic Marxist centrality of the working classes take state power and creating working class forms of economic and social life, could only work as theories of some military defeat of the imperial centers by revolutionary declassed intellectuals and lumpenproletariat elements freed from the land in third world countries. In short the creation of rural (or urban in some cases) guerilla armies guided by an ethos of revolutionary violence as cleansing its supporters in the process of knocking out the old order. In short, as well, a variant of the old Narodnik theories in the old time 19th century Russian Empire that revolutionaries like Lenin and Trotsky had to fight against in their time.The real problem with such lumpen-dependent strategies, borne out over time, and now in re-reading The Wretched Of The Earth, painfully borne out, is that the masses play no, or a passive role, in their liberation with all the distortions that a strategy based on a central military strategy creates. Revolutionary violence is probably, very probably, necessary to overturn imperial power but the cult of the gun, the cult of the purifying gun is not, and has not, worked in the struggle for a new socialist culture. The most dramatic example from the American left scene was the fate of the Black Panthers whose best elements (George and Jonathan Jackson, Fred Hampton, Eldridge Cleaver, etc.) bought into the Fanon substitutionist revolutionary thesis (the internal black nation theory they got elsewhere including early American Communist party doctrine on black self-determination as advocated by Harry Haywood and his fellows). And some very good Panthers wound up dead, wound up in jail (and some still in jail) and wound up cynical for their efforts. Let that example set in as you read Fanon's very intriguing book, a book like I said earlier that was very influential in my own early left-wing thinking, and that of the generation of '68.Note: I would be incomplete in this review if I did not mention that Fanon, as a well-trained and extremely competent psychiatrist, spent a good portion of the book (the end section) describing the various traumas and pathologiesattributed to both the oppressed and the oppressor in Algeria during the national liberation struggle as a result of the colonial experience. He makes a very strong prima facie case for the proposition that oppression oppresses everyone and we had best get rid of this malignancy and take it off the human agenda as quickly as possible. To that I can say amen, brother."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon asserts that violence is necessary for colonized and opressed people to achieve liberation. Have none of the readers of this book ever heard of Gandhi or Martin Luther King? Not only can national liberation be achieved without violence, but India has proven itself to one of the more stable and democratic of the former colonial possessions. Further, violence is often if not always quite counterproductive. LBJ's civil rights program stalled after the Watts riots, and Seale, Newton, and the other Panthers were some of the best allies the right wing of America ever had. George Wallace and his kinder, gentler protege Ronald Reagan owe a lot of their political success to them and like minded groups. In much the same way the rise of the Israeli far right can be linked to Palestinian suicide bombers and other attacks on civilians. Of course these are facts and Fanon is theory and never the twain shall meet.Fanon isn't even that good when considered from a theory angle. His admirers can ramble on about dialectics all they want (a word I'd wager none of them could define), but from what I can tell Fanon's grip on Marx is shaky at best and his understanding of Hegel laughable. Particularly egregious is his moronic take on the master-slave dialectic. The whole point for the slave is recognition as an equal, which Hegel readily saw could not be achieved through violence, as did King and Ghandi, though they might never have slogged through the PhG. Their tactic of nonviolent resistance is much more effective in getting the &quot;masters&quot; to recognize the subjugated as equals than is indiscriminate murder (and yes Fanon does advocate that), a tactic which only reenforces the rulers' self-serving belief that their subjects are subhuman savages in need of education and civilization.On a final note if I had I not had to read it myself I would not believe anything this poorly thought out and morally disgusting could be taught at a respectible university. This tripe helps me see why the right holds the academy in contempt, but why more progressives don't take ivory tower sages who'd run screaming at a paper cut to task for preaching bloodshed and mayhem is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"About twenty years ago, I read this trash-book, here in Brazil.Frantz Fanon (1925-61) was a french( Martinique-born), black and anticolonialist intellectual.This book, The Wretched of the Earth, is Frantz Fanon's last and most famous and important work.In fact, the author wrote this book confined to his bed, dieing of leukemia in 1961.Even writen with so many wyll, the ideas of this book aren't just absurds, but also outdated today.To example, it claims that criminals, vagrants, and the unemployed are the persons that someone must find to begin a communist revolution.Please, traditional communist revolution is over as way to the left get power.Since 1980, left only created communist tyrannies by fascist-like praticers.After fair elections, leftists became dictators, emulating Hitler and Mussolini and using democray to doom itself.Robert Mugabe began this pratice in 1980.Hugo Chavez was nominated by Fidel Castro to be his deputy, years ago.Both entered to power after normal elections, but became communist tyrants and robbers, by coups and elections.Writen for a world complete different, this book is outdated, absurd and useless today; even for the left.Communism is alive, but Frantz Fanon was buried by history.The real future for communist isn't the useless fake, describe in this book.The real future for the left is to become muslins.Forget Moscow;remember Mecca forever.Forget Marx, but remember Muhammad forever.Forget \\"The Capital\\" , but read and follow \\"The Koran\\".Islamism is the real totalitarism, of the future."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"Fanon's book is a brillant invaluable book which can be considered a manifesto of the Third World liberation.

His conclusion, that the third world has to rise to the task of protecting and taking back liberal humanism from European hypocrisy, (and that they have to do it on their own terms) might be overly idealistic, but its a kind of idealism which is very hard not to agree with by the time he's done making his case.

Frantz Fanon was a Black psychiatrist who was born on the French island of Martinique. During the Algerian War of Independence (1954-62) he worked in Algerian hospitals, and developed a strong sympathy for the struggle of the native Algerians (who were not of European origins!). Fanon died in 1961, far too young, at 36, stricken by leukemia. Alistair Horne wrote the classic, dispassionate account of the Algerian War, entitledA Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962 (New York Review Books Classics). Fanon wrote his own classic masterpiece, a cri de coeur, literally on his death bed. This book would be an essential inspirational text for those who fought in the remaining anti-colonial wars as well as the Black civil rights movement in the United States. The book also contains an introduction from Jean-Paul Sartre.In the introduction, Sartre says in his indubitable style: \\"The European elite undertook to manufacture a native elite. They picked out promising adolescents; they branded them, as with a red-hot iron, with the principles of Western culture; they stuffed their mouths full with high-sounding phrases, grand glutinous words that stuck to the teeth. After a short stay in the mother country they were sent home, whitewashed. These walking lies had nothing left to say to their brothers; they only echoed.\\" Sartre is utterly oblivious. Willfully oblivious? How many of those \\"natives\\" who were educated in European \\"rights of man\\" values went back to lead the revolts against their colonial masters? A minority, for sure, but surely a majority of those who actually revolted, from Ho Chi Minh to Pol Pot. And is Frantz Fanon himself a \\"walking lie\\"? Clearly he was one of the natives who benefited from a European education, and could see the hypocrisy in the proclamations of universal rights and then hear the clearing of the throat, the er.. ah.., of course I mean for whites, even leaving the distaff side \\"in their place.\\" Fanon himself does not address his somewhat ironic situation of utilizing his European education to denounce the European \\"world order.\\" Perhaps if Fanon had lived longer, he would have addressed this matter.But STILL, this is an excellent book, because that is not really the issue. Fanon is simply scathing in his denunciation of the injustices and hypocrisy of colonial rule. For example, in speaking of the colonialist: \\"...he shows them up and puts them into practice with the clear conscience of an upholder of the peace; yet he is the bringer of violence into the home and into the mind of the native.\\" Or: \\"The Church in the colonies is the white people's Church...\\" Or: \\"Leave this Europe where they are never done talking of Man, yet murder men everywhere they find them, at the corner of every one of their own streets, in all corners of the globe. For centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of a so-called spiritual experience.\\"Fanon also does denounce his fellow natives who have been educated, and are Sartre's \\"walking lies\\": \\"It (the native bourgeoisie) follows the Western bourgeoisie along its path of negation and decadence without ever having emulated it in its first stage of exploration and invention...\\" The word \\"bourgeoisie\\" is one of those flags that confirms a \\"Marxist analysis\\" which is obviously quite dated today, aside from connoting prose that drifts into the opaque.But again, STILL, even with that \`dated' flaw, it does not diminish insights such as: \\"Those literally astronomical sums of money which are invested in military research, those engineers who are transformed into technicians of nuclear war, could in the space of fifteen years raise the standard of living of underdeveloped countries by 60 per cent.\\" Even more dramatically (and only partially correct): \\"The people come to understand that wealth is not the fruit of labor but the result of organized, protected robbery.\\"Despite the heavy prose, and the lack of ironic introspection, this is a classic critique of the essential injustice of the colonial \\"world order\\"; it is a book which has inspired many.

Fanon asserts that for the colonized: \\"To live simply means not to die. To exist means staying alive.\\" Thus, it can be inferred that Fanon's portrayal of the Algerian Revolution is one that deals with individuals stripped of the human faculties of identity and forced simply as human beings to exist in the sense of breathing: a morbid assertion at best.The entire book thrives on the notion that, in order to harness a sense of social identity among the \\"wretched of the earth,\\" or the colonized masses, it is imperative that violence, or any other possible means, be used to destroy the colonialist foreignors (specifically, in Fanon's case, the French colonists in Algeria). Jean Paul Sartre, who wrote the controversial preface to the Wretched of the Earth, asserts that the only thing keeping the predominantly dehumanized wretch humanized is his desire to kill the colonist, to take his place (an idea also asserted by Fanon himself). Fanon does an excellent job merging the different ideals espoused by the respective sections of the colonized movement, including the urban proletariat, the lumpenproletariat, the tribal leaders, and the colonized intellectual, who Fanon holds in contempt for submission to Western thought (though he later asserts that the intellectual can regain his bearing in the liberation movement if he/she integrates with his/her brethren in the mountains and villages).The work extensively examines the economic portion of decolonization, and demonstrares Fanon's vehement support for a redistribution of wealth and a unification of resources in order to distribute among the people seeming trivialities, such as grapes and other commodities previously witheld by the colonizer. The memorable conclusion demonstrates Fanon's ideals in his call for the Third World to create a distinct delineation between itself and Europe in order \\"to create a new man.\\"Overall, the Wretched of the Earth is one man's cry for a Third World reawakening delivered in miltantly abrasive prose that still resonates to this day."},{"Title":"The Wretched of the Earth","review":"...even though I never got to reading it before donating it to the library.

Kuehlewind says that there is and that the human being can &quot;read&quot; this &quot;book&quot; of nature. This language is very subtle and the person must wake in him/herself the organ of perception waiting inside of him/her to speak this language.Although on first reading this book is difficult and is written in a way not easily followed, upon my second reading I think the concepts had had time to digest and it became far easier to follow the text. One does feel that, no matter how much is said of this language or the ability to read or speak it, an ordinary language such as English with its strong noun based structure, resulting in a static kind of thought, does not completely allow the free flow of Kuehlewind's ideas. I feel there are two options available to resolve this problem, either use another language which expresses movement as true movement rather than composed of non-moving parts, eg Eskimo or Blackfoot Indian, or use this language of nature itself to describe such ideas, this is often expressed as a sense from mind to mind or if writing is used at all through contradictory or paradoxical statements such as Zen koans which break the habitual thought cycle of ordinary language.A remarkable book which both deepens and elucidates Goethe's original insights with input from Steiner."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"This anthology of Nietzsche's writing is a marvelous work - Kaufmann's translations make the philosopher's unique style accessible and interesting to the English reader; it doesn't resort to false formality or dry academic prose as is often the case in translation of such material, but rather sets things in lively and dynamic tones, much as Nietzsche's own writing and tendency toward the dramatic was noted by his contemporaries.Nietzsche's father was a Lutheran minister, but he died five years after Nietzsche's birth in 1844. Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of Kaufmann's text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.Kaufmann states in the introduction that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.Kaufmann states that 'Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse. This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays. The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods. The third essay concludes the work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.Perhaps this later explains the second work in this collection, Ecce Homo. In this book (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life. Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold. For example, his idea of his work in the first piece of this collection, the Genealogy, is as follows:'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far. Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche. However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good collection, for Kaufmann is one of the better translators and commentators. Kaufmann's notes here are especially valuable."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"My interest in philosophy itself has never been as great as my interest in &quot;How One Becomes What One Is,&quot; which is the topic covered in the little book at the back of this double selection.

But one must be profound, an abyss, a philosopher to feel that way.

In opposition, Nietzsche propounds art and culture as a counteragent and champions the &quot;Diyonisan tragic artist&quot; who will affirm and celebrate life. - Also a pioneering text for poststructuralist critical-historical analysis, as represented by the likes of Deleuze and Foucault, and deconstruction, the maverick textual methodology of Jacques Derrida."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"I gave this to my coworker and he couldn't stop talking about how great it was!"},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"Nietzsche attempts to construct the origins of Christian morality using the scalpel of his pscyhological-historical method. Despite the many penetrating insights into human nature, in some areas he misses the mark totally. He claims that Christianity was the product of a Jewish conspiracy to enact revenge on Rome -- that it was the fullfilement of the burning ressentiment of the Jewish slave-priests who in their impotence could not subjugate the masters by force and were therefore led to do so through a doctrine of love. Christ, as Nietzshe sees it, was the bait through which Rome was subjugated to a transfigured Judaism. While the theory, despite its obvious absurdity, sounds interesting, it follows from the psychological arguments that Nietzshce is building, and even more so from his premise that &quot;God is our most enduring lie&quot;. For once this accepted, as Nietzsche sees it, Christianity ipso facto becomes the product of human minds; hence he endeavors to find the materialistc origins of Christianity by way of a psychological-historical deconstruction of the human-all-too-human tendencies responsible for the inception of Europe's dominant religion. Yet such a method can certainly back-fire -- and in Nietzsche's case it seems too. How so?Nietzshche's obsession with values that accompany strength, dominance and might may have mirrored his own decrepid physical condition. The German philosopher was forced to retire from his teaching post at the young age of 34 due to his deteriorating health. Some speculate that his condition was precipitated by an injury during military training in his youth which cut short any aspirations he may have had of becoming a soldier. Taking into considertation that much of his life following retirement was ridden with painfull fits of vomiting and unceasing migranes, does it require a radical leap to presume that a man so deprived of health would fanatically esteem strength and everything connected to an abundance of physicality? After all, which other philosopher wrote so eloquently about the greatness of the overman's domineering power and the importance of the will-to-power? Yet Nietzsche was incensed by attempts to explain-away his ideas by explaining HOW and WHY they arose in himself. Irononically, this is the method he uses against Christian-morality; he presumes that an explanation is an explanation-away. As he writes in the WILL TO POWER: &quot;Everywhere God is inserted...and the real origin of morality denied&quot;. It appears that the blind spot of his genealogical anaylysis of Christian morality is himself, which can be equally genealogically-submerged if his method is adopted. This means that both Christian values and Nietzsche's views can be explained away by exposing the circumstances that led to their emergence. Where then lies the truth, if all perspectives are levelled by the &quot;consuming fires&quot; of genealogical-subversion?As I Muslim I side with the Christians (and all believers in Divine causality), in arguing that an explanation is NOT an explanation-away, and that at best it simply reveals the contextual bed underpinning the emergence of any phenomena, be it an idea or event -- that and nothing more. As Ghazali, the medieval Islamic mystic writes: the materialist is like an ant which crawls on a sheet of paper, and seeing black letters spreading over it attributes the cause to the pen alone."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"This is a great Kaufmann and Hollingdale translation, with copious and succinct footnotes and many excerpts from other Nietzsche texts. \\"Genealogy\\" is my favorite -- incredibly packed with wit and venom.

At the most basic level the question is: Have you submitted to a subject-object reversal, whereby your subjectivity is displaced into some kind of ruling object and its will? Or, are you still your own subject, the master of your own will?I think there is much room for misunderstanding Nietzsche if one doesn't already thoroughly and fully possess one's own subjectivity. One can invest all of one's philosophical capital in the images that Nietzsche portrays, of oligarchy and a lust for power, along with a kind of unconscious sadism (the eagle that \\"loves\\" the lamb). However, there is no point in adopting any of these mannerisms and proclaiming that one is now \\"master\\" when one has not first obtained power over one's subjectivity. To assume that one already has this power, when one has not, must be the most common mistake of most of Nietzsche's adherents."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"_On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo_ consists of translations by Walter Kaufman and R. J. Hollingdale of the works _On the Genealogy of Morals, A Polemic_ (_Zur Genealogie der Moral, Eine Streitschrift_), first published in 1887, and _Ecce Homo_, written in 1888, by the tormented German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche. _On the Genealogy of Morals_ was Nietzsche's eighth book and consists of three essays which reveal his opposition to Christian morality. _Ecce Homo_ was an autobiographical work which consists of several chapters detailing Nietzsche's philosophy. Nietzsche's philosophical viewpoint may be described as that of aristocratic radicalism, in which he sets up an opposition between the morality of the masters and what he terms \\"slave morality\\". It is this \\"slave morality\\" motivated by a spirit of ressentiment that Nietzsche seeks to overcome by a return to the morality of the masters. Nietzsche is firmly opposed to the Judeo-Christian tradition, which he views as the culmination of slave morality. Indeed, according to Nietzsche the slaves sought to revolt against their masters by supplanting the morality of the masters with their own which glorifies the weak, meek, and sickly. Instead, Nietzsche advocates a revaluation of all values with a return to the morality of the masters, who are proud, strong, and heroic._On the Genealogy of Morals_ consists of a preface followed by three essays and an appendix which consists of aphorisms from his various writings. The preface notes the slave rebellion in morality, in which a morality of pity came to replace the morality of the masters. Nietzsche references the work of Schopenhauer, his great teacher, who he believes has made possible a new Buddhism for Europeans - nihilism. The first essay of this book is entitled \\"\\"Good and Evil\\", \\"Good and Bad\\"\\" and it details Nietzsche's opposition to Judeo-Christianity and Christian morality as well as Platonic philosophy. Nietzsche argues that the Jews, a slave people, began a great revolt in morality which resulted in the inversion of moral values in which what previously had been called \\"good\\" and \\"noble\\" came to be replaced by the lowly, weak, and sickly. Nietzsche argues that with Jesus of Nazareth, the Jewish slave revolt was accomplished in which Europe became under the sway of a Jew. Nietzsche contrasts this with the \\"blond German beast\\", the primitive Aryan tribesman, and his morality of the conquerer. Nietzsche quotes extensively from the church fathers, including Tertullian, regarding the \\"kingdom of God\\" and offers in opposition to the sign on the entrance of Dante's hell, \\"I too was created by eternal love\\", the sign \\"I too was created by eternal hate\\", instead. Nietzsche offers the opposition \\"Rome against Judea, Judea against Rome\\". In addition, Nietzsche shows how the Jews have come to conquer Rome through the slave revolt in which today in Rome they bow before three Jews and a Jewess (Jesus, Peter, Paul, and Mary). Nietzsche claims that the Renaissance represented a return to the classical idea; however with the Reformation motivated largely by ressentiment and the French Revolution the slave revolt was made complete. The second essay in this book is entitled \\"\\"Guilt\\", \\"Bad Conscience\\" and the Like\\". This essay focuses on the meaning of guilt and ressentiment showing the cruelty of punishment and torture. Nietzsche shows himself to be a primitive psychologist in his understanding of \\"bad conscience\\" and \\"guilt\\" and his theories were an important precursor to modern day psychoanalysis. The third essay of this book is entitled \\"What is the Meaning of Ascetic Ideals?\\". Here, Nietzsche focuses on Richard Wagner with whom he had a complicated relationship. Nietzsche also expresses his disgust with the German anti-Semites of the time (though only with a certain type of anti-Semite, the kind who still retained adherence to the Christian tradition). This essay ends with the following line: \\"man would rather will nothingness than not will\\", an expression of Nietzsche's nihilism. This book concludes with an appendix, \\"Seventy-Five Aphorisms in Five Volumes\\", containing various aphorisms from Nietzsche's writings._Ecce Homo_ was Nietzsche's last work and was not published during his lifetime. The book is subtitled \\"How One Becomes What One Is\\". _Ecce Homo_ contains a preface and three chapters, followed by discussions of several of Nietzsche's books, and then a final chapter. The chapters attempt to show Nietzsche's philosophical progression as he began his career as a philologist, the influence of Wagner on his early life, his subsequent break with Wagner, and his later writings. Nietzsche also includes commentary on his own writings, particularly his _Zarathustra_ and shows the opposition between the Dionysian and the Appolinian. Nietzsche entitles his chapters brazenly: \\"Why I Am So Wise\\", \\"Why I Am So Clever\\", \\"Why I Write Such Good Books\\", followed by his discussion of his individual works, and then \\"Why I Am Destiny\\". It has been suggested that Nietzsche may have been experiencing the early symptoms of his mental decline at this point and his complete mental collapse was to occur soon thereafter (rumored to be the result of syphilis, though probably wrongly). Nietzsche claims that he is wise because of his aesthetic sensitivities. He claims that he is clever because he can choose the right nutrition, climate, residence, and recreation for himself. He claims to write such good books because they open up a series of new, delicate, and noble experiences. And, he claims to be destiny because his anti-moral truths serve as intellectual dynamite which can topple the sickness inherent in Western culture. Indeed, Nietzsche writes, \\"I am no man, I am dynamite.\\" Nietzsche opposes Dionysus to \\"the Crucified\\", as his new god of life's exuberance to overcome the god of the heavenly otherworld. Nietzsche claims that he wants no believers and that he fears that he will be worshipped and pronounced holy in the future. He wants to assure that his publishers will prevent his book from doing \\"mischief\\". Nietzsche ends with the pronouncement that he is the great immoralist and that Dionysus has come to supercede \\"the Crucified\\".This translation of two of Nietzsche's important works includes commentary by Walter Kaufman. Some of Kaufman's commentary is useful; however Kaufman was prone to his own understanding of Nietzsche which he interjected all too often. Nevertheless, these two books stand out as important works which must be understood by those who seek to develop an understanding of the rise of nihilism in the Twentieth Century."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"Some say Nietzsche's biggest mistake was reducing everything into moral terms. I do not think this is the case. In fact, I find it more loutish to think logic can explain everything. Logic is only one of many approaches to knowledge. I say this because Nietzsche didn't write in traditional philosophical terms. He was one of the first great existentialists who looked at values for what they were; reflections of All Too Human needs, desires, wants, and the general human condition.

Would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"To the eyes of a general reader, Nietzsche's intense energy might be overwhelming, and his theories intimidating. That blonde beast which seems ready to bite into any flesh without the pangs of conscious inevitably conjures up images of a ferocious maniac who would wreck the world, bringing with it infinite sufferings to the grocery-store-citizens and the corn-field-peasants. In fact, this weak peasant who plows his land and prays before his god and whom Nietzsche despises seems like a much more amiable character to the general reader. Certainly, this peasant will not have the will-to-power to reshape the world, but he will be more or less the relative peace of normal life.Nietzsche, however, can not be so easily dismissed, and if one believes in the above description of the strong against the weak, he is missing the essence of Genealogy. In fact, Nietzsche's blonde beasts are not renegades against the world, instead, they are the masters of the world who recognize the inherent conditions of their environment; this grasp of reality gives them command over promise and forgetfulness, and allow them to set the directions of the world with whatever values they see fit. They are indeed strong, but they are not lawless monsters to be feared. The true renegades against this world are the people who follow the slave morality-they can not succeed in the world because they refuse to conform to the conditions of reality. Under the general rubric of empowerment established by Nietzsche, Weber follows in Politics as Vocation with a concrete example of self-empower in the role of the politician, and Plato also uses Nietzsche's methods in his search to understand the nature of man and society.The Genealogy of morals is in fact a genealogy of human weakness and suffering. This suffering arises because the conditions of civil life require activities that are in contradiction to the traditional life of the independent savages. This suffering consequently results in \\"bad consciousness\\", from which arises a belief within the weakling that he is inherently sinful and bad. Nietzsche writes,\\"I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace.\\" (N, p84)Nietzsche does not offer an outcast view on this point, and it is easy to imagine the decrease in freedom and increase in pain that men experienced when they turned from hunter and gathers to agriculturalists. When Ghengis Khan marched his horsemen into the lands of the Han or the Muscovites, the Mongolians horsemen despised the conquered natives for their pathetic existence as farmers who had to work all year long doing monotonous work but only to be disappointed by draught or flood.The agricultural life is only one aspect of the constraint of life of civil man. Living in the state, the man is often deprived of land and is confronted by civil forces thousands of times greater. To lessen his pain, the provincial agriculturalist turns toward the hopes of religion and such, giving rise to the slave Morality which Nietzsche passionately accuses. Nietzsche writes,\\"We stand before a discord that wants to be discordant, that enjoys itself in this suffering and even grows more self-confident and triumphant the more its own presupposition, its physiological capacity for life, decreases.\\" (p118)The situation which propelled the suffering people to turn toward \\"bad consciousness\\" is precisely the situation of the man with toothache. One should find a dentist and fill cavities when he has toothache; but those who are too lazy to find a doctor, or refuse to eat less candies will continue to suffer until it is too late and their teeth have already rotten away. But during and at the end of this process, in order to justify one's existence despite his sickness, the sick man tells others that the pain in his mouth is actually a great joy to have and teeth are bad anyway. Despite this effort to manipulate psychology, the man can not escape facts of his body, which is that without teeth he can not chew.The agriculturalists were forced into a new situation in which they suffered, and the solution was to turn to the morality of the weak. The morality of the weak, in fact, has become so prevalent that many feel it is the only way to live life despite the self-negation and hate inherent in it. As he points out this problem, Nietzsche does not offer a solution explicitly; rather than prescribing, Nietzsche describes an alternative way of life of the truthful and the noble-an alternative way to resolve the problems of civil life. These men do not suffer the pains of the weak, and the reader, desiring for relief from his corrupted existence, must feel a natural inclination toward the \\"nobler\\" way of life.Just before the weak gets ready to embark on a new life, however, they might be shocked back by Nietzsche vigorous depiction of the strong which makes them intimidating and unruly. But in fact, despite their strong \\"physicality\\", the strong are not anti-social monsters, but people who are the most willing to conform to the conditions of civil life. To understand their nature, we must delve into their qualities of strength, memory and forgetfulness. Nietzsche writes,\\"The knightly-aristocratic value judgments presupposed a powerful physically, a flourishing, abundant, even overflowing health, together with that which serves to preserve it: war, adventure, hunting, dancing, war games, and in general all that involves vigorous, free, joyful activity.\\" (p33)This passage must not be taken to mean that one must be a Napoleon to be strong, or one who has the right blood pressure and cholesterol level will be strong, or that those who are naturally smaller have no chances in salvation. Real physical health could indeed be beneficial, but the physicality here implies a physicality of the mind-It is the experiences from war and adventure which strengthen one's understanding of the world and of himself that Nietzsche cares about, not the acts of war or adventure themselves. The man of physicality is a man who knows his environment and who can take advantages of its situation to fulfill his ends,Nietzsche elucidates the specific quality of the strong when he describes their ability to forget and to remember. On forgetting, Nietzsche writes, forgetting offers\\"a little quietness, a little tabula rasa of the consciousness, to make room for new things, above all for the nobler functions and functionaries...\\" (p58)This forgetfulness at the core is an understanding over the situations of the world, it is about forgetting the senseless worries which only make man impotent. The weakling, after a disaster, will simply dwell upon the horrors of the disaster without understanding the natural causes. He will sink into a world of doubts and superstition, and as Nietzsche writes, he will think that he has done things intrinsically evil against his gods or ancestors. The strong person, on the other hand, has gained a knowledge of the world, and knows that there is no gods behind the clouds. Hence, they might worry, but they will not feel bitter or gain a \\"bad conscious\\" against themselves because of the rain. Eradicating worries-this is the essence of forgetfulness. Worry is passion-consuming, and only when the man is independent from can he have the mental capacity left over to gain a greater understanding of the world-he has more time to experience the reality of this world through adventure, through wars.The ability to make promises arises naturally from the lack of worry; the scientists who knows how clouds form can \\"promise\\" their coming. This promise could be for any ends which the active desire of the strong man wills. As Nietzsche writes, memory of the strong is \\"an active desire not to rid oneself, a desire for the continuance of something desired once, a real memory of the will.\\" (p58)Nietzsche also describes the memory of the slave morality and its relation to punishment, but this is a different memory than the strong man's memory. Nietzsche writes that the ascetic people's memory is \\"unforgettable, \`fixed,' with the aim of hypnotizing the entire nervous and intellectual system with these \`fixed ideas'\\" (p61) The strong memory is proactive, for it is \\"an active desire\\", the weak memory is reactive, for it is about \\"hypnotizing\\" the mind. One is used to help the will all its directions, while the wills in only one direction-the abyss into suffering.This individual who possesses the control over past and future, memory and promises, is the \\"emancipated individual\\". This person is liberated \\"from morality of customs\\". This emancipation is not accomplished through killing the innocents or running naked, but through the ability to set \\"measure of value\\" (p60) based on reality. Nietzsche writes, \\"...this mastery over himself also necessarily gives him mastery over circumstances, over nature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures.\\" Nietzsche is calling people to become \\"masters\\" over circumstances, not to destroy circumstances. The swordsman who is a master over his sword does not use his hands to fight, but is a master precisely because he uses the sword and knows where to find the best sword and how to use it the best.The difficulty of this mastery is precisely the difficulties of acquiring new languages: it is hard for an adult thrown into a different country to learn the native tongue, but unlike those of the slave morality who give up and blame oneself for inherent inability or blame the language for being evil, the strong people will patiently learn the language. All this requires is a little bravery! Nietzsche writes, man's suffering is\\"the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy and terribleness had rested hitherto.\\" (P85)Indeed, instinct is the ability of man to react quickly to familiar environment, but the civil man's life requires a new set of skills and understandings, new instincts. Just like the strong with their new tongue can now express themselves in anyway way they desire, the strong man in the greater world will be a master of the \\"language\\" of the civil society and thus gain the ability to set values and fulfill wills.The above ideas draw a positive conclusion from the genealogy, and offers hope to those who are brave, but the Genealogy is a pessimistic book. Nietzsche writes,\\"Man has all too long had an \`evil eye' for his natural inclinations, so that they have finally become inseparable from his \`bad conscience.' An attempt at the reverse would in itself be possible-but who is strong enough for it?... The attainment of this goal would require a different kind of spirit from that likely to appear in this present age...\\" (p96)Reading this, it seems that our age is doomed, and the essay in front of you has been promoting a pointless hope that even the hope's supposed originator does not have. But Nietzsche's words are no mere pessimism, they carry a pessimism that is angry at the \\"bad air\\" in life, it is pessimism with passion! Nietzsche is an angry mother telling her son that he has no future at all because he only drinks himself to death in a bar every night. The world perhaps has been dark, but this anger will be the lightening rod which shakes away the shells of our complacent irreverence toward truth and nature!When a reader is confounded by the world which Nietzsche depicts, he may turn to Politics as Vocation by Weber. In this essay, Weber paints a specific case of the grandiose problem of adaptation, or survival in new environments, in the person of the conflicted politician.Politics as Vocation inherits the essence of Genealogy of Morals in calling for the politician's mastery over circumstances. The politician must both be a master of his internal conditions, and his external conditions. Internally, for the politician to be a politician, he must have \\"passionate devotion to a \`cause'\\". This passion, or excessive energy, however, can lead to vanity and then the \\"striving for power ceases to be objective and becomes purely personal self-intoxication\\" (p116). In order to counterbalance this tendency, Weber says that the politician must have a \\"cool sense of proportion\\" (p115). One's ardent political passion is the fire that will draw the hearts of a thousands followers, however, if he gets carried away by the worshipping crowds, then the fire has burnt onto himself. In another word, there is no strength in the ecstasy of self-adulation, there is no power when one does not even notice the reality within himself and is merely fooled by vanity. Although the context is different, Weber is asking exactly what Nietzsche asked: the politician must know what words of praises he should forget and always know what he needs to remember to keep his crowds in control; he needs to constantly adapt to the changing conditions of the crowd so that he will always know its language and express his Will with this tongue.Extending this into a greater sphere, politicians must rely on the support of businessmen and interest groups, and he necessarily have to use his power to bring to his backers a profit on their investments. Living in this reality, Weber advises the politician to gain mastery over the situation, to know the goals of their political life with a clarity, and to pursue this goal with a sense of responsibility to the goal. In Nietzsche's terms, the politician must learn to forget and not fall into the moral trap of self-deprecation against every \\"unethical\\" act that he necessarily takes, but he must also always remember his promised end which he will reach with his mastery over the tools of politics.Behinds Webber, Plato also has similar things to say as Nietzsche. Nietzsche offers his readers hope with the model of the truthful he erects which all who have a little bravery could follow. Despite differences that can not be discussed here, Plato's creation of the noble city with the noble people could be regarded as an imaginary application of Nietzche's theory (although 2000 earlier).The whole of Republic is about understanding man and the world. Plato writes, \\"this very thing, good judgment, is clearly some kind of knowledge, for it's through knowledge, not ignorance, that people judge well.\\" (IV, 426e) The ultimate search for knowledge rests in understanding the light from the \\"sun\\", but practically speaking, Plato has made it his duty to search for human nature and the social nature of the Greek-state. The \\"tripartite soul\\" conclusion that he draws from the natural conditions of his world is contentious today, and Nietzsche certainly has much to say against it, however, the resolute search for understanding the internal and external conditions of man, however, is the same.Furthermore, in building his world, Plato asks his nobles to be able to forget certain things with the noble lie. The goal here is precisely the same as Nietzsche's: Plato wanted to leave the inessentials in the past, and prevent obsession with the \\"dark\\" things that gods supposed did or the petty accounts of who was truly \\"silver\\" or \\"gold\\", stories and accounts that will elude man on their journey for greater power. With their passion freed from the foolishness of the past, from the plays of dark shadows reflected from the fires in the cage, men and society as a whole is better positioned to get out of the hole of the past and embrace the glory of truth.In all, Nietzsche's strong men are not scary. The weak ones of the slave morality are not scary either, it is merely so sad to behold them that catapulted Nietzsche writes about them with such vehement anger. Nietzsche never says that the strong should be followed, and perhaps in other books of his one can draw differing conclusions about what Nietzsche really is promoting, however, from the Genealogy, it is clear that the contrast between the strong and the weak makes the strong a more appropriate role model. Again, one does not need to be scared of them, they are merely adroit adaptationists, masters of their environment, not destroyers."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"In his characteristic raging style and with a sometimes obscene vocabulary, Friedrich Nietzsche shouts (\`Am I understood?') his vision on the origin of morals (good, bad and evil), of guilt and bad conscience and on the value of ascetic ideals.The origin of moralsThe antithesis good-bad was established by \`noble' rulers who seized the right to create their own values. They called their egoistic actions good, which means \`of first rank'. Who were these masters? At the bottom all these noble races were \`blond beasts of prey in search of spoil, living the voluptuousness of victory and cruelty.'It was only when the aristocratic value judgments declined that the slaves (other names: the herd, the plebeians, the low, the mob, cellar rodents, insects, the oppressed, the downtrodden, the worm-eaten) could impose their own morality of unegoism, pity, self-sacrifice and self-abnegation on mankind.The moral revolt of the slaves began when their ressentiment became creative. This ressentiment is an imaginary revenge, a brain-sickness, by those who are denied true action. The egoistic \`good' of the rulers became \`evil'.However, the slave morality is an illness based on the phantasmagoria of anticipated bliss, the \`Last Judgment'. It is anti-life and a danger for the species \`man'.Guilt, Bad ConscienceGuilt has its origin in \`debts', in the contractual relations between creditor and debtor, in which the latter pledged that if he should fail to repay, he would substitute his debt by something else that he possessed (body, limbs, wife, freedom).The origin of bad conscience comes from the internalization of instincts which couldn't discharge themselves. All those instincts of the wild, free, prowling man (cruelty, destruction) turned against man himself, because the political organization (the State) protected itself against these old instincts of freedom.Real masters don't know what guilt is. One day, the man of the future, the Antichrist, will come, as a sovereign individual, liberated from the slave morality. He will call his dominating instincts his conscience.Ascetic idealsThe three slogans of the ascetic ideal are poverty, humility and chastity.But, an ascetic planet is a nook of disgruntled, arrogant creatures filled with a profound disgust of themselves, of the earth, of all life.Ascetic life is a self-contradiction. It is an attempt to employ force to block the wells of force, beauty and joy. Its pleasure is sought in decay, pain, ugliness, voluntary deprivation, self-mortification, self-flagellation.The allies of the ascetics are the scientists (\`these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians'), with their belief that truth cannot be criticized (?) and with their aim to dissuade man from his former respect for himself.What we need is the freedom of \`Nothing is true, everything is permitted.'EvaluationThe powerful, the beasts of prey use(d) religion and its slave morality as a means to keep their power and wealth intact. The many accepted it, until in some countries general free elections (democratic rule) put the power base of the beasts in danger. The beasts had a new problem to face: how to control democracy.Nietzsche's anti-democratic, anti-scientific, barbaric, full spectrum egoistic rule is unacceptable and indefendable in our \`enlightened\` world.However, his shout to mankind to wake up and to live a real \`human' life, free from a slave morality, is still highly needed and even more than ever before.These brutal, raw, blasphemous essays didn't loose one ounce of their invective and polemic power. A real catharsis.A must read for all Nietzsche fans, but with the necessary caution."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"Rivalling Hegel's Phenomenology, Plato's Republic, and the Bible, Nietzsche's Genealogy successfully challenges historicism and the foundations upon which history is based.

He is not trying to hide his dislike for traditional values and his contempt for early Christians, whom he holds responsible for the rise of these values, is very evident. &quot;Genealogy&quot; besides being a polemic, influenced later developments on the ideas of guilt and bad conscience. Nietzsche clearly anticipates Freud (who was 12 years his junior) in explaining guilt as not something that comes from above as a punishment for wrongdoing, but as the aggressive impulse directed inward, against oneself.&quot;Ecce Homo&quot; is Nietzsche's philosophical autobiography that attacks the unselfish ideal, metaphysical abstractions, and traditional views of morality. N. predict wars &quot;the like of which have never been seen on earth,&quot; but this is probably not due to his as much to his seeing powers as to his recollection of the Book of Revelations. Nietzsche cannot get away from his Christian background and from the intellectual atmospher of 19th century Europe, try as he might. Purely as a writer, he is more talented than any major philosopher I know. He is also the first major philosopher to make serious investigations into subconscious motives and processes. But in retrospect, he overestimated the impact that the theory of evolution and the general process of secularization would have on Western societies. This led him to overestimate his historical importance as a prophet. In the end, he was a creative and insightful man who rose against standardization and blandness of his age, and againt unquestionable beliefs in traditional values, though as a prophet he has the usual shortcoming of being all-too-human."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"On The Geneology of Morals -- This work is clearest when read as a sequel to Beyond Good &amp; Evil.

It laid the groundwork for such 20th century thinkers as Foucault and Deleuze, though they would never reach Nietzsche's complexity and moral sophistication. In the preface to the book, Nietzsche proposes the project of investigating the origins of morality on the grounds that human beings are unknown to themselves. He is ultimately concerned with the development of moral prejudices, and the value of morality itself. He criticizes mankind in its acceptance of moral principles, and writes: \\"we need a critique of moral values, the value of these values themselves must first be called in question-and for that there is needed a knowledge of the conditions and circumstances in which they grew, under which they evolved and changed\\" (456).Nietzsche begins the essay (Good and Evil, Good and Bad), with a philological examination of the words and roots of the words related to good and evil, and a delimitation of their evolution. He makes a connection between the creations of words and places them within the historical context of rulers and nobility. Linguistically, Nietzsche has discovered that the \`good' is linked with nobility. He writes: \\"everywhere \`noble,' \`aristocratic' in the social sense, is the basic concept from which \`good' in the sense of \`with aristocratic soul,' \`noble,'\\" (464). Alternatively, words associated with the \`bad' invariably were linked with the \`plain,' \`simple,' and \`low.' In this way, morality as a human construction is an extension of power, wealth, and civilization. The origin of evil is intertwined with priestly aristocracies.Nietzsche moves into a discussion of a shift in the history of morality, in which the morality of the priestly aristocracy is superceded by Jewish morality. For Nietzsche, the Jews inverted the morality of nobility and established a system which places value on the lower order of mankind. He indicates that the Jews believed \\"the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good; the suffering, deprived, sick, ugly alone are pious, alone are blessed by God\\" (470). Nietzsche describes this turn as \`the slave revolt' of morality. He describes the triumph of Judeo-Christian morality over the previous system of values, and indicates that this turn is a triumph for the herd instinct, and for ressentiment. He writes: \\"The slave revolt in morality begins when ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values: the ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction, that of deeds, and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge\\" (472). Noble morality develops as an affirmation of itself, while slave morality always says No to what is external to it. For Nietzsche, the need to constantly turn outward to an external \`other' and place judgment on it is the essence of ressentiment.In the proceeding section of the treatise, Nietzsche discusses civilization's taming of man the animal. Here he writes: \\"Supposing that what is at any rate believed to be the \`truth' really is true, and the meaning of all culture is the reduction of the beast of prey \`man' to a tame and civilized animal, a domestic animal, then one would undoubtedly have to regard all those instincts of reaction and ressentiment through whose aid the noble races and their ideal were finally confounded and overthrown as the actual instruments of culture\\" (478). Nietzsche insists that Europe's taming of man is a tremendous danger, for we are made to be weary of our own being. For Nietzsche, this weariness and fear of man has compelled us to lose our love for him, to turn our backs on our instincts, to reject affirmation."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"I should note up front that my review refers to the Vintage edition--the review and the rating pertain to Kaufmann's translation only, not to Nietzsche's text. Nietzsche's work is a classic and should be read by anyone with an interest in philosophy or related fields. That point, I think, goes without saying. What does need to be said is which translation you should choose to read it in. Kaufmann's is, pretty much, the standard translation. And, for the most part, his translation is true to Nietzsche's German. But it suffers in one important way, and that is how it conflates Hegel's idealism and Nietzsche's thought through the use of a Hegelian, idealist vocabulary. To be sure, Nietzsche draws on Hegel a lot, but Kaufmann's translation misleads the reader into thinking that there are more similarities than there actually are. It also makes this translation unbearably difficult to read.The second problem I have with this particular edition is that Kaufmann's notes are so shallow, and not really helpful at all. A perfect example is on the first page of the first essay, where Nietzsche abandons his native German for a moment and refers to the English Psychologists pushing the \\"partie honteuse\\" of our inner world into view. Kaufmann leaves the phrase untranslated, as he ought, and lets a note do the work of translating it. His note says simply, \\"shame.\\" In my view, it may be as if he had just omitted the note altogether, because this tells me almost nothing about what Nietzsche means, and doesn't even attempt to get at his metaphor. If one were to turn to Clark and Swenson's translation, put out by Hackett (On the Genealogy of Morality), however, one would learn that the phrase means \\"shameful part\\" and when pluralized it is equivalent to the English phrase \\"private parts.\\" This is a helpful note which explains Nietzsche's metaphor and the connotations he's aiming for.I'll give this edition three stars because I have to compare it to others, such as Clark and Swenson's, above, or Douglas Smith's translation in the Oxford World Classics edition (On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic. By way of clarification and supplement to my last book Beyond Good and Evil (Oxford World's Classics)). In many ways Smith most avoids the \\"Hegel-ization\\" of Nietzsche (although it is possible to overdo it, and Smith might be guilty). But in my estimation, Clark and Swenson's is the best, deserving five stars, and Smith's is a close second, perhaps deserving four and a half, or four and three-quarters, not least because Clark and Swenson's notes are better. (Smith's would get five stars if I reviewed it.) Kaufmann's is so far behind these that I cannot justify giving it more than three stars. For a more formulaic, objective approach, you can subtract one star from the translation for at times confusing Nietzsche's thought, and doing so in a confusing way, and subtract one from the edition in general for having mediocre notes. Then you also end up with my three-star rating."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"This is a complex, often confusing, yet a very important book, because it gets at the bottom line of one of the thorniest conundrums ever to face man: The problem of where his morals originate. Although several books have readdressed this issue in light of new findings in psychology (Freud in his Civilization and its discontents), social psychology (Robert Wright's Moral Man), and Anthropology (Ernest Becker, Angel in Armor) just to name my three favorites, none have done so with either the emotional intensity or philosophical depth as has Nietzsche.In this, Nietzsche last book, he locates the origins of morality at the intersection of man's transition from hunter-gathers to agrarian societies. With the advent of agrarian societies, there was a crossover in the survival value of violence versus that of cooperation: man's instinct for violence cease to have the survival value equal to that of cooperation. And as a result, he was forced to learn to outwardly suppress his violent instincts by more and more turning them inward. This conversion of outward violence into an inner struggle, allowed man to use his conscience to carve out an inner life, which was a mixed blessing as there were both collateral benefits and penalties. Along with guilt and bad conscience, man also acquired a sense of beauty. The upshot of his inner struggles was that they eventually got resolved through the development of religion: Bad conscience and moral guilt could be redeemed or forgiven through the grace and mercy of a higher, morally perfect, being.With this as introduction, Nietzsche's story of morality takes place in three parts over the span of three essays, each of which elaborates a different aspect of the details of his theory.The first essay deals with Good and Evil, and examines the evolution of two different kinds of moral codes: that of the master and that of the slave. The second essay deals directly with guilt, bad conscience and related moral concepts and issues. Here, Nietzsche notes that initially guilt lacked moral overtones, and was more like a monetary debt, in which the debtor was due payment and the debtor, was punished. The third essay struggles with the question of: What is the meaning of Ascetic Ideals, or, with why different cultures pursued a life of self-denial. Nietzsche's answer is that self-denial gives the individual more power and control over himself and is therefore life affirming rather than life denying.Nietzsche's writing is dense and not for the faint-hearted, but ultimately rewarding. Five stars."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"Nietzsche gives an historic account of how morality has developed in the world. Unlike many others, Nietzsche takes a historical approach to the development of morality and gets into the etymology of the the ancient languages. The &quot;good vs. bad/good vs. evil&quot; distinction is very important to get a grasp of as well as the concepts of guilt, conscience, and the ascetic ideal. Along with Beyond Good and Evil, this book should be one of the first by Nietzsche that you should read, in my opinion, to get a good grasp on Nietzsche's thought. Great analysis of Christianity too!"},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"Perhaps the most readable book for a Nietzsche neophyte, yet a stunningly accurate and psychologically valid glimpse into the &quot;moral,&quot; and an explanation of what that realistically entails.

A warning, however: this will probably offend those who believe in modern democratic ideals."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"The translation is very good in this book and it has enough remarks from the translator to not be overwhelming but still give you the information you need to understand some of the things Nietzsche references from his time. The paper and binding are a good quality. The way I read tends to wear down bindings, but this one had no trouble.The content itself is great. Genealogy of Morals is extremely insightful into the human psyche and explains very well where a lot of our morality stems from. What's even more interesting, in my opinion, is that he talks at length about what the psychology of this morality causes in society.Ecce Homo is great on another level. It's rare to see a great thinker make great note of his faults. He talks about his thought process for each book he wrote. While this may not seem greatly informative I think this books main purpose it to encourage people to not deify him the way we tend to do with long dead figures.Nietzsche is a great writer, but if this is your first book of his I would strongly recommend reading it in entirety before agreeing or disagreeing with it. He likes to speak in extremes. I find this a great approach when it comes to understanding his entire book, but it's easy to get the wrong idea if you only read part of it. For instance, he's call the Jews some of the most harmful forces in human history and then many pages later (and with some of these things even books later) he will say that despite that their general mentality is essential to our survival and that any form of antisemitism is horrifically misguided. In general it's best not to quote Nietzsche, rather paraphrasing tends to be more accurate. He writes so that you have to actually read his work, not just read the wiki on him."},{"Title":"On the Genealogy of Morals / Ecce Homo","review":"\\"The Genealogy of Morals\\" is one of the more straightforward and easily-comprehensible of Nietzsche's philosophical works. It is a sustained focus on a single topic -- the origins of morality -- and is comprised of three related essays which explore morality and the nature of \\"ressentiment,\\" or \\"suppressed resentment.\\" According to Nietzsche, \\"ressentiment\\" is the fundamental motive force, the \\"will to power,\\" of the religious (specifically the Christian) temperament and character, and results in moral and spiritual corruption: hence Nietzsche's claim that Christianity is the greatest of all evils because it fosters, nurtures, and embodies \\"ressentiment.\\" Although Nietzsche's diatribes against the Christian religion sometimes get tedious, his psychological analysis of the origins of morality is insightful and intriguing.The companion piece in this edition, \\"Ecce Homo,\\" is one of the most entertaining and fascinating autobiographies ever written. Nietzsche recounts events, people, and places that were important to him personally and significant for the development of his philosophy; he offers summaries and \\"humble\\" appraisals of his philosophical works (appraisals which are as provocative as they are \\"humble\\"); and he claims to have destroyed Christianity and invented psychology -- and while these claims sound exaggerated, they're true from a Nietzschean perspective.

This is so the reader could see how light pollution affects the sky's appearance. The photos are disappointing. First, it is hard to see anything in them unless you have magnifying glasses or are looking under strong light. Secondly, for each part of the sky, the 3 photos don't exactly match.

Compiled from fragments of clay tablets representing Sumerian, Chaldean and Assyrian cultures this Epic has survived for over five thousand years--with the capacity to fascinate modern man. The Penguin Classics edition, whose cover displays the famous scene of Gilgamesh wrestling lions, opens with an extensive and scholarly Introduction by N. K. Sandars, fully as long as the actual saga. With occasional short lines of free verse, this timeless tale is rendered mainly in prose--making it much more readable. This edition also offers a map of the Ancient World to oriente readers.Perhaps originally written as a thesis these erudite pages present the following topics: the History of the Epic, The Discovery of the various Tablets, Historical Background, Literary Background, The Hero of the Epic, The Principal Gods of the Epic, The Story itself, the Survival of the Epic, the Diction of the Epic, and Remarks on this Version.Recited by ancient poets long before committed to clay and preserved in a visual format this story opens with a Prologue about Gilgamesh, King of the mighty city of Uruk--separated from the Persian Gulf by the biblical city of Ur. The seven successive sections of the epic present the Coming of Enkidu, the Forest Journey, The Death of Enkidu, the Search for Everlasting Life (or Eternal Youth), followed by a tale-within-a-tale: The Great Flood sent by wrathful gods, the Return of the hero, and ultimately the death of the protagonist, Gilgamesh.As with the Homeric epics, this was a time when men interacted with powerful gods--beings often at war with each other who demonstrate all the vices and foibles of manipulated mankind. \\"A mixture of pure adventure, of morality and of tragedy,\\" the story presents a wise and godlike King on a quest to preserve mankind in the flower of youth, and to cheat his inevitable end in the dusty embrace of Death. Here we find all the passions of mortal man: love, honor, lust,vainglory, friendship, self doubt, ambition, grief, and determination. Despite his crown, manly beauty and godly heritage, Gilgamesh proves a splendid Everyman who represents the human race in its age old struggle with the meaning of life.Even the frequent use of epithets and the required repetition of oral tradition do not prevent this prose version from being both readable and entertaining.

Like &quot;Beowulf,&quot; Gilgamesh is a king whose initial goal is to establish his own eternal fame.Gilgamesh, the child of a goddess and a priest, is, at the start of the epic, driving the people of Uruk crazy with his boundless energy and restless enthusiasm. The people beseech the gods to send a companion for their king. This companion comes in the form of Enkidu, a wild man who communes with beasts in the forest. Gradually, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become the closest of friends. While the search for fame and glory continues, it becomes only too clear that the focal point of the epic is the relationship between the king and the wild man. Without peers or equals, the two live almost exclusively for each other and through each other. Other ancient epics, of course, feature complicated relationships, but &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is rare in the sheer intensity of the homosocial bond.The wanderings and quests of Gilgamesh and Enkidu find their highest purpose in the pursuit of eternal life, which, again, surfaces because of Gilgamesh's relationship with Enkidu. Mortality becomes the overarching theme of the epic. A theme which we continue to deal with, the epic intersects the drive of science, pseudoscience, and magic throughout human history.Stylistically, the most notable feature of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is repetition of phrases. Even in conversation, one sees the same sentence, sometimes modified, come from two or more characters, even at relatively great distance from each other in the actual text. This demonstrates very powerfully the oral origins of the epic. Repetition, which could become tiresome, draws us further into the story, as it forces us to pay closer attention to the significance of what is being said, as well as important numbers (7 and 12 appear most frequently), and images.The adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu amongst gods, beasts, and natural forces, are compelling, interesting reading. Certain parallels between the ancient Mesopotamian epic and the Judeo-Christian biblical narratives that post-date it, have been well-documented. N.K. Sandars' introduction is extremely detailed, giving the history of the region surrounding Uruk, the history of the text itself and how it has been read, compiled, and studied since the 19th century, provides excellent background on the complicated mythology of the ancient Mesopotamians. A solid read altogether."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I ordered the hardcover edition of this book from ... , and it is unfortunate that it is not readily available in the US. At least the softcover edition is now available, and worth acquiring for anyone interested in a glimpse of what life-and thought-was like nearly 4000 years ago. I was unaware, before reading this volume, that Gilgamesh, despite it's significance and popularity in its day, does not come down to us in any complete form. George provides both a background of the civilization that produced Gilgamesh and also a history of the various partial versions that have survived and been found. Throughout the text he is careful to explain where different versions disagree, where he has interpolated fragments from other versions to fill gaps, and where no known version exists. He appends translations of various fragments and of earlier Sumerian poems of &quot;Bilgames&quot;. While lacking the completeness, and therefore coherence, of the Homeric epics, George's translation of Gilgamesh offers at least a peephole, if not truly a window, into a civilization very far removed from ours. Despite the distance the desires and fears-particularly the fear of death-expressed seem very human and recognizable. In fact, and in spite of, the archaic structure of the verse, Gilgamesh seems more human to me than many of the semi-divine heros of Homer. Certainly not light reading, but very much worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"This was the first translation of Gilgamesh that ever really grabbed me. I had waded through plodding, tedious translations (mostly in prose) before, and been left feeling like Assyriologists must be the most bored people in the world.George's translation, however, is in verse and adds vigor to what appeared to me, for years, to be a bland jumping off point for bigger and better epics of later eras. I flew through this translation, hanging on every word, and was almost sad to see it end.The notes and critical bits were nice as well, and the numerous lacunae showed me just how little of the full story we really have. Heartbreaking, really, and it made appreciate those bored people I used to pity.If you're new to The Epic of Gilgamesh and want an engaging, readable verse translation of it, this is the one to buy.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a fascinating tale of great historical importance. Composed 1500 years before Homer's epics, the story is one that modern man can readily understand and appreciate. Gilgamesh was the more than capable ruler of the ancient town of Uruk; his strength and physical beauty were unmatched by any in the land, and his subjects adored him. Although he possessed so much, Gilgamesh wanted desperately to live forever like a god. He was two-thirds god and one-third human, but he refused to accept his destiny to die. If it were his lot to die, he wanted to perform great deeds so that his name would never be forgotten.The story opens with the story of Enkidu, a wild man of nature who was to become Gilgamesh's best friend and accompany him on his dangerous journeys. The first trip takes them to the Land of the Cedars where Gilgamesh sets out to kill Humbaba, the guardian of the forest. When he later slays the Bull of Heaven, the anger of the gods is turned upon him and Enkidu, leading to new suffering by Gilgamesh. In desperation, he seeks Utnapishtim in the land of the gods; Utnapishtim was granted eternal life after preserving mankind in the wake of a great flood. Gilgamesh again finds only heartache for his troubles. Returning to Uruk, he preserves the story of his journeys and deeds in writing, and it is, perhaps ironically, in this written record that Gilgamesh is recognized today for the great man he was.One learns much about the ancient gods in this tale, and the story of the great goddess Ishtar's role in the related events is pretty amazing. When Ishtar invited Gilgamesh to be her husband, he issued forth a litany of former lovers whom Ishtar had turned out and cursed, boldly rebuffing Ishtar's advances. It is this brave act that led to most of Gilgamesh's later troubles. Even Enkidu, whose reported bravery is belied by his reluctance to aid his noble friend in several situations, is rather astonishingly disrespectful to the goddess.N. K. Sandars does a remarkable job of putting the epic in its proper historical and literary perspective. A glossary of relevant gods and characters is particularly helpful. Along with providing a short history of the man, the gods, and the epic itself, she goes to great lengths to explain her method of producing this modern translation. There is no one extant copy of the Epic of Gilgamesh; a number of tablets, in varying degrees of condition and legibility and differing somewhat in the details of the story, have been compared and contrasted in order to produce the story as she presents it. Perhaps the most useful part of the introduction is an explanation of the form and style of the text. The text was originally told in verse, and Sandars explains that she chose to produce the text in narrative form in the interest of readability. As the order of events is not universally agreed upon, she explains why she chose the order she did for events. One annoying feature of the text, at least to the modern reader, is the constant word for word repetition of speeches between characters, and Sandars does the reader a great service by alerting him/her to this and explaining the rationale behind its use by the ancient writers.The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest written texts in history, yet its theme is timeless, its characters all too human, and its appeal universal. Sandars' modern, narrative translation transforms the historically important epic into an eminently readable, quite enjoyable story. The tale of a great flood in this incredibly ancient tale has raised eyebrows ever since the text was discovered. The parallels to the Biblical tale of Noah are obvious, adding great strength to the argument that the legend or memory of a cataclysmic flood was common to diverse cultures in the ancient Near East. Those familiar with the ideas of Zechariah Sitchin will find this story especially fascinating and illuminating."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story-- perhaps 4 thousand to 5 thousand years old. Originating in ancient Sumeria, it spread throughout the Near East and the version we have has been reconstructed from Akkadian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Hurrian translations inscribed on clay tablets. Its themes and motifs (including a divinely ordained Great Flood) influenced the development of other great poetic works and mythological traditions, including those of ancient Egypt, Israel, and Greece.The story here is mythic and powerful. I won't try to summarize it other than to say that it raises truly timeless questions about what it means to be human-- questions about love sex and friendship, about nature and civilization, of the simple joys in life and about our desire to do great deeds, about our fear of death and the impossiblity of escaping it.There is much about this story that may seem archaic, naive, and odd to first-time readers, ranging from the description of Gilgamesh as 2/3 god, 1/3 mortal (which may perplex folks who try to work out how that can happen hereditarily speaking), to the repetivite narrative voice that stem from the conventions of orally performed poetry (which does seem a bit odd when being *read* silently in a book). However, once one learns to see beyond these curious features, it is apparent that _The Epic of Gilgamesh_, as it has come down to us, is a brilliant and clever piece of poetic craftsmanship and storytelling. The use of recurrent images and motifs, the narrative symmetries and ironies (e.g. how, after Enkidu's death, Gilgamesh leaves the city, puts on animal furs, and goes off into the wilderness... becoming much like Enkidu was at the beginning of the story). In truth, I would not hesitate to say that the _Epic of Gilgamesh_ is, from a poetic point of view, as complex and sophisticated as any of Shakespeare's plays.The Penguin edition of the poem, I should add, offers a loose prose translation that is quite satisfactory and extremely readable. Those who are more interested in the stylistic qualities of the original may prefer a more literal translation, while those more interested in the history of the poem and its sources, may prefer a more scholarly edition-- but for the general or first time reader, Sandars' edition should be more than suitable."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read)."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Not having read scores of Gilgamesh translations, I really don't know how many stars to give this one, but I am very happy with it. In addition to giving a 'complete' version, mainly from Standard Babylonian texts from the Nineveh library but supplemented from other sources (even Hittite editions) for the sake of having a complete story, the book publishes in separate chapters, older, more fragmentary sources. Even Sumerian versions are covered. Also, in the beginning is an excellent treatment of the history of the rebirth of the Gilgamesh epic and the state of cuneiform translation and research in general. No speculation about the epic on literary or religious levels is given. George doesn't bother to tell us about the literary or historical relationship of Gilgamesh to the bible, nor does he try to use the epic to define for us Mesopotamian religion. He is simply interested in providing a good translation and is very thorough and scientific in cataloguing his sources and judgment calls, yet he hands us a lively and fluid English text."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I recommend this Penguin Classic, but it offers more thorough scholarly apparatus than usual for the series. This is not meant as a criticism! But, a beginner may find a \\"version\\" such as Stephen Mitchell's easier to start with for an overview of the storyline, and a briefer introduction and helpful endnotes. The poem itself is not lengthy, but the ancillary texts and sources, as Andrew George shows us, do take up considerable space which may please enthusiasts but discourage newcomers to this epic poem.George prepared for Oxford UP in 1999 a two-volume edition, and this Penguin adapts the core of the English translation for a wider audience. It appears ideal for a college classroom or the reader wanting to learn more about the lacunae, the gaps, the language, and the editorial decisions made by George and fellow translators. A fascinating appendix shows how out of grammatical markers, syllabic, and half-syllabic cuneiform incisions the sounds and rhythms and absences that fill this most ancient of narratives turn into what we can understand. To a point.Terms such as \\"louvre-door,\\" \\"glacis-slope,\\" \\"hie to the forge,\\" and notably Ishtar's exhortation to \\"stroke my quim\\" give a rather archaic diction to parts of the translation. George aims obviously for precision in such terminology, but this does clash with the more demotic vernacular chosen by Mitchell in his popularization. Mitchell's also considerably more erotic and develops passages that in their original state, reading George, remain terse. Again, George approaches the thousands of fragments that are still being assembled nearly 150 years after their discovery and observes that this epic is still, amazingly and poignantly, one in progress as we await trained Assyriologists able to decipher not only the later Akkadian but the considerably more challenging and often cryptic Sumerian sources. It's a shame that in a region where so many billions have been spent to destroy the area between the Tigris & Euphrates that a few thousands can not be provided for the study and restoration of the oldest story text we have ever found."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Andrew George gives you the best of both worlds. He reprints the Old Babylonian version of Gilgamesh, which I find the poetry to be gritty, raw and exciting. (. . . until the maggot dropped from his nose.) He also gives you the newer versions of the story,including tablets 11 and 12. I found that these two additions to the story, written at a later date, did not quite match the OB version. Each version twisted the story from the original Man vs. Hero, into Man vs. King and then Man vs. God. I do believe, though, that this is the best of any Gilgamesh book you will read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I fully agree with the previous reviewers who praised the qualities of this book and the translations by Andrew George. The introduction and supplementary material that accompany the standard version of the Gilgamesh epic really help to put this story into the proper historical context.This was my first reading of the Gilgamesh epic and what surprised me most about this story was its humanistic focus, especially considering that most of the literature at that time focused on the gods and how they created the universe and mankind. We learn about the superhuman heroes Gilgamesh and Enkidu, who openly spited the gods by performing deeds that ran counter to their interests. After Enkidu dies, however, Gilgamesh gets a reality check and attempts to avoid a similar fate by searching for the secret of immortality. Instead, he only discovers that even a powerful king like himself will never be able to escape death. But he also learns that instead of performing silly quests like searching for immortality, Gilgamesh should &quot;seize the day&quot; and actively use his time among the living to perform actions that will make a king great to his people. In this way, he will be able to ensure that his name lives on among future generations. Now this is great literature!As other reviewers have commented, Andrew George's translation of the Gilgamesh epic is very approachable and makes for very entertaining reading, even for the general reader (like me) who is not a serious student of ancient history. However, if you want to study the history of the Western literary canon, you have to start here in Mesopotamia."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Warning.

The epic of Gilgamesh, is one of the oldest known scriptures ever written by the human hand. Yet still the epic captivates audiences and the reader while still delivering a powerful and meaningful message about our humanity. The epic itself is one of the most interesting accounts of a Sumerian hero. However the language of the unknown author has the capacity to move, and to entice. The novel continually involves the reader, even from the beginning, with a question. It asks the reader to identify with the characters as if they were the characters and to still remember the ultimate lesson of life, to enjoy. Not only addressing the elements to keep a reader's attention, but revealing powerful and important aspects of being human. Among these is to understand ones place, and to realize that life is only what we make it, and how we live it.

The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, one story about the Epic of Gilgamesh concerns a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist who ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true). Unfortunately, I don't recall the guy's name anymore, but it's true.The Epic of Gilgamesh is notable for the fact that it's considered the oldest text understandable by a modern reader without special knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--since his concerns are easily understandable to a reader of any day and age. He is motivated by several concerns, such as his fear of mortality and death, the ephemerality of life on earth, the desire to accomplish heroic feats to prove himself worthy of immortality, to protect his friends and loved ones, and to destroy evil and preserve the good. He is also concerned with honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, and happiness.It's also the most ancient text for which we have an author attribution. Around 1200-1300 BC, a Mesopotamian by the name of Sun-Liq-Unnini compiled the well-known \\"Standard Version\\" of the epic. He wasn't actually the \\"author\\" of the text, but it seems likely he was steeped in the historical tradition and the different versions of the text which had come down over the years in both the Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, and he seems to have gone to some trouble to gather and compile the best versions of the various stories and legends about Gilgamesh in his \\"edition,\\" which became the most widespread and popular version.We also know that he was employed as an exorcist, an important job in Mesopotamian society, since they were called on for everything from driving out evil spirits in the ill and sick, to making sure dwellings and new buildings were free of evil spirits, to blessing farmland that was about to be planted for the new season.By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 B.C., but these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.Another interesting historical character is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"A half god and half human, Gilgamesh was a King of the city of Uruk.

Sandars translation for approximately 31 years now - not nearly as long as this tract has been around. I probably don't have to inform you (if you've dug this deep into Amazon checking out Gilgamesh) that our discovery of its existence - a little over a century ago caused quite a stir - we actually found there was a text, scribed in the middle east no less, that was indisputably of greater antiquity than the Bible. Many opine that the inception of comparative religious studies was the result.Nowadays - we have a plethora of Gilgamesh translations from which to choose - the Gardner, most notably, perhaps.

Theyfound a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains,among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood,though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the otherGods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he wasbut two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions!

Historians think that Gilgamesh might have been a ruler in southern Mesopotamia, although there is no historical evidence for any of the exploits covered in this narrative or the five poems written about the hero. Cultural anthropologists believe that Gilgamesh was a great king whose name became associated with pretty much every major legend or mythical tale in that culture.Unlike some translations that go tablet by tablet, this translation by N. K. Sandars breaks the epic down into six main narratives. The two most famous of these would be &quot;The Story of the Flood,&quot; with its obvious parallels to the stories of a great flood in the Bible and Ovid's &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; and &quot;The Coming of Enkidu&quot;/&quot;Ishtar and Gilgamesh, and the Death of Enkidu,&quot; which Captain Jean-Luc Picard narrates in the Star Trek: Next Generation episode &quot;Darmok.&quot; Both of these are relevant points because in working from the known to the unknown they are both avenues of introducing Gilgamesh to which students will readily await. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the fundamental mythic tale in Western Civilization, but tends to be relegated to the shelf in most classes unless in happens to be included in an anthology. His quests for the Spring of Youth and immortality have been echoed in so many other tales. I have always thought that Gilgamesh is a more important figure than Beowulf, but that would be a decidedly minority opinion. I just wish this little volume was not so expensive because I think that hurts its utility in classes dealing with mythology, legend and/or folklore."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I'd heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh over and over again from history classes, to the use of it to confirm events in the Bible, but had never bothered to read it before. Perhaps it is the word \\"Epic\\" in the title that had conjured up mental images of a giant tome written in verse that deep down I knew I would never comprehend. Then suddenly one day I decided that I needed to at least OWN a copy, even if I never managed to read it. When I opened up my amazon box, imagine my surprise when I pulled out a thin little book of only 128 pages.The introduction is well worth the read, and actually makes up the majority of the book. For people like myself who had no prior knowledge of what the Epic of Gilgamesh really was, this intro is invaluable. It gives not only the history of the tablets, but also goes into the meaning of the tale, and tons of historical information that really added to my enjoyment of the story.The actual Epic goes from page 61-119 and is very interesting to those who have read other mythologies. The characters are very human though I won't say that in today's frame of mind that they are entirely likeable. The story follows King Gilgamesh who is 1/3 human and 2/3 god though the discovery of his brother, their quest to fight Humbaba, their battle with the Bull of the Heavens, and Gilgamesh's search for immortality. To be honest, I wouldn't say that this is a \\"must read\\" but it is certainly a very interesting read, simple to follow (at least in this translation) and a real eye opener to the beliefs and customs of the time.I highly recommend this version to those that are reading it outside of a classroom or discussion setting, because the intro was a lifesaver with the background and historical context that it gave. The version I read was the Penguin Classics translated by N. K. Sandars."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh, which pre-dates Homer by some 1,500 years, somehow survived on clay tablets and was translated in the 1800's. It tells the story of Gilgamesh, 2/3 god and 1/3 man, king of Uruk.In the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is a strong king, building an amazing and beautiful city. However, the people are unhappy with him because he takes all sons from their fathers and leaves no virgin to her lover. There being no man alive who can contend with Gilgamesh, Aruru (a goddess of creation) made Enkidu, a man-beast strong enough for Gilgamesh to respect. After a harlot sleeps with Enkidu, he leaves the forest and comes to town to find Gilgamesh. The two wrestle, and after some time, Gilgamesh is finally able to throw down Enkidu. But Enkidu's strength is admired by Gilgamesh and the two become as brothers.Wanting to forever keep his name the mightiest, Gilgamesh goes with Enkidu and slays the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba. This act greatly angered the god Enlil - and this act would ultimately bring great heartache to Gilgamesh.The goddess Ishtar was impressed with Gilgamesh's actions, and she asked him to be her lover. But Gilgamesh then rattled off a list of all the men she had hurt and her wicked actions, and gave her a &quot;thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Angered, she had Anu create the Bull of Heaven, which attacked Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They eventually slay the bull, but victory is fleeting. In the aftermath, Enlil gets revenge by sickening Enkidu with a deathly illness.Gilgamesh now goes on a long journey, seeking everlasting life. He visits Utnapishtim, man of everlasting life. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about the great flood that wiped out most all of the world - save for what was on his ark. For preserving life on earth, Utnapishtim was given eternal life. But for Gilgamesh to be young again, he must recover a flower at the bottom of the sea. he gets it, but it's quickly taken away by a serpent. Everlasting life is not to be Gilgamesh's lot.He returns home, and is exalted as the greatest king ever. Gilgamesh lears important lessons about justice and mortality. His journeys and experiences have truly made him a great king.While redundant at points, this is an amazing tale, told in a straightforward manner that makes it a swift and compelling read. A truly amazing work."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"It is hard to put into words how meaningful this book is. It was inscribed into clay tablets some time around 2000 BC--the same distance from Christ as we are--yet its central message is universal. The message is that man, fundamentally, is committed to establishing a legacy.What does \\"legacy\\" mean? It means status after death. Men fiendishly pursue status in life, and they seek to perpetuate that status to last even after they have died. Gilgamesh reveals to us that this is not some culturally created ambition, but is rather a psychological fixture that transcends the ages, stretching from this exact moment all the way back to the beginning of history. And rest assured that men will be striving to build their legacies until the end of history, too.As the modern industrial age has clearly demonstrated, having all of one's material needs met is not enough for happiness. Gilgamesh illustrated this four millennia ago. He is the king of Uruk, has access to any woman he wants, is indomitable on the field of battle, is loved by the Gods, and surely has as much food and riches as he can imagine. Yet this man, who seemingly has everything, is brought to tears by the thought that he is a finite being who will inevitably die. His solution to this problem is to forsake his life of riches and journey into the forest to slay the monstrous Humbaba. As he puts it,\\"If I die in that country I will die without rancour, [...] Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures; men will say of me, \`Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba.' Long after the child has been born in my house, they will say it, and remember\\" (71, 2).For status, Gilgamesh puts it all on the line. He is ready to die fighting a savage beast, far away from home, so that he will be remembered.When I first read this book, it impacted me deeply. But at the time I did not fully grasp its significance. I only began to truly understand it when I read the book \\"Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence.\\" Some readers might be perplexed by this. What is the connection between these two books? The connection is this: evolution has endowed male apes with a deep lust for status. This is because high status apes produce the most offspring. Thus, according to this perspective, the philosophical problem of death is merely an epiphenomenon stemming from the basic drive to accumulate status. That is, the problem of death is subordinate to, and serves the purpose of solving the superordinate problem of status. The reality is that before man was philosophical, before he even had language, he was fixated on accumulating status. Gilgamesh supports this view in the simplest, most eloquent way. For you skeptics, I strongly encourage you to read Demonic Males and then read Gilgamesh. The parallels are remarkably clear. Once you digest the facts, a great deal of phenomena will come into sharp focus.It suddenly makes sense why we humans have such great difficulty finding happiness: because our brains were designed to constantly pursue status, and to never be satisfied. It suddenly makes sense why Gilgamesh was so existentially troubled: his brain was structured to build a tower of status up into the heavens."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"This is another from my \\"what haven't I read that maybe I should have\\" period. This is a difficult read - part of which is because of the way the text and variants are put together (though I don't know how to make it any better).

It must have been a classical already at that time because later on, the epic was re-written or translated by the Akkadians and the Hittites. Unfortunately, none of the versions was entirely preserved. Therefore, attempting to provide a \\"correct\\" version of the story is nonesense. Instead, one has to accept that many versions are possible; each one with its pros and cons.In my view, the translation done by Sandars is a succesful one. Surely there are omissions here and there. Of greater impact -maybe- is the fact that the story is re-written in prose (although the original was a poem). However, Sandars has aimed at getting a fluent and \\"readable\\" version in English without betraying the essence of the epic. Taking this goal as a priority, he has undoubtly achieved an excellent result. Moreover, a glossary containing a brief explanation on the Sumerian gods was added which helps the reading further.

In other words, all literature. The timeless epic relates the events in the life of an ancient, mighty king who is given a great friend, and then loses him. Humbled, saddened, he seeks to understand why. Along the way we meet goddesses and monsters and romance and take a trip to the underworld. Though the story is really quite simple and straightforward, this is not an easy read. So much time - nearly 5,000 years! - has passed since it first started taking shape. The culture is so altered from our own that it may not be immediately clear to a modern audience what's going on and why it should care. So on to......the historical introduction. A must read for anyone who wants to gain the full experience of the the tale. The historical introduction written by Andrew George is - in a word - wonderful. One word isn't enough. Here are more: thorough, readable, and accessible. Gilgamesh - as epic, as history, as mythology, as evidence of the rich complexity of the lives of those who went long before us - has long deserved this kind of affectionate treatment. What do I mean? Mr. George is clearly energized by the work that he does and has labored hard to make available to a broad audience this unfortunately all-too-obscure tale. He has leaped impossible gaps of time, culture, language, and context and managed to bring Gilgamesh, and thankfully, Enkidu, back to life.Now the translation. I have not seen better. The arrangement of the text, with careful attention paid to both the chronology and the logical sequence of the various fragments, and the contextually-relevant inclusion of part XII...just brilliantly managed.Finally, parents, get this book, inform yourself in the intro and then read it to your kids.

The conflict that ensues ends with Gilgamesh and Enkidu becoming as brothers, but not before Enkidu finds himself alienated from the wild beasts with whom he once kept company.Interestingly, Enkidu himself had been sent on his way to civilization and Uruk by a trapper who had been frustrated by the wild man's success in thwarting the trapper's attempts to ensnare game animals. The trapper introduced Enkidu to a temple prostitute, so that after lying with the woman the animals would no longer associate with him. One can't but help but wonder if such a story might have been a precursor to the that of The Fall of Man in Genesis. As in the case of Adam taking the forbidden fruit from Eve, so was Enkidu banished from the primal garden after consorting with the woman."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I need this book for my freshman orientation class and instead of paying fifteen dollars for a new (and taxed) copy, I bought it in near-perfect condition for seven bucks. This was a great find!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I was reading these thirty-some reviews of The Epic of Gilgamesh, starting the old Sanders one in prose, which isn't half bad. Almost none of translations and/or reditions (translation made from other translations, rather than from the original Akkadian in cuneiform alphabet)...none are really bad, but you certainly can get different slants on the story, and twisted episodes, and missed tone, and so on.The scholarly translations by Assyriologists (A.George, Foster, Kovacs, Dalley, and so on) are usually too scholarly, and interrupt the read with all the problems that still abound. (Almost a third of the epic is still missing, for example.) The renditions, poets and wanna-be's like Jackson and Ferry, tend to wander off into their own thing; John Gardner (Grendel) included: he's sexy, but he ain't Sin-leqi-unnini (the supposed 'Homer' of the version found in an ancient library in 600 BC). Stephen Mitchell, a great Rilke translator, doesn't let on that he doesn't really read the Akkadian, so that's a rendition without your knowing whose versions he worked from. There's a lot of fudging going on in the Gilgamesh racket. It's a whole sub-story to the epic itself, and almost as much fun.But if you wanted to get as close to the original text as possible, dig up the 1948 translation by Alexander Heidel (whose text seems sympathetically ancient: the book's typeface makes it look like a dissertation from that era, font by Underwood). But Heidel is closest to what the original sounds like: The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parellels: \\"A translation and interpretation of the Gilgamesh Epic and related Babylonian and Assyrian documents.\\"But really everyone named above, and maybe three times that many in print today, all take it beyond Heidel's crude (albeit with an ancient beauty, almost like an artifact) level, but I think they all err, in going too far, or not far enough, or getting too far from the original, or just keeping a good read going. The politics of getting to the original tablets, by the bye, and the technology of reading the ancient clay fragments covered in cuneiform script three to four thousand years old, is a worthwhile epic in itself. There are 'Gilgamesh wars' out there that you'll never hear about, having to do with careers, withheld translations, transcriptions, etc. And why not, the stakes aren't really that small: this is the very first of work of literature, predating Homer by a thousand years and much longer if you look at earlier versions, the Old Babylonian and the Sumerian mess. Why indeed not lock in the 'definitive translation'?But enough of human ambition; one final suggestion: if you want to read a version that stays quite close to the original, whatever that is/was, but brings the sensory dimension up to modern taste, and teases out a good deal of the humor that's arguably in the original but which most translations miss, then I'm pleased to inform you that there is yet one more Gilgamesh cropping up in of all places, at Lulu dot com, as a graphic novel. The cartoonist has added his own humor--it feels like/looks like it's for 14 year olds some of the time--but he's also brought out the intrinsic humor of the original, has certainly rendered the scenes vividly, keeps his own contribution distinct from 'the original', and the text for the pure epic reads as well as the best ones above and keeps the reader forefront, not the scholarship. Check it out at Lulu.Qualifier: It's not finished, but two out of three installments are there, through about Tablet IX (a total of 12), where Enkidu falls sick and then Gilgamesh sets out bereft and alone on his quest for immortality, learning lots of secrets as he goes, including that of the story of the Flood. This is Noah's arc, but written down some one to two millenium before Genesis. When one George Smith first cracked the code, in the 1872, there were riots. It was Darwin all over again, to the literalists of faith, of which there were then as now, many.A neat new book (2006) on all that is out, listed here in amazon: David Damrosch's The Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh.Back to the graphic version:A comic book reviewer, former editor at DC Comics, one 'Occasional Superheroine,' begins a pretty favorable revew with something like: Ancient Sumeria meets Krum... This is about right: the epic bleeds through in all its strength and Sumerian-Babylonian wonder and feeling, and the cartoons provide a tongue-in-cheek commentary that's much more sophisticated than it at first appears, with its Ally-Oop hero and his hirsute side-kick. The Bull of Heaven, the giant monster Humbaba, Shamhat and Enkidu out there on the steppes unchaperoned, spoiled little vindictive Ishtar... it's really worth a gander.Curious note: the artist and writer seem to be brothers, or a father-son team.

They found a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains, among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood, though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the other Gods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he was but two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions! The poem was his epic, and there was indeed an historical figure of the same name.Recently, in my home town, 8th-grade students were assigned the poem to study, in this very translation, but because of a rather innocuous passage referring to a \\"harlot\\" who used her blandishments, including a reference to her nakedness, toinfluence a friend of Gilgamesh (Enkidu), the teacher was persuaded by an angry parent to black out the offending phrases, resulting a dispute over censorship which made headlines here.Mountains out of molehills!This is an interesting artifact for its insight into human history, if nothing else.

K. Sandars. Penguin Classics Revised Edition. 128 pp. London : Penguin, 1972 (1964) and Reissued.Although many perhaps don't realize it, we live in a truly great age of translations, being awash in an abundance of texts that would have been the envy of earlier readers. The classics of every age and every culture - or those that have survived the hazards of time - are freely available in all kinds of versions. These range from the productions of outstanding scholars learned in the ancient languages, all the way the way through to the adaptations and reworkings of non-specialist enthusiasts, some of whom can also be very scholarly in their approach.I don't really know how many translations of Gilgamesh are currently available, but the newcomer could do worse than select that of Sandars. He freely admits that his &quot;isn't a fresh translation from the cuneiform&quot; because such a translation would require a detailed knowledge of Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite, a task which he tells us he is not competent to undertake (page 50).He adds that extensively annotated and accurate scholarly translations exist in English, French, and German, but that these hardly suit the needs of the ordinary reader. He himself, however, has made full use of them in preparing his own version, a version which as an ordinary reader myself I've always found wonderfully readable.His book falls into two parts. First we are given a 50-page Introduction which I personally found to be quite interesting and informative, although predictably conventional in its interpretations. Sandars accepts the standard definition of the Sumerian word DIN.GIR as meaning &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods,&quot; as do almost all others who write on Ancient Mesopotamia, though readers of Zecharia Sitchin will have their doubts (see Sitchin, 12th Planet, p.169).Following the Introduction we are given the text of Gilgamesh, mainly in Sandars' lucid and sensitive prose, though with a few passages in verse. The book is rounded out with a 'Glossary of Names,' and an 'Appendix of Sources' which gives full bibliographical details of the scholarly sources utilized by Sandars. It also includes a useful map, and is printed in a large and easy-to-read type.As a non-specialist Sumerophile I like Sandars' text and have re-read it several times. Here is an example of his verse, with my obliques added to indicate line breaks:&quot;Hear me, great ones of Uruk, / I weep for Enkidu, my friend, / Bitterly moaning like a woman mourning / I weep for my brother. / O Enkidu, my brother, / You were the axe at my side, / My hand's strength, the sword in my belt, / The shield before me, / A glorious robe, my fairest ornament; / An evil fate has robbed me...&quot; (page 94).Others may have rendered this passage better, but to me it effectively communicates the despair any man would feel at the loss of his closest friend. There are other similarly moving incidents in this strange and compelling story, a story which is essentially tragic though not unrelieved with an occasional bit of humor.Here is an example of Sandars' prose:&quot;My friend, I saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful. The heavens roared and the earth roared again, daylight failed and darkness fell, lightnings flashed, fire blazed out, the clouds lowered, they rained down death. Then the brightness departed, the fire went out, and all was turned to ashes fallen about us. . . . (page 79).Gilgamesh was sleeping when this experience occurred, but I wonder if &quot;dream&quot; here really means &quot;dream&quot;? Perhaps, but what this passage evokes vividly for me is an ancient man's experience of being very close to the site of the launching of a huge rocket (See Zechariah Sitchin, 'The Stairway to Heaven,' p.127). Everything seems to be there - the roarings, the flashings, the dark clouds of smoke from the exhaust, the fall of a residue of &quot;ashes&quot; from the firing. I wonder if a modern witness of a Cape Canaveral launch could do as well . . .Gilgamesh's tragedy is that he was partly human : &quot;... the great gods made his beauty perfect.... Two thirds they made him god and one third man&quot; (page 61). But who were these &quot;gods&quot; whose lifespans were so much longer than those of humans? And how did they make Gilgamesh two thirds &quot;god&quot;? Did the Sumerians just dream all this up for purposes of 'entertainment' ? Or were they more accurate reporters than they are credited with being ?The Sumerians were adamant in asserting that they themselves created nothing at all, neither agriculture nor irrigation nor architecture nor engineering nor astronomy nor mathematics nor writing nor anything else, but that their _entire_ civilization was given to them by the &quot;gods.&quot;Of this civilization we find Gilgamesh lamenting : &quot;Here in the city man dies oppressed at heart, man perishes with despair in his heart&quot; (page 72). But would human beings have deliberately created a system in which widespread despair was unavoidable? Or was something else responsible for establishing the civilizational patterns that, as a reading of Samuel Kramer's 'History Begins at Sumer' will convince anyone, are still ours? Is &quot;civilization&quot; a euphemism for a non-human system of exploitation?There are many mysteries in this profound and moving tale of Gilgamesh's friendship with the wild man Enkidu, his frustration over the human lot, and his courageous attempt and failure to discover a solution. But whether you read his story in Sandars' version or in some other, make sure to read it. It's a story you will not easily forget."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk (and in real life he was the king of Uruk), is the first tragic hero recorded by the human race. Though many of the epic's tablets were discovered in Assurbanipal's Assyrian library (7th century B.C), parts of this book appear to originate from around 3000 B.C. Long before the Assyrians, 1800 years before the Hebrews, and, in fact, before anybody as this story originated with the hard-bitten people of Sumer, the first civilization, who happened to have been utterly lost from history until the 19th century A.D. The very civilization to invent the wheel, the city, the sexigesimal system governing the sweep of hands on your watch and, most importantly, writing. Say \\"alcohol\\", and you speak Sumerian - as they apparently invented that too, while the word has not changed for over 5000 years. \\"Hard-bitten\\" because while the Egyptians would celebrate Nile floods, Sumerians cursed themselves for having deserved such punishment as a flooded Tigris or Euphrates. To Egyptians the sun was life. To Sumerians the sun was relentless. Suffering is an excellent source of creativity (though the Egyptians did well with less) and Gilgamesh reflects this in both its creativity and diagnosis.Although very old, his story is forever new. Gilgamesh is - as stated in the introduction - emblematic of our concern with mortality, the struggle for knowledge and escape from the common lot of man. As a mortal, Gilgamesh is condemned to death, but he doesn't take his fate lying down. So, like all good mythologies, he sets out on a great adventure to rectify his problem, encountering gods, monsters and his best friend, Enkidu, the \\"savage man\\", who is at home with the animals, until enticed by the civilized Gilgamesh with a woman - something he never saw before. Perhaps a symbol of man's complications when leaving his natural state.Most interestingly Gilgamesh reaches \\"where the sun rises\\" to meet Upnapishtim. Upnapishtim is by now famous for saving \\"the seed of all living creatures\\" on a boat, whose dimensions are given by a rogue god friendly to man, all before a great worldwide flood sent by other capricious gods because humans were making too much noise, keeping the gods from sleep. (That Noah mimics the Upnapishtim myth should be no surprise as Sumer influenced the Levant for thousands of years after its passing.)When Enkidu dies Gilgamesh morns, \\"How can I rest when Enkidu, whom I love is dust and I too shall die and be laid in the earth forever.\\" In the end Gilgamesh is \\"mocked by fate, lost opportunities, wasted hopes and swallowed by death\\". Apparently, no matter how many gods you have - and the Sumerians had hundreds, one even for the pick-axe - death remains a mystery and confidence of reward a hunch.A wonderful journey into the mind of humanities first civilization, greater understanding of scriptures to follow and a clear signal that the deepest concerns of our human condition remain unaltered no matter where or when."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"One of the things I like best about this book is not the words but the layout and graphics.

Andrew George gives us a taste of what the original versification was like. He also translates all the extant versions and fragments of versions of the epic, and this is important. Not only do the versions augment each other and fill in the gaps that time and entropy have literally carved, shattered, and eroded into the original tablets, but they key us into the variations that the generations of years of cross-cultural retellings have wrought. Gilgamesh becomes Bilgames, etc. etc. Finally, an appendix at the back of the book discusses the process of translating the text from the tablets. In many ways this is the most fascinating part of this volume. Along with these good points, we are treated to line drawings taken from period artwork illustrating the epic, so we see the gods, goddesses, and strange monsters as they were visualized by the Babylonians. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I recently ordered this version to prepare for teaching Giglamesh in a Humanities I course. I had read the famous Sandars version, which compiles the various tablets into one coherent prose narrative. However, Andrews' new version attempts no similar gloss: the work is revealed as a fragmentary masterpiece, with gripping passages of narrative trailing off into maddening gaps and uncertainties. The Introduction offers a very informative, concise overview of Gilgamesh scholarship and the state of the work itself. It is truly humbling to realize how little we have of this great work, yet what we do have literally changed our understanding of the ancient world. And as Sandars suggested in his Introduction to the earlier Penguin volume, it is amazing that such an old, fragmentary work from a forgotten culture still has the power to move us. This sounds like academic hyperbole, but even in its most authentic state, the work is powerful; we see Gilgamesh's grief, his desperation, and his bitter defeat upon losing Enkidu and the possibility of eternal life. The translation carries some powerful imagery that somehow surpasses the more fluid prose translation; perhaps this is a bit of chiaroscuro (sp?), the lost passages showing the more complete, brilliant ones in greater relief.Even better, this translation includes all the various fragments of the Gilgamesh story, as well as the ealrier Sumerian version of the epic, which is much different than the Standard version. It's a remarkable volume which is fun to pour through and reconstruct this ancient world on the dawn of civilization. It truly inspired me to teach this work to my students, emphasizing how such a powerful work can rest on only a handful of broken tablets."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"This epic from the Assyro-Babylonian culture (parts of which were probably written as early as 3000 B.C.) contains perhaps the earliest known example of man's quest for immortality (the version I read was the translation by N. K. Sanders). According to Samuel Kramer, the prologue has the oldest known reference to Lilith, who is an important female demon in Jewish legend. Apparently, a historical Gilgamesh actually existed and ruled Uruk in Mesopotamia in the first half of the third millennium B. C. (probably in the first dynasty of Uruk). In the epic, the god Anu attempts to curb the harsh rule of Gilgamesh, the son of the goddess Ninsun and a mortal priest of Uruk, by the creation of a strong and wild man named Enkidu (or, Eabani) (many scholars regard Enkidu as a symbol of primitive man). After a fight between the two, they become friends and have a number of adventures. In one tale, Gilgamesh is wooed by Irnina (or, Ishtar). But she is rejected by Gilgamesh and the bull sent by her father Anu to destroy him is killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu (some regard this story as a nature myth in which Gilgamesh represents the solar god of the spring season and the goddess is the goddess of love and fertility). Later in the epic Enkidu is stricken with disease and dies. Gilgamesh is devastated and wishes to avoid a similar fate. He goes in search of eternal youth and immortality (perhaps the earliest example of such a quest in literature). After more adventures, which includes him learning the Babylonian story of the great flood, he finds the answer to his quest; but, it is quickly lost. Even though this is probably the earliest epic, it has considerable allegorical significance. It is perhaps the earliest known description of man's quest for the meaning of life and the struggle to avoid death. What is learned is that death is inevitable and man should enjoy the life he has."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"You wouldn't think a 4000-year old story about a dead king would be that interesting or exciting, but actually, I enjoyed this book. The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, the translater, Andrew George, says a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true).George also makes the interesting claim that the text is the oldest written text accessible to a modern reader without special archaeological or scholarly knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--he is concerned with fundamental issues of life and death--honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, happiness, and so on.I also enjoyed some of the historical details George provides in the introduction. By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 BC, according to George, but he points out that these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.An interesting character George discusses is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic.Anyway, the introduction and epic made for more interesting reading than I had imagined."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"N. K. Sandars' presentation of Gilgamesh is an outstanding achievement of editing, interpretation, and paraphrase. \\"Paraphrase\\" rather than translation, because she admits that she is unable to read the cuneiform in which the epic was written over four thousand years ago; instead she's compared all the literal scholarly editions available and turned them into very readable and moving English prose. This was easily the finest version for the nonspecialist reader when it was published in 1960, and to my mind it remains unsurpassed.Readers primarily interested in the cultural background of Gilgamesh will want to look at more recent scholarship, but for the rest of us Sandars's rendition of the text is as powerfully engaging as when it first appeared.Though tyhe original Gilgamesh is a verse epic, and Sandars writes prose, readers looking for the intensity of poetry will find it here, in what's really a splendid \\"prose poem.\\" In fact, Sandars's prose strikes me as more, not less, satisfying than David Ferry's currently popular verse translation, which is competent but, to my mind, rather lackluster.Although Penguin has issued a newer translation in verse by Andrew George, I hope they keep N.

From the Noah-like figure Utnapishtim, to the ark, to the story of the magical plant that gives life, to the sleep that falls upon Gilgamesh, or the birds that Utnapishtim sends out to see if the flood has abated, one cannot deny that the Noah story was pieced together from EOG.

Gilgamesh, 2500 years ago, wanted answers to the very same questions we ask ourselves today. He had the same frustrations, the same fears, the same concerns as we do now. It was a very interesting and reassuring read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"There is something so direct about ancient and mediaeval poetry. The very style of it is clearly designed to be read out aloud, with repeated lines varied, like in modern blues, combined with heavily alliteration.The vigour of this poem, which is four thousand years old, is astonishing. Literally, modern writers could learn a great deal from this long-extinct style of writing.My favourite part is where Gilgamesh crosses the ocean at the edge of the world: the poet writes something like: \\"He rowed one mile. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed two miles. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed three miles...\\" etc. This is magical writing, evoking the style of oral tale-tellers of the time. One gets a real sense of Gilgamesh's trip into the murky and Jungian darkness of the outer ocean.Also, of course, there is a lot of fine detail of Assyrian life, such as the details of the palaces; also, the mythological monsters are fascinating, such as Humbaba the ogre, who attacks people with somethign called an \\"aura\\", which seems related to later Gnostic ideas about the multi-layered universe.To round things off, we get bits of five even more ancient Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, or Bilgames, as he was then called. These deal with tales that precede the later Epic. I particularly liked the tale of the captured prince who watches out for the attack of his allies that will liberate him and vanquish his captors.Unfortunately, the Epic of Gilagmesh and most of these poems are fragmentary. I'd like to have known what exactly happened to the Scorpion-People that Gilgamesh encounters; or what the nature of the Stony Ones was.We will probably find out some day, as there are plenty of tablets either waiting to be excavated, or awaiting study. Unfortunately, many of these tablets, read and unread, were kept in museums in Baghdad. No doubt some shady dealer in antiquities is trying to flog them off even now, unable even to read what he is selling!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Before the Bible and long before Beowulf, before Hesiod and Homer, more than 4500 years ago, in ancient Mesopotamia, in a place called Uruk (and in a region now known as Iraq) they told the story of a great and powerful king. Gilgamesh, created by the gods and more powerful than any man, was once an unstoppable force. He took what he wanted, and the people feared him. They pleaded with the gods to control him and so the gods created another man, Enkidu, who was his match in wisdom and cunning and was yet different than him in many ways. Whereas Gilgamesh was a ruler over men, Enkidu roamed freely with the beasts of the fields. Where Gilgamesh lived to conquer, and took advantage of his people, Enkidu protected the beasts from their enemies the hunters. Somehow, though, opposites attract, and these men became fast friends - and Enkidu helped to soften his friend, redirecting his ambitions and channeling his strength, helping him to become a protector and shepherd of his people who would eventually be heralded as a great and heroic king who had established the foundations of a great nation.It's a wonderful story, that can be read on a number of levels. It is a heroic story, that can be read like the heroic stories from various mythical cultures. It is a parable that explores what it is to be human, and how one can accept one's fate and that one will die. It is a story with many intriguing parallels to other great stories, that have defined cultures and beliefs - there are parallels here, for example, to the creation story of the Bible, to the story of the Fall, and to the story of Noah and the great flood. It is the story of a journey, through which a number of themes can be explored: the nature of man, the significance of gender, death and immortality, friendship, memories, and the character of the hero. Finally, it can be read as a kind of anthropological document in which the peoples who wrote it are coming to grips with the importance and meaning of the shift from a hunter-gatherer type people to an agricultural-based civilization. Enkidu can be thought of as a nomadic group that joined forces with, or was assimilated into an agriculturally based community, and then this is the story of how they, together, conquered or destroyed a forest-dwelling people, but came to see as a result that their own civilization could some day be lost as well. From that perspective the epic can be seen to carry a kind of unwitting ecological message about the impact and costs of civilization: that in order to maintain itself, an agricultural-based, military civilization must constantly be in search of resources outside of itself, and destroy those who claim those resources. Then, of course, we'd have to ask questions about a culture (not so far from our own) that tells just this story about itself and treats its own founders, the plunderers of other nations, as heroic and godlike.A rich book, and rewards re-reading and reflection. It's short and you could read it in a couple of hours - but it rewards study. This translation reads well and feels fresh, not like some old dead book. The historical introduction is useful, too, for after you've read the actual book a few times, even if it's a bit dry in comparison to the liveliness of the text itself."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"This poem is perhaps the oldest \\"book\\" known so far. It is supposed to have been first conceived by the end of the Third Millenium B.C. It tells, in a direct and somewhat naive way, the adventures of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, in Mesopotamia. In the beginning we are told of how Gilgamesh got to be king, and how he felt lonely, since he lacked a friend worthy of him. The gods listen to him, and tell him to send a whore to seduce Enkidu, a savage man who lives with the beasts and behaves as such. He is the \\"good savage\\", totally in a natural state and without a civilizatory stain. It is chilling to think of this particular story as an ancient memory of our life in pre-civilization times. The prostitute manages to seduce him (any resemblance to Adam and Eve is granted), and then the beasts reject him. He has become fully human. This passage is a wonderful metaphore of the civilizatory process which we humans experienced in immemorial ages. Enkidu has to learn to drink milk from a jar and not directly from the breasts of animals. He has to learn to wear clothes, drink wine and sleep on a bed.Enkidu fights Gilgamesh, showing him his strength and courage, which makes him the inseparable friend. After that, Gilgamesh feels the urgency to leave his legacy in this world before his inevitable death, another humanizing feature, since the individual already shows a full conscience of his mortality and of himself, and thinks of the future. So, both friends depart for the Woods, presumably current Lebanon (the Cedar Forest), where Ancient Mesopotamians got their timber, so scarce in their country. To conquer the Woods, they must kill the giant Humbaba, guardian of the forest, incarnation of Evil and presumably the first reference to the Devil in literature. In doing so they infuriate all the gods except one, and one of them must die. This is how Enkidu gets sick and dies after an excruciating agony. This fact turns out to be devastating for Gilgamesh, because it confirms the inevitability of his own demise. Ravaged by his friend's death, Gilgamesh sets out on a journey to try and find a way to escape from mortality. He travels to the East, beyond the mountains, to the Country of Sun, to try to cross the Sea and reach the land of Dilmun (kind of a preserved Garden of Eden), where Utnapishtim lives, the only human to have survived the Flood (it raises your hair to see a reference to this cataclism, centuries before the Bible), and consequently granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh reaches the \\"garden by the sea\\" where a young female vineyard tender lives. She tells him frankly that he will never find what he's looking for, since Death is unavoidable. It is humans' Fate, but to humans it has also been granted the possibility of happiness, and so the girl advises him to \\"fill your belly with good things... have fun and rejoice. Wear clean clothes, bathe in fresh water, caress yout little cildren and embrace and make your woman happy\\", for that is also the Fate of Man. Gilgamesh can't give up and convinces the oarsman to take him to Dilmun. Utnapishtim, puzzled, receives him and tells him he'll live forever if he stays awake six days and seven nights. Of course he can't make it, and when he wakes up Utnapishtim tells him the story of the Flood, suprisingly and suspiciously similar to that told later in the hebrew Genesis (let's not forget the long years of Hebrew exile in Babilonia). Gilgamesh makes a final effort, ripping from the bottom of the sea the \\"plant that gives you your youth back\\" but later, while bathing in a well, a snake steals the plant, changes skin and leaves. Unconsoled, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk and dies.It is difficult to exaggerate the historical and literary importance of this work, since in its brief span it collects all that makes us human: civilization, glory, the conscience of Death. It also gathers primeval memories, the process of going out of the African plains and building cities, the search for supplies and the fear of the beasts of the forests. The tale of the Flood confirms for us the memory of cosmic catastrophes which since the remote past left an indelible mark upon us. Indispensable reading."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Overall, a decent rendition. I was looking more for a direct translation of the poetry though, whereas this is a rendition of the already-translated poetry into prose form. I felt like it was dumbed down for the reader, but it's still Gilgamesh, and therefore a great story."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"One of the most fascinating books I've ever read. The episodic tales of Gilgamesh, which were recorded around 3,000 BC from even earlier oral traditions, pre-dates the Old Testament by 1,600 years at least. There are clear parallels--such as Noah (Uta-napishti, known by the Babylonians as Ziusudra) who, after surviving the Flood, is elevated to an immortal, heroic status in Sumerian mythology. Also fascinating is the story of Gilgamesh rebuilding the ancient prediluvian cities after the Flood. One can't help but address Biblical implications since the patriarch was an Akkadian.This tale, if even partially true, conflicts with young-earth Creationist belief that the continents and landscape of Earth was completely redefined by the Flood (which some argue was responsible for the Grand Canyon). Surely that level of destruction would have destroyed any mud-and-brick cities. And yet, we have evidence here that the Sumerians were at least aware of prediluvian cities, meaning there were remnants of those cities. If one chooses not to believe this story, and treat it purely as fiction and myth, then how would one deal with the problem of Gilgamesh pre-dating Genesis? The Noahic flood and Adam and Eve stories in Genesis were derived from even more ancient epics like Gilgamesh. These tablets go so far as to explain that God created man from clay, which obviously parallels Genesis' \\"dust from the Earth.\\"Gilgamesh was, in my opinion, one of the \\"mighty men of old, men of renoun\\" (Gen 6:4). The patriarch Abraham was from Uruk, the capital city reportedly built by Gilgamesh. He was clearly educated and successful, so he would have learned of Gilgamesh and Uta-napishti in his youth. The epic of Gilgamesh has been found in several temples in Uruk and other ancient cities in Abraham's homeland (circa 2,000 BC). To the skeptic I offer this: There is a hint of truth in every myth."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"Or something like that. I'm sure I've gotten the quote slightly wrong. But be that as it may it does very much sum up much of this stories reason to be. The epic of Gilgamesh comes down to us from Sumerian times though its kernel may indeed be older than even that. Based on the story of a great god-king fellow it is does not appear to have come down to us totally 100% complete. This version has a fairly informative preface introducing the reader to some of the academia behind the story and while it didn't really engage me overmuch it was admittedly useful in understanding the story.And the story touches very much on a number of central tenets of humankind which is perhaps why it's proved so popular not only amongst an academic readership. Comprehensively taking the reader into subject areas such as mans quest for power, his insecurities regarding mortality and the nature of friendship and indeed some philosophy of leadership and it's relation to those ruled this book is a very good addition to any \`classics' library you may be building up for yourself or your children.It must be pointed out however that this isn't the sort of ancient classic I'd hand to a newcomer to the genre. The prose format of the story combined with the expressions contained in it as well as the simple fact that certain lines and couplets are incomplete do make this a bit of an acquired taste. Certainly I'd visit Homer or Virgil first and perhaps stuff like Beowulf before diving headlong into this somewhat more obtuse read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"The translation here reviewed is lucid and readable, yet never deviates from the spirit of a text in transition, from scattered tablets to complete work. However, George does a wonderful job of maintaining the flow within this patchwork epic. In some sense it feels as though you're reading the tablets themselves under his guidance and assistance. There is also a great introduction to basic Near East culture and history, as well as an interesting appendix on the creation of an ancient Babylonian translation. The illustrations are also interesting.Footnotes were nonexistent (though they were usually unnecessary--George has an introduction before every chapter). Also, the repetitive, partial fragments that George has translated after the epic are bit needless in an exoteric translation, though the poems were a nice touch."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"I have to say that I didn't enjoy reading this edition of Gilgamesh as much as I thought I would. Probably the most bothersome aspect was that the text was littered with missing phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. It's not like the editors are to blame, its just that story is taken from hundreds of clay cuneiform tablets, not one, it seems, that was intact. In fact, most of the story is cobbled together from multiple sources in order to create a most complete edition.On the other hand, the fact that this story was written down so very, very long ago, perhaps 1000 years before the Odyssey and the Iliad were written down, and that there is so much there, motivated me to make sure I learned the story.True, you can read a \\"cleaned up\\" version, but there's nothing like reading the primary text. Footnotes at the bottom of the pages would also have helped. Mercifully, the text isn't that long and it does read relatively quickly. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"This version is a very popular adaptation of the Gilgamesh story because it contains N. K. Sandars' crucial introduction which is just as important as the translation itself because it includes information about the discovery of the tablets in Assyria dating back to the third millennium BC and then goes on to explain the difficulties that scholars have had in rediscovering the story from these artifacts and how during this long laborious translation process found themselves actively engaged in evolving the story, and thus the mythology, which had developed from other sources and had certainly influenced ancient hero epics that proceeded it. There is no one version of Gilgamesh. There are very many. Having a good introduction like this makes reading the story even better because we understand its significance beyond being just a very old fable.The story of the translation of the epic of Gilgamesh is every bit as important as the epic itself and maybe more so because of its relevance to modern questions about the authenticity of the accounts held by popular traditional sacred texts. It is impossible to ignore the resemblance the epic of Gilgamesh has to Greek mythology as well as to the Judeo-Christian Islamic religions. Elements of the story such as Gilgamesh being part god part man, the flood story which is vertically identical to the one in Genesis and the underlying quest for immortality will peak interest and is probably the main reason why most people want to read the epic of Gilgamesh. The discovery of the tablets only increased popular scholarly opinions that religions have their roots in mythology and here is yet more evidence to back that position. Thus the epic of Gilgamesh and the story behind it is an essential classical text for ancient storytelling and how they evolve with time through the civilizations that come in contact with them. The Epic is not just Gilgamesh but the gradual progression of important themes in life that humans deal with by developing these legends and fables.Sandar's work also contains an important treatment of the story and an explanation of the role of the gods which are essentials to understanding what the story is about. Gilgamesh is hard to read without these initiations because the era and the setting in which the story was written must be dealt with or else the plot which contains abundant and rapid interactions between the gods, their attributes and the consequences, will not make any sense to the reader. The ancient ways, and we are talking ancient going back some 5000 years at least, are not our ways. Here gods are superabundant and are responsible for every aspect of life and with an outcome, such as the setting of the sun by scorpions, there is also a god who is bringing the fiery ball down into the underworld where two more gods are there to catch it and who influence our lives somehow.Gilgamesh is another world, almost alien, giving us a glimpse into how our ancestor's explained themselves and the world they found themselves in. It goes to show how far our modern understanding of why we are the way we are and why things are the way they are, has gone."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh: An English Version With an Introduction","review":"There are two different versions of this book being sold by Amazon.The one version is the more current and is translated by: Andrew GeorgeYou can get that one here:http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1263331576&sr;=8-1Then there is the older version translated by: N.K.

Reading the memoirs of this phenomenal woman with such a zest for life, a love of living, one cannot help but get swept away by her eloquent prose, swept away to her childhood in the south.From her birthplace of Eatonville, Florida, \\"a pure Negro town\\", Zora sets out upon her road of life, one often paved with stones, with a smile on her face, and the will of an ox. Her often wicked sense of humor makes this woman's life seem not sad or depressing, but as fun as well as funny. Hurston sees every chance and takes it; sees every downfall as a challenge to be met. Such a will to live, but not just to live, but to live fully, and righteously-- this pure energy comes across in the book, leaping from the pages as if Zora were in the very room. \\"The primeval in me leaped to life\\", she recalled at one point, recounting another incident which would be mundane and dull to any other writer, but taken as a wild adventure by Zora.This book is the proof that even the lowliest of people needn't stay humble and meek; anybody can rise to fully realize their dreams and ambitions. Anybody can be somebody, and Zora is the some-bodiest of them all, leading the parade and twirling the baton of life. This book raises an energy in the reader, an energy of spirit-- of soul. With her energy, Zora has made something of her life, rising to become one of the more prominent writers of the Harlem Renaissance. This book is the truly remarkable account of her early life, her loves, and her energy for life."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"I've just finished reading this book as a summer reading assignment for school, and to my surprise, I found myself actually enjoying it.

However, despite my prejudices against it, this book managed to grab my attention.That is, in the last three chapters. I did not think this book was mostly an account of the other books Hurston has written, as some other readers have stated. Hurston only focused one or two chapters toward the middle of the book on other works, but even then it was only to list when she wrote which book, not to go in depth on the process and motivation. However, it seemed to me that it was an account of Hurston's journey through life, including details on her childhood in Eatonville. This is all well and good, except, especially as Hurston gets into the adult years, she tends to gloss over much of the details, omitting names, and mentioning events which obviously impacted her life yet for some personal reason or another, refusing to describe to the reader these events for fear of who knows what.This was only the first confusing element. I also had a difficulty with Hurston's writing style. She tends to jump from one anecdote in the middle of another with no explanation before returning to her original story, which left me as the reader, feeling befuddled. The sequence of the chapters, out of her childhood, also does not really seem to follow a sequential storyline.I was also bothered with Hurston's portrayal of herself, especially her childhood self. She seems to portray herself as the only child there ever was with an active imagination. Perhaps I am actually a member of the privileged minority, but I know that I told myself stories and had imaginary friends when I was a child. I was also very devoted to literature, and reading, as I still am, though Hurston's individualities in that area are more understandable, perhaps, considering the circumstances.Despite all this, I walked away from this book with a respect for Hurston that I hadn't felt before because of the last three or so chapters in the book where Hurston discusses her thoughts and feelings on her race, and the inter-racial strife which hurt the African-American Civil Rights movement. I also enjoyed the appendix in which the reader is allowed a glimpse at Hurston's more controversial writing.I don't hold a grudge against Hurston's perhaps unorthodox method of writing an autobiography, far from it. In fact, I think this book would have benefited greatly if Hurston had included more of her personal view points on the world as she did in the last few chapters. Hurston was often criticized for writing African-American literature that was not a rousing cry for Civil Rights, in this book, Hurston finally explains WHY. It also would have been helpful if Hurston either would have detailed the events in her life which were so groundbreaking, or simply not mentioned them at all, instead of saying \\"Then this happened and it changed my life and for that I will be forever grateful, but I'm not going to tell you anything about what it was.\\" The strange presence of such passages was much more disquieting then their absence would have been.So in conclusion, I'm glad this book included an appendix, and I do feel Hurston deserves some plaudits for writing what was eventually a stimulating autobiography."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"Hurston's Dust Tracks on a Road is a true story of a smart little black girl, who has the intelligence and the perseverance to rise above her all-black community, Eatonville, and become a respected and well known novelist,short-story writer, folklorist and anthropologist.However, it is not a typical autobiography, not in any way. It has often been said that Hurston lived her life 'half in shadow' and this is also characteristic also of this book. It is rare that ,after having read an autobiography, the reader is left without the information of the writer's year of birth, for instance. On the other hand, it is, in the words of Robert E. Hemenway, who also wrote her biography, 'a fascinating self-portrait, despite its inconsistencies, of one of the major black women artists of the twentieth century'.The main reason for reeding Dust Tracks is its nature, i.e. the way she describes the struggle of a poor black girl to 'secure an education and catch fame'(R.E.Hemenway, Introduction to Dust Tracks on a Road, Second Edition) and the way she manages to collect her reflections and ideas about her own life into three unique chapters at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"While I enjoyed this book, it is far from her best work. Zora seemed to ramble in this book -- and it is widely believed that she fabricated several stories contained within. I would recommend &quot;Their Eyes&quot; and &quot;Jonah's&quot; before reading this book..."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"Whenever I think of Ms Hurston, I smile while I am sad. Her life story is a joyous song and while still a judgement on society and an insight on Black America at that time. she was extremely funny and apparently a very kind woman. She was also a wonderful writer and talented one. Her prose was a gift that few can duplicate. If you are into women writers, you must include all her books. If you want to write, you must study her style. You will not be able to put it down and will be upset when you finish because you want there to be more beyond the last page."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"I found the memoir of this icon of a Renaissance woman to be very exciting and enlightening. Hurston's revealing portrait was a curious blend of anecdote, memory, and observation. I agree to some degree with other critics who question the truth and authenticity of the story as autobiography. At times it does seem a little out of sequence and jumbled. However, it is a precious collection of material (memory, folklore, dreams, anthropology, legend, etc.) out a key era in the history of African Americans. It is very informative and regardless of its shortcomings and the questions it may leave unanswered, at the same time, it does allow us a peek into the life and psyche of a deep, delightful and brilliant woman who was certainly before her time. It is our good fortune that she was able to set down this account of her experience, which has been preserved for us to share. Hurston was obviously somewhat of a free thinker as well as a scholar and I wonder if she could have told her story any way other than the way she did, although she has been criticized for it. It is the account of a particular Black woman who had a very unusual life for the time that she lived in. I would also add that given the alternative material related to the book which has been uncovered since the initial publishing it has to be taken into account that the book was likely censored, which would color the whole picture in ways the author may not have originally intended. But I was greatly affected, inspired and informed by the book and would recommend and encourage any Hurston enthusiast to read it."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"This was a book I felt I needed to have read for my general education and rounding as a person.I am aware of what people say about the way Hurston fabricated her life for this autobiography, but isn't all of history in some way fabricated and presented through someone's eyes? I mean, this is a highly subjective field, even when presenting mere facts, it is so easy to skew things when deciding which bits to leave in and which to take out. We all do it, Hurston is no exception.The spirit and nature of her life was captured beautifully: a sad (very), positive, hopeful, stubborn, opinionated, strong, resilient, hard-working woman. A remarkable woman in every way that I can see, and I feel right to have spent some time honouring her life by reading her story through her eyes, \\"Nothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one person\\".The other value of the book lay in her exploration of basic life concepts, such as Love, Friendship, Religion and Race. I always enjoy the experience of getting as close as possible to looking at things through someone else's eyes, an opportunity afforded here as Hurston shares her opinions.Finally, I would give this 4 stars, not 5, but for some reason, star-rating is fixed at 5 for this book..."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"As with any of her works, Zora being who she was has to weave in folklore, anthropology, history, and some of everything into her work. Her autbiography is no exception. She is truly one of the most poetic and artistic authors of all times. She knows how to play with words and phrases that keep you hooked; not necessarily for the content but because you are waiting to see what funny or thought-provoking thing she will say next.The only reason I had to rate this work four stars is because of a couple of inaccuracies. She claims to have been born in Eatonville, FL for one thing. This is not true according to U.S Census records. She also takes years off of her age, but never explicitly tells when she was born. Other than that, this is one of the most interesting autobiographies that you will ever read. Also one of the most inspiring."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"The autobiography of Zora Neale Hurston, \\"Dust Tracks on the Road\\", proved to be an incredibly interesting book. This book shows the hardships that Zora underwent during her rise from childhood poverty in the rural south to a prominent place among the leading artists and intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance. One part of the book that really caught my attention is how Zora manages to give her reader glimpses of a character that is a very public and privet artist, writer, and companion of black heritage. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to deepen as well as straighten their knowledge of the African American Heritige."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"Rich with detail, a great story."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"Have not finish reading but the first 10 chapters is very entertaining. Sometimes I want to cry Zora has a great story, I am excited."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"This Autobiography gave the impression that Zora was a realistic and she lived life to enjoy it. It focused entirely on her life along with her accomplishments. Zora was very open minded and willing to try different things, and she was not afraid of change. Zora realized that racism was everywhere but she was able to succeed even when she had to change strategies to be successful."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"It's a good read.

I recommend this book for anyone wanting a interseting read."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"This is a highly compromised book. Critics are all over the board on what on earth motivated blatant lies that she told about her life, and the sugar-coating of the realities of the black experience, in america, before civil rights.I would personally say, that this is a very unfortunate piece. I would give it three stars for its entertainment value.Zora Neale Hurston was born in 1891, in Alabama, about 10 years before she claims, in ''dust tracks.'' She was not born in Florida.She essentially falsifies her identity; she shares experiences from about 1900 - 1940, lived by a person who is actually 10 years older than she claims to have been!College would look like a very different place if you experienced it at 32, than if you were to go through it at 22.I recommend this work, only if you read it with a current biography next to it.In hindsight, her presentation of her life and times, compared to our general understanding of her realities makes this work a very interesting historical document."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"I am fifteen years old and I found that despite the reviews of Zora's other books, Dust Tracks on A Road is not an award-winning work. Even though it's considered an autobiography, it focuses on her other books and works instead of her life. It did have some interesting parts that covered her childhood and her lovelife but not many. I was extremely disappointed and I feel that my summer was wasted. The time spent reading this book was wasted."},{"Title":"Dust Tracks On a Road","review":"This autobiography focuses equally on her opinions (highly untraditional)and her life (also highly unorthodox) giving the reader an unashamed glance to peer into the deepest wells of her being."},{"Title":"Best of the Best, Vol. 4: 100 Best Recipes from the Best Cookbooks of the Year","review":"Have you ever wished for a cookbook that would test your cooking abilities just a little more? Maybe a cookbook that is not too complicated, but will take your cooking to the level of a chef? I found the recipes in this cookbook really made cooking quite fun and the colors, tastes and textures are also very exciting.I just finished making: \\"Pumpkin and Pancetta Risotto\\" and thought how wonderful this would be to serve in place of mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving. The creamy rice flavored with crispy pancetta, pumpkin treats and shallots is quite comforting, especially at this time of year. This dish is also so beautiful when you are making it and is perfect to make in October/November.If you do make this specific recipe, I recommend even adding some toasted pumpkin seeds as well. Just saut' dried pumpkin seeds in butter or make extra pancetta (saltier than bacon) and top each serving with more mascarpone. You could really make a meal of this recipe and just add a cup of hot apple cider.My other recommendations for Fall from this cookbook are:-Chocolate Heart of Darkness Cakes (Sounds sinful, don't they? ;)-Pumpkin Ginger Cr'me Caramel on Spiced Pumpkin Cakewith Pecan Shorts and Toffeed Pecans-Creamy Corn with Smoky Bacon Chanterelles, and Thyme-Long-bone Short Ribs with Chinook merlot Gravy and Rosemary White Beans-Sweet Butternut Soup with Thyme Cr'me FraicheThis cookbook is quite detailed and has many extras you won't find in other cookbooks. The Editors really make this very easy to use. There is a wonderful index as well as a list of recipes by book, so you could choose to look up 10 recipes by Tom Douglas if you found his cooking to be your style. The Index also has boldface numbers to indicate recipes with pictures.The contents include recipes for: hours d'ouevres, fish, chicken, pork, veal, beef, lamb, main dishes, vegetables, side dishes and desserts.Each year, the editors from Food & Wine search for the best recipes from the best cookbooks. This year their final selections have come from cookbooks by world-famous chefs. You can enjoy recipes from cookbooks written by Alfred Portale, James Villas, Marcel Desaulniers, Christopher Kimball, Jasper White, Jerry Traunfeld, Pam Anderson, Mark Bittman, Tom Douglas and Maya Kaimal to name a few.The Layout is especially enticing and creative. You not only get great recipes, you can find all the \\"test-kitchen tips\\" right with the recipe. That gave me more confidence to adapt the recipe. The recipes are also inspired at times by delectable multicultural fare.The editors started with 700 books, in which they found 300 recipes to test. 100 recipes were chosen to be in this really fun cookbook. Recipes from 27 cookbooks are featured.\\"So if you find yourself gravitating toward recipes from a certain author, you'll know that there's a cookbook out there that really suits you and that the recipes in it are written just as they are in these pages.\\" -Judith Hill, Editor in ChiefThis cookbook is quite exciting and you will find many new recipes to try. The pictures are also fantastic. This book comes with my highest recommendation for gift giving.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Best of the Best, Vol. 4: 100 Best Recipes from the Best Cookbooks of the Year","review":"The afternoon I purchased this cookbook (enticed by the attractive, clear layout and the fact that the &quot;best&quot; consisted of recipes from a diverse array of cooking volumes), I immediately took it to the supermarket and prepared several dishes within four days -- Palace Olive Poppers, Fast Gazpacho, Cheese-and-Mushroom Quesadillas, and Toasted Penne with Herbs, Goat Cheese, and Golden Bread Crumbs. The first three were extremely simple and not time-consuming, while the fourth required more time and effort but was certainly worth the investment. The Poppers I made again within a week because my husband craved them again (even a half recipe makes a meal) The Gazpacho fits it with my low carb diet, and also was successful for a pot-luck ladies' luncheon. I anticipate happily undertaking more treasures in this volume, including the Bite-Size Cheddar and Thyme Gougeres, Quick Fried Shrimp with Toasty Garlic, Sage Tagliarini, Tagliatelle Souffle(an unusual and impressive-looking creation), and Chocolate Heart of Darkness Cakes.

Steve Farrar was our speaker. We were not familiar with Steve's work. Steve announced his weekend topic as simply Psalms 23 ... line by line ... for three days. First note to self ... this could get tedious.A wonderful surprise ... it was dynamite! Steve grabs your attention with a treble hook. These rote verses came alive, brilliantly decrypted and positioned in the relatable context. The 6 verses, in Steve's macro/microscopic delivery brought Psalms 23 into the 21st century ... all brand spankin' new.We wanted more. I've now read \\"Gettin' There\\". Each chapter is a WOW of cogitative discovery. There's so much more to Psalms than I had been equipped to absorb before reading \\"Gettin' There\\".Steve's a big man, an impossing orator, a critical thinker of Gospel origins and here and now evangelistic thought. I was able to see his style and delivery in every word of \\"Gettin' There\\".

It is basically a devotional from the book of Psalms which uses the word \\"path\\" many times. The author uses a western theme and relates this to be like a \\"trail\\" that you take. He has great stories to illustrate the choices of trails that have been taken by those who have gone before us, good and bad.

The three novellas, A Players Paradise, At Your Service and A Man and a Half, highlight the lucky and the not so lucky in and out of lust and love.In A Player's Paradise, Kenton is the player extraordinaire until he meets his match in a game of cat and mouse. D. T. Niles is more than Kenton bargained for and her clever secret will rock his world. After facing financial ruin, Franklin enters into a game of survival that bursts in his face in At Your Service. Serving as a co-dependant for his mother and sister, Franklin enters into the world of a would be escort only to find affection with a client. Wesley, the most sensitive and loving of the trio, enters into the game in A Man and A Half after being stood up at the altar. All his attempts to reconcile with his bride are for naught which sends him spiraling in to the arms of all the wrong women only to crash and burn.Each story is intriguing as it is funny; the antics of the primary and secondary are like none other and at times, over the top. The authors did a good job of highlighting the dysfunctional characteristics of the players and the people in their lives. In A Player's Paradise, Kenton's friends appear to be needy and envious of Kenton to the point of pathetic in an attempt to emulate him. With At Your Service, Franklin's mother is a non-working woman whose occupation is the latest scheme, whether it is through the Internet or hustling knock off designer items. Her hold on Franklin is unreal and her behavior towards Franklin and any woman in his life is a bit much, but then again, this is fiction therefore drama and more drama. The secondary characters, in each story, play a necessary role as you come to realize the demons, which the characters carry from childhood to adulthood, which plague them.Each author wrote with a mature pen as the conflicts the characters went through jumped from the pages. You end with some heartfelt emotions towards the three men in question and feel for the women they come into contact with.

He let women know what the situation was-up front. He even did a \\"clean sweep\\" of his home from top to bottom between women-even if they were back to back. But...then he met his match, Delta, a female with a player's attitude. His life changed and was turned upside down. She had him hooked-through the nose. She was his competition in more ways than one. Victor created an enjoyable novella and we are awaiting his next book.In A Man and A Half, Wesley, a good man, was left standing at the altar by Sheila, the love of his life. And to top things off, his boys, Omega and Ten, didn't have the nerve to tell him before the wedding that he and Sheila were a mismatch. Wesley was deeply hurt and tried everything to get Sheila back. When it didn't work, he decided to go back to being a player-even if he wasn't very good at it. His bad luck went downhill-faster than an avalanche. He went through \\"all the wrong\\" women, including a stalker and one who made him loose his job. All while a woman and a half was right before his eyes. Phillip created a novella that ran up and down the emotional roller coaster.In At Your Service, Franklin, a good guy with a bad influence from his money-scheming mother, fights with his girlfriend, Cassandra, because of a $1,000 \\"loan\\" to his mother. He suddenly looses his girlfriend and his high-paying job-all in one day-and finally decides to get a job with his cousin as an \\"escort.\\" During these bad times, Franklin never abandons his lifelong dream of opening a fitness center.

I was expecting so much more from this book to be honest.\\"A Player's Paradise\\" by Victor McGlothin. I am a new fan of Victor having just completed \\"Sinful\\" and \\"Sinful Too\\" I had high expectations for his shorty story and as I dove in I wasn't disappointed. Kenton Reese is the ulimate and smooth player, as Chief of Marketing and Sales at Dream Creames he has a nice bachelor pad and is used to running through many women. When he meets his match in Delta (who later finds is the competitor taking his business) the story was set up perfectly and well written. I was so disappointed by the fast and rushed ending...it seemed like if Victor had more pages this story could have played out so much better but because he was forced to come to a quick conclusion the ending didn't live up to how masterfully he wrote the beginning of this story.\\"At Your Service\\" by Earl Sewell. This was actually my favorte read of the three short stories...the pace was right nothing seemed forced or rushed. Franklin Crenshaw (though I was confused by his name since the back panel of the book speaks of a Jimmy being in this character). Franklin is easily manipulated by his mother who runs schemes and in the most latest he takes $1000 out of his live-in girlfriend's account to give his mother money. Of course Cassandra leaves, but not without running up his credit cards first leaving him in alot of debt. He loses his job after being exposed in an aduit and at the encourageement of his cousin becomes a high class escort...he meets Cassandra and their love affair is a steamy one. His mother as always tries to run this new girlfriend out of his life but he finally puts his foot down. I like how it ended...of the three men in this book I will say that Frankin sounded the most delicious.\\"A Man and a Half\\" by Philip Thomas Duck. I am new to this author so I went in without any expectations and I was actually really disappointed in this story and it is the least favorite of this series. Wesley Matthews seems so desperate and pathetic I can never get into the story...granted his fiance Sheila left him jilted at the author then threw many hurtful things in his face including her gorgeous, dreadlocked \\"personal trainer\\" AJ. After being jilted he is desperate to get Sheila back and goes through an episode of trying to make her jealous and then taking her back (flaws and all) to only see her cheat with his own two eyes. His attempt at becoming a player is laughable...the two women he gets hooked up with don't make him seem like a player to me more than these women just wanted a good lay. Everything was awkward about him...to top off this unbelievable story his ex-fiance's best friend Janet had been secretly in love with him and admits it to Sheila...and as if I wasn't disappointed with the rest of this book, it ends with his ex-fiance giving her best friend a makeover so that she can win him. I am sorry I can't ever see myself doing this for any of my friends...why? I didn't like this story though I thought the real player in this story was Sheila and not Wesley. Sheila didn't become attached and worked her way around Wesley and the others...I was expecting a Player's Paradise type of book and only two stories lived up to that and really on one of the stories left me wanting more.

The first is The Secret Power of The Word, in which the author discusses the science of sacred sound with reference to its principle of resonance (sympathetic vibration), the principles of rhythm, melody and harmony, plus qualities like pitch and timbre. The scales and the healing elements of music are investigated - the section on the musical interplay with theChakrasis particularly enlightening. Other fascinating sections are The Occult Significance of Speech and Mystical Words of Power which deals with ritual words and sounds like the Hebrew God-names plusSanskrit Mantrasand chants.Part Two, the Renaissance of the Bardic Traditions, provides a history of the mystical bards and deals with magical storytelling. It includes a section on musical instruments like the lyre, harp, guitar, keyboard instruments, flute and others. There is also a captivating section onmagical poetrywith a discussion of forms such as alliteration, repetition, anagrams, assonance, meter, rhythm and rhyme. The book concludes with the chapter Bardic Healing that provides practical techniques for tuning and healing the human body.There are notes to every chapter, a select bibliography on (a) sound, music and voice and (b) on the Bardic traditions. The illustrations include musical notations, the humanbodyand the chakras, plus the astrological musical wheels of the spheres. Several helpful tables are also provided, for example on the God-names.Andrews has succeeded in bringing to life the lost tradition of the Word in this well-written and engaging book that opens the door to our understanding and using the power of sound, music and words for regeneration,vibrational healingand enhanced creativity.This book is ideal for those interested in esoteric healing, in the metaphysical aspects of sound and music and for those who lovesacred musicin any tradition. If sound has always been considered the direct link between humanity and the divine, this excellent book, Sacred Sounds, serves as the key that provides access to that link again."},{"Title":"Sacred Sounds: Magic & Healing Through Words & Music","review":"This is the first book I've seen that links music, sound, and spoken word to chakras and healing centers in the body. Just as chakras respond to certain thoughts, and colors, the vibration of certain notes resonate to corresponding chakras. The right combination of sound and tone can be used to aid in spiritual healing. Ted Andrews describes a fascinating history of storytelling and music throughout time, the importance of maintaining oral and musical traditions. Sacred Sounds also covers the important power of words, and what actions they can create. This is a great and informative handbook on music and healing."},{"Title":"Sacred Sounds: Magic & Healing Through Words & Music","review":"This is a very well written book, as Ted Andrew's books are. They provide a great deal of explanation, details, and how-to instructions. This book provides lots of background information on the use of sound, in words and in music and how sound has related to healing for many years, much of which has become a lost art. Ted covers a lot of history, for credibility and for understanding the linear path to nowadays.If you think it is not logical that sounds can affect you, ask yourself how you feel when you listen to certain types of music. Try it. Does some music make you angry, some sad, some peaceful, and does some music make you feel love? How about words? Is there a word someone could call you to make your blood boil? Is there something nice someone said to you recently that made you feel like you could just melt? That's just to get you thinking. Now what if someone told you that you could maybe begin to reverse a health problem by playing a note that corresponds the the chakra area that has an energy blockage? Bull??? Worth a try?Ted goes all the way into details of 10 names of God from the Qabala and how to tone them properly. He explains which music notes influence and balance which chakras and a whole lot more. After reading this book, I now understand what is happening with my voice and why. There is a lot of metaphysical information found in this book as it relates to the use of sound that you will not normally find just anywhere. If you're looking for that kind of information, get the book.If you are interested in how animals might have messages for you, check out \\"Animal Speak\\" by Ted. I have also read several other books of his on the topics of angels and spirit guides, colors, and auras. They are all well written and provide a lot of information."},{"Title":"Sacred Sounds: Magic & Healing Through Words & Music","review":"Ted Andrews is a kind of person that leaves you with a feeling that whatever he does he does well. This also holds true for this book. It is a well structured and easy to read book for understanding the importance of sound in our daily lives. We are also reminded in the storytelling section that the words of the songs that we frequently listen can have a great subconscious impact on our feelings and emotions."},{"Title":"Sacred Sounds: Magic & Healing Through Words & Music","review":"I always enjoy the writing style of Ted Andrews.

In giving context to my review of this very important book, I should perhaps make clear that I was raised a Protestant, from a long line of Protestant clergymen. In fact, my dad's second cousin was a rather well known Protestant theologian. (Yes, that Tozer.)Belloc makes his case flawlessly. This past year, I have spent much time studying Scholastic philosophy. And we readily discern the profound impact of formal logic, cosmology, psychology, ethics, epistemology, and ontology in Belloc's beautiful and insightful prose.We are most grateful to the Neumann Press for making this wonderful and terribly important little book available in its attractive new format. And it is a short book. In fact, it can be read in one good, long sitting. He who does so, in one sitting or more, will have then at his command the essential arguments for the most important truths in the history of human civilization.

But graduation is drawing near, and Shima's ex-lover Amamiya is suspicious of Shima's behavior. Will he find out their secret? Will they stay together after Hikaru graduates? And does Shima really care about Hikaru? All these questions are asked and eventually answered in this conclusion to a strange yaoi tale. I was impressed that the translation work was improved in this volume, and that the ending was not as pat as most series wrap up. The emotions of the characters became surprisingly real, and the drawing as always was unique and lovely. The novel also includes a touching after-story bonus tale that makes you happy about everyone's fate in the end. This is a must-have for all yaoi fans. WARNING-Vol. 2 does contain an explicit shower scene, whereas the first volume's love scenes were relatively tame and hardly warranted the parental advisory. The graphic nature of the plot however is not recommended for children."},{"Title":"Passion, Volume 2 (Yaoi)","review":"Its hard for me to understand why I like this series so very much, when the plot is actually more twisted than I think even a lot of people who've read it realize. Passion Volume 1 and Passion Volume 2 are about the love affair between a student and a teacher, a line that should never be crossed. Albeit, Hikaru is an 18 year old (or at least I hope 18 year old) senior, it is still wrong. In the first book there is a scene where Hikaru's mom orders him to take a shower. He's sleeping with a man probably a decade older and wiser (or at least should be wiser) than him, but his mother is still telling him to take when to take his showers and asks him where he's going to be and who he's going to be with. Its not that the age difference is to great, or a big deal, its just that Hikaru is in high school, and Shima is his teacher. Shima, if you look very closely at how he acts in the manga, is mentally unbalanced. His ex broke up with him because he copied everything his ex did, conforming his wants, likes and dislikes to his. And in the begging of volume 1, Hikaru rapes him and Shima does . . . . nothing. A clear thinking person would have called the police, or, at the very least, avoided his attacker. But Shima encouraged him. Also in the first book. there is another scene which points to Shima's lack of emotional stability. Hikaru had just finished his finals and is hanging out and talking to some friends. Shima is gazing at him through the window. Jealous , he calls Hikaru and makes him chase him all throughout the city, forgetting his friends. Even if it were a normal relationship, this is not something rational person would do. Hikaru may have crossed the line, a person should NEVER force themselves on another person. But in this new volume, the reader discovers that Shima, was in fact, the one who crossed the line first. Volume 2 sheds new light on Shima. Instead of cold and unfathomable, he turns out to be very emotional and very, very human."},{"Title":"Passion, Volume 2 (Yaoi)","review":"Another of DMP's Yaoi Manga, it's not like most Yaoi Manga having the teacher as the Uke and the student as the Seme. It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it. The art didn't catch me and neither did the story. So if you are a true Yaoi Fan get it but if you only collect the good stuff, pass by this one. After all, two of the main characters get girlfriends and that's not my cup of tea when I prefer reading boys boinking."},{"Title":"Passion, Volume 2 (Yaoi)","review":"As I said with Volume 1, the art can take some getting used to and the translation is sometimes awkward, but the fascinating story makes up for any shortcomings in these areas. (This series is complete with Volume 2, though the author of the story talks about the possibility of a sequel.)One of the things I really enjoyed about this series is the way it challenges assumptions. Also, seeing the characters grow and become more mature people makes the story more entertaining; I think it is particularly easy to see how Hikaru has \\"grown up\\" in the \\"Valentine Side Story.\\" Eh... it's hard to talk about this manga without giving anything away... The ending is extremely satisfying. How's that?For further reading I recommend:Our Everlasting (yaoi)Kizuna - Bonds of Love (yaoi)Loveless (shonen ai-ish)"},{"Title":"Passion, Volume 2 (Yaoi)","review":"I was really looking forward to this after reading the first one, and I'm happy to say I loved it!

Is it possible? It is. Here you have one of those books that give you the chance of talking with an author in a special dialogue. Yes, he is the only speaker but it speaks in such a manner that it seems he is talking to you, you the reader.This book was published in 1965 and in that time Bronowski opens the first chapter with these words: \\"My fundamental assumption at the outset of these essays is that man is a part of nature.\\" It seems obvious, isn't it? Yes, maybe today on 2012. But what it is not obvious is the weaponry that the author uses to convince you: art, poetry, philosophy, psychology. All are called and come in a beautiful register: neither ornamentation nor redundant twists. Just the other way round: order, simplicity, scope.And even more...The first two essays (or chapters) are the best in its type. Almost never you find sentences as inspiring and courageous as these ones. He dominates not only the topics but also the style (I insist). So it is not only what he says but also the way he does.You cannot let it go. Believe me: DO CLICK and get it.

Bronowski has written an insightful book concerning the majorproblem of our time: how to integrate the findings of modern science to the humanist problem of values."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"The idea is an intriguing one. Down through the ages, mystical artifacts have been watched over by The Librarian. Forced to find a job- his very first- Flynn Carson, the perpetual student, and geek extrordinaire, is the unlikely choice for the newest Librarian.On his first day at work, Flynn finds that one of the artifacts, one segment of the legendary Spear of Destiny, has been stolen. His mission is to retrieve the other two parts before they can be reunited by the evil serpent brotherhood, and used for, of course, world domination.This book, and the television movie it was based on, did not try to deliver the most amazing adventure story ever told. No, what it promised to deliver was simply a good time.And it did.The story has humor, such as Flynn's comment, \\"The fate of the world is in my hands... that's just so sad.\\" Through the course of the book, Flynn travels to remote locations, survives against perilous opposition, and uses trivia to solve many of his problems in a deductive way that Sherlock Holmes would be proud of.In short, this is a fun story, not meant to be the ultimate adventure or a serious 'get the bad guys' tale, but just to take the reader, for a moment, on a fun ride.The Librarian shows that even the unlikeliest person can be a hero, and that the world needs to be felt and experienced, not just understood."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"I love this book. There is so much in this book. Imagine the Lost Library of Alexandria, loaded with books, knowledge from all over the world through the ages, and then someone sets it on fire, and all that knowledge is lost to you. All those artifacts gone forever. Now, imagine an ancient order of Librarians, and it is their job to look after and protect this knowledge, and add to the Library which is now the most secure place on the planet. Encounter the Lost Ark, the Holy Grail, a unicorn and more. Go with the Librarian as he makes his way through an Amazon Jungle to find the missing pieces of the Spear of Christ, while a dangerous deadly group are in the chase determined to take the Spear and the weld the power it possesses.There is more in the book than in the TNT made for tv movie. Now they have the second movie The Librarian: Return to King Solomons Mines, but no book. I really hoped for a book series of adventures. You can do so much more in a book than a movie. I'd like this book in hardback. I'd like Lost Horizon in a hardback (it was the 1st paper back). Enjoy the book, see the movie, visit the website, tell them, we love this, we want more."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"I liked all the adventures, like going through the Amazon and finding the Mayan temple. I liked that everyone thought Flynn was a geek, but he turned out to be the hero."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"The concept was interesting, though in my opinion, heavily borrowed from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" It seems, beneath the New York Public Library, there is another collection presided over by The Librarian. Among the artifacts in this collection are Pandora's Box, the Holy Grail, and of course the Spear of Destiny.An evil brotherhood manages to steal the one-third of the Spear of Destiny held in this collection. The Librarian, Flynn Carson, uber nerd and a new hire, has to go after the other two-thirds of the spear before the Brotherhood can unite all three pieces together for their nefarious purposes. Accompanying him is a too beautiful for words sidekick who can also kick serious butt.Great concept, which might have worked save for the excessive silliness and simplicity of the writing. I really do think this book would be great for Young Adult readers who are not quite ready to go to Harry Potter, but need a start in fantasy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"I thought that the story was wonderful, but I probably wouldn't have liked it as much had I not seen the film first. The writing is a little too simplistic and banal, but it was good overall."},{"Title":"The Adventures of the Librarian: Quest For The Spear","review":"This is a novelization. As such, the reader needs to be aware of what to attribute to the scriptwriter and what to the novelization author. Sometimes the novelization author can improve of what is in the screenplay. Unfortunately, this time both are bad.An ancient organization known as The Library has been safeguarding powerful relics that humanity is not ready for. A rival ancient order wants the items for their own bid for power. Flynn Carson is a professional student who finds himself needing a job. He is offered the position of The Librarian, the guardian of The Library.Flynn starts his new job only to be thrust into a quest to find the hidden pieces of the Spear of Destiny. The trip takes him around the world and wins him the love and sexual favors of a beautiful Library employee.Now lets look at what might be wrong with the original story.Our characters are on a commercial international flight. The pilots have been entertaining someone in the cockpit. Both pilots escort their guest back to their seat. All of this occurs on a flight in a reality that includes an Air Marshall on board.On an international flight, the door is opened and several characters jump out. Apparently everyone was wearing their seatbelts as no one else fell out. The jumpers did not use any method to breathe in the rarified atmosphere.The super-genius thinks his cell phone will work in the Amazon. We then have a cell phone receive a call in the Amazon (maybe phone rates are so high because they have been spending money to put transmitting towers al through the Amazon).An ancient riddle written in a language that predates the Tower of Babel has an answer in English.A holy Christian relic can only be repaired though a Pagan ritual that calls on the Old Gods (let's ask Jesus about that one).Although the show seems to be pushed as a family show, it is important to the plot that the hero has sex with someone he only met a couple of days earlier (let's hear it for family values).The list goes on and on. But what about the book author? Well, right at the beginning we are given a taste of what to expect during the course of the book. Flynn is escorted through an \\"empty hallway\\" and then we get a description of all of the things in the hallway. Is it empty or not?The adventure angle and the popular cast will, I am sure, get good ratings at first, but as for the novelization, it should remain in the slush pile."},{"Title":"Flashman in the Great Game","review":"Wonderful, rousing, and educational - you have to read this with a bookmark in the footnotes section, and you'll probably enjoy doing so - the historical research Fraser does is astounding, and exposes much of the hypocrisy of John Company's stay in &quot;Indja&quot;."},{"Title":"Flashman in the Great Game","review":"Yet another victory for Flashman during the Mutiny.

If you have enjoyed Kipling's Indian stories then Flashman is also worth a try."},{"Title":"Flashman in the Great Game","review":"How does George MacDonald Fraser do it? The great Indian Mutiny was one of the most appalling, bloody episodes in all Britain's imperial history, a period when - to use GMF's phrase - \\"fear, shock, ignorance, and racial and religious intolerance, on both sides, combined to produce a hatred akin to madness\\". Indian rebels butchered hundreds of European women and children. British troops retaliated by lashing suspected mutineers to the muzzles of their cannons and blowing them to smithereens. And yet GMF only has to drop his fictional anti-hero Harry Flashman into the action and the whole grisly affair becomes the unlikely backdrop for a fantastically entertaining tale of comical cowardice, unintentional bravery, narrow squeaks, and non-stop rogering and randyfication.

He wrote many books, such asA Christian View of men and Things (A Treatise Showing that Social Stability Demands a Christian Society), ,Thales to Dewey,An Introduction to Christian Philosophy,God and Evil The Problem Solved,God's Hammer: The Bible and Its Critics, etc.He asserts that \\"It is essential to define Christianity more exactly by a specific doctrinal system. Romanism is not what is meant. By Christianity we shall mean, to use common names, what is called Calvinism.\\" (Pg. 23) He elaborates, \\"outside the Bible the most accurate and satisfactory expressions of Christianity are the carefully worded creedal statements of the Westminster Confession.\\" (Pg. 146)He is critical of fundamentalism, which he describes as \\"a faith without reason\\" (pg. 71), and suggests that \\"Frequently they deplore reason, knowledge, and scholarship.\\" (Pg. 89)He rejects the idea that God's existence can be demonstrated on the basis of observation of nature. (Pg. 45) He admits, interestingly, that \\"The idea of a finite god, although it is a non-christian expedient, has nonetheless a certain amount of merit by reason of its honesty.\\" (Pg. 198) Later, he argues that \\"As God cannot sin, so in the next place, God is not responsible for sin, even though he decrees it.\\" (Pg. 240)This is a substantial augmentation of the explanation of Clark's apologetic approach."},{"Title":"The Romantic Imperative: The Concept of Early German Romanticism","review":"One can only give an exhaustive work like this five stars. But be warned, Professor Beiser's perspective is decidedly non-literature in nature. That is, there is little or no analysis of the poetry or prose of EGR, instead, exhaustive investigation of EGR philosophical writings, especially of the Schlegels.One thing I personally despise is our modern tendency to see figures in the past as merely precursors to our great and lofty present-day mindset. This happens so often in literature scholarship that I rarely look at any 20th/21st century literarure scholarship anymore! If you've seen one Marxist lesbian clasping the Brontes to her ample bosom, you've seen them all! Beiser cannot be accused of this, so thoroughly objective are his treatments. But having said that, he does seem to spin the EGR as merely a curious branch of the greater Enlightenment. He carefully, meticulously argues that EGR is NOT an anti-rationalist backlash against the \\"Rationalismus ueber alles\\" Enlightenment, that the orderly, logical, rationalist approach is very much in evidence in their philosophical arguments, and that they never argue for outright rebellion against rational processes. I wouldn't mind thrashing this out a bit more with him, as I can see many examples in, say, the writings of Novalis that clearly favor intuitive sensibility over brute-force logic and reductionism:\\"...when those who sing or kiss know more than the most learned scholars...and people will recognize that the true histories of the world lie in fairy tales and poems...then at a single secret word this whole wrongheaded existence will fly away.\\"...that's pretty right-brained, IMHO.I'm not accusing Professor Beiser of one-sidedness, but I would suggest reading the actual literature also for a nice, rounded view. To my thinking, rationalism has been quite the bully down through the years; it does not play well with other philosophies. With symbolic \\"yes or no\\" logic, it seeks to bring order where the sheer complexity and sublimity might suggest a different approach. Obviously, learned noblemen like Novalis would not resort to irrationalism, but would strive to couch the \\"loose, far-flung webs\\" of his Poesie revolution in reasonable language, language with the empirical quality that others may read it and get the same gist reading after reading. But this cannot be seen as some odd subset of rationalism itself. Novalis is speaking of a \\"beyondness,\\" to my thinking.The modern 20th/21st century arts can be crudely described as the ironical if not absurdist reaction to the madness of the rationalist juggernaut, i.e., modernism is reationary. However, I get something far more subtle than reactionary from EGR. If we are to understand the universe through \\"Poesie\\" instead of \\"numbers and figures,\\" as Novalis says, there must be a very positive as well as intense effort made. When I read Thomas Carlyle's account of Novalis and see his bright, innocent face in the one surviving painting of him, I know The Way Forward lies in him and his band of brothers, and not through any of the twisted, jaded \\"sick puppies\\" the 20th/21st century has produced. All in all, Beiser has done us a great service with this book in shoring up the philosophical underpinnings of EGR."},{"Title":"The Romantic Imperative: The Concept of Early German Romanticism","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested, the author is obviously an expert in the field and offers a clear, in depth and surprisingly objective study of the mechanism behind the genesis of romanticism."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"this was the first terry southern novel i've read. the frantic irrational tone this book creates is great. the characters are right on par with o'toole's &quot;confederacy of dunces&quot;. as well it reminds me a bit of vonnegut, without the omniscient narration. 4 instead of 5 because it was a bit open ended and short. probably would be a better movie. but of course that was southern's primary strength."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"&quot;Flash and Filigree&quot; is like nothing you'll ever read. Satirist, Terry Southern's first novel is one wild ride into the realms of insanity and obsession. The story begins with a head-scratcher of a meeting between a Doctor and a Patient, and soon has them in a game of cat and mouse in the streets of 1950's Los Angelas. I loved the way in which Southern toys with the reader: Who's crazy? Who's insane? Who's paranoid? Who's obsessed with who? Who's following who? Southern is relentless! I think I could do without the story of the nurse, which has nothing to do with the doctor's or the patient's. I also loved some of the supporting characters: The drunken detective, the pot-head bar girl, etc. This book is as sick and bizarre a novel about obsession and paranoia as any book I've read.

Couldn't have.The book I read alternated between being boring and self-consciously \\"avante-garde.\\" In defense of Mr. Southern, this is very much a first novel. Lots of characters, lots of plot and. . .it all goes nowhere. The characters, all of them, are selfish, self-serving neurotic a-holes. It was impossible to feel anything for them. Only the Latino gardener character was anything resembling human.If you're new to Southern's writing, skip this effort and go right to THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN---so much a superior book, it's hard to believe it was written by the same guy. For what it's worth, in the fine Southern biography, A GRAND GUY, it's noted that Allen Ginsberg couldn't make heads or tails of FLASH AND FILIGREE either."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"Terry Southern is a master satirist in _Flash and Filigree_. Fans of David's Cronenburg's _Crash_ will certainly consume this book in a single sitting... simply to follow the exploits of Dr. Eichner (who would have been a nice addition to the movie; I guess Cronenburg didn't do his homework). Southern handles this whirlwind, insanely paced novel with totalitarian precision and makes every word (regardless of how trivial the word may seem) count. Southern was doing the gig that Tarrantino is now doing in the 50s. Southern also is not fearful of the controversial and he boldly depicts the daterape of Babs by Ralph. The scene is trash, but, by God, Southern writes trash perfectly. Besides, scenes such as this put the bread on the tables of MacKinnon, and Andrea Dworkin (this scene would have fit nicely into Dworkin's theoretical manifesto _Intercourse_). The characters are unforgetable (in fact, they have inspired a few characters in some of the stories that I have written). In summation: this review is chaotic, the book is not, buy it, or rot in boredom as you remain a slave to television."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"Flash and Filigree is Southern at his very late-50s best,and is the only work that can stand together with TheMagic Christian. If you can forgive the dated anddiscomforting date-rape chapter, the rest of the bookwill have you alternately courting hernia from excessivelaughter and horror from Southern's bizarre juxtapositions.Where else can one find a therapist who coldcocks hispatients with a heavy glass ashtray ?"},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"Warped sense of humor, bizarre story line, great story telling. It's Terry Southern...what more needs to be said? What's REALLY wild about it is that this is his first novel, yet could have been anywhere along the chain. it's just pure TS."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"Strange book...totally not what I expected from the man who wrote Easy Rider. Actually funny in a couple of spots, but left me feeling perplexed as to why I read it."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"I slogged through it only because Terry Southen has written some of the best books I have ever read. The Magic Christian and Candy are wonderful works of satire, so I kept thinking \\"This has to get better.\\" It did not. The character's thoughts and motivations were wierd, overly complicated (as oppposed to Complex) and out of sinc with what was going on or at least just plain stupid It's hard to see the same author behind this one. Maybe it is because it was his first novel. I felt it was written by someone who is highly intelligent but completely lacking in esthetic judgement."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"The story was disjointed. I read cosiderabje of the story and never got to a connection between the characters. It was as though there were multiple stories. I didn't finish the story. This story is the first in years that I couldn't finish."},{"Title":"Flash And Filigree","review":"A brilliant treatise on the question of identity, reality, normalicy, obsession and sanity. Is Dr Eichner obsessed with Treevly, or is it the other way 'round? Does it matter? Can't wait for the film version."},{"Title":"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc Official Strategy Guide","review":"How much can you say for a game guide? Well, quite a bit actually--some are little more than a cursory walk through, while some may have more about the game (or game series) history than it devotes to walk throughs, and secrets. While this guide doesn't give you much about Rayman's history, or the story, it certainly has everything else you would expect it to have. It provides an excellent explanation of the scoring system (which the game user manual lacks), and teaches the player how to maximize their scoring. It has no maps, but you don't really need them. The walkthroughs are adequate, provide tips on how to defeat enemies and bosses quickly, and efficiently, and more importantly, highlights major scoring opportunities, and tricks to accessing secret rooms. It also spotlights the scoring thresholds needed to unlock the bonus games, and hoodlum training tapes. Having a scoring table for the various levels was a very nice touch as well since it helps emphasize scoring instead of simply completing the game. Much of this game's challenge lies in getting a good score, and this seems to be an aspect that's overlooked by most Rayman 3 players. Being given an enemies list was another good touch, and can be helpful, but not as much so as the score table. This guide is also very well organized, complete with callouts on all the collectible creatures (which can be worth BIG points if acquired correctly) in each area of each level, as well as the maximum attainable score. The collectible creature callouts are especially useful because they can be quite easily overlooked otherwise. The screenshots are adequately large, bright, and clear, and generally do a good job giving you visual cues as to what you're supposed to be doing. The single drawback to this guide is that it does not reveal how to access the super secret \\"Zowar Secret Room\\" (it's in the last level, and has to be approached with a cumulative score of over 400,000 points before it will open) which contains four 1,500 point green jewels, as well as a glimpse at 3 creatures which were dropped from the game at the last minute for unknown reasons. Those shooting for scores worthy of the global leaderboard at Rayman Zone will undoubtedly want access to this room because it holds the largest single scoring opportunity in the game, and it's just irritating to discover there is a secret in the game the guide doesn't reveal--isn't having this sort of information revealed supposed to be what players buy strategy guides for?The guide covers all platforms Rayman 3 is available for, is logically laid out, well organized, and very easy to read and use. There isn't enough good to be said for good layout, and smart organization; few things are more irritating than guides whose information is scattered all about, which ultimately insures scouring the text for clues, flipping back and forth, and keeping track of a bookmark. Perhaps most importantly, this guide helps players discover a dimension of challenge in this game that many have overlooked, and harshly criticized it for lacking. It's difficult not to believe that this game might have been more successful if more people had bought the guide alongside it. Overall, aside from the glaring omission of the \\"Zowar Secret Room\\", Brady has done an excellent job on this guide. And though the omission of the Zowar Secret is pretty significant, in the big picture, it is a single secret in a large game that has many secrets, so while it's a big deal in principle, how much it matters to you is your call to make. This guide is also out of print, and an extremely rare find even in secondhand outlets. At the end of the day, and especially in lieu of the affordable price marketplace sellers are offering it for, this guide is an indespensible companion for the game, is very helpful, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc Official Strategy Guide","review":"This guide is great. \\"Rayman 3\\" has tons of secret rooms, and this guide will show you where they are so you can get a much higher score. For that reason alone, this guide is awesome. I would never have found some of those rooms myself. I was able to get a much higher score in the game with the guide's help. This guide also has tips for getting more points, tells you about enemies, the controls, the scores you need for all the extras, etc, in addition to getting through the game itself, of course. In short, this guide has everything you need, and it is one of the best video game guides I have."},{"Title":"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc Official Strategy Guide","review":"I bought this as used good quality and it was like new talk about customer satisfaction! I would definately recomend this."},{"Title":"I Shall Not Die: Titokowaru's War New Zealand, 1868-9","review":"While parts of the book are slow moving it does convey the sophistication of Titokowaru from his military strategy to his letters to the British. It also provides a picture of life for early settlers in New Zealand.A good read for New Zealanders who think that history only happens in the battlefields of Europe!"},{"Title":"I Shall Not Die: Titokowaru's War New Zealand, 1868-9","review":"Straddling the Maori and European worlds of the 1860s, Titokowaru was one of New Zealand's greatest leaders. A brilliant strategist, he used every device he could to save the Taranaki Mori people from European invasion. When peaceful negotiation failed, he embarked on a stunning military campaign against government forces. His victories were many - before the battle he lost. In the end though, he was \\"forgotten by the Pakeha as a child forgets a nightmare\\", but his vision endured. \\"I Shall Not Die: Titokowaru's War, New Zealand, 1868-9\\" won the Adam Award for an outstanding contribution to New Zealand literature 1989-90.Titokowaru's War was a military conflict that took place in the South Taranaki region of New Zealand's North Island from June 1868 to March 1869 between the Ngti Ruanui Mori tribe and the New Zealand Government. The conflict, near the conclusion of the New Zealand land wars, was a revival of hostilities of the Second Taranaki War as Riwha Titokowaru, chief of the Ngti Ruanui's Ngaruahine hapu (sub-tribe), responded to the continued surveying and settlement of confiscated land with well-planned and effective attacks on settlers and government troops in an effort to block the occupation of Mori land.The war, coinciding with a violent raid on a European settlement on the East Coast by fugitive guerrilla fighter Te Kooti, shattered what European colonists regarded as a new era of peace and prosperity, creating fears of a \\"general uprising of hostile Moris\\", but once Titokowaru was defeated and the East Coast threat minimised, the alienation of Mori land, as well as the political subjugation of Mori, continued at an even more rapid pace.Titokowaru, who had fought in the Second Taranaki War, was the most skilful West Coast Mori warrior. He also assumed the roles of a priest and prophet of the extremist Hauhau movement of the Pai Mrire religion, reviving ancient rites of cannibalism and propitiation of Mori gods with the human heart torn from the first slain in a battle. Although Titokowaru's forces were numerically small and initially outnumbered in battle 12 to one by government troops, the ferocity of their attacks provoked fear among settlers and prompted the resignation and desertion of many militia volunteers, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of most government military forces from South Taranaki and giving Titokowaru control of almost all territory between New Plymouth and Wanganui.Titokowaru provided the strategy and leadership that had been missing among tribes that had fought in the Second Taranaki War. His forces never lost a battle during their intensive campaign, but abandoned their resistance after being pursued into their headquarters in the swamps of Ngaere by Colonel George Stoddart Whitmore, commander of the colonial forces, on March 25, 1869.[4]Titokowaru's apparent invincibility created a security crisis in 1868, with the government fearing attacks on Wanganui and Manawatu. According to New Zealand historian James Belich, his achievements were gradually watered down to the point where his name was erased from the most widely-read New Zealand histories. Belich concludes: \\"As a result, the military crisis of which he was the principal architect - perhaps the greatest threat to European dominance in the history of New Zealand - has all but disappeared from the received version.\\"The two final New Zealand Wars, those of Te Kooti and Titokowaru, present an interesting contrast. Titokowaru used the pa system to such devastating effect that, at one stage the New Zealand government thought they had lost the war. Te Kooti, (readRedemption Songs: A Life of TE Kooti Arikirangi TE Turuki)on the other hand, was an effective guerrilla leader, but showed little or no skill in fighting from a fixed position. He had ill-built pa, inadequately supplied, and he held on to them for too long. Te Kooti's War ended due to his defeat at Nga Tapa and Te Porere.The New Zealand Wars (aka Maori Wars) overall are an interesting area of study: They were a series of armed conflicts that took place in New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The wars were fought over a number of issues, the most prominent being Mori concern over land being sold to the (european, primarily British) settler population. Maori forces were always outnumbered by the British, who at one stage had 18,000 troops in New Zealand, but Maori tactics for many years offset the superiority in numbers and weapons of the British forces. As an example, at Gate Pa during the Tauranga Campaign in 1864, Mori withstood a day-long bombardment in their bomb shelters. One authority calculated that Gate Pa absorbed in one day a greater weight of explosives per square metre than did the German trenches in the week-long bombardment leading up to the Battle of the Somme. The palisade being destroyed, the British troops rushed the pa whereupon Mori fired on them from hidden trenches, killing thirty-eight and injuring many more in the most costly battle for the Pkeh of the New Zealand Wars.In all these various Wars, Titokowaru emerged as probably the most capable of the Maori military commanders and Belich's book is an interesting study of this now little-known conflict. For a broader study of the Maori Wars, Belich'sThe New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflictis a good recounting. For a very British account from the actual period of the wars, read G A Henty'sMaori and Settler: A Story of the New Zealand War.ContentsMaps and plans1. Titokowaru's peace2.

It is not overly long or complicated and should not intimidate a beginning programmer like some books do. A CD-ROM containing Visual Basic is included so no extra software has to be purchased. There are also over 100 program examples included, with all their code and screen captures of the resulting forms. All new topics are fully covered in a concise manner. Everything is easy to follow. Every chapter contains many programming exercises for the user to try and a second CD-ROM is included containing the code for the programs in the book."},{"Title":"Simplified Visual Basic","review":"This book is absolutely horrible for beginners, or even for those upgrading to Visual Basic 6.0 from a previous version. It fails the Visual Basic programmer in a number of ways.The book fails to adequately describe the properties of Visual Basic's standard controls, giving only a cursory discussion of a handful of properties. It even goes so far as not discussing a property it expects the reader to utilize in the chapter exercises.Where sample code is provided, it often completely confuses the reader. Code is shown in the book from screen shots, with no attention paid to the fact that the code was often cut off on the far right due to the author's screen resolution.In addition, this book is poorly laid out. It expects the user to learn debugging in the second chapter of programming, before even touching on variables or decision-making processes.In at least one instance, the book actually provides incorrect syntax for a frequently used statement. The SELECT CASE statement is incorrectly taught as simply SELECT, causing any reader trying to duplicate Wilborn's code to get syntax errors until they figure out on their own the correct syntax for the statement.In short, I would not recommend this book for anyone, whether a beginning user or an advanced programmer. Its inconsistencies will confuse and frustrate the beginner, and will probably annoy the advanced programmer."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics for Public Administration","review":"This text provides good examples of statistical problems pertaining to public administration. However, the text does not do a good job in explaining how to use certain statistical tools to solve problems(e.g. chi-square). In addition, some of the statistical tables are confusing for students."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics for Public Administration","review":"At one hundred fifty dollars this book is a total rip. It's softcover for chrissakes, and boring! You can get the international edition for less (I paid forty one dollars)."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This is my third Goddard book and he never really ceases to amaze me. I read Closed Circle first, which was great, but then Out of the Sun was incredible. This one, like all of his work, has a wonderfully crafted plot and excitement galore. Goddard is a hidden gem outside England, and that's a shame. If you don't know which of his books to buy, start with Past Caring and you'll get all of them after that. Goddard has quickly become my favorite author and I will gladly devour anything he writes!!"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This was my first Robert Goddard novel, and after reading this book in less than 24 hours I can certainly be considered a new fan.I simply could not put this book down. It did what every good thriller should be able to do -- transfix you and make you want to turn the page to see what happens next. It was the twists that kept me reading this book. However, they are not so frequent that you expect a twist at the end of every chapter. There are just enough thrown in to make you reconsider every time you think you've sorted out what is really going on.Reading the other reviews posted here, I was a little concerned about all the flashbacks that this novel uses. But upon reading the book I found it no problem at all. It is not overdone and they are all contexualised with modern day events. One will have no problem at all keeping track of things.I was glued to this novel for the better part of a day, reading it in very quick time. I simply had to find out what was going to happen next! If you like that in a thriller, then you will greatly enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This was my first Robert Goddard book and I was pleasantly surprised. Goddard's writing evokes a sense of place almost as strong as those created by P.D. James. I don't think all of Goddard's characters are as well drawn as they might have been, but he does a good job with the Great Uncle, Christian, and Nicky. &quot;Simone&quot; is over the top at times, and her character stretched my suspension of disbelief pretty taut.The plot reminded me of LeCarre's &quot;Perfect Spy&quot; or Deborah Crombie's &quot;Kissed a Sad Goodbye&quot; with it's the twists and turns and links between the present action and the events of the past. I found it a challenge to keep things straight at times, but I anticipated almost every plot twist before it happened with a few exceptions, so either I'm pretty good at deciphering mysteries, or the plot isn't as confusing as some critics have suggested. I also think it helped to read the book in a 24 hour period.I recommend this book. It's head and shoulders above many other mysteries I've read lately by &quot;famous&quot; authors."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Another unique mystery from the pen of Robert Goddard, a writer who knows how to create thought provoking, absorbing stories peopled with conflicted characters, some-what flawed protagonists and descriptive images of the British countryside that are so vivid you feel an overwhelming urge to jump on the next plane and have a look for yourself.The story spans a period of time from the late 1940's to the early 1980's and examines the impact of a 35 year old murder on the two families directly involved. The characters expose us to the full gamut of emotions as they experience friendship, honor, lost love, avarice, hate, vengeance, and the strong antipathy between family members..........and...... as with many novels set \\"across the pond\\" money and social status are the name of the game and losing is not a viable option.The plot of BEYOND RECALL has as many twists and turns as a Grand Prix course with the same potentially hazardous consequences should a wrong turn be taken by our protagonist.The main thing I appreciate about Goddard's writing is that his stories are always logical in their resolution. No inconsistencies, abrupt endings or surprises out of left field. The solution was always there for us to see, it just took a while for it to come into focus."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Estranged from his family, Chris Napier returns home for the first time in years to attend his niece's wedding at the family estate Tredower House converted into a hotel in Truro, Cornwall. Unwanted at the ceremony, Nicky Lanyon arrives insisting to his childhood friend Chris that his father Michael never killed Chris' great uncle Joshua Carnoweth over three decades ago; although authorities hung the man for the murder insisting the motive was greed as he was about to be replaced as the heir.Nicky accentuates his point when he is found the next day hanging from a tree; apparently having committed suicide. As homage to Nicky and to alleviate his guilt having ignored the plea, Chris decides to investigate the 1981 homicide of Joshua though his preference remains leaving the past buried.This is an exciting tale of murder, blackmail, and avarice within an extended family as secrets from the past are slowly revealed. The story takes a bit of time to introduce the three prime interrelated families, but once it does the plot never decelerates as the tangled history is unraveled one dangerous thread at a time by Chris. Fans will enjoy this fine suspense thriller filled with twists and spins that shake the hero as he uncovers the truth.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Have read all of Goddards books, and definitely recommend this one, (as all the others!).

For those who wish there was one more Agatha Christie novel."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"Thanks, AMazon, for recommending this...read it in one sitting and then ordered all his other titles. Fast-paced, eintelligent, well-written and well-plotted...this author deserves a wider readership!"},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"This is a terrific, complex book. It begins with a suicide, not a murder, but that act of self-destruction opens a door into the past -- a past that is filled with murder, blackmail, inheritance, duplicity, and the hanging of a possibly-innocent man.As the book begins, Chris Napier, a childhood friend of the suicide, begins to explore the reasons for his friend's death. Chris is driven at first by guilt. He had let go of his friendship with Nicky years ago, when both were boys and Nicky's father was hung for murder. Chris hadn't meant to abandon his friend, but the murder drove a wedge between their families, and, finally, it drove Nicky's family to leave the area and take up a new life.Before long, however, Chris is driven by more than guilt. The original murder may be long in the past, but once he has opened the door, that past comes alive in the present. Chris digs -- he finds the retired policeman who investigated the case; an aged witness from the trial; a woman in a nursing home whose mind is sharper than anyone realized -- but at the same time, things begin happening in the present. Someone is stalking him.The story is incredibly complex, but absolutely believeable. In part, that's because each character is believeable. Not just the major characters, but each person we encounter. Each of those witnesses Chris finds, for example, has a real personality -- each has motives, foibles, and a life history that we glimpse in passing.Each witness that Chris uncovers adds a new piece of information to the story, and, with each new bit of data, the story takes a new turn. In some cases, the new bit of information gives us a rude awakening -- things are not what we thought. In other cases, that new bit of data casts new light and expands our understanding. The entire effect is that we follow Chris along -- darting back and forth between present and past -- and peel layer and layer back off the story until we have it all.I've read a few other Goddard books -- Hand in Glove an! d Closed Circle -- and they were decent books. This one is so much better that it could have been a different author."},{"Title":"Beyond Recall","review":"A friend from Canada gave me 2 Goddard's for Xmas along with a clipping of an article by Stephen King listing Goddard's novels as his top \\"discovery\\" of 2008.

A question that nags Chris and demands an answer when Nicky commits suicide. A question that sets Chris on a long journey through three families' histories and the ramifications the truth brings.Robert Goddard has written a twisting haunting tale of lies and intrigue much in the style of Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden or Iain Pear's Stone's Fall.

I read the prior reviews and then bought the book anxious to find another great author. What I found was boredom and frustration, some red herrings, and a mystery not worth my time.

The cover said something to the effect that the book is a \\"celebration of life.\\" Although I totally agree with that assessment, I can't put my finger on the reason that it strikes me that way.

I absolutely fell in love with the story and with the voice of the reader, Lisette LeCat. I took the CDs into the house, listened to them every spare moment, and then rushed out to buy the next in the series, Tears of the Giraffe.The story and characters are wonderful. Ms. LeCat's supple and expressive voice makes them even more irresistable. By all means, read the books if that's what you prefer, but in this case, listening is better."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'll keep it brief, since there are plenty of other reviews here, but hands-down, one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. The prose is pure joy. The mysteries Precious Ramotswe uncovers in her detective work are wonderful looks inside African culture and the human psyche. The humor is life-affirming and lovely. Read this book first, then the whole series. You'll be glad you did!!!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Everyone loves these books, and no one can really narrow down why they are so utterly lovable.It would say it is in part due to the sheer simplicity of the writing, the divine descriptions of nature and the beauty of the image McCall Smith portrays of Botswana. The foriegn-ness of the themes and the exotic-ness of the main story relating to the witch doctor, as well as the colours and life of the covers.Additionally, the lovability of characters, particularly the main character, with her completely un-Western notion of the body beautiful, her enduring sensitivity regarding the death of her baby and her enchanting love of her father. The devotion of her fiance is also gorgeous.Perhaps the appeal of these works is the fact they suggest a fundamental life we essentially aspire for. Simplicity, kindness, nature, beauty. Such a different life than we of the Western world."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Okay, I was not wow'd by this book, but found it to be a decent, more subtle read. The main character is endearing, she doesn't flinch in any situation to stand up to whomever necessary and do what is morally right. I think that because of that, you inevitably root for her. It is also interesting that a man wrote this book from a woman's point of view and did do a pretty convincing job of it. However, I was not so moved by the book that it made me want to go out and read all of the more recent books by that author, some featuring the same main character. This was not a bad book that I regret reading, but it didn't really leave any lasting impressions or feelings with me either."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a tapestry overflowing with the richness and warmth of Africa. I have never been to that beautiful land in person, but through this book am transported there every time I open its pages. I start reading and am instantly awash with exotic African sunsets, rich wildlife, immersed at once in a culture of beauty, gentle humor and a quieter pace of life than I have ever known. Every time I close the book, with a smile on my face, it is a shock to find myself back in North America. Contrary to the popular saying, &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, I would have to say that this book is worth a thousand pictures."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Botswana lady sleuth Mma (pronounced \\"mee-muh\\" in my head, but represents your standard gender term for a female) Ramotswe solves local Botswana crimes: family problems, fraud, kidnappings and disappearances. What makes this book so readable (for me) is that the \\"crimes\\" are rather mundane compared to what we see on the 5 o'clock news. This is a welcome change when one has grown tired of all those mystery novels out there that start with a dead prostitute lying face down in a city gutter and the ubiquitous hard-boiled detective spouting hardened prose like, \\"In a city like this, you wake up everyday wishing you were dead\\". This book is also worth a read as the story is peppered with local images/cultural idiosyncrasies that one might not know about Africa and, more specifically, Botswana."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is reminiscent to me of Tony Hillerman's books, in that we are taken into the lives of a different type of people with their own way of dealing with a different kind of lifestyle that we are not familiar with, only instead of the four-corner area of the southwest, we are in Botswana, Africa. The story is not one of a thriller packed with action, but of a No.1 lady detective (the only one) who is approached by various customers to look into mundane to serious cases in her area. It is a relaxing, funny, sad and thought provoking book. It gives the reader a look at life in Botswana that is entertaing and informative and leaves you wanting to learn more. There aren't many fiction books on life in Africa that is available to the average citizen that is this enjoyable. You have a relaxed, good feeling when you finish the book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, The Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency, and couldn't wait to see what Precious Ramotswe was going to become involved in next! I loved her direct approach to solving the &quot;mysteries&quot;. She comes up with an idea, executes it, and solves the mystery with her innate sense of wisdom and common sense.My question to others who have read this book, or to people who may be familiar with Botswana has to do with the titles used in the book. Precious Ramotswe is referred to as Mma or Mme Mma, and later one of the male characters is referred to as Rra. Does anyone know what those titles stand for? The closest I can guess is Mme stands for Madame or Madamoiselle, but I can't figure out Mma, or Rra. Please offer help it you are able.Other than that, I recommend this book for light summer reading for those who enjoy mysteries or for those who don't. The situations that Mma Ramotswe finds herself in are light enough for even the most squeamish. Thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just can't say enough about the Number One Ladies' Detective Agency! In my own family my aunty, who had lived in Africa for several years, she first found this book and read it, and loved it. Then my mom read it and was crazy about it (and she's a retired librarian who reads a ton of novels). Next my sister, another librarian, read it and likewise was nuts about it too. My dad even read it, and he almost never reads any fiction at all....he was crazy about it also. My wife read it and is almost finished now with the next one from this exciting \\"new\\" author. I just finished it yesterday and knew I would have to review this book, would have to try and encourage others to read it.I think I'll read all of the books in the series, and I understand there are four of them.Botswana. I confess I didn't know much of anything about it before this book, but here Botswana comes alive, becomes completely real. The heroine of these books, the big, fat, smart, really wonderful character Precious Ramotswe, she is just too clever and fun. One little mystery after another unfolds here, each of them totally absorbing. I read the occasional mystery, but this one is easily my favorite.I'm a writer myself (Safe Sex in the Garden, Allergy-Free Gardening, etc.) and I so appreciate writing that is fresh, fun, inventive, imaginative, full of discovery and surprise, and this novel has it all. There were several parts in the book that made me cry too, not from sadness, but from pure joy. A simply marvelous book. If a book ever did completely deserve five stars, this is the one. Treat yourself to a copy and you won't be able to put it down. When you finish it, give it to someone who doesn't read much, and I expect that this one they'll not only finish, but they'll love it too. A rare find; a simply terrific book!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The lady detective of Botswana is utterly charming. She pursues her cases with logic and diligence. The local color in the story is delightful. It even seems that the political scene is correctly drawn when allusions are made to the rather step-child relationship Botswana has with South Africa. The cases for which clients seek solutions include an incident of witch craft, a matter of insurance fraud for an amputated finger, an instance of blurred identity in the medical profession where twins function as one physician, and a tale of a straying husband."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just finished this book, which I read in a day. It was unexpected, funny, and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend. For a movie version, I can see Whoppi Goldberg as the detective. It would be hilarious."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It ain't great literature, but nobody promised it was, and besides, it's a great beach read, and you learn quite a bit about Botswana in the bargain.Premise is that a woman sets up a one-lady detective agency, not only the #1 agency of its kind, but the ONLY agency of its kind. Written as a series of vignettes focusing on the cases that come along, the author explores and enlightens her readers at a leisurely pace, which is just perfect for sitting on the warm sand and glancing up every now and then to check on the children playing at water's edge.Written with wit and wisdom, this is a book to be read, savored, and then passed on to a friend."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith has done it again with &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The protagonist Precious is, well, precious. A wonderful character! The humor displayed in this book cannot be surpassed. I really love the locale and characters in this book. A fun read you will not want to put down. This one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a charming story, with funny bits, a pleasure to read. So good in fact, that I immediately bought the other volumes. I hope the author writes as many books about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as Agatha Christie wrote about her sleuths. Not only are these good stories about interesting people, the information about Botswana is intriguing and makes me curious. I'd like to learn more. Like another reviewer of this book, I have an additional recommendation to make. If you really like mysteries and good writing, be sure to read Robert Barnard's books. They are excellent."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm not a typical mystery novel fan- most of them seem to be about elaborate, overly complex and unrealistic murder cases, where the whole point of the novel is for us readers to find out 'who dun it?' Characterization, settings, and mood suffer as the author is almost entirely focused on setting up a complex web of events and 'clues' that aim to shock the reader at the end.So I was happy that THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was not your typical detective story. Mma Ramotswe does not spend the whole book figuring out a series of elaborate murders, rather, she spends her time searching for a missing husband in a river, tracking a rebellious teen-age daughter, returning a stolen Mercedes Benz, exposing con-artist doctors, and investigating a young boy kidnapped by witch-doctors.Unlike traditional detective fiction, where we know little about the detective's life apart from his or her work, we get extraordinary insight into Mma Ramotswe's life. We meet her as a child with a gift for drawing, then follow her tragic marriage to an abusive man and feel her grief at loosing her child. We watch as she fulfills her dear father's wishes in opening a business- although he didn't expect her to be the first lady detective in Botswana- maybe Africa! All these events have shaped Mma Ramotswe into a strong, feisty, proud but compassionate woman who loves Africa, drinks bush tea, drives a 'little white van' and wears size 22 clothing.The novel also highlights life in Africa. Hilarious passages highlight issues such as gender relations (African men 'carry on with ladies' and don't want to change 'babies nappies'), respect for elders (Mma Ramotswe is miffed by an 'upstart' 19 year old who treats her like a child) and the importance of a leading balanced life (Mma Ramotswe feels sorry for white people who are 'always dashing around' and never realize the valuable things in life such as watching your cattle eat grass). We also learn about the land of Botswana, including the desolate Kalahari plains with thorn bushes and cattle, dusty roads with deadly cobras, and rain-swollen rivers with man-eating crocodiles.Thus, while I agree with Bjorn Torrissen (review August 19, 2006) that the actual detective cases were rather simple- (I did figure out some of them before Mma Ramotswe did), there is so much more to this book than detective fiction. While the cases do not necessarily 'shock' due to their cleverness, they succeed brilliantly, along with details of Mma Ramotswe's life, in showing the spirit of a modern African woman and her beloved country of Botswana."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Having spent considerable time in Botswana (most of it living with host families), I find this series to be very endearing and an accurate (if slightly sterotypical) potrayal of life in Botswana.I just want to defend it a bit against accusations of \\"sexism\\" on the part of the protagionist. You really really have to realize that much of Africa, especially the southern bits, is very \\"macho\\" and man-centered and rather misogynistic. The protagionist is not saying bad things about ALL men (especially not American men) but of Batswana men, many of whom really can be \\"that bad\\".Sure, it could offend Western sensibilities but you must read in the spirit of cultural relativism and realize that other cultures aren't quite as liberal on the gender-role thing as we are here.Anyway, these books are truely wonderful and capture the spirit and heart of this great country perfectly."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I do not usually pick up novels that are placed in the mystery genre but the title of this book and the intriguing cover art drew me. I was not disappointed.Alexander McCall Smith is physically opposite of the black, lady detective he created for this series of books but she comes across as genuine. She has a subtle humour and generous spirit that I hope the author also holds.This is a well-written work and I do hope to continue the series. I doubt that fans of strict mystery novels will enjoy this because there is no overwhelming mystery. Anyone who enjoys a good character novel, however, will find this a delight.Very recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I can't praise this book enough. It is so gentle, so loving, and so reverent of its worthy heroine, that we cannot help but fall in love with her. As a student of Africa, I greatly appreciated McCall Smith's successful attempt to convey the dignity and humor of Tswana culture and of the profoundly sensible and human characters he created.But you definitely do not have to have any prior knowlege of Africa whatsoever to appreciate this easy, heartwarming and uplifting read. This is a great book if you're feeling down as it reminds you of the kindness of so many people and of all the important values in life. Definitely a classic. NOT a mystery but a work of literature that will make you smile all the way through. I don't know why it's sometimes classified as a mystery.I promise you you will not be disappointed by this book or by the sequels!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When reviewing an audio book, there are two things to consider. First is the story itself, and second is the quality of the reader.This book is engrossing in its detail of life in Africa. I normally avoid mysteries, but I wouldn't classify this book as a \\"mystery\\" per se in the \\"whodunnit\\" tradition. The characters, places, and situations are the real stars, with a view of Africa that is hard to find in the west, when most of what you hear about Africa is about poverty, corruption and AIDS. The author doesn't shy away from the first, and alludes to the second and third, particularly in comparing Botswana (the location of the novel) to its neighbors, who seem to fare far worse.To address the second point, normally, audiobooks bore me to tears. I far prefer to plow through on the printed page, but the narrator is SO good! According to the biography, she is from South Africa, and she draws on her knowledge of local accents to give each character a distinctive voice, without making the recording sound like a children's book or a Robin Williams interview. It is just enough to enhance the story rather than distract from it. In addition, knowing the correct pronunciations of all the names is very nice.I am neither a mystery fan nor an audiobook fan, but this recording captivated me. You won't want to turn it off, and when it ends, you will want to get the next one as soon as you can!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"There are so many &quot;original&quot; detectives, cats, quadriplegics, ancient Romans, ninteenth century psychiatrists, Elizabethan actors, medieval monks, midwestern chefs, park rangers etc that I was sceptical of finding anything really new. After so much bad news out of Africa, and recently reading Theroux's &quot;Dark Star Safari&quot; I was also doubtful of finding anything cheerful. My pessimism was unfounded. This is a delight. Precious Ramostwe uses the money from the sale of the cattle her father left her to start a detective agency in Botswana. She solves a series of crimes but these are secondary to the atmosphere and characterization. I don't know how authentic the picture of life in Botswana is but what is depicted rings completely true. The prose is deceptively simple and unobtrusive. Every sentence is prefectly crafted with never a wasted word."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a wonderful little book with engaging, memorable characters. Mma Ramotswe is a down to earth, unapologetically real woman doing what she wants to do instead of what people expect of her. Yes, this book is about a detective agency. Yes, there are concrete mysteries for her to solve, but I think the real beauty in this book lay in the larger mysteries, the mysteries we all face in life that Mma Ramotswe so eloquently voices. As Mma Ramotswe says:\\"How sorry she felt for white people...who were always dashing around and worrying themselves over things that were going to happen anyway. What was the use of having all that money if you could never sit still...? None, in her view; none at all, and yet they didn't know it. Every so often you meet a white person who understood, who realized how things really were; but these people were few and far between and the other white people often treated them with suspicion.\\"I think this sums it up pretty well!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm not sure why this book got such raving reviews, I certainly don't need to go on and read book 2 in the series. Perhaps it is because I listened to the audio version, but I found the tone of the writing condescending toward the culture the author is supposed to represent. Moreover, the main character is hardly compelling, and the unfolding events during the story perilously close to being simply boring."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book was a wonderful surprise. I had heard of neither it nor its author before, but once I started reading the book, I could not put it down. I was charmed by its heroine, the wise and traditionally built Precious Ramatswe. The gentle, humorous, and lively depiction of Mma Ramatswe's life, friends, and family in Botswana pulled me in. The book is generous and forgiving in its view of human nature and human relationships. It also conveys a love of the land of Africa, and pride in the nation of Botswana. This served to remind me that human beings consist not only of their feelings, thoughts, and relationships (which are so easy to get caught up in), but also their national identities and ties to their homelands. We are individuals, and also members of a society."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Our book group read this book because many of us had heard from other people that this series was really good. I have to say that I found this book a little boring. It's not really an ongoing plot but, instead, a series of short stories. The solutions to the \\"crimes\\" come about by the most unrealistic coincidences and situations. If solving cases were this easy there wouldn't be any criminals out on the streets. One gal in our book group bought the series based on recommendations and after reading the first book gave the rest of the set to one of the ladies who liked the book. I would say our book group consensus tallied at about 80% who didn't care for the book and 20% who did."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A truly delightful book and character. You will love to meet Mme Precious Ramotswe and hear her bits of daily wisdom as she experiences her ordinary yet extraordinary daily life. Do not come to this series expecting some great thiriller or mystery, they are more about the rich texture of lives of a different culture that you are thrilled by the pure simplicity and richness of it all. Think of eating a well made milk custard;..simple, yet rich."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe inhabits a very different world from our's, a continent so foreign, and yet, she brings a very familiar and comforting human touch to the barren plains that stretch out and nearly cover her native country of Botswana.Though Alexander McCall Smith's charming detective series is on the surface a series of mysteries, as the title would suggest, it is so much more than that. Mma Ramotswe is perhaps one of the most likeable characters to grace modern popular fiction, at least recently. Bold, confident, patient, and sensible, she brings her intelligence and perceptive human insight into every 'case' she tackles. The way she deals with her cases and makes judgments are fair and clever, and often times humorous, as her attempts to observe her subjects seem less than successful.As enjoyable and well-written as the book is, however, the mysteries are not full-fledged mysteries in themselves and they are by no means the most complicated, complex ever written. But here that was not the point. The cases serve as a kind of supplement for the story of Mma Ramotswe, and the country she loves so much, all written in Alexander McCall Smith's engaging and light narrative, which could be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"An enchanting book, a real pleasure to read, which totally deserves the plaudits heaped upon it. Apart from the remarkable protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, and her succession of interesting cases, I particularly appreciated:1. The beautiful setting: Central Southern Africa - running all the way down the eastern side of Botswana from Bulawayo to Mafikeng and on to Johannesburg in neighbouring South Africa. The book really makes this local topography come alive and gives an evocative picture of the whole area.2. The wonderful idiom of the speakers and the conversations. Alexander McCall Smith has caught the local flavour of character, motivation, and speech so well - it's a privilege and a learning experience to \\"listen in\\".3. The human suffering, which lends a three-dimensionality and depth to the characters. Precious Ramotswe herself sets up her agency after a troubled marriage and motherhood.A retrospective describes the suffering of Precious's father in the Jo'burg diamond mines. The bosses there, says author McCall Smith, speak Funagalo. \\"...there are many Zulu words in it, but it is not Zulu. It is a language which is good for telling people what to do. There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love, or happiness, or the sounds which birds make in the morning.\\" [This soulless communication has been extended to the concept of 'Office Funagalo' - check the Web.]4. Concept of freedom. Almost all of Precious's cases involve some kind of liberation.Beautifully nuanced, clever, humorous, moving - highly recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This entire series is an absolute joy to read. I noticed that at least one (young) reviewer complained about the lack of a central plot, but in my opinion this is one of the main strengths of the series - that the main characters and the day-to-day events of their lives are so absorbing. It's such a rarity to find good character-based literature, and this series is an absolute gem in that department."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This unique and lyrical book is about Mma Ramotswe's detective agency, which so happens to be \\"the number one ladies' detective agency\\". It's also the ONLY ladies' detective agency in Botswana, Africa, which is where the novel takes place. I loved the author's descriptions of Botswana: even though I've never been to Africa, I could picture everything he described perfectly. Normally I don't care for books in the \\"mystery\\" genre, but this book is just so much more. The main characters are heart warming, and I liked Mma Romotswe's attitude towards life in Africa--not always easy, but always beautiful. A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm an American woman who has spent 12 years living in Africa, and traveled to almost every part of the African continent. When I bought this book, somehow, from the name, I was expecting it to be about some Chinese people living in London! Nevertheless, it was a delightful surprise when I found it was about a lady detective in Botswana.I found it interesting that the author is a Professor of Medical law, living in Scotland, but having been born and raised in Zimbabwe. He has published many varied books on many subjects. I think these are his \\"fun\\" books! I also think that part of the reason he has written these books is to show non-Africans what traditional African society is like, especially how it is managing to move into the modern age. By setting it in Botswana, he neatly sidesteps many of the problems found in other parts of Africa, and is able to concentrate both on his story, and on showing us how traditional Africans THINK and act. I found this especially interesting, having lived in several African cultures, myself. I also find the series very uplifting and rewarding to read, in addition to being a good story. I think some of the critical reviews are from people who have never lived or traveled in Africa, and they just don't realize how true-to-life are so many of the episodes-I do not find these books at ALL condescending toward blacks. On the contrary, they are a celebration of the traditional GOOD values found in black African culture (a nice change from what we usually see in the news).There were several things I especially enjoyed about this book. I don't particularly enjoy first-person, male-oriented police detective novels. This is about a woman detective, who had no more qualifications than you or I, but who just hung out a sign, and used her common sense. She ordered a text book from London, from which she learned some investigative procedures. She's very clever. The book is not written as a first person, blow-by-blow account. On the contrary, it is written in third person, and is more about her LIFE, going through her becoming a detective, the cases she meets along the way (which we watch her solve), and what we learn about the society as we go along. I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning to travel to any southern African country. It is a light, humorous book, from which you can learn a lot while enjoying a great story. I found it difficult to put down. I have now read the first two books in the series, and plan to order every single one. I can hardly wait until they arrive in the mail!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;She approached one of the woman traders and spoke to her in Setswana.&quot;Are you well today, Mma?&quot; she said politely.&quot;I am well, and you are well, too, Mma?&quot;&quot;I am well, and I have slept very well.&quot;&quot;Good.&quot;&quot;Pretty much the same as &quot;How are you?&quot;, but so much more lyrical and slower in pace. This is the Africa I miss and the Africa the reader gets a taste of in this book.I too cannot wait to read the whole series. What a joy it was to read. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Romatswe is the lead character and detective in this delightful series, and she is a joy to spend time with. This is the first book in the series, in which Precious Romatswe sets up her detective agency in Botswana. I enjoyed reading about her life, and her cases, and felt I'd visited a sunny and pleasant place, while reading this mystery. If you enjoy Agatha Christie and other cozy-type mysteries, and you enjoy learning about unfamiliar cultures, try it out."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Set in rural Botswana, Alexander McCall Smith's novel adds a twist to the conventional detective mystery. The striking feature in Smith's story is not a captivating crime with clues that keep the reader guessing. Rather, the life of detective heroine Mma. Ramotswe governs the novel's focus. Readers will more often find themselves chuckling at Mma. Ramostwe's dry humor than piecing together a compelling mystery. Described as a heavy-set, middle-aged woman, Mma. Ramotswe relates to characters and readers at a basic, human level. For instance, after a frustrating day at work, the novel tells how she returns to the comfort of her home and routine pumpkin dinner, something that \\"brought you down to earth ... [and] gave you reason for going on\\" (81). Furthermore, Mma. Ramostwe often serves as a counselor to her clients. In several instances Smith likens her position to a priest or doctor and calls her a \\"fixer of lives.\\" Mma. Ramostwe discovers techniques in professional detective manuals prove less effective than her intuition and listening skills. Smith does an excellent job developing Mma. Ramotswe's character outside of her detective work sphere. The first several chapters are devoted to telling about Mma. Ramotswe's father and her family. To a reader eager to dive into hunting clues, this background detail can seem laborious and tedious; however, learning about her family history is essential in seeing Mma. Ramotswe as more than a one-dimensional Sherlock Holmes detective. Knowing about parts of Mma. Ramostwe's personal life, such as her deceased father and failed marriage, enables readers to understand the motives behind Mma. Ramostwe's detective agency and her attitude toward gender and domestic issues. Mma. Ramostwe never attempts to unearth a mass murderer or serial killer; instead, she works mainly on domestic cases involving cheating husbands and disobedient daughters. Readers may be frustrated that no common thread seems to tie Mma. Ramostwe's seemingly unrelated cases together. However, the lackluster and somewhat random nature of her cases enhances Mma. Ramostwe's character and parallels a realistic detective agency, in which investigators aren't constantly putting their life on the line to unearth a sensational crime. Mma. Ramostwe struggles with issues common to many independent agencies, such as making ends meet and cooperating with her secretary and various clients. Placing Mma. Ramostwe as the central feature of his novel allows Smith to reveal a humanistic side to detection that sensational murder mysteries and traditional Sherlock Holmes novels lack."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Rare among works of detective fiction are stories suffused with joy rather than fear and suspense, but Alexander McCall Smith's _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_ celebrates the role of detective rather than elaborating on its dangers. This is not to say that the novel does not deal with serious matters: Precious Ramotswe, the No. 1 Lady Detective of Botswana, faces insurance fraud, medical malpractice, abduction, and even the potential killing of children for magical potions, but she performs her feats of detection primarily out of love for the people of Botswana. She is a \\"fixer of lives,\\" an exceptional figure in a genre of characters concerned with bringing criminals to justice out of a desire for vengeance. Precious Ramotswe's position as a pioneering female detective contributes to the novel's unique tone. Many of her cases revolve around the domestic - missing husbands, impersonators of family members, lost children - but Precious Ramotswe works within the traditionally female realm to subvert and surpass it. She beats the often pompous and self-satisfied men in the novel at their own game, accomplishing her goals with wit and sensitivity and emerging from early life struggles with good-natured wisdom. This touch of the personal infuses Smith's novel with a uniquely human sympathy, appropriate for the story of Precious Ramotswe's maturation, and for Botswana, historically exempted from the severest political turmoil of its fellow African nations.Smith's light, spare style adds to the charm of _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_; the narration glides from anecdote to anecdote with the grace of beads sliding down a string. If the novel suffers from anything, it would be that the individual detection stories seem too loosely strung together and that the secondary characters sometimes lack development. But Smith is less concerned with the process of uncovering a single mystery than with the growth of the central detective: each story uncovers another of Precious Ramotswe's talents. A novel of hope and healing, _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_ reinvents detective fiction for a distinctively African, distinctively female world, weaving a tale of cleverness and warmth as it rejoices in the vibrancy of African life."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It seems as though every time I finish a book, I take the book and cradle it to my chest, and close my eyes and reflect upon all that I have read, and if it is a good one, and in some way has changed the way I feel about life, I will have a smile on my face, and a sense of accomplishment. This is how I felt when I finished this book :o) It was open, honest and educational, and left me with a sense of calmness.....and a bit closer in touch with spirituality. It was very easy to read and to follow along with. Also a nice glimpse into a part of Africa :o)I liked the way the author Mr. Alexander McCall Smith developed his main character Mma (Mrs) Ramotswe. In some incidences along the way, he had her &quot;get caught&quot; which to me, made her seem more human, and not some character that is always perfect. Also there was a nice little twist when she encountered the young and clever Nandira.The book also gave me a deep craving for some &quot;Red Bush Tea&quot; ~I would give this book a five star rating, and I will read more of Mr. Smith's books in the near future. Also I would love to meet Mr. Smith in person if he ever comes close to any of the bookstores in my area~ I was also surprised that he knew so much about how the female mind works :o)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The first thing that you might notice about this book (indeed, the whole series is the language. The no. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is written in this precise, methodical, but wonderfully melodic and wholly satisfying tone, that immediately reminded me of so many real people in former British colonies dedicated to using and mastering Queen's English. It only adds to the character of the novel as a whole. By the end of the first chapter I was even thinking in shorter, more precise sentences.The second wonderful aspect of this novel is its heroine, Mma. Precious Ramotswe. She has somehow managed in Gabarone, Botswana to cultivate the common sense of Miss Marple, the good manners of Hercule Poirot and the savvy and discretion of Hetty Wainthrop.Then there are the sort of cases that come her way and the people she encounters, but to get into detail might ruin it for someone else. My advice is to buy or borrow the bookand settle down with a nice hot cup of bush tea (this really heightened the experience for me - it's known as Rooibos or Ruibos in North America!)."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I loved this book. The names of people and businesses brought a smile to my heart. Having lived in East Africa for a few years, I felt a real bond wth Mma Ramotswe. She remeinded me som much of the dignity of the African women I had met. You will enjoy this book if you have any sense of whimsey."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is deceptively light and delightful -- a splendid, fun change in a genre which is known -- mostly -- for its noir-appeal. The only thing I can add to the praise for this series is that in my opinion the cover art on the English version is overwhelmingly more attractive and well-suited to the books. Thank goodness few readers are judging this one by its (American) cover!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was a delightful, refreshing read. After reading some heavier books, this book was perfect. You can't help but fall for Mma Ramotswe and her antics. The author's descriptions of the African country made me feel the heat and smell the dust. Not every book has to be written for or by a literary genius - this is fun!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book to my 93 year old father. Pretty soon he was telling me he wasn't quite sleepy and hinting for another chapter. The connection that Mma Ramotswe had with her father while he was alive and even after his death was beautiful and I am sure was even more meaningful to a very old, loving father who may now think that his love will go on after he is gone. I will start the next book on my next visit and he can't wait. Good luck on pronouncing the names!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have no idea why I picked up McCall Smith's first book, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I never would have imagined reading a book about a lady detective named Mma Precious Ramotswe who hailed from Botswana.After all, what serious author would name his heroine \\"Precious\\"! Why it sounds like the book would reek of drippy/mushy/romancy stuff with a murder tossed in just so it could be labeled a mystery.Wrong! I was so very wrong, for McCall Smith wove magic and I found Mma Precious Ramotswe to be the perfect name for a woman so courageous and determined she is able to shoot a crocodile and slice its belly open looking for parts of a missing child. I relished the fact that here was a heroine who knew when to detect and when to sit and enjoy a rich bowl of cooked pumpkin. Although Mma Ramotswe is overweight she is more than capable of tackling pesky snakes or crooks and still seeing herself as sexy. Mma Ramotswe may be middle-aged but she still understands the yearnings of rebellious teen-agers under strict parental rule. However there is another element to Precious that can't be ignored or easily forgotten, she is a woman of wisdom who sees things clearly, simply. And thus, just as I had in my university days, I found myself looking for a high-lighter to mark thoughts/lines/passages - for these books are not merely fiction - they are literature in its truest essence.Suffice to say, I have since zoomed over to the bookstore and promptly ordered McCall Smith's third and fourth books: Morality for Beautiful Girls and The Kalahari Typing School for Men."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Extrordinary book. Living in the present as an art form. Precious is an experience one can only hope to meet in the real world. All 4 books bring you into an extraordinary world. Very well done Mr. Smith!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"THE LADIES' NO. 1 DETECTIVE AGENCY is the first novel by Alexander McCall Smith, a medical law professor at Edinburgh University. A wonderful book with smart characterizations and enough mystery to keep you going; the scenery is breathtaking, if somewhat severe: we are at the edge of the Kalahari. There are many interesting details about life in Africa, specifically Botswana, and many intriguing insights into mores and manners. I really enjoyed this book! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book in one day. In scarcely populated land-locked Botswana, Mma Ramotswe inherits 180 head of cattle from her frugal father. From age 18 to age 30 Obed Ramotswe worked in an Oppenheimer mine in Johannesburg and saved almost everything he earned buying cattle. But in the mines his lungs filled with dust, eventually causing his death of emphysema at age 64. From the proceeds of the sale of her father's cattle, Precious Ramotswe buys a house and an office, hires as her Secretary Mma Makutsi, a widow who \\"passed the general typing and secretarial examinations with an average grade of ninety-senven per cent\\" and opens \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\" From her eyes as a detective, we have a fascinating view of life in Botswana: a crocodile devouring a man being baptized, a witchdoctor kidnapping an eleven year old boy, an Indian merchant prince spying on his teenage daughter, an imposter Daddy living off of his successful \\"daughter,\\" twin doctors one of whom has a degree and the other not, a man who keeps filing claims against different employers for the loss of the same finger; and cars that always break down but are kept running by Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni The main resources of this country are cattle and diamonds and 70% of its land is the lion inhabited Kalahari Desert. The people maintain the formalism of an English colony. It is a simple country, yet a country filled with morality and all the human emotions, joy and dispair, that can be found anywhere. This is a book that should be read before the other books in the series as it sets the stage for the characters that will be developed later."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it. The writing is simple, and effortlessly creates well-developed characters by exploring their inner thoughts as events (even the run-of-the-mill) develop. The story is indeed \\"heart-warming\\" and reassuring without at all being corny. The moral lessons are beautiful-- comforting like a childrens' book-- but for adults.The only trouble is that the second book in the series (Tears of the Giraffe) is even better than the first. I hope that anyone who isn't completely impressed with this first installment goes on to read the next."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"With beautiful writing and great settings, this wonderful Alex McCall Smith book will surely become one of your favorites. Taut, psychologically suspenseful, and brilliantly constructed like McCrae's &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; or some of Hemingway's works (though those are of an entirely different subject matter),this tour-de-force will have you wanting to tackle the other books in the series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Really fun, light read. Will definitely pick up the sequels. Nice twist on your average mystery with endearing characters. Enjoyed reading about the country and its people, as well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I loved this book. I was very fond of the lead character.This novel was easy to read and was a real page turner.I highlyrecommend it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a character I wish I knew in real life. Warm, wise, witty -- have just ordered the three sequels because I just can't get enough of Mma.Ramotswe, the main character of this series. I also appreciated the African experience; it whets my appetite for more. If you need a lift, read this novel. You'll come away richer for the experience."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a beautiful little book. Its presentation is lovely and almost childlike at times. There are genuine mysteries to be solved here, but even though the individual stories are short, this is not &quot;mystery light.&quot; The author creates some really memorable characters and presents an interesting sense of place (with Africa's Kalahari as the background), but more like a soft, fuzzy dream than a detailed picture. This is a place where witch doctors rule, where cobras nonchalantly climb into cars. The author uses simple language full of wisdom. One chapter is titled &quot;Mma Ramotswe Thinks About the Land While Driving Her Tiny White Van to Francistown&quot; -- and that's exactly what it's about! Here's more: &quot;They taught us ... a language which is good for telling people what to do. There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love, or happiness, or the sounds which birds make in the morning.&quot; and &quot;So for many years, nothing at all happened. It was a good system of government, because most people want nothing to happen. That is the problem with governments these days. They want to do things all the time; they are always very busy thinking of what things they can do next. That is not what people want. People want to be left alone to look after their cattle.&quot; READ THIS BOOK! It's full of joy. I'm going to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I can only describe this book as darling. Precious Ramotswe, \\"a good fat woman\\" is a wonderful character. She's smart, brave, resourceful and likes herself just as she is. The story of her daddy and the unnamed cousin who raised her is extremely touching as is the section on her genteele, cautious romance with the owner of the local garage. Mma Ramotswe tackles mysteries short, complex, funny and frightening. She deals with deadly witch doctors, crocodiles, con men and womanizers all with the same cool head.I just loved her and this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe has just inherited money from her father. Instead of buying a traditional business like he wanted, she decides to start her own, the only detective agency in Botswana owned by a woman. Her clients are slow in coming, but soon she is developing a business finding lost husbands, tracking the secret lives of daughters, and looking for a kidnapped boy.This book is really a literary novel not a mystery novel, which is what I expected when I started to read it. Most of the cases are solved in one chapter. We get several chapters of the main character's back story before the agency is even opened. When I was reading it as a literary book, I could get into it. If I tried thinking of it as a mystery, I was disappointed.Precious Ramotswe herself is a bit unbelievable. She was just starting out, yet did a perfect job on every case. Where were her flaws?Finally, it really seemed like a feminist book. Almost all the men in the book were the scum of the earth. While I will admit that some men are, I'd like to think I can name some that aren't (starting with me.) I have no problem with gutsy, independent women, but the overall tone just seemed to be anti-man. Ironic, since the book was written by a man.Judging by the success of these books, I'm in the minority in my opinion. It was an ok read, but certainly not something I'm crazy about and wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want to read the other books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Smith creates a charming, considerate, overweight, wise, and, most of all an utterly convincing character lady detective Precious Ramotswe. Unlike usual detectives, Mma Ramotswe makes mistakes in life, and she does not hesitate to acknowledge them. She is proud of her homeland, Botswana, her heritage, her father, and even of her chubbiness, as being fat is the how good Botswanian women should be. She is undeterred by westernization -- she seeks to live her life by the traditional African way. Events take place in the vicinity of her city, and across the Kalahari Desert. The volume as a whole is of parallel structure, Mma Ramotswe solving one case after another. The cases she gets appointed to ranges from searches of missing people, finding out whether the appointer's husband is cheating, and tracking down a witch doctor responsible for killing a young boy for use in medicine. Upon resolution of each case, Mma Ramotswe seeks a middle ground -- it is not legal justice she is after; she seeks a humane conclusion, often times striving to protect the criminal in the aftermath, not to mention the victims.The creation of the character Mma Ramotswe is the centerpiece of this novel. She is someone almost everyone would like to have as one's neighbor. Thus if you are looking for a warm, and, as the cover of the book displays, a life-affirming novel, this book could be for you. However if you are seeking a mystery with an evolving plot, it is likely that you'll be disappointed. I personally am yet to decide whether to pick up the next volume of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm wondering what I am not seeing in this book. It came highly recommended by a friend and I picked it up recently to read on a plane. The main character is a likeable sleuth, though her opinions about men consist mostly of stereotypes so blatantly sexist that I couldn't help thinking more than once, \\"A book whose main character spoke so disparagingly of women would never get published, and certainly wouldn't get the favorable press that this book has received.\\"The best part of the book is Africa, which is there, but not vividly enough to make up for other things that are missing, like a plot. The book is vignettes about Mma Ramotswe's cases. The back cover leads you to believe that \\"the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.\\" It would be a good book if that statement about a heart tugged at, danger, and a case that exists at the center of the book were true. The missing boy case takes up a total of about 10 pages of the book, 15 at the most. I kept waiting for the vignettes to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book. I was disappointed in the writing, the stereotypical view of males, and the lack of a mystery in the story that engaged me for more than a few pages.Was it better than the in-flight magazine on Northwest? Definitely. Would I recommend it? Not if you want a good mystery, unless your options for reading material are limited. For a literary introduction to Africa, read The Poinsonwood Bible. For fluffy and unbloody yet charming mysteries with coherent plots, read Dorothy Gillman's Mrs. Pollifax books."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this in my book club; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. The book never gets too involved in any one story. There are many cases Precious solves, too many. I was interested in the case of the missing boy and kept waiting for that to be developed. It wound up being anti-climactic. As I read it, I thought, this is it? I did enjoy Precious life story, and how she got to own her own agency. Some of the writing is very beautiful. Other members of my book club, said the other books are much better. Sadly, I'm not interested enough to find out. As for women detectives, I LOVED Maisie Dobbs by J. Winspear"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is about an African women deciding to open a detective agency because she thought she could help people. The characters are engaging, but the \\"mysteries\\" she solves are not so engaging.I really enjoyed reading about Botswana and everyday life. I thought that was the best part of the book. The characters, especially Precious, are entertaining, but I felt the author could have made them more complex. The book is fairly humorous, but not laugh out loud funny. More dialogue probably would have been a pleasant addition.I can't recommend this book if you are looking for a mystery. I would hesitantly recommend this book if you're interested in learning more about everyday life in Botswana. I found the book to0 simple."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Okay, I have read and enjoyed the first three, listed here plus Tears of the Giraffe and whatever the third was called. My daughter has it right now. A gentle series about a really not understood part of the world. It's also a sort of rally for fat people, or as it is put in the series, traditional size ladies. Botswana sounds like a little piece of heaven in the disaster that is sub-Saharan Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Having read so many glowing reviews, I picked this book up and promptly signed my name in it. When I was done - I wished I hadn't written in it, so that I could return it!!! I found this book slow moving, trite and uninspiring. Maybe if I had more knowledge of Africa and the every day slang used there, I would have become more involved in the stories. I'd say if you want a book to read that's &quot;just a book to read&quot;, and not something you become immersed in, then this book would be ok."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Some books get to the No.1 slot on Amazon - this is one that OUGHT to get there - if enough of you buy 10 copies each to give to all your friends and family this Christmas, it is in with a chance - No.91 on the list is simply far too low. Mma Ramotswe and the other many equally delightful people of Botswana that McCall Smith has created in this simply idyllic series (even Laura Bush loves the series I gather), is the perfect enjoyable, innocent, heroic, gentle and always hilariously funny reading that everyone needs in these deeply troubled times. This is THE perfect Christmas present for just about everyone in the family - my wife and I are ladelling out copies like sweets this year - and each one will give a lifetime of fun. Not only that but success and fame could not have happened to a nicer person than McCall Smith himself - he is simply one of the nicest, kindest and most consistently hysterically funny authors you will ever meet, and booksellers world wide are now eagerly awaiting his next novels in the Botswana series, to pack out their stores and to have an author evening like no other. This is magical stuff, folks - make us all happy, buy 10 copies each to introduce them to friends and family, buy 10 boxes of the boxed set each for those who will enjoy all of them and get this most deserving of authors to Amazon No.1 by Christmas.

Detective Agency, the number one installment in Alexander McCall Smith?s Precious Ramotswe series (okay, I know that I just said a lot but it is better to be done with all that at once rather than having to subject the reader to an attempt at constructing an urbane and cohesive first several sentences that incorporate all of the aforementioned information), introduces the reader to the lady detective and her number one lady agency at its inception.McCall Smith?s lucid, fluid prose adds remarkable depth and ease of reading to this already fine story. Ramotswe?s Botswana is a land of tradition dealing with ineveitable arrival of modernization. Unlike some more hardened detectives, however, Ramotswe does not seek to raze one opposite in favor of the other but to preserve the better qualities of each in the midst of a world that continually brings the two into conflict. The seemingly arbitrary progression of the novel can be a bit annoying at times but the individual episodes stand to reinforce each other. This reader gives this first Ramotswe mystery a fine score of seven and two-thirds thumbs up (out of a possible ten)."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It ain't great literature, but nobody promised it was, and besides, it's a great beach read, and you learn quite a bit about Botswana in the bargain.Premise is that a woman sets up a one-lady detective agency, not only the #1 agency of its kind, but the ONLY agency of its kind. Written as a series of vignettes focusing on the cases that come along, the author explores and enlightens her readers at a leisurely pace, which is just perfect for sitting on the warm sand and glancing up every now and then to check on the children playing at water's edge.Written with wit and wisdom, this is a book to be read, enjoyed briefly, and then passed on to a friend."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I do not understand why this book is so popular.

There are no lady detectives in Botswana (her phraseology, not mine), and she decides that she will be the first.What follows is a marvelous exploration of the modern African world with a dash of mystery thrown in. Mma Ramotswe (how DO you pronounce \\"Mma\\", by the way?) is a size-22 bundle of joy with a very practical and pragmatic view of the world. She has no illusions about her fellow countrymen but at the same time has an extremely positive outlook on life - an outlook she uses to her advantage to help solve several mysteries, from the amusing to the serious.This is the first book in what promises to be a wonderful series and I will definitely buy the rest of Alexander McCall Smith's books."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe decides to set up a detective agency when her father dies and leaves her some money.

Refreshing mystery tales, almost like short stories in themselves. I took an instant liking to the character of Mma Ramotswe, self-made, determined woman who opens up a ladies detective agency which was unheard of in that town. With her intuition and thinking abilities, she solves one case after another with ease. The book takes you in from the very start with a case to solve. Though I did not like the change from the case to learning about the life of Precious's father and her childhood, I realized that it is important for the building up of a character and took it in my stride. Later, this proved to be beneficial. I have always enjoyed mysteries, especially those where I get to think with the detective and give my mind a jog to solve it. I ended up doing that a lot with this book.*Spoiler*I loved the character of the little Indian girl who ends up conning Ramotswe. And was I glad to hear her nod to marriage in the end. I loved her so much to wish for her to have a companion and a worthy match at that.*End of Spoiler*I loved to solve mysteries and be a detective since childhood, whenever something disappeared from our home, I would be the one to find it. The only case where it wasn't found was when I was the one who had hidden it in the first place.A lovely, short book that finished even before you realize it since you are so engrossed solving the mysteries.I also picked up some great quotes from the book-\\"It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on.

She hires a skilled secretary and waits. Soon, a small but steady stream of customers comes calling. Mma Ramotswe's sleuthing skills are as unconventional as they are effective, which is why, by the end of the book, business is near booming. The Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency, with its wide-ranging, always engaging characters, is the first installment in a really good, easy reading, detective series set in Africa. Readers are likely to find Mms Ramotswe, with her kind, overachieving, commonsensical ways and adoration for Africa, endearing and her character traits (relationship with Note aside) admirable. The next two books in the series (which is as far as I've read) are just as entertaining. Also good: Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller, Graceland by Chris Abani, and Fever! By John Grant Fuller."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read the first four books in this series when I was recovering from an accident. I got hooked on them.

Botswana Africa is seen through the eyes of the major character, Precious Romatswe, the lady detective. We get to know the people of Botswana, it's capitol, and her contemporaries. It is a detective story but no murders or violence. Mma Romatswe's cases usually involve finding out things that her clients want to know; finding lost children, philandering husbands,relatives, or the like. She is charming, sensitive, and clever. But the book is really not about detective cases but about how the people of Botswana, from the cities to the villages, feel, believe, and act. The characters are finely drawn and McCall Smith's writing crisp and often charming and very often quite hilarious. His descriptions of Botswana are vivid, detailed, and one feels like one has lived there. This is the first of 9 novels about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, all of which I have purchased and five of which I have read, and each of which, in my opinion, increase in enjoyment."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I was expecting an exciting mystery so I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The main character is an African lady thay has had some hardship in her life but she remains upbeat. She loves her Africa and in that vein, she introduces us to her Africa. That I did enjoy.

This was a case of picking up a popular book on a whim since I had heard how good it was, and finding to my delight that it lives up to its expectations.Precious Ramotswe, the lady manager of the titular detective agency, can easily stand alongside Agatha Christie's Miss Marple as a folksy but savvy sleuth. The cases she covers seem simple and even ordinary -- an over-protective father worried for his daughter, who only wants to be cut some slack; a con man trying to defraud his latest employers over an over-exaggerated work-related injury; a doctor suspecting a hospital worker's competence -- but she approaches them with a keen eye and a clever, even quietly sassy way to coax the people involved into divulging the truth, almost tricking people into making a step that uncovers what they try to hide. The \\"voice\\" of this book has a simple, artlessly child-like quality to it, like the tone of a story-teller. The setting, Botswana on the edge of both the South African border and also the Kalahari desert, is as much a player in the stories as the human characters, and through Precious's keen eyes, you get a feel for the soul of the land itself. I feel like I learned as much about the country as I learned about how people live there and how deep they feel for it and for each other."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"When Precious Ramotswe hops in her tiny white van in search of clues to a mystery, she is not looking for bloody prints or a dead body. She is in search of truth... even if she has to lie to get it!Life in Botswana, South Africa is much different from life anywhere in America. Even though many of the characters seemingly live carefree lifestyles, there is much we can learn from the morality, wisdom, and humor that lace their mysteries. While the stories dealing with infidelity and lack of integrity are all too often familiar to us, Ramotswe usually offers a firm and peaceable resolution at a fair price.Though most of the characters are unrelated; the stories are unconnected, and some mysteries remain unresolved, THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY is an enjoyable, light-hearted read. The novel gives readers a comical look at some of life's serious issues and offers a ray of hope when it seems so far out of reach. Though he is an unofficial detective himself, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni proves to be a ray of hope and helps Precious Ramotswe find her way to true love."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Nice slow pace. Very relaxing and entertaining.

Loved them all!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first book of the widely acclaimed series featuring Botswana's Precious Ramotswe and her tiny detective service. Although it is not technically an historical mystery, to us it seems timeless and has value in its presentation of a slow paced, dignified side of African life that is often overlooked. Precious' rare combination of refinement and ingenuity more than once helps her solve problems both big and small. Her understanding of certain situations as a female of a certain age holds her in good stead as well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I listened to the amazing audio version from Recorded Books. The narrator, Lisette Lecat, was so delightful. Authentic. I cannot say enough about this book. It took me where I wanted to go. I was with the most charming characters. I fell in love with the place, the people, and definitely Mma Ramotswe. By the end, I was gabbing my heart and saying \\"how wonderful!\\" as tears came down my face. Please read this book!

Can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a really fun and light read, a perfect vacation read or when you're in the mood for something light but meatier than chicklit. It's very exciting with an event occurring in each chapter. The characters are very likeable, especially the protagonist.I liked the effective description of the setting and mood of Botswana through out the book since I haven't been to Africa and it was as of I was being transported there. I also like the nuggets of introspection by the protagonist, much food for thought.Smith's ability to write in the voice of the female protagonist is impressive, incredibly convincing."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe finds herself in need of a way to support herself after her marriage fails.

This was a fun story as in from-your-childhood. It also gives you just a little glimpse (I wish it was more) of African culture apart from refugee camps we see on television, something I'm completely ignorant about. The character development is fairly well done too. However, if you are looking for a serious mystery book you'll be very disappointed. There is not much depth, no intrigue, no mystery, no mental challenge. This is almost a pre-teen book. It is very simply written, as if Africans have a limited vocabulary. Maybe most do, I have no idea. But I almost think it is insulting. I thought if the setting were \\"Kansas\\" instead of \\"Botswana\\" this book's style would be laughable. Are we in love with the idea of a simpler world and culture perhaps? Is this an accurate portrayal of Africans? I'll continue to struggle with that question but in the meantime I've downloaded the next e-book in the series. I like this simple kind of story-telling. I have enough mental challenges elsewhere. But I'm also going to check out The Poinsonwood Bible since others recommended it for a more serious look at Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Take one heaping cup of African history, culture & lifestyle, add in a half a cup of basic wisdom, philosophy & elementary dialog , then mix it up with a scant eight cup of a little bit of mystery, and you have this novel. I finished it because it was interesting & fairly entertaining., but in no way was it a mystery. Doubt if i'll buy any more of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, first published in 1998, is the first in Alexander McCall Smith's acclaimed Botswana series. Precious Ramotswe is the lady detective behind the book's title. She opened her agency with money inherited from her father, Obed Ramotswe. In this first installment we learn about Obed's life--he worked for years in South Africa's mines, saved his money, and later invested in cattle--and also about Mma Ramotswe's early history. (\\"Mma,\\"pronounced \\"mah,\\" is a term of respect that appears throughout the book.) She grew up in Mochudi, raised by her father and a cousin. Against her father's wishes she leapt into an unhappy marriage that left her alone and grieving her only child's death in infancy. It's an unhappy chapter in Mma Ramotswe's life, but it packs meat onto her character: she is not all homespun goodness, that is, but was capable in her youth of great folly, and what wisdom she has was hard won. The book offers an account of Mma Ramotswe's earliest cases, which she solves with legwork and good sense and the occasional help of her friends, in particular Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni, the proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Mma Ramotswe is not the sort of detective one calls upon to solve grand crimes, but neither are all of her cases trivial. In addition to dealing with a client's wayward daughter, for example, and a doctor's worry about his colleague's competency, she is concerned throughout this book with the case of a missing eleven-year-old boy. The story of his disappearance and of her involvement in the case is woven throughout the book.McCall Smith's series is not plot-driven. Mma Ramotswe's cases give the books their framework, but the focus is on Mma Ramotswe's character and on the country of Botswana itself: the setting of McCall Smith's books is at least as important to the stories as his protagonist. But although one doesn't think of the books primarily as mysteries, they are in fact good cozies, so the books can be enjoyed on that score as well.If you haven't yet stumbled on McCall Smith's series, you have yet to experience the singular joy of slipping into Mma Ramotswe's world. There is something soothing about the experience, and I'm not sure how the author achieves this magic: the simplicity of his language, perhaps, or of his characters' ethos. At any rate, the books are a pleasure to be savored.-- Debra Hamel"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The problems Botswana's Lady Detective, Mma Ramotswe solves aren't solved in a masterful way, ala Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Yet there is a sweetness to this story that pervades. The relationships amongst the people are deep, and dear.Would that the protagonist had more complex problems to solve. Or that the one difficult problem wasn't abetted in a contrived situation. How interesting is it to read about someone being followed and a problem being solved just like that!Nevertheless, the patois seems authentic. There is a lyrical quality to the dialog that is enchanting. It's also a relief to read about any African country without hearing stories of bloodshed and depravity.I'm going to read some more books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This isn't your typical woman detective novel. You won't find the complexities of Nevada Barr or Sue Grafton. Instead, you get a charming, overweight, lovable woman in Africa who solves common, every day cases. From the case of a woman who thinks her husband is messing around to the case of a missing child, Mma Ramotswa gets the jobs done."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is an unpretentious book, in size and scope, but its entertainment value is immense. There are no car chases or shoot-outs; no great earth-shattering truths are revealed. The heroine, Smith's &quot;Number One Lady Detective,&quot; is in fact Batswana's ONLY lady detective. But she and those she deals with in her brand-new profession--her friends, clients and victims--were enough to keep me turning the pages. Precious Ramotswe is a delight. She is plump, shrewd and opinionated, as at home in her village and her country as Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee is on his reservation. She solves her little mysteries with a logic, dogged resourcefulness and sense of humor that are quietly brilliant. Smith's prose is well-crafted, spare and subtle; he doesn't beat a reader over the head with Africa and its history, but lets us witness both the uniqueness and the universality of Precious' small-town, open-country world through her very human eyes. I'm hooked; I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.Susan O'Neill, Author: Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Nam"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read. The language weaves a spell around you and the images described are breathtaking. I have to admit this isn't my usual type of book. The hype got to me so I broke down and got it. Boy, am I glad I did!It is such a treat to be swept away into a foreign land and given an insight into the culture and daily lives of its people. This is a simply written book but it compliments the land, people, and story so well you don't mind.\`The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency' begins with Precious Ramotswe and a modest moment. It is an afternoon where Mma Ramotswe introduces us to herself and Botswana. She is enjoying her time at her \\"only female detective agency\\" in Botswana. The novel travels from the present to the past in such a fluid way; it makes you believe that stories could only be told in this way.Alexander McCall Smith creates a strong female character that is down-to-earth, while being intellectually and morally evolved. Precious carries her client's problems as her own. They instinctively become yours as you feel a part of her life. She shares with us the beauty and tragedy of her beloved Botswana. This country is lucky to have someone who loves it so much. As we are introduced to the people in her life, don't be surprised if you end up feeling sorry of those don't take her advice. Her logic defies comprehension and you find yourself agreeing with it without question.It is a treat to find a character that you wouldn't mind being like. Mma Ramotswe is worthy of imitation. For a story that will tug at your heart and having you cheer Prescious' clever ways, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This splendid little book tells us how Precious Ramotswe, who has inherited some money from her father, uses it to set up a detective agency, armed with a manuel on how to be a detective and a secretary she does not need but thinks it important to be seen to have. It is quite episodic, midway between a set of short stories - detailing Precious various cases, checking the credentials of a suspect long lost father, investigating a suspect claim for an industrial injury, determining the fate of a missing husband, tailing an overprotective father's teenage daughter, figuring out why a doctor at the local hospital is sometimes so good and sometimes so bad - and a novel, united by the characters of Precious, her relationship with Mr J. L. B. Maketoni (a very close friend but we are never told a what his first name is) and an investigation over a missing boy which runs through most of the book.The book differs from a conventional detective story in many ways. For one thing there is no murder and most of the cases Precious investigates are fairly minor undramatic affairs, only rarely involving any serious crime at all - exactly the sort of cases such a person who most likely spend most of her time on in real life. For another it is set in Botswana, not a country the genre has made much of hitherto. And it is a joy to read, most particularly for the characters of Precious - terrified of snakes, utterly unfazed by lawyers and gangsters - and Mr J. L. B. Maketoni, the bachelor mechanic who is smitten with her. It must be nice for the author that his books come up first under \\"most popular results [of 32000!] for Smith\\" but it's a success this book very honourably earns."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Hurrah! This witty, moving, funny, brilliantly well-written, superbly characterised novel is back in the top 100 again. (It ought to be no.1). The author , who must be one of the nicest people ever to grace a bestseller list, also paints a much more accurate, hopeful picture of Africa than we often see on the news - Botswana is one of the real success stories of post-independence Africa. Read it, buy it for all your friends and then buy a whole load more for Thanksgiving and Christmas presents - and make sure you do it not just for this one but the whole brilliant series as well. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"At first glance, the writing in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency seemed simple. But after a few pages, I realized that the simplicity of narrative was deceptive. I believe it was the author's intention to give us his story as a proficient speaker of English, native to Botswana (where the story takes place) might tell it. The net result is beguiling and evocative of the culture. I was left feeling that I'd spent some time in Botswana, that I'd learned something of the people and place.Precious Ramotswe, the author's protagonist, is a woman no longer young, but hardly old, one of substantial girth, highly intelligent, worldly wise and not afraid of much. Having inherited a sum of money from her father, Mma Ramotswe decided to do something unexpected of a woman in Botswana and open a detective agency.This first series entry is really a series of interlaced short stories that tells us a great deal of the people, the place and Mma Ramotswe's background. In the course of the novel, she solves a number of mysteries and we see her intelligence and integrity at work. It doesn't take long for a reader to love this woman who has known pain and suffering and has become compassionate and committed in the process.By the end of the novel, I was thoroughly appreciative of this author's prose and I regard him as a master storyteller. Each sentence made me want to read the next one, and before I knew it, I'd reached the end of the book. Today I'm buying the rest of the series and I sincerely hope the author will give us more. Alexander McCall Smith pays tribute to Agatha Christie in this novel and were Ms. Christie still alive, I'm sure she would highly approve of Mr. Smith!(By the way, \\"Mma\\" and \\"Rra\\" are titles of courtesy and respect in Botswana, equivalent respectively to \\"Ma'am\\" and \\"Sir\\" when used alone or \\"Ms.\\" and \\"Mr.\\" when used before a surname.)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Every so often, something comes along that is all new, that makes you fall in love with reading all over again. This is one of those books. With a literary grace filled with wit, wonderful characters and intelligence, Alexander McCall Smith introduces how Mma Precious Ramotswe, an independent contemporary woman of Botswana, came to set up her own business, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, and the cases that came her way.The plot is episodic, though a central mystery is built in slyly. Smith experiments a bit with perspective but mostly sticks to Mma Ramotswe's point of view. She is in her mid-thirties, a person of generous proportions who catches the eye of more than one man. There is tragedy in her background, but for the most part she has succeeded in life and uses her intuition well. She is honest, compassionate and ethical even as she cunningly lays a trap (her rationale for lying in such a situation is hilarious, coming as it does as she is brushing off a border guard).Most important, in Mma Ramotswe, who was born about the time the country became an independent state, Smith captures the tension that is contemporary Botswana, an African success story that enjoys stability and modern conveniences but is worried about losing tradition in a changing world. Civilization largely clings to the southern and eastern edges of the country, and beyond that rim is a wide-open, ancient land that holds beauty but sometimes danger, too. As an admirer concludes, Mma Ramotswe is all the best things of the old and the new Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I liked this book a lot, but I also think the fact that at least three of Alexander McCall Smith's books are on the bestseller list right now says a lot about our desire to read entertaining, dare we say hopeful stories about Africa. I am fascinated by Africa, but can only bring myself to read so much about war, suffering, drought, and starvation. Smith shows the human, day-to-day life of the continent -- may he be only the first of many!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a sweet and simple tale--an easy read that despite its simplicity will have you pondering what goes on in the novel. The novel doesn't have much of what one would call a plot, but rather contains a series of vignettes in which Mma Ramotswe recounts various clients she has helped in her detective work. She is an unconventional detective, and goes about solving the riddles posed to her in surprising ways. She also shares her personal history, telling us how she got to where she is. It is a charming tale, charming and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith has written over 50 books, from such specialized works as The Criminal Law of Botswana, Forensic Aspects of Sleep to Children's books.

She is drawn to her profession to \\"help people with problems in their lives.\\" Immediately upon setting up shop in a small storefront in Gaborone, she is hired to track down a missing husband, uncover a con man, and follow a wayward daughter.

The uniqueness of the mysteries reflect a simpler lifestle than many of us live and especially expect in a \\"mystery\\". TOTAL ENJOYMENT!John Row"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I came to this book after having had many, many people recommend it to me. When I get that kind of Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers thumbs-up, I tend to get stubborn, suspecting a mass-marketing push of some sort. The more fool me. In this case, the price for my stubbornness definitely came off my own hide.Fortunately, my niece's plane was late to land a couple of weeks ago, so I picked this up at the airport bookstore and started to read it. I was immediately hooked.As you can read above, this amazing volume follows the exploits of Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's first female detective. We watch her set up her office, solve her first few cases, and eventually unlock a mystery that peers into the dark (and banal) heart of human evil. But to call this a detective novel is almost a disservice to Mr. Smith's wonderful book. Mysteries, in general, fall into a very few, well-established sub-genres: the Cozy, the Hardboiled Detective, the Police Procedural, the Thriller. Every one of these types has a very clear set of standard gimmicks--tropes--that let you know what's going on. Even books that mix genres (like Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels which mix fantasy with hardboiled, or Laura Joh Rowland's Sano Ichiro series and Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, both of which tend to shift from procedural to thriller) tend to show great respect for the genre. But this book seems to ignore the traditional forms of the detective novel altogether. It is, first and formost, a novel, a work of literary fiction. Its main subject is the soul of the people of Botswana, as viewed through the lens of Mma Ramotswe herself. Yes, she solves mysteries. But it is more in the fashion of Solomon or Judge Ooka than Sherlock Holmes or Sam Spade. She is a master of the human soul. She understands people, and why they do the silly things they do, and so she inevitably manages to uncover the answers to questions that others can't seem to solve.Part of the beauty of the book is that Smith's deceptively simple storytelling style all but forces the reader to fall in love with Precious. She is so admirable, so endearing that you have no choice. You know she's going to solve the case, and that, as long as she is working on the problem, everything's going to be all right. By way of example--and I'm not going to give away too much here--about half way through the book, an incident occurs that is, on many levels, quite horrific. Smith handles the scene beautifully, simply and terrifyingly. It is the sort of scene that has broken my suspension of disbelief in several previous thrillers. Yet, because of Smith's style and Mma Ramotswe's charm and perseverance, I felt enough trust to continue on. That trust was rewarded. The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency solved the case in most satisfactory fashion.For me, knowing of southern Africa mostly through novels and horrific news reports, it was a joy to get to know Botswana on so personal and believable a level."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"History, memory, and place all play central roles in Smith's beautifully crafted detective novel. &quot;We don't forget,&quot; protagonist Mma Ramotswe muses. &quot;Our heads may be small, but they are as full of memories as the sky may sometimes be full of swarming bees, thousands and thousands of memories, of smells, of places, of little things that happened to us and which come back, unexpectedly, to remind us who we are.&quot; This quote is indicative of the manner in which &quot;Precious&quot; Ramotswe solves the mysteries that she confronts - she reaches deep into her own identity, her country of Botswana, her family, and her experiences to feel her way through various investigations.Ramotswe accepts Africa, with its blemishes, its various problems. Perhaps her intention to open a &quot;Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; has at its root an essential desire to address the roots of these problems from a uniquely African angle. Ramotswe realizes that, in her detective efforts, she is more successful when she relies upon her instincts and her knowledge of her country than upon any Western standards of detection. Similarly, her Detective Agency is a demonstration that Africa's future need not rely upon Western standards; Botswana can travel a parallel path to Western culture, and Africa should not be judged by Western ideals. Ultimately, the parallel between Ramotswe and Africa results in a declaration of the beauty of both; Precious is &quot;mother, Africa, wisdom, understanding, good things to eat, pumpkins, chicken, the smell of sweet cattle breath, the white sky across the endless, endless bush, and the giraffe that cried, giving its tears for women to daub on their baskets.&quot; Trevor's descriptions of Africa are superb and his female detective is bound for great things."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I first discovered the series through the HBO mini-series (which I loved) and took the plunge to actually read the books. Normally I would not read the book after seeing the film because generally they are so different, however, I was absolutely, positively thrilled when I discovered how close the two were. No distractions at all. The characters and writing are so warm and generous that once I finished the first book, I had to read the second. (I am now on book six.) Rarely does one feel both happy and satisfied at the end of a mystery, but that is the feeling I get after each book. Well worth the time. Enjoy and savor."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have read the entire series up to the latest which I have just begun. I love them all. I can't get enough of these stories. After completing each novel of the series I crave more. I don't want the books to end. When a new book is released, I must pre-order the hardcover... no waiting for me. I adore Precious and her dignified, decent approach to life in a Botswana, a seemingly barren land, that is rich with life. These are feel good novels which do not contain foul language, overt sex or grisly death scenes. Instead, you will find tales that are grand in their simplicity told in a beautiful and lyrical prose. I hope you have the chance to read and enjoy them. Also, as much as I love the physical printed book, you may want to sample the audio. You will want to try to get the versions read by Lisette Lecat. Her readings are incredible, and since she is from South Africa, her pronunciation is authentic. After listening to them, I now know how to pronounce the African proper names and terms. I know this is not profound or great literature. Anyone who knows me or views my bookshelf can see the great \\"literary\\" novels I have read, as well as the junk. This is not \\"great\\" literature, but it is not junk either. I have eclectic tastes, and I try and balance my book selections. I will read a heavy Pulitzer Prize winning novel followed by a light and breezy work. With this series, I always feel a sense of contentment. As much as I love the heavy hitters, it is always a pleasure to sit down and savor a book like this."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just joined a book club with some co-workers and this is the first book I read with them. I am not sure if I'd have picked this book up on my own, but ended up enjoying it quite a bit. However I liked it even more after the group was able to sit down and discuss it together.In a nutshell, The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is about a woman named Precious Ramotswe who lives in the African nation of Botswana. When she inherited a bunch of cattle after her father passed away, she did the unimaginable and sold the cattle to buy a house and open a detective agency. She decided on a detective agency because everyone needs a little help with their lives at some point. Her cases range from small (cheating husbands) to large (kidnapped children) and as she gets more popular more business comes her way.The story has cute little gems throughout. The really fun part comes in discussing the book later with others who have read it. There are lots of cultural references about Botswana, and a large theme woven throughout the book is women's liberation and male chauvinism (In fact, it is hard to believe this book was written by a man). It also overlaps with a theme of traditional values versus technology and modern living.All in all, this is a spectacular book! It is incredibly uplifting and I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Ladies' Detective a true delightThe Number One Ladies' Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith is a delight for young and old. It follows Mma Ramotswe as she solves cases in the beautiful Botswana, Africa. She deals with worried wives, trickery twins, and of course the witch doctor that is feared to have taken a small boy.This book kept me laughing all the way through, with silly dialogue as well as charming characters. The light-heartiness made it a fun novel and kept me entertained throughout. For example, here is just one of the humorous passages I found myself laughing to.\\"So,\\" said Mma Ramotswe, \\"when people see a sign saying Number One Ladies Detective Agency, what will they think? They think those ladies will know what's going on. They're the ones.\\"The lawyer stroked his chin.\\" Maybe.\\"\\"Yes,\\" said the Mma Ramotswe. \\"Maybe.\\" Adding, \\"Your zip is open Rra. I think you may not have noticed...\\"This passage shows that despite doubts, Mma Ramotswe was going to prove that she has what it takes to make it in a male based profession. While some reviews claimed the book was too harsh on men, I think that it was meant to not deal with men at all. The author is trying to show that women have not been given the same respect in many countries. It was not long ago that America was dealing with the same problem.Also, many reviews claimed that the book lacked a plot and was too light. I agree that it was light; however, it would be a stretch to put \\"too\\" in front of that. The cases were enjoyable and interesting, although I agree they lacked a little detail. The main point here is that this is no Odyssey or a work of William Shakespeare's. If the reader was looking for a lengthy challenging story then it is their fault for making this book their choice.One of my favorite parts of the book is the description of Botswana. Through the writing I got a picture running through my head. I could see the beautiful landscape. It made me feel as though I was right there miles and miles away. While some said it lacked the detail of Africa, I felt it was filled with stories that centered on its beauty.If the reader is looking for a book that will keep them smiling and won't cause them a headache, then The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency is for them. It is the perfect combination of mischief and mystery, charm as well as creative humor."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I don't normally like mysteries, because I hate blood and gore and suspense. But I have to say that this book was really charming. Although it has 'detective' in the title, the mysteries are not the central theme of this book at all. This is a book about the main character and about her country - the mysteries she handles are supporting plots, and they are not bloody or gory. I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just love this whole series! They are the type of stories that you curl up in a chair by the fire and just relax with. I was 'hooked' from the first book. Mma Ramotswe is a gentle, kind, and observant woman. Through the book, the author writes his love for Africa. Mma Ramotswe loves Botswana and helps the readers to love it, too. I could find nothing 'bad' in the books, nothing that I would have wished was not written. Pretty rare for a whole series! I recommend this series being read in the public schools."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Plot Summary: Precious Ramotswe, a proud daughter of Botswana, has taken the small inheritance from the sale of her father's cattle and opened her own business, called the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. With her common sense wisdom, and a detective instruction manual to guide her, Mma Ramotswe manages to find the answers her clients need, even if it's not what they want to hear. As her fledgling business grows, she hires a sweet-tart assistant named Mma Makutsi, and she relies on her friendly mechanic, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, to keep her tiny white van running long past its expected lifespan.Have you been feeling a little blue lately? Down in the dumps and you can't shake the funk from your brain? These little books are the perfect antidote, because I always feel happier and at peace with myself after immersing my imagination in Precious Ramotswe's world. Everything is painted in the vivid colors of Africa, and the slower, simpler lifestyle feels refreshing compared to our fast-paced mania of commuting, texting, twittering, and too much television. I feel at home and connected to the people in this corner of Botswana, and it makes me hopeful that yes, we humans can share something special together when we don't let technology get in the way of meeting face-to-face. The irony is that I'm writing this to essentially nobody, to later post on a website. See? We are messed up over here. Mma Ramotswe would have sat me down with a cup of red bush tea, and let the words tumble out till the cows came home and I was feeling much better.There are two utterly charming romances that play out over the course of this series, for both Mma Ramotswe and her intrepid assistant, Mma Makutsi. Their courtships proceed with awkward, halting steps that ring true in real life, where women usually read relationships like a map, and the men are tongue-tied, wary wildebeests ready to bolt at the first sniff of commitment. I just want to pat these guys on the head, and tell them to give it up, because the poor fools just don't stand a chance when these ladies get it in their heads that it's time for marriage.The novels are fairly short, which makes each installment feel like a brief, sweet treat, and I was ready for the next one immediately, like picking a new chocolate from a box of truffles. The touching humor, and the powerful reassurance that real human connections are what matter most in life, perk me up like a sunny day after weeks of rain. If I could choose my relatives (and it's a pity I cannot), I would adopt Mma Ramotswe as a favorite Auntie.Here's a list of the book titles in this series:The No. 1 Ladies' Detective AgencyTears of the GiraffeMorality for Beautiful GirlsThe Kalahari Typing School for MenThe Full Cupboard of LifeIn the Company of Cheerful LadiesBlue Shoes and HappinessThe Good Husband of Zebra DriveThe Miracle at Speedy Motors"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"....are the words that come to mind when describing this wonderful little novel. Precious Ramotswe wants something fun in her life...after a doomed romantic relationship. When her father dies leaving her a rather sizeable inheritance, Mma Ramotswe decides to open up a detective agency...the only one in her native Botswana. At first, she is concerned that there will be no clients; but soon the business starts rolling in. From cheating husbands, to strange physicians to missing children, it is not long before Mma Ramotswe is rather famous in her country.With generous descriptions of the African country of Botswana, to the local vernacular and customs, Smith has managed to create a beloved protagonist with just the right mixture of wit, drama, and suspense. Wonderful book.DYB"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Call me simple, but I couldn't get through the first tape of the unabridged audio book. I tried to be patient, but after an hour, the plot still hadn't begun to take shape. Although I can't offer much in the way of a review, I nonetheless felt the need to post one, because I bought this book BECAUSE of the rave reviews. It may warm up, but all indications pointed to ramblings of cultures and complications in simple lives, and I was absolutely bored to death. The slow speech and accent of the reader may have contributed to the coma this book attempted to put me in."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first time in my life where I have bought a book, based on the printed reviews, and found them to be totally misleading!I am VERY displeased. The review on the cover of this book was definitely misleading. There was not one hilarious or even mildly funny episode in the ENTIRE book. I unfortunately kept reading it until the very end, thinking it has to get better. Where's all the funny stuff!!It was not written well. The story did not flow well. It is nothing but short stories about a few investigations and then WAH--LA she decides its time to get married...the end. This has to be the worst book I have ever read!I am really sorry I forked out my twelve bucks at an airport bookstore for this one."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I bought this book after reading all those fabulous reviews ,it was so boring that no matter how hard I forced myself I couldn't go on reading after the 40th page .You could feel that the writer was a novice from the start"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book was very slow moving and lacked the ability to hold my interest. I'd recommend the Poisonwood Bible instead."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is an interesting novel, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the writing is not up to the level of other PI fiction, e.g., novels by Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, etc. I would note that that author has previously writen children's books, and the writing style may reflect that. The plotting is somewhat simplistic.Having said that, the characters are interesting, and the novel provides substantial information about Botswana where the author lived for a period of time. The novel covers a number of cases, and the interesting ones are towards the end (insurance fraud, people's identities, and a missing child).I thought it was worth reading, but if you are used to the complexities of American PI novels you might be disappointed."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I wanted to read this book ever since I read a book review of it on the 'Time'. I was curious as to how fun, witty it would be, and whether it deserved all the compliments. The book didn't reach my expectations, but it was still an interesting read. The dissatisfaction I felt came partly from the fact that it was so predictable, so undiverging from the rules of good. The banal boo-hoo story of a violent husband and the trauma. The peccadilloes of uninteresting people, and Mz. Ramotswe's unsurprising solutions. The book lacked one very important element essential to make it breathe, to draw the reader in and make him laugh and cry with the story; it lacked charisma of the characters. I need a character who somehow touches my heart in any way, to make me appreciate the book to its full. Another fault was that the literary style had no flavor; it was so ordinary. However, I have been concentrating on its small faults; overall, the events were interesting and the book wasn't bad.The heroine is Mma Ramotswe, who sets up a detective agency after her father's death, with the money from the sales of his legacy of cows. She solves various cases that smell of Africa brought to her by people leading ordinary lives in Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Follow along on dangerous journeys, stalk infaous men, and enjoy detective life with Mma Ramotswe in Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. The story is set in present day Africa. The plot follows Mma Ramotswe through the grunt-work of being a detective. From case to case, the book will have you flipping pages until the very end.The main charecter, Mma Ramotswe, is the owner of the only Detective Agency in Botswana. Born in Botswana, Mma prides herself on her unique business and her 100% satisfaction garuntee. Mma's agency was funded by the sale of her father's cattle. Like any business, it took a while to get started, one it did Mma was inundated with clients. One client in particular kicks the plot froward. A poor Katswana schoolteacher writes to Mma and asks for her help in the disappearance of his son. Mma uses her detective skills and the help of her good friend Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni to follow the trail of the boy. The road to discovery is rocky with the potholes of witch doctors, smugglers and one of the most infamous men in the country, Charlie Gotso. To complicate matters, Mr. Matekoni proposes. Mma is in over her head, she must solve the disappearance of the schoolteachers son and decide whether she will acept Mr. Matekoni's proposal for the ulimate ending.Certain parts of the story are hard to believe. An example of this was when Mma Ramotswe was in hot pursuit of a suspect. A client asked her to see the whereabouts of one of his doctors. His erratic behavior suggested he was on drugs but the employer wanted proof first. When she followed the suspect to a house she watched from the garden of an abandonned house next door. Her detective skills failed her and the suspect spotted her. When asked what she was doing she made up a story about how she used to live in the abandonned house and she was reminiscing her days there. Suprisingly, the suspect believed her. This seemed particularly hard to believe. How could an eductaed man believe the reason Mma was crouched in the garden was that she was reminiscing her childhood? In any case, this parallels a oint in my life when I was in Elementary school. I lost my math homework and said my older brother ate it. Since the excuse was original and the homework was difficult, my teacher brushed off the excuse with a good laugh and waved the assignment.All in all, The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency had me flipping the pages until the very end. It was a light read that accomodated my need to get away from heavy material. For a good laugh and some thrills, read Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I wanted to read this book because of the positive reviews it had received. The book was hard for me to get into. I wanted the mystery to present itself sooner than it did. Too much time was spent on the main character's history, which I suppose was to set up the series. When she finally got a case, it was resolved very quickly. I realized that this book would describe several simple, quick cases she had worked on rather than having a main mystery that would serve as a plot. It was interesting to have Africa as a backdrop, but that is not enough to make me want to read other books in this series, the first book of which disappointed me."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I really tried to like this as I knew someone who thought it was great. Unfortunately, I could never get into it. I must have read half the book before I finally just gave up and gave the book away."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Congratulations to Ms Smith. A fun read.

One reviewer thought the author of this book was a woman. Hello!!!Now, I will review the book: it was excellent...it made me smile and feel happy. I wanted to be a better person after having read it because there are many morality messages. The characters were so well developed, I felt I knew these people like my own family. The author has great insight into women's psyche"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I found this book enchanting. Mma Ramotswe is both likable and hilarious as the lead character running her own detective agency in Botswana. She encounters many interesting sorts and solves their mysteries along the way.Alexander McCall writes with an easy style that encourages his readers to read a little longer. His chapters could easily be a short story within themselves. I was so wrapped up in his book that I read it in two days and am currently on to the next in his series about Mma Ramotswe. I see a movie in the future!!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have not literally \\"read\\" the book, but I have rather \\"listened\\" to it in its unabridged version on tape. My judgment may be partly biased by the dull, almost bored tone of voice almost invariably kept by the reader. She is very good at imitating accents, but she is not a very good story teller. Anyway, the book is really dull as well. The prose is poor, and dialogues are mostly uninteresting. Barely any sentence worth remembering. The book tells the story of a young and resourceful lady who decides to open a detective agency in Botswana, a country which is one of the few Development \\"success stories\\" in Africa.The story is mostly uneventful, and relatively boring. The main character has to deal with such interesting \\"cases\\" as that of a father who disapproves of his teenager daughter's dates, or that of the wife looking for proof of her husband's misbehaviors. Most stories are quite predictable, and interspersed with cheap wisdom on life in general, and in Botswana in particular. We learn that all men, or almost all of them, are mindless creatures only interested in sex. We meet the evil and powerful politician.I don't know if the \\"simplicity\\" of the story and of the characters are supposed to be the strength of the book. It the idea that this is what one should expect from simple people in a still relatively poor country? I do not think so. But, really, if you are looking for a glimpse of \\"real Africa\\", this is not the book you want to read. You can learn much more spending the same amont of time reading travel diaries, or historical, sociological, or anthropological essays. If \\"foreign cultures\\" is what you are interested in, this book will only provide you a few hints, while keeping you mildly entertained for a few hours.This book is not horrible, but its success is hard for me to understand, and I can assure you that I am not the kind of \\"intellectual\\" reader that only reads essays or War and Peace. I am, for example, a great fan of Harry Potter, which is not as beautifully written as The Lord of the Rings, but at the same time it is wildly entertaining. All in all, I will not buy the next episodes of the \\"saga\\"."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mna Ramotswe is the most colorful character to grace the pages in a long time. Her wonderful vivid accounts of Africa and its people are splendid and warm. I discovered her quite by accident and can hardly wait to find our her next excellant adventure. The audio books are a wonderful way to immerse yourself from the stresses of a busy day or a wonderful companion on a piece of exercise equipment. I hope you will enjoy the No 1. Ladies Detective agency adventures as much as I have."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"An absolutely delightful read! The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency is full of humour and wit. I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Compelling story written with insight and great humor on how a woman copes with challening attitudes and gains acceptance, and respect in Botzwana. Very enjoyable and worth reading. One of the cable pay channels created a few shows by the same name that were fantastic...hope they air more episodes soon."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I found the book to be simple yet delightful. The stories reminded me of the television show, Murder She Wrote. Instead of Jessica Fletcher, you'll join the clever detective, Mma Ramotswe whose personal life is as insightful as the cases she solves. I already started book two, Tears of the Giraffe, purchased here on Amazon."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mr Smith does a lovely job with this book. He sets the book up nicely giving you the background on Precious, so it's a good idea to read this series in order. Precious solves a number of cases in this book & whilst it must be admitted she got some very, very lucky breaks it doesn't stop this from being a really entertaining quick read. I also like how Mr Smith repeatedly pays respect to Agatha Christie in this book, who is still one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love this series of books. It is adorable, endearing and fun. This one is as good as the others, thus far. It arrived in good condition as well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I would say my favorite genre is modern literature because of the prose, depth and reasons behind the story. The problem, though, is that some of modern literature is depressing or overdone (read: snooty). I enjoyed this book because it has depth but is somehow almost lighthearted. I think it had a lot to do with the main character and her outlook on life. The book deals with death, crime, abuse, etc, but the setting is so peaceful and main character is so down-to-earth that it makes her setting more bearable. This is a quick read but still has a purpose.The author does a great job dealing with varied perspectives and moving in time while keeping the story consistent. There are several mysteries in here, and they're all enjoyable, but they are really not the point of the book. You need to love the setting and the backstory before you can get into the mysteries. His writing style can lean toward the choppy, but there are poetic bits as well.I'm excited to have stumbled on this book and look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I did not expect to like this book, but I fell in love with the main character, the language, the stories. In a time when society thrives on who killed who and how, these stories took me to a gentler place, while still discussing death, kidnapping and adultery. Loved it. Recommend it! Get it!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have seen this series advertised for a long time. I read the first one and was pleasantly surprised. I had no idea it was set in Africa. The book was a delight. I liked the main character, Mma Ramsotswe. She is smart, interesting and definitely brave. Her descriptions of Africa make me want to visit.You will love these books. It is a fantastic series! I am already in the middle of the second one and I look forward to reading all of them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This didn't live up to its hype I decided. After hearing so much about it I was really looking forward to it, but there was a lot that could be improved.A new detective business has opened up in Botswana. Ad its run by a woman. After her father leaves her a good bit of money, Mma Ramotswe opens up the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. She solves simple crimes brought to her by people of her town. But that's not all she does, she also reminisces about the past and certain periods in her life. But this isn't your ordinary mystery novel. Its more about the people of Botswana than it is about solving cases. Mysterious are solved, but its not the main focus.I really liked the characters. They were all interesting and compelling. I would have liked for more description on them actually; something more of the culture and life to make me understand them a little better. Ramotswe herself is an especially well written character with a lot of personality, although I don't always follow her train of thought all the time.For a plot this is where the novel lost me a bit. I found it too jumpy and too much going on. It evened out by the last third of the book but getting there was tedious. I also had a bit of trouble with the writing. While it is representative of the rhythm and language of the area, for those not accustomed to it it can be hard to read and I found it distracting when I just wanted to read the story. This too evened out towards the end though, or maybe I just became used to it.I won't be rushing out to find the next book but I will probably be reading them eventually. I want to see what happens to the characters, but there are other books calling first.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective AgencyCopyright 1998235 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have read all the books in this series and really enjoyed them. One of the things I love about this author, in everything he writes, is that he can explore real issues and write a thoughtful, meaningful book without all the pretentiousness, downbeat elements and consciously elevated writing that so many \\"literary\\" writers seem to go for. This is a real soap-box issue for me. Sometimes I like a really escapist read, but sometimes I want a book that makes me think, yet does this have to mean I must plough through all this dense writing and catatonic characters who are so alienated and never seem to behave like normal human beings? Surely not! Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful humanity and lightness of touch. I recommend his work to anyone who is looking for that kind of in-between read - life-affirming and thought-provoking without being a chore to wade through."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Listened to this Book on CD on a recent trip. It was so enjoyable...and I believe one of the reasons was the way the reader put such enthusiasm into her work...just listening to the pronunciations of the names was such fun! Now the TV series brings all the characters to life."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The only thing I didn't like was that it had to end.I learned that you don't have to write elloquently to write a book. This book was so simple and yet so enjoyable that it makes me wonder if I really could write a book too.Because each mystery/case is so short and precise, it doesn't need all the suspense other books use. I think the suspense in this book is about finding out what the next problem will be and how clever she is to solve it.One question asked in book club was if women are more perceptive than men. I don't feel that all women are more perceptive than all men. It depends on personality. However, I would venture to generalize that many women seem to be more sensitive to other people's feelings than most men are."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexader McCall Smith has amazing managed to write from the prospective of an African woman. This is a simple and pleasant story, about a simple and pleasant person, who one day decided to become the number one lady detective in Botswana. So, she opened up an office and put out a sign. This is not a suspense drama, or a romance novel, but has enough substance to keep me interested. I want to read more of this series, (which has now been produced on TV). The characters are nicely developed, and already seem like old friends."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a cute read, but not too cute so that it's like a little-girl read.

Having seen the HBo series as well made this an even better treat."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Love, love this book. It's written so simply and beautifully. I had read other of the books in the series and went back to read the number one book so that I could understand what happened first. Precious Ramotswe is a gem. Nothing escapes this woman's eye. Yet she always has time for a break and nice cuppa bush tea. I wish I could join her and we could have a talk and a little gossip about the situations in Gaborone, Botswana that she is sorting out. Her assistant Mma. Makutsi is a scene stealer. She is so serious about her job and very conscientious. She was very proud of the fact that she earned 97% on her final exam at secretarial school. The cases Mma. Ramotswa solves are secondary to the humorous goings on in this African town. Author Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful story teller. When you finish this book you can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I've been hearing about this book for a long time. People speak about it in glowing terms. So........when I picked it up to read I expected something grand and wonderful. what I discovered was a cute series of vignettes about a chubby Botswanan detective who solves puzzles and some criminal activities. The writing is just okay and the subject matter just barely managed to hold my interest. I thought the book would be better marketed for young adults rather than for mature adults.I can't understand why the book is such a sensation and why a whole TV series has been made about it. I think I am drawn to more intense and darker books. I certainly prefer books with better narratives and a finer style of writing."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Described as a \\"series of vignettes,\\" The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency uses a non-linear narrative style which at times makes you wonder what one chapter has to do with anything else. Mma Ramotswe, the main character, is a clever woman who is always minding everyone else's business. Her antics and interactions entertain but the writing style doesn't really \\"set the hook.\\" In the end, it all comes together. I enjoyed the story once it was complete, but not always so much along the way."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I started watching the HBO series and loved it so I ordered the first book. It's fantastic and I'm so glad HBO is sticking so close to the author's vision. Loved the book and I'm upset at myself for not ordering the second in the series until I finished the first one because now I'm without a book to read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I was also suprised that a man could write a woman's part so well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A truly entertaining story that had me transported to Botswana. Fascinating characters, particularly Mme Ramotswe, and such vivid descriptions that I felt as if I were there. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a joy on several levels. As a series of mysteries solved by the inimitable Mma Ramotswe, who invariably puts her size 22 finger on the crux of a mystery and solves it, the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is satisfying; but unexpectedly rewarding are the glimpses into the manners, habits and prejudices of another culture. Smith's writing style is exquisite; deceptively simple, but with little gems such as his description of the language used in the South African mines:\\"...a language for giving orders, push, shove, do this, do that; but no words for friendship, love, or the sound the birds make in the morning.\\" This is a book to read and reread, and make cherished friends of Mma Ramotswe and her circle."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book in a day, partly because it is a short book and mostly because the writing was charming and engaging. The instantly charismatic heroine detective tells the fun and interesting stories of the mysteries she is called on to investigate and solve in her own unique way - all the while revealing bits of the culture, relationships and problems of her native land.The author, through the heroine, gives the rich history and description of her African country and her life and family experiences, some that make you laugh, and some that make you really feel for the characters, but most of all to shape Precious Ramostwe and alert us to why she makes the decisions she does and pursue her own way of life. I enjoyed the unique taste of African culture and recommend it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a delightful book this is! This is an episodic novel that keeps moving forward. The episodes build up to a beautiful character study. The protagonist is one Mma Precious Ramotswe, a clever 35-year old Botswanan lady of ample proportions who has a big heart as well. The book presents her story from the time of her father's wooing of her mother and a childhood of being raised by a kindly cousin who trained her mind after her mother's early death. When Precious grows up, she marries an abusive man who abandons her when she is pregnant with a child who will only live five days. But Mma Ramotswe manages to survive and prosper. With the money her father bequeaths her she sets up The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The book then documents her efforts to make her business a success and her breezy manner of solving mysteries. She takes on several cases, from women who want to know if their husbands are cheating on them, a strict father who wants to know if his daughter has a boyfriend, a case of medical fraud and disappearance of a child whom she suspects was murdered in a witchcraft ritual. This is all set before the stunning backdrop of Botswana, which is vividly evoked. This is a beautiful book. I don't remember the last time I read a novel as consistently charming and delightful. I found it very difficult to put down and read it in record time for me. I love Precious Ramotswe and look forward to her further adventures."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The debut novel in this series is the weakest one, but still good. Still, don't skip \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,\\" as each novel builds on the one that came before.The novel appears to be a collection of short stories about the cases of Mma Precious Rebotswe, a clever and gentle Botswanan woman who goes into the detective business armed only with a how-to book, an incomparable secretary and her own good sense. In the end, it turns out to be enough, and all the stories tie in together by the last page.The next book, \\"The Tears of the Giraffe,\\" is even better. In fact, each of Alexander McCall Smith's books is better than the one that came before. (What a nice twist from what usual happens: that is, a writer has a great idea for a series, but then runs out of steam.)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After the death of her father, Precious Ramotswe uses the inheritance to buy herself a house and an office from which she starts the first detective agency in Botswana. Business starts slowly, but she gets a number of clients with problems ranging from missing husbands to fraudulent employees and she starts to build up a reputation leading to new clients. The book describes some of the cases that Mma Ramotswe solves, but the real star of the book is Africa: there are long, loving descriptions of the nature, the people, the culture and the life in Africa and anybody who has been to Africa (and subsequently loves the continent despite all its problems) can use this book to refresh their memories and long back to those real African nights. Don't read this as a detective but as a book about Africa."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Smith underwrites in the most effective way, letting the characters take over the book, never imposing himself or manipulating.

In the beginning of the book we learn about her father's life as a miner and we are introduced to the country. We also learn about Precious' upbringing, her head for figures and her failed marriage. Precious struggles with establishing a new business, but she gets cases. They are not all the typical detective story mysteries about malicious crimes. Most are more concerned with the human heart and relationships between people. There is a woman whose long lost father finds her, but she suspects that he is not really her father and is taking advantage of her kindness and generosity. There is a woman who is upset that her husband stole a car and she wants the car returned without her husband's knowledge or the involvement of the police. There is a father who believes his daughter has a boyfriend and he wants to know who the boy is. There are a number of other cases and I enjoyed them all. This was very easy-reading and not a complex detective story, but the setting was fun and the reading enjoyable.Recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe truly is precious, and the book is a quick, funny, quirky and captivating read. I found myself laughing out loud while reading passages about lawyers and people suffering from constipation. The Botswana culture, albeit stereotypical, came alive through the author's brief but colorful depictions of roads travelled, snakes and bugs, witchcraft, foods eaten, and personalities encountered.The lore of Botswana through the eyes of Precious and the variety of cases she solves in her trusty &quot;little white van,&quot; is quite a fun and relaxing read. Be sure to share this one with your friends, family and favorite attorney."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this book, then the second one (Tears of the Giraffe), and can't wait for the next one. Alexander McCall Smith has captured a character who stands not alone, but who represents womanhood and hopefully those of modern Botswana. Having never been to Africa it was a delightful opportunity to read of someone else's descriptive manner at detailing a storyline around a whole of their people. Since I do not have any experience to this observation, let it suffice to say that it intrigued me and kept me reading. The main character was just that, a character. Her life and that of the simple life around her was developed in such a manner that I wanted to find out more of how she thought, lived, and developed her detective agency in such a place. Her main male interest was charming as well. He had pride, depth, and honesty when often we think of those we don't know in far away places as perhaps not being as morale as we believe ourselves to be. It was eye-opening, interesting, and worth the read.The sad part was reading some viewpoints from readers who found the book not a &quot;great&quot; detective novel. They missed the point entirely. Her neighbors and clients were charming folks with lives that had simple fears, hopes, and dreams. What more could a reader ask than to have a glimpse into their lives.Read on folks, the second book is as delightful as the first.Thank you.Reader in California"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A beautiful story, the life of Mma Ramotswe a detective agent in Botswana, Africa. She takes us back through her childhood and brings us to the present to meet her customers where each story unfolds two pictures of Africa now and then. Mma Ramotswe symbolizing the modern African woman and the conflict that goes between modernization and culture. Humor is one of Mma Ramotswe's qualities and she never fails to make you laugh out loud! Whether she's analyzing her problems or trying to solve a mystery.. it is so simple and hilarious!She loves her country, but tries hard to eradicate horrible old beliefs. She cherishes her freedom and the new way of life but nevertheless holds tight to her roots. She portrays wisdom and femininity, and pours out her opinion whenever possible. A romantic ending to a beautiful story!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"McCall Smith creates a refreshing fictional world: a Detective Agency set in an African locale. Simple in style, brisk pace, agreeable characters, rich African ambience, less than complex mini-investigations, pleasant reading - The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency very much falls within the softer side of crime detection fiction.Mma. Ramotswe, the plump Agency Detective, loves Botswana and its people. In Sunday school, she learned early in life about \\"good and evil\\". Later, she suffered a disastrous marriage and the pain of losing a child. Left a herd of cattle by her deceased father (a gripping section recounts his harrowing time as a miner), Mma. Ramotswe sells up and astonishingly opts to sink the proceeds into setting up in business as Botswana's first female private detective. With few assets, no track record, no client base, the Agency needs to establish itself quickly - or shut up shop. Mma. Ramotswe uses commonsense, wit and women's intuition to help people resolve \\"their difficulties\\" (not necessarily involving a crime); some cases are funny such as the woman who suspects her husband of playing around, some bizarre such as the inexplicable dramatic fluctuations in a hospital doctor's competence from one day to another, while others deal with missing persons, notably the disappearance of an eleven-year old boy, possibly linked to witchcraft. In resolving cases, Mme. Ramotswe's guiding principle is that Justice is paramount.These gentle mini-mysteries, entertaining in themselves, give fascinating glimpses into African life and culture. In this respect, The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, it could be said, is as much about modern Africa as it is about crime detection. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Botswana is the setting for the first in a series of detective novels by Alexander McCall Smith featuring Mma Precious Ramotswe, a 'traditionally built' women 'blessed with expansive girth rather than height'. When Mma Ramotswe's father dies from lung disease - the result of long years spent working in South African mines - she uses her inheritance to open her own business, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.We follow a progression of cases including the man who had joined a Christian sect and then vanished, a wealthy Indian business man determined to reign in an errant daughter with 'modern ideas', a factory worker suspected of committing insurance fraud, and a boy who may have been kidnapped by a witch-doctor. These delightful vignettes introduce us to a wealth of beautifully detailed characters described with humour, compassion and an obvious love of Africa and its people.The gentle pace of this book perfectly matches the wisdom and insight of Mma Ramotswe as she drives her tiny white van through the shimmering heat of Botswana."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Moments of brilliance mixed with a nice gentle story.

The characters are refreshingly original, and I enjoy the armchair trip to Africa. I was somewhat disappointed that the cases tend to appear as a too-short series of vignettes, not enough tangles of threads for my tastes in this genre. Still, I'll likely pick up another in this series when I have an appetite for a light and warm hearted diversion."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The writing style is simple, yet there is great depth within the stories. Alexander McCall Smith is an excellent story teller, with the capability to make one fall in love with his characters. If you are looking for some light reading, this is a find. If you are looking for something which will make you introspective, again, this is a find. One of the best reads I've had in a long time and I'd consider it a modern day classic."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I absoutely loved this book. The Lady Detective (Precious Ramotswe) is one of the most charming, smart and savvy characters to grace the pages of a novel in a long while. The writing is so colorful that you can imagine that you are riding along with Precious in her \\"little white van\\" across Botswana or wherever her detective adventures take her. Out of a need for work, Precious opens a detective agency. He clients run the gamet from those who don't have a lot of money to those who live behind gated walls and own several businesses. She takes on all clients-as long as they don't want her to do anything illegal. She solves the cases with determination, grit and yes, a little luck. Precious is a very strong, yet kind and compassionate person. There are so many mean and unkind characters in novels now, it is refreshing to see someone writing a novel with such a nice central character. I have already bought the next three novels in No.1 Ladies series and am looking forward to reading them as well."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I lived in Gaborone 20 years ago, back when there were no traffic lights, and the road to Kgali hill was dust and bush. This this book brought so many memories back! The changes in the city are substantial, but the people remain the same.Yes, the story is fictional, but the kindness, the concern for any neighbor, the love there is for every brother and sister in that huge expansion of land that is Botswana, remains the same.The story is a simple one, like the life of the people. Mma Ramotswe's investigative adventures are not thrilling and suspenseful, but fit perfectly in a world where there are no major complications. The results of her investigations seem to come easily, but in a world where everybody knows everybody, and is somehow related to everybody too, doors open easily and conversations are started without difficulty. This is not a book to analyze until exhaustion, but one to enjoy for the simple pleasure of a good time.I'm only reviewing this book, but I read the whole series, and loved it. For a person that has not had my experience, I recommend the book simply as an escape of the \\"real world\\".

'"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe has had a tough life. Her father has passed away after a long, painful illness. She's survived a disastrous marriage to a ne'er-do-well musician, and miscarried a child. What should she do with the modest legacy her father has left behind?Start a detective agency, of course.It's the first detective agency in Botswana run by a woman, and after a little hoopla and media attention, she settles down into the routine of a small businessperson trying to meet the monthly expenses. Who in Botswana is going to want to hire a lady detective, anyhow? Lots of people, it turns out. Precious is a natural detective. She has a sharp eye for detail and a good memory. She listens patiently and sympathetically to people's problems, and the clients begin coming to her, in ones and twos, then more regularly. She handles a variety of small cases-unfaithful husbands, rebellious children, con artists and embezzlers. She gains a reputation as somebody who solves problems.One day, she encounters a more serious mystery-a missing child may have been murdered, and powerful people are implicated. Memories of her own lost child haunt her, and this case becomes an obsession. She must find the answers, no matter what the cost.Alexander McCall Smith lives in Scotland, not the sort of fellow you'd expect to pen The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, first in a series of detective novels featuring a woman in Botswana, but he was born not far away, in Zimbabwe, and taught law at the University of Botswana. He visits regularly. His affection for Africa and its people comes through loud and clear. This is a story that savors the slow pace of life on the edge of the Kalahari Desert, the summer's relentless heat and broad blue skies.Precious is a fabulous character. A woman of progressive ideas, and a \\"traditionally-built African lady,\\" she moves through the male-dominated culture of Botswana with grace and style. She's comfortable in her own skin, proud of her accomplishments, and filled with unquenchable love for her homeland and its people. No obstacle is insurmountable, given a little thought, and patience, and a good cup of bush tea. She obtains guidance from an obscure book on private investigation, and inspiration from Agatha Christie, but she doesn't really need it. Precious has all the intellectual tools a good detective needs, plus the confidence and audacity to stick her nose in where society says it shouldn't be allowed. She gains many admirers along the way, including two very eligible bachelors, but she insists she's through with husbands and wants to focus on her new career.There are no sensational crimes, intractable puzzles, or drawing-room confrontations in this book. The cases Precious handles might seem rather mundane, but they are of paramount importance to her and her clients. She solves them mostly through persistence, keen observational skills, and old-fashioned common sense, leavened with compassion for both victims and perpetrators. It's a very human story, and I was fascinated by the interactions among the characters. I didn't care so much about the crimes--Precious was going to figure out what happened, no doubt of that--I wanted to find out who she was going to meet along the way, and what they were going to talk about.Smith has written a very charming story, with an insider's feel for the people and territory of Botswana and its neighbors. Like much of Africa, the story moves at a tranquil pace that allows the reader to savor its images and characters. It's a great book for a sunny summer afternoon.HBO has produced a television series based on the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels, but I haven't seen it, and I don't really have any plans to. The book's good enough on it's own."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"the words in the header are few which come to mind when you are reading the book - it is a classic - it portrays a picture of Africa which very few other authors have ever been able to do - this is like Africa - a lighter version of Nadim Gordimer - everything is simple - it is difficult to portray simplicity without making it boring but McCall Smith has pulled that off in flying colors - his respect for the land and its people flows through every line - the protagonist Mma Ramotswe exudes confidence and walks up against all odds with the courage of a warrior - it can be a petty thief or a political big-shot - she is afraid of none but she does not treat them equally - she adjusts to the situation within her limited means - there is a continuous undercurrent of her love for Africa and its people - she respects the nature, the land and its people - it thows a new light on the Africans in Botswana region - but it does not hide the illegal trades or the lack of opportunities - everything is painted in beautiful colors - the stories are complete even though smith does not write long sentenses - you never know what is coming - simple turns but Mme Ramotswe manages to fascinate us with her boundless talent and curiosity -this book is an absolute wonder and may change your idea about Africa-"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"No greater compliment can be given (in my opinion) except that the reader is sorely disappointed to say goodbye. I am living in a country where books in English are rarely available, and I am sometimes forced to endure dribble and pretend to enjoy it.Boy was I pleasantly surprised when this book passed into my hands. I loved the main character before the first chapter was over.The writing was charming, endearing, and unique.One of these days, I hope the second book will find it's way here."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoy these books by Alexander McCall Smith about the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency as they make me feel happy. I am 79 and an avid reader and I have never read books that I actually go back and reread and enjoy again. My thanks to Mr. McCall for writing such delightful stories. I had a complete set of the books and when we down sized I gave them away and then bought them again to enjoy in our new home."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was an easy read, and a simple story to follow. Some of the imagery in the book was just beautiful. However, it didn't really have much of a 'flow'...by this I mean, each chapter seemed like an anecdote or short story unto itself, that had many of the same characters. And I certainly wouldn't classify this as a mystery (that is what the back cover had it categorized as)...there wasn't much in the way of thrilling or 'whodunnit' action! All in all, an okay read.

Wonderful writing, beautiful stories, bound to be classics for a long time.The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Movie Tie-in Edition) (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first in the series of the Alexander McCall Smith books featuring a lady detective in Botswana, Precious Ramotswe.Precious has many adventures in this book with several interesting supporting characters like Happy Bapetsi - the names are great all by themselves. While relating all this, the book introduces readers to what apparently life is like in Botswana. It seems to be quite an interesting culture, especially in its viewpoints on life.Here is one example of the latter. While Precious is daydreaming about her retirement to come one day in the future, she thinks how sorry she is for white people, because they worry themselves about things that are going to happen anyway. What good does all their money do them if the can't sit still and take in the view? She thought that the rare white people who understood the truth were regarded with suspicion by the other whites. As a white person, I must say that Precious may have a point here.The book is worth a look for the Botswana philosophy alone. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe had a short nightmarish marriage to Note Mokoti and gave birth to a child who lived only five days. For the next fourteen years she stayed with her father until his death when she was thirty four. Luckily he left her well off so she set up a detective agency.The rest of the book deals with the cases she handled and how she handled them. Many of the stories were very interesting but there were some weak ones too. For example the case of Malatsi who disappeared in the river, when he was about to be baptized. How did Mma Ramotswe know that he was eaten by a crocodile and above all how to position herself in a place and time for the crocodile?!! After killing the animal she slit open its belly and found undigested bangles and rings and a wristwatch and so solved the case. Sorry, to me this was weak.The author captures some of the nuances very well indeed and I liked how the book ends on a pleasantly romantic note."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In more 'traditional' detective novels, the detective is an embittered, experienced, cynical witness to the seamy side of society (in addition to being--most likely--male and Causcasian). The remarkable Precious Ramotswe is none of those things. Precious is a portly-but-dignified, 38-year-old lady living in Botswana with absolutely no detective experience, who takes it into her head to found a detective agency when her father dies and leaves her a little money.Preciouse Ramotswe turns the whole idea of being a detective inside out. Although she does solve cases, they don't seem to be the point of the tale but secondary to Precious herself. And I must say I found her completely compelling. Completely centered and self-assured without being cocky. Size 22 without self-loathing (and with multiple marriage proposals). A great sense of humor and clever without being cynical.It's as though being a detective was a metaphor for taking care of people. Detecting = observing the world around. Observing the world = taking care of the people in it. Detective as mother.Although in parts it is quite funny (the bit where the snake gets snuck under her car), on the whole I found it supremely moving. Alexander McCall Smith mixes Precious' resolution of her cases with lyrical passages describing the Botswana countryside that Preciouse observes as she passes through it in her trusty white van.My only caution is that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different. But anyone else reading this review--anyone that just appreciates wonderful writing--should PLEASE buy this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith deserves praise for not only writing a great mystery, but for writing several.And I don't just mean multiple books. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a top-notch series of mysteries with clever, sometimes hilarious resolutions. Whether it's read all at once or in pieces, it plays perfectly. Almost every chapter stands on its own as a great mystery with an intriguing set-up and a satisfying wrap-up.The main character, Precious Ramotswe, runs the titular organization with only the help of a secretary. It's no mean feat for her agency to be number one, since it is the only ladies' detective agency in Africa. Competition is slim but when she opens up shop, she discovers that demand is high. People all over the city are in need of feminine detective work. No one expects a female private investigator, though a little girl who she is trailing for her father spots her while being followed.Precious is a remarkably appealing character. We are given her background history in rich detail and it explains quite well why she feels and thinks the way she does. She's had it rough and wants nothing more than everyone else to have it much easier. She is trying to change the world for the better. And best of all, she has a tremendous wit. Her methods for solving problems and dealing with difficulties utilize both ingenuity and comical deception. She pretends to be a witness to an accident, a nurse, a seductress, and a policewoman on her separate investigations. She gets to shoot an alligator between the eyes as well as demand a blood transfusion to prove the identity of a parent. Within the context of the story, these unexpected twists are jarring and highly memorable.The persistence of one of her friends, Mr. Matekoni, to get her to marry him is hilarious and makes for a funny, unexpected ending. It shows her iron will throughout the book and lets the reader into her head about her true feelings and why she feels compelled to lock some of her emotions away. Precious is deeply textured and her actions are never predictable.One funny, involving mystery after another plus characters with genuine heart make this a real winner. Smith's Agency is number one, all right."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"It took a few weeks for me really to get into this book. For me, it started slowly, but then I began to love the descriptions of Africa as much as the gentle mysteries that move this book along. The best proof of the book's general appeal is that I have given away at least a half dozen copies and have received warm thanks from everyone. It is a marvelous book and its episodic aspect makes it well suited to reading aloud."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is truly one of the most remarkable books to come out in recent times. Though the storyling is far from ground-breaking, the brillianty penned story from McCall Smith sets up the series of books perfectly, and will ensure you want to read on to the next book.The story follows Precious Ramotswe, an independant, philiosophical and very patriotic lady from Botswana, who sells some cattle she receives from her father after his death to set up a detective agency-'The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency'. From beginnings which include an abusive husband as a young woman and a father of whom she is immensely proud, she emerges a strong and well respected woman determined to become Botswana's first female detective. Hiring a secretary and setting up shop, the heroine begins the uphill battle. Her first cases range from a doctor with two personalities to a missing person, and Precious finds herself having to apply her strong morals to many of her work situations.What makes this such an amazing book is the character. Alexander McCall Smith truly breathes life into Precious Ramotswe, presenting her philosophical outlooks, high ethical standards and opinions on all things from Western culture to the everchanging state of her beloved Botswana. McCall Smith has created one of the most memorable and beloved characters in modern literature, and it is nothing short of amazing just how well he has stepped inside the mind of a 30-ish female from Botswana.This book really is everything you hope for. Incredibly funny in parts, moving in others and very reflective and thought provoking at times, it is any book lovers dream, and Precious Ramotswe has earned her place as one of literature's great characters. I simply cannot reccommend it or the other books in the series highly enough."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books are great! They read quickly, and they are an excellent way to escape to a far away place without too much effort! Although the first book features a number of smaller cases, Tears of the Giraffe (book 2) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (book 3) focus on larger cases that aren't solved as quickly, easily keeping your interest for the length of the book.It isn't necessary to read the books in order, either. The author does a great job of filling in pertinent details as he goes. I would recommend reading the No. 1 Ladies Detective before reading the other books though. Important details about Mma Ramotswe's life are disclosed in the book, and those events are often referred to later in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only female private investigator, should probably have called her agency \\"No. 1 Lady's,\\" since she's its sole operative. But apart from that grammatical slip, she doesn't miss a trick. A \\"traditionally built\\" (read: stout) person creeping up on 40, she decides to enter this field with the money she gains from the sale of her father's cattle after his death. With little more than a desk, a telephone, a typewriter, a small white van, her cleverness and common sense, her loyal secretary Mma Makutsi (who graduated the Botswana College of Secretarial and Office Skills with an average grade of 97%), and the occasional assistance of her good friend, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, she solves cases that range from a freeloading con artist who has tricked an honest woman into believing he is her father, to the abduction for sinister purposes of a young boy by native witch doctors--who have a connection to a very prominent citizen.Smith clearly knows the country and people of which he writes, and succeeds in giving his story a lilting, lyrical flavor that makes the reader feel almost as if she is listening to a story being spun by a native tale-teller. This first of the series bodes well for volumes to follow."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"First published in Edinburgh, Scotland, this initial work in Alexander McCall Smith's detective series is guaranteed to capture the attention and attachment of an international audience. With the animated and ardent Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's very own original ladies' detective at the helm, Smith takes his reader on an unforgettable expedition through the African outback and into the hearts and lives of its citizens.A &quot;fixer of lives,&quot; Mma Ramotswe is a specialist in the ways of men, a rabid hunter of all things fishy and uncertain, and a personal confidant for the people in Gaborone, the largest city in Botswana and site of the only detective agency for ladies in the country.In his entrancing detective novel, Smith reveals the interesting and unexpected ways that traditional methods of detection must be altered and adapted to fit the singular and distinctive culture that is Africa. To solve the crimes and situations she confronts, Mma Ramotswe must rely heavily on her remarkably keen sense of humanity, intuition, and sharp intellect. In doing so, the reader also learns a good deal about the physical, political, and social landscape of this small African country and the larger continent.In contrast to the hard-boiled detective of most mysteries who hardly take time for coffee, Mma Ramostwe knows and acknowledges the importance of even the simplest life-sustaining rituals. &quot;She stopped. It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on. Pumpkin.&quot; (81) Like Mma Ramostwe, the people of Botswana are concerned with the business of life, and in her practical, perceptive way, Mma aids her fellow countrymen and women in this essential pursuit of happiness.In sharing Mma Ramostwe's stories, Smith delights the reader with a rare glimpse of humanity in all its radiance and unembellished truth."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A glimpse into modern Botswanian life seen through the eyes of a woman.

It's a light, comfortable, easy read I would feel good about putting in my child's (teen) room for the summer or taking to the beach for something quick. However, it was too light for me. No plot, short, poor dialog, very little depth to the characters. The author would start to touch on the charm of Africa, then simply abandon it in search of a story that never seemed to take hold.I am pleased to have met the charming main character, however found I could have put the book down at any time without feeling the loss.

Please keep them coming!!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The title of this book called my attention so much, I bought the book in the spot. What a wonderful surprise it was. I immersed myself in this story. Precious Ramotswe is a charming character that will take you for a trip you won't forget. This is one of those unique books that let you really feel the characters and the culture where they live, just by the way they act and think on their every day life. I went into the internet and researched the country of Botswana, so I could enjoy the book even better. Mc Call Smith has a wonderful way with words. I marked two or three pages during the reading of the story and found myself going back to reread them. Only this kind of writer can make one truly enjoy reading something as simple as a character waking up in the middle of the night to have a glass of water. Wonderfully written to the smallest detail and with so much good humor too! Is a detective story so of course most of the mysteries are resolved in a satisfactory way, and if they aren't be ready for a good laugh. Definitely recommend this book and can't wait to read the next one in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I appreciated this story because it was a quick read, easily comprehended, pleasant and entertaining. It was fun to watch Mma Ramotswa reasoning her way through her investigations as a rookie private investigator with no previous sleuthing experience. And given the apparent perceived gender inequalities in Botswana, she navigated the waters of gender prejudice quite well.However, a couple aspects of the story were difficult for me to get past. My first hang-up was the predictability of her investigations. In most (but not all) of the cases that arrived at her agency, the apparent (and inevitably final) solution to the mystery was fairly clearly obvious before she ever got close to solving it. Most notably, the eventual solutions to the situation of Dr. Patel's daughter's activities, the case of the outstanding/inept doctor at the hospital, and the missing finger at the machine shop were quite obvious as soon as the complainant laid out the case to Mma Ramotswe.Secondly, there were some unreal aspects to Mma Ramotswe's investigative activity that even a fictional novel could not allow for. For example, the surveillance activity conducted by Mma Ramotswe of her investigative suspects. As a single individual she was able to conduct effective surveillances of her subjects without ever \\"getting made,\\" and only infrequently did she lose her subject. In real detective work, it can be exceptionally difficult to effectively follow the subject of an investigation with a single vehicle. Such a surveillance technique would typically result in losing the subject in heavy traffic, at stop lights, etc. Following a vehicle in lighter traffic runs the risk of discovery, effectively tipping-off the subject that they're being followed.Finally, it's quite apparent that McCall-Smith is a big fan of Botswana, but I found the chapters and deviations devoted to Botswanan life, culture, etc, a bit distracting. I found myself wanting to get on through apparent reflections of African life and the author's musings of life in Botswana, to Mma Ramotswe's next life saving adventure.I realize these are probably minor criticisms and shouldn't detract from the overall pleasantness of the story, but I personally had a hard time getting past them. That said, I would recommend this story if one is in the mood for a quick, simple and not particularly involved or complex group of short mysteries. I would also continue to the next books of the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What can I say. McCall Smith is an extraordinarily good writer. Even if you don't go for detective stories, this will captivate you with the descriptions of Botswana and its people. Every one of his books, no matter where they are set, whether in Botswana, Edinburgh or Germany, are absolute gems. It is a pleasure to read a well-written, interesting, funny and informative book, and McCall Smith manages to write them!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I wish there were more books written this way. I love the story and love the entire series. I've read the entire series and can't wait for the next book to come out. This is a relaxing enjoyable read with no violence, profanity or sex. A welcome change these days."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you're looking for Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, or Patricia Cornwell here, don't bother. This book is as much -- or more -- an extended excursion into the mind-set of Africa and especially of its female population as it is a set of sleuth puzzles. It's hard to believe that this book was written by a Scottish male. It's also a very rich and rewarding socialogical study of life in what the author considers to be one of the most successful post-colonial nations in Africa. It is episodic -- a series of cases rather than one single extended case -- and there is so much time spent on the background of the protagonist and the lifestyle of Botswana that the avid mystery fan is likely to be quite frustrated. But it is a story with its own wonderful rewards, a singularity that should be judged on its own merits rather than how it may fit into an established scheme."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm a High school student in California. The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency was my book club book, so I read it. First time, it was not that fun or interesting to me. Because, I expected serious cases such as murder. However, chapter by chapter, I realized that the author wants to show something to us such as the women independence or the common but important struggles between person and person. And he shows to us the processes of solve the cases which we should know. Also the book shows that many weakness environments in Africa but also it tells us that they do their best to live and be happy. The background of this story is Botswana which is located in Southern Africa. It is not that much developed however, that country, is really peaceful and clam. Even that makes me want to live there. Mma Ramotswe is really powerful and independent women in the story who is the main character. She lost her mom when she was very young and unfortunately, she also lost her baby when her baby was got born. But he emphasizes that even Mma Ramotswe who has the sad backgrounds she can be the No.1 in the Botswana by her own business. I really recommend this book to you. It can make you happy and warm."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After reading a lot of good reviews -- and having a friend recommend the book as well -- I was expecting much more than the book delivered. First, the book isn't a \\"detective\\" book; second, the cover blurb says the main character is \\"put in danger\\" and that never truly happens; third, I guess I was looking for a little more insight into the culture of Botswana in the vein of Tony Hillerman and that was not supplied either. The writing is good but the hype leading up to my getting the book certainly led me to expect something totally different. Hence, I have to rate this book as \\"Average.\\""},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Absolutely delightful! I agree with all the others who left five stars for this book. When I read a series I always try to read them in order. I was tempted to buy the last book in the series at an airport bookstore. When I realized that there are six or seven earlier books I put the book back on the shelf, but made a mental note to buy the first one later. As I was reading this book I liked it so much that I ordered most of the books in the series. I think if you read the first book first you won't be disappointed as others have suggested. You'll simply want to read more. I just finished the second book, \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" and did find it even more enjoyable than the first. I started the third book, \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" last night and am already sucked-in. So far, \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" books have filled my heart with quiet joy. I am going to give all the books to my mother who I think will adore them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In an attempt to better my reading girth, I've been tackling well-known, well-written books this summer. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was such a happy surprise. I learned lessons about simplicity, joy, and human decency while being carried along by a beautifully written story. The prose is sparse but effective and the voice is one of the best I've read. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Have you ever wanted to do something--a career move, a hobby,a change in your life--and no one thought you could do it? You knew you could. You wanted it badly, but every one around you gave you no support, not your friends nor your family. That would be what Precious Ramotswe encountered in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.Highly intelligent and pleasantly plump, Precious lived in Gaborone, the capital city of the African nation of Botswana. Her father had left her a nice inheritance. But what would she do with it? Open a detective agency of course. She has no experience or potential clients, but she has \\"a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, and an old typewriter.\\" And don't forget the secretary.Precious, or Mma Ramotswe as she is referred to, uses her hunches and ends up helping people, sometimes with hilarious results. She does, however, also face dangerous situations with boldness.Life handed Precious Ramotswe a few curve balls. She refuses to feel sorry for herself and does what she wants to do with her life, no matter what her culture dictates. The reader will cheer Precious on and find inspiration from this character's no-nonsense methods."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was, for me, a sublime and surprising pleasure.The characters are full of warmth and humour. The Precious Ramotswe character, in particular, is a relevation. The prose is simple yet effective and achingly beautiful; at times, the words almost leap off the page. The vignettes, while perhaps at times a little too heavy on the morally instructive side, offer wonderful insights into the human condition. And McCall Smith's passion for Africa, especially Botswana, shines through.I read the book in a couple of hours, yet it has stayed with me for days.The best book I have read this year."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you find yourself needing a little uplifting relaxation and a fun read, pick up a copy of Alexander McCall Smith's The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, the first book in the overwhelmingly series. A perfect break from an overdose of too many noir crime novels!The story tells how Mma (aka Precious) Ramotswe struggles to get the only detective agency run by a woman in Botswana off the ground. Smith, a native of Zimbabwe, intermixes several story strands, including Mma Ramotswe's back story. She deftly solves mysteries large and small without violence or high-tech equipment. Smith uses the stories to take the reader to a little bit of southern Africa.A very enjoyable read. Often compared to Agatha Christie with some justification, Mma Ramotswe is a worthy and wise fictional character in her own right. She narrates her own tales with a delightful light and commonsensical tone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first in series of mysteries that take place in Botswana. It's good to start with volume one because you learn about Mma Ramotswe's father and how she came to set up her agency. (Her father's mining career was a particularly interesting chapter.)You learn about life in Botswana through what might be garden variety detective cases. Botswana, like places everywhere has worried parents, suspicious spouses, and employers who sometimes need a detective. In addition, Botswana also has crocodiles and witch doctors.It was an enjoyable read. The books in the series have interesting titles. I will try one that appears to focus on one case."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I agree with many that this novel shouldn't be catagorized as mystery. It is far too literary to be pure mystery. Since finishing the book, it has taken me a while to decide whether I liked it or not. This is my favorite type of book, one that doesn't leave me at the last page, but forces me to think about it long after."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have to admit that I didn't really expect to like this book (or the others in the series). This is the type of book that reviewers describe as \`delightful' and \`charming' and \`wonderfully witty'. I usually prefer crime fiction that is \`gritty,' and \`violent,' and brimming with \`dark twisted humor'. But I have come to appreciate the simple pleasure of the Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency.These books are classified as mysteries which can be a problem if the reader is expecting to read an actual mystery. This novel does include a fair amount of detection (not much mystery and very little violence) however later novels in this series appear to abandon crime solving altogether, focusing instead on the everyday lives of the central characters.These novels are a pleasure to read and are certain to make you smile, but they lack substance. This particular novel reads like a series of short stories strewn together. Mma Romotswe solves her first cases quickly with the exception of the principle case in the novel (concerning a kidnapped boy), a case that she works on intermittently thoughout the novel. Mma Romotswe makes some huge leaps in logic to solve this case. The thin bit of evidence she does find (by luck rather than deduction) leads her to a man who may have kidnapped the boy but in the end it turns out that the evidence wasn't connected to the crime at all, making Mma Romotswe's deductive reasoning something of a fluke.Of course, this novel (and the others in the series) aren't really about solving crimes. They are about life in Botswana and the lives of the people in Mma Romotswe's life. Smith tells a story that is charming without being overly sentimental. This novel may not be dark and twisted, but it isn't syrupy sweet either. Personally, I could have done without the chapters focusing on Mma Romotswe's daddy and his life in the diamond mines, which felt like it belonged in a separate book, but all in all, these novels (and this one in particular) are simple pleasures to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I fell in love with Precious Romatswe and her beloved Botswana. Mr. McCall's prose is a wonderful blend of humor and wisdom."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the first book in Alexander McCall Smith's extraodinary series, the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency in which Precious ramotswe sets up her detective agency using the inheritance from her adored father. While the subsequent books in this series, I feel, are lighter and perhaps deal with less weighty themes, this first book has some very unpleasant issues in the story lines. Ones I found personally depressing, but also felt leant a note of pathos and depression to the story.The classic episodic writing smith uses is perfect for this type of book. Each Chapter deals with a case, or part of a case. It reminds me of Dickens writing which he used to publish week by week in the papers. I think Smith has published some of his writing like this. The writing is personal and Precious Ramotswe is a fully rounded character - the language is gorgeous too. The syntax and vocabulary is so reminiscent of the Africa and Botswana.However as I said, I found the themes mostly disturbing - while some cases were small and their resolution simple (wayward daughter of an Indian businessman, Philandering husband, and putative father) the background to Precious Ramotswe's short marriage to the Note and the death of her child I found devastating. It was simply written, but very bleak and felt out of character to what was relatively light. The other dark theme was Muti - that is murder of children for witch-doctor medicine. It was grim. And Precious reflects on this herself at times that life is a cycle but it does not mean you have to ignore things which are not right.Precious is honest, reflective and decent - even if she is unorthodox. I felt the later books in the series allow her to be happy as well as a fully rounded person. In this I felt too much pain for her.Personally I wouldn't recommend starting the series of No. 1 Detective Agency books with this one, even though it is the first. The rest of the series is much more enjoyable, come back to the first book once you love the characters."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I absolutely love this book. Alexander McCall Smith is long overdue - he is such a change from the usual fictional writers who are out there today. Mma Ramotswe is such a great character for starters. She is kind and intelligent, and a very far cry from the more typical mystery detectives. She takes her time, and often solves cases with pure logic and common sense. It's a relief to read a book about honest, normal people, and a relief to discover that a mystery novel can be written without anybody being murdered and can still be interesting. The setting itself makes the stories astounding. Smith can describe Africa and show you there is more than third-world countries and poverty. Read this and see that not every country in Africa is riddled with war and hatred. And that not every African is uneducated and poor. Smith shows the beauty and the ugliness, and leaves me at least wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had to buy this book for a reading class I was taking in school. At first, I was under the impression that it would be extremely dull and packed full of political propaganda. Typically, books that focus around African countries are so full of political jargon that it's impossible to enjoy, even if the plot is brilliant.This book is NOTHING like I thought it would be. The author's style of writing is wonderful. The humor in this book isn't direct, you won't find the characters cracking jokes with one another. The humor in this story mostly inferred in random statements throughout the book.I really enjoyed it, I couldn't put it down, and I finished it long before I had to (which caused a few problems on those weekly tests!)I highly recommend it! It would be a great book to curl up with during the summer."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a great read and a great escape from the usual, predictable novel. This was a Christmas gift from a friend in Scotland and I thanked her for introducing me to a new author.I have ordered the following 3 books and plan to savor them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"At first, I was not sure if I would like this story but I ended up loving it. It was a very easy read and I fell in love with the character of Mme Ramotswe. This detective story has alot of heart and there is really good advice in it also. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a light hearted, good read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have really enjoyed this book very much and am looking forward to reading the author's other ones as well.Mma Ramotske, a very intelligent African woman always had her ambitions of starting a detective agency, rare for a woman in Africa. So with a little money left by her deceased father, she opened up the agency in a small storefront. Business begins slowly, but as she becomes more well-known, she has some interesting cases to solve.One of her main cases is about a boy who had vanished from his home for no reason; and Mma Ramotske works on solving the case piece by piece.She also uncovers a con-man in the story, as well as the discovery of a missing husband.I highly recommend the book-it's very difficult to lay it down."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Set in Botswana, the heart of Africa, where culture and lifestyle are concrete values to the natives, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency portrays a melodious, yet suspenseful and engaging, life through the eyes of Precious Ramotswe. Mma Ramotswe was born into a world rich in relationships and pride, with the viscous backdrop of African culture. The story creates a theme of the ironic turns life takes, shown through Mma Ramotswe's wholesome wont to assist people as best she can with the problems they encounter by opening The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The story fleshes out a heartwarming take on life, made all the more so by Ramotswe's persistence towards setting things right, her values, and her all-around embrace of life.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency would be placed under the \\"slice of life\\" category; a taste of the situations Mma Ramotswe finds herself in as the only female detective in all of Africa. As the reader becomes more in tune to the accepted ways and ancient traditions of the locals, a theme is perceived of the degradation of women and the alleged superiority of men, and how Ramotswe contradicts the stereotypical housewife image. This is, with out a doubt, a story that shows how women can change the world just as effectively as men can.Also, Ramotswe's character traits seem to gradually land the reader in her world; little things she does -- like always making bush tea, going shopping at the local market, and her approach to spying on people on the job -- they're minor characteristics, but they are what give the reader a sense of intimacy with her character, as if she's an old friend.Mma Ramotswe's story deals with the mystery and suspense of her job, which is heavily infused with African culture and the mellow people who live by it. Women's empowerment is reflected, and Ramotswe's personality is so well elaborated upon, the reader almost begins to picture her reaction to certain completely separate events. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency keeps one interested with each diverse case that explores a different dimension of life, and once all of its pages have been turned, the reader is left asking for more."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - the characters, the mysteries, the clever and surprisingly non-convulated problem-solving approach by Mma to helping her customers. As a former resident of Botswana, this was nostalgic for me and a wonderful portrait of a welcoming, complex, beautiful country and its people. Hurray for something so different, so human - highly recommeded."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Bravo, Mr. Smith, for creating such a delightful character in Precious Ramotswe. A plump divorcee in her early thirties, Mma Ramotswe decides to open the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in her small village near modern Botswana, using the inheritance left by her loving father upon his death. The unconventional act itself of creating a detective agency, when she has no experience or qualifications other than her calm self-assurance and determination, right away conveys the message to the reader that we're dealing with a special woman worthy of respect and affection. Using instinct and good old-fashioned common sense, Mma Ramotswe solves one case after another. In the process, introducing us to colorful characters in interesting circumstances, sometimes comical, sometimes horrible.The setting only increases the book's lure. Smith describes Africa with great love and reverence. Seen through the eyes of Mma Ramotswe, the beauty and mystery of Africa vividly appears in the mind. I found myself feeling almost ashamed of the self-imposed hectic life I lead in the sterile corporate world, constantly striving to attain bigger and better yuppie toys like leaf blowers and snow mobiles. I cheered Mma Ramotswe's scolding of people like me who fail to notice the beauty of our surroundings or to appreciate a good bowl of stew and a long chat with a friend while sitting on the porch watching the sun set.A refreshingly original story, simple and sweet. I can't wait to visit Mma Ramotswe again."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's novel The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, set in Botswana is a thrill to read. The characters capture your heart, especially the lady detective, Precious Ramotswe. The history of her life growing up in Botswana, and that of her father are as engaging as the mysteries she solves. A brave and cunning woman, Mma Ramotswe and her adventures make for a great read.

Then a friend told me about a recomendation from Amazon and lent me the first of this new mystery series. It is wonderful and just what I needed after my post Moosepath let down.

Not exactly a mystery, but rather, a chronicle of the activities of a private detective, complete with fascinating information on Africa, the book is refreshingly different from your average mystery. Mma Ramotswe is just a lovely character--a smart, no-nonsense fat woman who isn't ashamed of being nosy and who starts the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. She goes from case to case, helping people, making liars confess, tracking cheating husbands, wayward daughters, and, in one particular case, a fake Daddy. The book is witty and beautifully written in a simple, very readable, flowing prose. I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had the enormous pleasure of meeting the author when he came to Cambridge - and a more deserving, utterly nice, and hilariously funny person you could not find! He was every bit as funny in real life as his novels are wonderful: and it is great to see positive stories coming out of Africa for a change. My wife and I have not only all his Botswana books but the equally funny new series satirising academic life that he has just completed - all of them are compulsary reading in these troubled times in which we live.

The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was so intriguing with all the different detective cases Mme Ramotswe had to deal with. Each one more mysterious than the one before.Mme Ramotswe is a remarkable character whom is able to stay calm at all situations. She is cool, and extremely astute in solving her mysteries. Plus, she is not like other women main characters. Instead of being beautifully thin, she is fat. Instead of being blonde and white, she is African. And instead of being in her 20s and drive a fancy car, she is in her late 30s and drives a big white van. Even with these traits, she was able to get 4 proposals in the book. She is quite the inspirational character with all the things she was able to overcome, such as miscarriage, an abusive husband, etc...and shows women that they can do whatever they want even in a &quot;male-dominated&quot; society (even make a detective agency).That is why I give this book 5 stars. It's fully entertaining with some jokes as well.Read it. You will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I know.

This is true...I read it through once and then immediately read it again...the language is beautiful and I liked the twists. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK 100 PERCENT and I'm going to buy all the sequels tomorrow...so I'll have some guaranteed good reading on the plane and on my two weeks in Europe...

It was fun and well paced. It was easy to put down and pick right back up again, which is especially important if you are a mother of small children and have to steal away to read in small moments.I agree that there were some editorial errors as mentioned in other reviews, but I found them easy to recognize and move on. The errors didn't really deter that much from the story or, more importantly, the place the story takes the reader.After finishing the book in no time at all, I found myself eager to buy the sequels. I would recommend this book simply for the wonderful whit and observation of Mma. Romatswe and the simplicity of reading a good old fashioned detective novel."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I bought this book because of a review I read in a magazine...can't remember which one.Now, I have all the books in Alexander McCall's Smith's series about Precious Ramotswe, proud owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana.Unlike some reviews here, I can find no fault with the books. I agree they are not complex who-done-it thrillers, but Precious Ramotswe does not lead a thrilling life. She lives at a slower pace, more in tune with nature and her intuition than those of us in western civilization. The mysteries she solves are not that difficult, but she takes great pride in her professionalism and treats each client with great care and compassion.I particularly like the way I feel when I read about the daily happenings in Mma Ramotswe's life. I like reading about her house on Zebra Drive; her bright secretary (who scored 97% at the Botswana Secretarial College); her companion Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni; her life growing up as the beloved daughter of a devoted father who left his life's work to her so she could open her own business; her disastrous marriage; and the variety of people who seek out her professional assistance.Some reviewers have compared Mma Ramotswe to Miss Marple. I guess the comparison fits, but it seems to me that Mma Ramotswe would prefer to belong in a category by herself....the first female private investigator in Botswana.If you like the Jan Karon series about Father Tim and his beloved village of Mitford, then you might want to give The No 1. Ladies' Detective Series a try.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A very simple, easy to understand story about an African lady who becomes the first lady detective in the region. The story starts off a little slow, however, after the first 60 pages or so, it gains pace. Though, it is quite a peaceful read, really. Mma Ramotswe has been depicted as a very strong woman and yet there are instances in her life, when one can sense how weak she must have felt. Especially the time when she loses her baby. The story is set in Africa and it was quite interesting to me, just to imagine how it must be in Africa. (Would sure love to visit Africa sometime!)There is quite a bit of humor in the story, which I didn't expect I would find--- pleasant humor! Obed's character is a very strong one too. Once again, a very simple character. I think the highlight of this story is simply its simplicity. A good read."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I picked this little tome up at Sam's and have now ordered the rest of Alexander McCall Smith's books on amazon.com, eager to keep reading.What a pleasant surprise, Mma Ramotswe is! And such a treasure with her choice of life as a lady detective in Botswana, of all places! And how poignant the tale of this mid-thirties lady of size, a fat lady at that. And how beautiful this tale of her life, her father, her heritage, her love for her country, of Africa.There is humor here, surprising and refreshing morality, quiet strength and beauty in humanity. There is acceptance of one's ways, customs, nature, life, and a peaceful existence with the curious little adventures via a quiet detective style for a change.This book is a feel good and make you smile book, a book to refresh one's hope in mankind and in the serenity of a culture much slower and calmer and more at peace with itself.The curious manner of business, complete with bush tea, or coffee on the verandah of the President's Hotel, or a journey in a little white van, with politeness and strength from an African woman who knows who she is and is proud of it, this is a detective as special as any Mrs. Marple: delight awaits you in these pages.If you like the PBS series of Hettie Winthrop's detective agency, Precious Ramotswe will be right up your alley, leaving you smiling and ready for more.

This book is really about its characters, particularly the sensible, moral, and very likeable Precious Ramotswe, founder of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. It's also very much about Botswana--\\"a place of peace\\"--with its kind and caring people, acacia trees, deadly snakes, and limitless blue skies.

I was sorry to come to the end."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I was looking for something more like an Agatha Christie or M.M. Kaye when I picked up this book. In contrast to those books, this had little-to-no suspense. The characters are warm and the setting is interesting, but the book reads more like a series of short stories about Botswana and its people rather than a mystery. In themes, it's sort of a cross between &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and a Harlem-renaissance book called &quot;The Conjure-Man Dies&quot;, but much less interesting than both. I finished the book, there were some amusing vignettes, but overall it leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma.

She gets the answer in a most ingenious way and this opens the door to more cases, including the disappearance of a young boy and a sinister mystery in the form of a small bag of human bones...As you weave your way through the story you meet a selection of wonderful characters like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni the owner of Speedy Motors who is sweet on Precious, and Mma. Makutsi, the cleverest secretary in Botswana, she scored 97 percent on her secretarial exam and now works for Mma. Precious Ramotswe, serving bush tea, introducing clients and secretly pinning her hopes on becoming a trainee Private Detective!This book is not what you call an exciting read but this does not stop it from being totally engrossing and enjoyable; in fact if you are looking for excitement it is best that you give this book a miss as you will be disappointed. It is slow an interesting read, with plenty of description about Botswana life and her people, as well as the mystery element of a Private Detective novel.Mma. Precious Ramotswe has been likened to an African Miss Marple, well I am inclined to disagree though I do think she is as clever as Miss Marple, she does not have Miss Marple's ruthless streak. Rather she is compassionate and understanding about the frailties of human nature.In the not so distant past she herself was a battered wife with a short lived marriage to a violent trumpet player who deserted her as well as having the joy of motherhood for a brief few days. Because of this Precious has acquired an acute understanding of what it is to be flawed and full of human desires and like Miss Marple uses her experiences to understand the situations she is asked to investigate. But as I said before the similarities between the two is like chalk and cheese.Well worth the read, but remember don't expect fast cars, fast women and fast men. This is a story about life on the edge of the Kalahari, were life can be both beautiful and harsh.A cracker of a first novel."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a delightful novel..

The characters are not believable."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I belong to a book club and I picked \\"The Ladies Number 1 Detective Agency\\" for our next book. I ordered all the books on Amazon and received them just in time for our meeting. The only complaint I have is that the postage was more than the books, since I ordered each individually and they came from different people."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is light reading that makes you feel like you're actually in Botswana yourself. The main character is very likeable. I look forward to reading the others in the series."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Each mystery encountered by Precious opens a window onto a different aspect of the world she inhabits; it strikes me as a light-hearted version of Carl Mueller's short stories set in Sri Lanka."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had this book sent to my sister in Arizona. I know it arrived in good time, so I assume it all went smoothly. It did on my end!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"While the characters are mildly engaging, the plotlines in this book are rather uninteresting. I found the solutions to the mysteries glaringly obvious, and I am not one of those people who can routinely figure out whodunit by page 15. Precious Ramotswe is a likable but bungling detective who repeatedly gets found out by the people she is supposed to be trailing (yes, I know it's part of the plot, but it's rather irritating). The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as intelligent mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread any Dorothy Sayers novel--except the execrable _Thrones, Dominations_, completed posthumously by another author--for the umpteenth time, than continue following Mma Ramotswe's career."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Not your typical mystery. Not worth all the hype"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Referring to this book, and the entire series by the same author, I was very disappointed. On the one hand, these books are a refreshing change from the barrage of bestsellers pumped out from modern publishing houses in London and New York. You know the ones we all treasure as our 'guilty pleasures.' They are promoted, postered, and sold in airports and in the chain stores of the High Streets and shopping malls of both sides of the Atlantic. We do love to read them on the morning train and at the beach-\`ever more lurid' with their serial killers, roman-a-clef political and entertainment celebrities, packed with murder, death, debauchery, conspiracies and mayhem.On the other hand, however, Smith's \`Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency' series is pretty dull. Is this a question of \`the emperor's new clothes'? It appears to be a sunny, pleasant recounting of basically decent and wholesome \`ordinary' folks. Taking joy in the simple, daily pleasures kind of thing. But as one reads, one's teeth and pancreas start to ache from all the saccharin. His narrative voice simpers. The repetitive rhythm produces a monotone of banality. The characterizations and (forgive the use of the term, the \`action') resembles more the baby talk of a remarkably earnest 10 year-old with special needs, than the voice of poetry and \`simpler times' the author strives for. Hardly worth the eyeball time and minimal brain power required to process this drivel.These books ostensibly convey the charm and grace of a simpler, more natural, and therefore a somehow \`more worthy than corrupt modern us' culture. That is certainly their avowed purpose, and is what at least some literary critics say about the series. That kind of \`PC' and \`diversity sensitive' western thinking is claptrap. Third world, or other so-called \`native' cultural members don't simper, and don't use baby talk as a primary language when communicating within their own language speaking group. It may only appear that way at times when language differences limit and constrain what can be said and heard between such language speakers and native English speakers. Surely an educated person, and one who is supposed to have lived among village Africans for many years, would be aware of that? And would be sensitive to the per force inaccurate depictions of third world cultures that result from depicting such persons solely on the basis of the awkward and frustrating intercultural linguistic difficulties?Perhaps the puerile and monotonous style of these books might still be able to lay some claim as accurate portrayal of African life, that is, if the writer had to record his thoughts on a slab of clay (or some such rudimentary medium), painstakingly etched out with a sharp stick. In such a circumstance, the writer would be forgiven for abbreviating and omitting much of what would otherwise be required for a full and accurate version of daily societal interaction. But such a belabored, stereotyped, and simpering version from someone with access to a word processor, a typewriter, or even a pencil and proper paper is insulting and unforgivable. The stereotyping is subtle, as the intentions are probably inocuous, but the harm to the good people of Africa (and I have met many) will nonetheless further our misunderstandings of them."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Very light reading. I did not draw me in. So many better books out there."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read a lot of reviews of this book that state how gentle and harmoneous it is and it certainly has that dimension too. But I think we could view this book in a slightly different perspective if we were aware of a few facts about Botswana that I think might inform our understanding:++The HIV/AIDS infection rate in Botswana is at 37.3% of the adult population as of 2003 (image every third person you know is either HIV positive or has AIDS), exascerbated by migrant labor - the disease carries an enormous taboo - not generally discussed.++Because of this life expectancy at birth dropped from 65 to 39 years++on every day of the year one woman is raped every 12 minutes (either within or outside marriage)++domestic violence is grossly underreported but recognised by the government as a huge problem - men view it in general as their duty to discipline their wives - a quarter to half of all women are abused by their husbands, 60% of all Botswana women experienced gender violence in the last 5 years.++sexual harassment of girls often starts in grade schoolHow likely is it that Precious Ramotswe would be HIV positive by the time she lost her baby?Each of the above points is hinted at in the book and this did not make it light reading for me. The worst part was that it was hinted at so casually, so matter of factly, as if it was nothing to be concerned about. That's why I found it a most disturbing book.A couple of websites that might interest you:http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htmhttp://www.speakout.org.za/about/aboutrape/aboutrape_botswana.html"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a collection of short stories revolving around the new founder of her own detective agency. The book spends a fair amount of time on local color. The mysteries, if you can call them that, are light weight. There's nothing wrong with any of that, often I want a light read, but there were two big factors that I could not get around that make me give a one star rating.First, the people in Botswana are presented very negatively, and the men are even worse than the women. Maybe most Botswanans truly are self-centered bastards, but I found that too hard to believe. (Even so, I could accept that depiction in a hard-boiled detective book, but this is more of a sunny-side-up book.)Second, the author keeps presenting contradictory pictures of the characters, particularly the main character. In one story she is shown as exceptionally honest, while most other stories show her freely lying. In one story she says she would never commit a crime, and in another story she steals a car. In one story she is attracted to a man who beats and rapes her, in some stories she has no interest in any man, and in one story she is attracted to an apparently nice man. I kept asking myself if the author was trying to make some point by these contradictions, but I couldn't discern any theme and came to believe it was simply poor writing."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a book so simple written it hurts itself. It keeps flowing in one simple direction and never turns back. I thought of it to be a good one but when I started reading this I noticed that the landscape was more important than the works Mma Ramotswe is dealing with, so I am giving this book this rating"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Light-hearted reading. Very cute, very different cadence to the narrative. Enjoyed it. Not a strong plot, especially if you like page turners. This book meanders like a collection of short stories. America-bashing while glorifying Botswana. I guess readers have a love affair with Africa and I think that's why this book gained great reviews.There was a lot of male-bashing, but some good guys too, though expressed more subtly. The characters are entertaining, but again the plotlinein this book is dull. The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread Ellis Peters, Anne Perry, Elizabeth Peters, or Cynthia Peale.The back cover led me to expect &quot;the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.&quot; What?! Where?! The missing boy case was a teensy part of the book, and certainly did not tug at my heart strings at all. There was barely anything made of it at the end. I would have liked to see at least two of the stories to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just read Alexander McCall Smith's novel and enjoyed it, but think it was best suited for high schoolers. It was rather simplistic, and took many shots at Americans unjustly.While Precious Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni may be the kindest Africans around, the crimes and behavior displayed by fellow Africans was not unlike those found anywhere else in the world. I liked both of their characters enough to read Tears of the Giraffe, again their kindness comes through. No marriage yet. I think the author plans to string us Americans along to sell books. He shouldn't bite the hands that feed him by slamming us. Even in the second book on at least four or five different occasions he takes shots at us when it isn't justified.I guess I've had it with Mr. Smith. He should show some &quot;kindness&quot; to his audience too."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer...I'm halfway through and nothing is grabbing me. I'm reading it for bookclub and hate not finishing a book, but this one for me is done. I really like a deeper storyline."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I think this book is a really cool book. I think it is meant for older people though. The book tells about Mma Ramotswe and how she over came her past and looked for a bright new future. throughout the book, many of her cases at the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is described. i would recommend this book for people who like entertainment. it shows many of her thoughts and feelings that are pretty interesting. Hope you enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was a wonderful book. I don't know why I had hesitations about reading it. I read it and I was well-rewarded.Precious is your average African female. Her mother dies when Precious is quite young, and after that she stays with her father.Not knowing what love is she tries her hand at gettingmarried. When that doesn't work out, she goes back to live with her father. He leaves her some money and tells her to start a business. Well, she decides to start the #1 Ladies Detective Agency. Every case she gets is so interesting. I really couldn'tput this book down I absolutely loved it.The book did have many African words I didn't know, and I never found out what they meant, and I ended up referring to people as Mma R or Dr.K,etc. because I just couldn't pronounce their last names.Other than that it was a wonderful book, and I give it 4 stars:)"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"These little books, charming and disarming as they are, are more than a pleasant read. They are chock full of theology. Precious Ramotswe, as human a character as you will find, teaches us the meaning of humility, gratitude, forgiveness and love."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character, Precious Ramotswe is pleasant and resourceful (large and warm like Africa). The other characters are also straightforward and somewhat memorable. However, I struggle the fact that this book is on the New York Times Best Seller list. I recommend Helen Fielding's (Yes, the author of Bridget Jones' Diary)Cause Celeb."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A deightful easy read that will chase away all your troubles. I'm now a great fan of the # 1 Ladies Detective Agency and have read all three books in the series. I hope that there will be many more wonderful adventures with Mma. Ramotswe----soon, now that I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations in 1999 and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Milennium by the Times Literary Supplement, which can either be explained by British sentimentality or British condescension, but not by any special literary qualities. If you're looking for the Botswana version of Miss Read, this is your book. This isn't Inspector Morse transposed to Africa but tales of English village life, and the result is, to say the least, disorienting. Furthermore, the \\"cases\\" that Mma Ramotswe, No. 1 Ladies' Detective, investigates make the Hardy Boys look like Sam Spade. Mma Ramotswe drinks bush tea, not Twinings, but reading this book is like slowly drowning in a weak brew with far too much milk and sugar."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I can think of no better book for someone to read as their introduction to detective fiction. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency combines heart-warming values, love, a spunky female protagonist, African wildlife and every day problems into a delightful social commentary on the dangers and foibles of vanity and wealth. Along the way, there are little problems to be solved, little in terms of Sherlock Holmes perhaps, but not so little in terms of the lives of the people in Botswana.The structure of the book is a little unusual for detective fiction. The main focus is on the life of Mma Precious Ramotswe, a round women in her late thirties with a failed marriage behind her, who starts a storefront detective agency with the money her father left her when he died. Botswana doesn't have any other private detectives, and women usually have circumscribed roles in the society. But Precious knows that women notice more than men, and should make good detectives. Her father had hoped, instead, that she would buy an existing business. Like most new business people, she worries about going broke. She knows that first impressions count, so she buys and spruces up a building . . . and hires a secretary she cannot afford. In the first month, the secretary's salary comes to more than Precious' income.But as time passes, clients come to Precious with their problems. Many are related to concerns about the fidelity of a husband. Two involve missing persons. Another looks at a teenage rebellion. One seems like a psychiatric problem -- a doctor who alternates between being brilliant and incompetent. These cases become like short stories built inside the novel. Each story has a particularly rich African heritage . . . as does the flashback into her father's life as a miner. Precious is a common sense detective. She doesn't use advanced technology. She hasn't had any formal training. But she's dogged and willing to learn, and has an imaginative way of getting to the truth.By her sex, her locale and her heritage, Precious is an underdog. But she's an underdog who was raised with lots of love, and knows a good person when she sees one. By the African standards of her neighbors, she's relatively well-to-do . . . but life is a struggle because of attitudes towards women. Anyone who feels that women can do anything they set their minds to will be cheering Precious on.While this book may not sound cerebral, several of the mysteries (especially the man who disappeared while going to church, the strange doctor and the missing boy) have very sophisticated plot twists and confrontations with key witnesses that remind me of the best of the Perry Mason mysteries . . . except they are set in Botswana.In the background, there's an emerging love interest between precious and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (who keeps her van running smoothly and helps in some of the mysteries) that spices up the book.Anyone who reads this book with an open heart and mind will want to continue with the series.As I finished this book, I found myself thinking about what views we all share today in the United States about what people can and cannot do that are false in reality. Every time I see &quot;disabled&quot; athletes performing tasks that I would never dare to do, I realize that our limitations are in our minds. Dare to do what you were born to do! And lead with a loving heart."},{"Title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"With all the hype surrounding this book, I expected to love it. I didn't. The story begins with a slow narrative about Africa, which is where Mma Ramotswa, the main character lives. We then get a very short anecdote about a case Ramotsaw handles through her detective agency. From there, we get many pages of background information from her father's life, in her father's voice - and her father is already dead. By the time the story got back around to the detective agency, I had forgotten the book was supposed to be about a a female detective. I found the book slow and lacking in focus.
