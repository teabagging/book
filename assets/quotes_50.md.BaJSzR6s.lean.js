The maps in this book, to use a adjective favored by my grandchildren,[are bad]. Prange's prose is dense and detailed and the absence of good maps limits the ability of the reader to understand him.This is a good book -- maybe the best about Midway, the most important battle of the Pacific War. People these days seem to forget that in 1942, Americans were probably more worried about Japan than they were about Germany.Prange tells the story of Midway from both the Japanese and the American side. The insights from military leaders -- now virtually all dead -- make this an irreplacable source of information on the battle. I suggest a new deluxe edition of this book -- rewritten in places to improve the comprehensibility of the prose and with detailed maps, timelines, a glossary of military terms, and more photos of the battle and the equipment in use. I would like to see, for example, photos of the many different aircraft participating in the battle."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"The Battle of Midway was the most decisive battle in the Pacific in the Second World War. Prior to the battle the Japanese had one victory after another. They had put the majority of the American Pacific Fleet out of action at Pear Harbor, they had sunk the British Battle ships the Prince of Wales and the Repulse in a few minutes and they had won naval actions in conquering the Philippines.The Japanese had in their carrier arm a superb weapon. The Zero fighter at that time was superior to any American aircraft. Their naval pilots had been fighting since 1936 in China and were superbly trained.The Japanese fleet which sailed to Midway had four carriers and a huge battle fleet. The Americans had only three carriers available, one the Yorktown had only just been repaired after the battle of the Coral Sea. Logically the Japanese should have won and dominated the Pacific. Instead at the end of the battle all the Japanese carriers involved in the battle were sunk, the cream of the Japanese fliers had been killed and the Japanese started to lose their confidence. As the war developed the Americans were able to rebuild their fleet and to develop technology which meant by the 1944 the Japanese navy was totally outclassed both in numbers and qualitatively.Unlike the European war there have been no real mysteries about the pacific campaign. The conquest of Japan meant that records of all major battles were available from both sides. Never the less this book is a clear well-written account of an important battle. It can be easily understood by anyone and is a delight to read.In short the victories of the Japanese meant that they became careless. The did not do a proper search for the American forces and their carriers were caught with fully armed aircraft on their flight deck. This meant that single bomb hits detonated the weapons of the Japanese dive bombers causing multiple explosions and the destruction of the carriers. A great book of a battle in which American bravery allowed them to win against considerable odds."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"For a guy who has been dead a while, the author keeps turning out some good books. At Dawn We Slept and Miracle at Midway are two of them. Midway was the battle that turned the tide against Japan. Midway is a Battle so exciting that fiction could never top it, and yet this was history. And this book captures the battle brilliantly. Walter Lord also did a great job in Incredible Victory. This battle showed the determination of American sailors and airman, the leadership of Nimitz, the importance of aircraft carriers,some luck and intelliegence. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"I have read several renditions of the Battle of Midway, but this is by far the most intriguing and interesting one to read. The author writes it like a story and draws you in-it was hard to put down. He has many sources and looks at the battle from both the Japanese and American perspective. This battle was probably the most important one we fought in the Pacific. If we had lost, the Pacific would have been Japanese home waters. The only book you need to read about the Battle of Midway."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"Gordon Prange devoted the second half of his life to researching and writing about the attack on Pearl Harbor. He spent seven years in Japan during the occupation collecting material on this operation. He is the author of the book \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" and the screenplay for the film of the same name. His masterpiece on the attack is \\"At Dawn We Slept.\\" He died before he could finish this book and two of his students, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, turned his unfinished manuscript into a publishable book. In the course of his work on Pearl Harbor, he kept stumbling upon material related to Midway. Prange decided to write a book on Midway as well, which was also unfinished at the time of his death. Goldstein and Dillon finished this book as well.The strength of \\"Miracle at Midway\\" is that Prange tells both sides of the story, American and Japanese. He offers more coverage of the American side for understandable reasons. The Japanese commander, Vice Admiral Nagumo Chuichi died later in the war, and valuable records were destroyed when the four aircraft carriers sank during the battle. Prange, though, makes up for these shortcomings with interviews he conducted during the occupation years with a number of survivors and important pilots and staff officers at this battle like Genda Minoru and Fuchida Mitsuo. On the other hand, developing the American side of the story is pretty easy. All the major figures in this engagement survived the war as did their records and written reports.Developing the Japanese side of the story is important, because Prange basically argues that Japan lost the battle more than the Americans won it. The problems the Japanese faced were not the work of any one individual, but rather were large, systematic shortcomings like a flawed battle plan that had two conflicting objectives, overconfidence in their abilities, poor command and control, lack of resources, and sloppy intelligence work. The Americans owed their victory more to luck than any other factor. With those points made, Prange gives a lot of credit to Chester Nimitz for knowing how to use his theater resources, to Raymond Spruance and Frank Jack Fletcher. Prange also argues that Nagumo, who is often seen as being indecisive, made the right decision with what information he had at the time in shifting the armaments of his planes.Luck was what carried the day for the Americans and Spruance admitted as much. The Japanese had little regard for American torpedoe attacks and with good reason. The U.S. Navy had poor equipment and lousy training. It was only Lt. Cmdr. Wade McClusky's decision to use an unconventional search pattern as his fuel was running low that allowed the Americans to pounce on the Japanese at the moment when their ordinance was unsecured and the fighter coverage was too low to stop the dive bombers.The shortcomings of the book are more minor than substantial: the writing at times seems overly flowery. The story builds slowly. When it gets to the sexy parts, the fighting, it really gets going. The maps vary significantly in quality. Some are quite good, others are atrocious and appear to have been hand drawn.To wrap it up: this book is a good sequel to Prang's study of Pearl Harbor. It won't be the last word on the subject, but it is an important one."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"While this is probably the best book on the Battle of Midway I noticed a couple of factual errors. The authors have fallen for one of the biggest myth of WWII in their account of the recovery of a crashed Zero. They stated that American designers tested the rebuilt plane and were able to counter its weaknesses and designed the Grumman Hellcat as a response. Totally, false, design work on the Hellcat and construction of a prototype was well underway by June 1942 and the captured enemy plane had no bearing on the Hellcat's design. This story has been repeated in so many historical works that it is rare to find a book on the Pacific War that does not mention it. Blatant mistakes like this, which can easily be checked, cast doubt on the credibility of the rest of the research."},{"Title":"Miracle at Midway","review":"In this book, Prangue recounts the many converging destinies of the Battle of Midway. For the Japanese, Midway was the focus of the war in 1942. Jimmy Doolitle had bombed Tokyo in April and even though the damage was slight, the thinking in the Japanese military shifted from one of offense to defense. Midway was the crux. Only 1200 mi. from Pearl Harbor, the capture of Midway would allow the Japanese to wage war at will against the US's last Pacific outpost and in turn, secure the homeland from aggression. Admiral Nimitz had but 3 carriers to commit to battle, one of which, the Yorktown, had been heavily damaged in the battle of the Coral Sea but at his urging , had been repaired in a slam bang fashion and commited to the battle. Prangue pays respect to the contribution of luck, cunning and selflessness that so characterises many battles. Nimitz knew that the Japanese were itching for the 'mother of all battles' which would eliminate the US Pacific Fleet. The question was 'where'. That question was answered by the fledgling Naval Intelligence Service which conjured up a way to get the Japanese to show their hand and allow Nimitz to ignore bogus attacks in Alaska and concentrate on the real target, Midway. This book has it all: the arrogance of the Japanese command, the shrewd gambles of the American commanders, the triumph of luck and ingeniuty, the heartbreak of failure that cost the US a carrier, the actual reliqunishing of authority of one American commander to another in the heat of battle because 'it was the right thing to do'. Even the side stories have real meanings. Prangue tells of the loss of a single Zero fighter plane in the faux attack of Alaska. The plane was recovered, analyzed and the result was the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter, which, after many previous failed attempts, was the plane that finally outclassed the Zero and achieved superiority in the Pacific war.

He is also a poet, but when his revolutionary poems are to be published, he agrees to the publisher's wish to revise them and \\"popularize\\" them for the sake of sales. He later regrets this decision. At first an avowed Chartist (Chartists were reformers interested in passing laws helpful to the industrial workers, especially regarding suffrage) Locke later becomes a Christian Socialist. Much of the novel is taken up with political speeches and diatribes against the tyranny businesses use against their workers. Some of that is interesting from a historical point of view, but the work as a novel suffers much because of it. The strangest chapter might be the one entitled \\"Dreamland,\\" where Locke in a dream imagines he evolved from primitive life forms through higher stages to the human form. (It is as strange to the work at large as Chaplin's dream sequence is at the end of THE KID.) Locke dies while sailing to America. More a historical curiosity today, this novel was one of the first in England to deal with working-class conditions."},{"Title":"Alton Locke: Tailor and Poet (First Edition)","review":"I undertook to read this book because an introduction to Mary Barton, the first novel of Mrs. Glaskell, mentioned this book as the first novel of Charles Kingsley and suggested it was worth reading. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading this awful book. The story it tells is really inane, I thought, tho I know one should make allowances for the period in which it was written. But we all know Dickens wrote in the same time period and his works still enthrall readers. I cannot imagine anyone being enthralled by this work. It does not help that Kingsley for entirely gratuituous reasons periodically snarls at what he calls &quot;papists&quot; with obvious bigotry. Towards the end there is a long chapter devoted to telling of a dream Alton Locke had, which I only was able to keep reading because I was determined to finish the book, since I seldom quit reading a book once I have decided, wisely or unwisely, to read it. Unless you are going to write a thesis or something on Kingsley you will be glad you did not decide to read this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA series)","review":"Brian Stanfield and colleagues have written a meaningful book that provides a profound, yet simple method to help groups effectively grapple and address any kind of issue.In the book, they say, \\"For whole systems to operate effectively, information must flow in every direction, up, down, sideways, and diagonally.\\" They go on to describe leaders as askers of questions and state that \\"the participatory principle requires the art of asking questions.\\"Canada's Institute of Cultural Affairs developed the focused conversation method as part of its Technology of Participation, which leads people through certain phases of reflection, enabling them to process their experiences as a group. A leader/facilitator asks a series of questions to elicit responses that take a group from the \\"surface of a topic to a topic to its depth implications for their life and work.\\"The focused conversation uses questions at four levels:1. The Objective Level- questions about facts and external reality. 2. The Reflective Level - questions to call forth immediate personal reaction to the data, an internal response, sometimes emotions or feelings, hidden images and associations with the facts, when we encounter an external reality (data/objective) we experience an internal response. 3. The Interpretive Level - questions to draw out meaning, values, significance, and implications. 4. The Decisional Level - questions to elicit resolution, bring the conversation to close, and enable the group to resolve about the future.The first third portion of the book provides an understanding of the concept of focused conversation and is followed by 100 meeting topics with specific examples of questions at the four levels that would be appropriate.The book has helped me to re-think the types and the order of questions that I address to a group."},{"Title":"The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA series)","review":"I like books that are practical and have real-world application. This book does that. You get 48 pages of enough explanation that you can learn how to use the Focused Conversation model. Then, you get the skeleton of 100 conversations that you can adapt and use. If you want to know more, read on.In the 21st century, those workplaces that share information to create value for themselves and their customers have a competitive advantage. On page 14 Stanfield writes \\"These days most people are tired of blaiming and demanding; they want to solve problems. They want to go beyond input to push an innovation through and take responsibility for making the desired change.\\" The focused conversation model is a technique for capturing the wisdom of a group and helping it become accountable for doing more than complaining or \\"giving input.\\"The model's four parts consist of asking and answering questions. The questions at the \\"objective\\" level begin to uncover facts about the topic being discussed. The \\"reflective\\" questions uncover how the group is relating to the facts discussed in the objective level. The \\"interpretive\\" level allows the groups to discuss implications and options. The \\"decisional\\" level then creates action based on the discussion. This book also contains hints and guidelines for leading focused conversations: what to do when someone gives a long answer, or when people start arguing, or when someone dominates teh conversation...and more.I've used several dozen of the 100 conversations in various work settings. I have gotten especially good value from the conversations on evaluating a seminar, planning a study group, coaching a colleague, mediating a difficult situation, reflecting on a choatic meeting...well, you get the idea.If you're interested in moving toward gathering, processing, and taking advantage of group wisdom, this book provides excellent tools.

This book expands upon the conversation techniques presented in &quot;Winning Through Participation&quot;. The model is simple and useful. When distilled down, a focused conversation proceeds through four stages:- objective / data- reactional / feeling- interpretive / meaning and- decisional / action.The model takes about 50 pages to explain and is followed by about 150 pages of examples of its application.

This book tells the history of the creation of this method, explains its purpose and its parts, tells how to lead such a conversation, and offers 100 sample conversations for specific situations. The purpose of such a conversation is to allow a group of people to process their experience (to experience their experience, so to speak) by asking a series of questions in four different levels: the objective, the reflective, the interpretive and the decisional. This conversation gives form to a natural process which 1) grounds us first in the reality of life, 2) acknowledges the reality of our feelings, 3) looks at meaning based on the first two steps, not on some abstract idea, and 4) moves us into the future from the wisdom just discovered.

Each example, outlines the process, provides the focus questions, and includes Hints, Other applications, and points to remember for each example. I have used this method and it works. I would recommend attending an ICA course in participatory methods to practise the technique in a \\"safe\\" environment before doing this on your own, especially if you are new to facilitation.The strength of this method is a structured approach that doesn't skip over feelings/emotions in the room. Once these are dealt with, I have found the rest runs smoothly. Some practical considerations; It takes longer to do than a 'normal' meeting so plan ahead, try to get everyone there who has a stake in the conversation or will be asked to implement its outcomes, and make it clear to the group what will happen with the information once they leave the room so that expectations are realistic.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA series)","review":"I suppose there are many formulas for directed conversation extant. but this book is the most complete \\"how to do it\\" that I'm aware of. Not only that, the author and his team describe the existential basis for it. The progressive four steps are easy for a leader to keep in mind, but for the method to be effective the participative audience also needs to be aware of the procedure. How to instruct the audience is outlined. The method encourages everyone to put in their say, no one can \\"hide\\" nor does it allow a few to hog the conversation, Wouldn't it be wonderful if politicians would use such a method as this for their so-called Town Meetings!"},{"Title":"The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA series)","review":"While the ORID method is reviewed here, it's presented in an easy to follow, pratical approach.

It has often been said but bears repeating that McCarthy is America's greatest living author, and I recommend his novels to anyone who enjoys beautiful writing. But I wouldn't suggest this screenplay unless, like me, you're already addicted to McCarthy and are looking for another &quot;fix&quot;. It's a short work, fairly expensive for its brief length, and the plot is so sparse that you really have to be a fan of his style to feel as though you've benefitted from reading it. I hesitate to give less than five stars to anything by Cormac McCarthy, but this screenplay is essentially too little of a great thing to merit the unqualified recommendation that I give to all his other books."},{"Title":"The Gardener's Son","review":"I struggle when reading screenplays and stage plays. Every action is dialogue-driven and the stage directions - 'he moves to the window and, a perplexed smile on his face, sets down the smoking gun' - always jerk me out of that state of suspended disbelief I need in order to really lose myself in a story.But then, nobody writes dialogue that is more convincing, more authentic, or more neutral than Cormac McCarthy. He doesn't force or fudge anything. He doesn't judge any character, no matter how vile they may be. It's just \\"this follows that follows the other thing\\" and when it's done you say, 'of course, it does. I'll buy that'. You're left to draw your own conclusions. That, to me, is how books should work.He treats the themes present throughout his oeuvre: injustice, race, family, exploitation, the indifferent universe, metaphysical doubt, human depravity, violence, and - in a theme that I think is central to this story - the elusive character of history. It's all there in \\"The Gardener's Son\\". Quite an accomplishment for such a brief text: an hour or two to read, tops. It'll take you as long to read this review.Following his own discrete economy, McCarthy doesn't waste a word, and here it results in a deceptively simple, linear story, that nonetheless simmers just beneath its surface with motive, context, and endless argument-starters. A layered, complex tale, filled with the paradox and contradiction that arise any time we try and get \\"the full history\\" of anything. But then, maybe after the smoke has cleared, all we have left are the stories we tell one another. The only true way of knowing what really happened. Yet, without the use of his matchless descriptive passages of settings and landscapes both natural and psychological, I found \\"The Gardener's Son\\" to be less satisfying than everything else McCarthy has written.If you've not read Cormac McCarthy before, my advice is 'don't start with \\"The Gardener's Son\\".' It won't give you the best example of what you're up against with this writer. Save it until you've read some of his other work. Accidentally, I've managed to do exactly that. This was my last McCarthy and I'm a little blue right now. Maybe I just need to hear everything again, from the beginning.Now where did I put \\"The Orchard Keeper\\"?"},{"Title":"The Gardener's Son","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who says that you should read McCarthy's books first; that's a must. I found this screenplay interesting, but a bit disappointing in places. Where I detected McCarthy's voice most was in the stage directions and monologues, and a few bits of the dialogue. The power the sysnopses mention was a bit lost on me; I actually found this work quite cryptic, and was puzzled by the flap copy's assertion that the accident was &quot;rumored to have been caused by James Gregg&quot;--I couldn't find even a hint of that. Maybe I missed it?In any case, a good little snippet. Now I have to go back to the novels..."},{"Title":"The Gardener's Son","review":"I've read all that McCarthy's given us so far, about two-thirds of his work twice. This was the last work I got my hands on. I read it in a day, then again in its entirety the next day. I believe it to be my favorite of his plays/screenplays, his best purely dramatic work. Recommended very highly."},{"Title":"The Gardener's Son","review":"This is rooted in a pretty well-worn historical milieu. There aren't really many mill towns left these days (at least not that I know of), but their corruption, greed, and sick, gilded-age paternalism have had some pretty horrible resonances into our own times. Mccarthy does a really good job of conjuring just how primal, how old the sense of economic disparity is here. It's like watching a grim old sepia photograph brought to life. The Gardener's son isn't simplistic, its just blunt, and direct. Even if its character's motivations are just hinted at rather than really delved into. If you've ever worked in a mill town or had some older friends or relatives who have, you'll understand it all too well."},{"Title":"The Gardener's Son","review":"I give it 2.5 but I really didn't think there was much of a story here.

After I wrote my review I began to wonder why the ratings for this book seemed to be all over the place. A number of reviewers stated that they were Hillerman fans but downgraded \`Hunting Badger' because of poor editing. Some of the complaints seemed ill-founded. The story does not tie up all the loose ends - the book's part of a series after all - and sometimes things just do not get neatly wrapped up with all the bad guys in jail and the good guys riding into the sunset.However, one reviewer asserted that a conversation between Chee and Leaphorn concerning coal mine shafts was essentially repeated thirty pages later as if it was a new topic of conversation for them. That comment bugged me. I used the \`search inside this book' feature on Amazon and, lo and behold, there it is on pages 192 and 222, the same basic conversation.That's inexcusably bad editing. I still rate the book highly because for me Hillerman's tales are as much about the setting and the cultural background as it is about solving a mystery. What follow is my original review.The Legendary Lieutenant, Joe Leaphorn comes back out of retirement and Jim Chee gets back from vacation just as a tribal casino is robbed of $400K. What is worse, two off-duty cops working as security guards are gunned down. As is their common motif, Leaphorn and Chee are simultaneously working on parallel tracks in ignorance of the other's efforts, but they come together to solve the crime.Hillerman sets this story in the heart of the Four Corners area, the Big Empty, and by the time I was done I was pining for a trip to the desert canyons. Navajo culture is also interwoven into the fabric of the tale. And Hillerman again creates believable tension between the Navajo and the outside, especially between the tribal police and the FBI.If you are already a Hillerman, I think you will find this work especially enjoyable.If you are new to Hillerman, this book may very well make you a fan. Hillerman has written some 18 Navajo mysteries. Leaphorn and Chee first worked together in 'Skinwalkers' (1986) and did so for four more books before taking a break. 'Hunting Badger' (1999) was their first book back together after about 5 or 6 years. Reading this series in sequence is really not much of an issue, but you may want be aware of the background. Several of Hillerman's books were also made into PBS Mystery episode a few years ago.Highly recommended for fans of the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman seems unable to write a stinker. Another of his books and highly enjoyable again. I am hooked on his series, this is Joe Leaphorn (retired Lieut.) and Jim Chee, working together again and a casino robbery.The case is twisted and full of turns and unexpected clues. What is apparent is not necessarily what is real. Leaphorn gets involved involuntarily, while Jim Chee has to contend with the dreaded FBI (as he points out this is not Full Blooded Indian) There is fraud and insurance scams going on hiding the clues, and at the back of it is the possibility that there is a witch around, a witch whose father Ironhand was also known as the badger - a man who could jump up to the top of the cliffs and down again.Jim Chee needs to sort out his feelings for his old boss, Leaphorn, and try to work with the FBI without humiliating himself.This is both a mystery novel and a personal journey for both Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Hillerman manages to combine the two journeys with ease and class. It is a satisfying read, utterly satisfying mystery too - unexpected yet convincing.If you haven't tried Hillerman's mysteries yet I would recommend them in the highest."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Jim Chee is returning to Shiprock. He is asked by Bernie, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, to find out who was behind a crime. It seems that Teddy Bai, a Montezuma County Sheriff, is being held as a suspect in a casino shoot-out because he functioned as a rent-a-cop at the establishment. There is a belief that he was the inside man.Lieutenant Leaphorn is retired. A Mr. Gershwin calls to ask him for a meeting. Gershwin claims he does not want well-dressed FBI agents to visit his ranch. He says he is willing to give Leaphorn the names of the casino crime perpetrators if his name is kept out of the investigation. Leaphorn wonders if he just wants the three guys to be hassled. He learns that one of them, Everett Jorie used to be tied up with one of the militias. Jorie had talked about flying Navy airplanes on his talk show. (The casino robbers left the scene by flying a plane away from the site.)Jim Chee selects a sheriff, Cowboy Dashee, to talk to the FBI about the casino case. When Leaphorn goes out to Jorie's place he realizes he had been there twenty-five years previously. Checking the house, Leaphorn determines that Jorie is dead. An apparent suicide, there is a note claiming that Ironhard and Baker were involved in the robbery of the casino and the subsequent homicide. Chee learns from his Navajo mentor who is dying that Ironhand is a witch. When people are sick all of their connections are broken.Chee is ordered back to work early from his vacation. He is to participate in the FBI manhunt. FBI man, Damon Cabot, young and recently transferred to Salt Lake City from Philadelphia, is in charge. Ironhand also has the name of Badger. In the Vietnam War, Leaphorn learns, he was a sharpshooter. Jim Chee, considering the name Badger, feels that the men may be hiding in old mining tunnels. The solution to the mystery is surprising and well-written."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Once again, Tony Hillerman uses his excellent knowledge of the ways and beliefs of the Navajo and other southwestern Indian peoples to craft a mystery that is at once engaging and educational. His frequent digs at the lumbering &quot;Federal Bureau of Incompetence&quot; are softened by his revelations of the guys working in the agency, trying to do their job under constant oversight from the politicians and bureaucrats in Washington. But what really makes his work stand out is that his people, good and bad, come across as real people.If you've never read a Tony Hillerman book, this is one you will either love or hate, and if you hate it I pity you. If you're a Hillerman fan, then this is good, solid Hillerman, neither his best nor his least. But then I've never read one of his books I didn't like!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I enjoy Hillerman. I like the weaving of cultural information into fine mysteries. But what was he thinking with Hunting Badger? That no one would notice that he shipped the book to his publisher without completing it? It was the most frustrating Hillerman book I've read. HE NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK. ALL KINDS OF STORY LINES ARE LEFT HANGING. The writing style is classic Hillerman, and wonderfully entertaining, but you expect a story to have an ending! It was interesting that in the promo for his memoir (the publisher should have used the pages completing the story), he refers to a book he wrote that had an inadequate ending. He quotes the publisher telling him &quot;we want to publish it if you can write a better last chapter.&quot; In Hunting Badger, Hillerman should have had as good a publisher."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I am a huge fan of Tony Hillerman's novels, and this one isn't up to par. It lacks the depth and evocative descriptions of Navajo belief, lore and countryside of some of his other novels. The story is rushed and spends way too much time referring to an older manhunt. Chee and Leaphorn are always a pleasure to visit, but if you're looking for Hillerman at his best, try &quot;Coyote Waits,&quot; &quot;People of Darkness,&quot; or any of the others."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony has done it again. As a resident of Northwest New Mexico, Tony's descriptions of the land and his understanding of the Navajo and Ute cultures are unsurpassed! With many friends who participated in the 1999 manhunt having shared their frustrations with me, his fictional search is almost too close to realty. For those who have not had the good fortune of knowing true Reservstion Navajos, Jim and Joe are as good as it gets. Too bad that NDPS (Navojo Dept. of Public Safety)can't hire the real guys. Plan a weekend around this book and tell your friends you are busy!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Having read all of the Leaphorn and Chee stories, I eagerly awaited this one. It is not as good a read as other Leaphorn and/or Chee books but I enjoyed it all the same. I strongly recommend that anyone planning to read this book as their first adventure into solving a mystery the Navaho way, start with one or more of the earlier books in this series. I do enjoy the way this author describes landscapes, people, Native American traditions, and Indian folklore to solve crimes. I have never been to Navaho country but somehow (thanks to the author) it seems very familiar."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"After a series of lesser tales, Tony Hillerman is back with a tale that captures the essence of the a detective who deals in the Native American world. While the amount of new information on the characters is minimal (after all, this is about the nth book in the series), Hillerman manages to find a cultural vein that is new and refreshing. Knowing the Badger is worth twice the priced of admission. Thanks, Tony!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"If we were reading Tony Hillerman for the plots, we wouldn't be sitting here talking. What is great about this book is the maturing relationships of Chee and Leaphorn, their growing ability to be comfortable about themselves, and the possible, successful resolution of their romantic relationships. In other words, we can be grateful that old friends have survived their respective losses and can look ahead. If you like Navajo country, you'll like this, and if you have read all the other books, this is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I wish I could review it.

The attitude of the local police is \\"good riddance\\" since the crime was the jurisdiction of the FBI which only misused and abused local police. The FBI's only suspect is off-duty policeman, Teddy Bye, who was working as private security for the casino. However, policewoman Benadette Manualetto (who has a mutual attraction to Chee) is convinced that Bye is not guilty, and convinces Chee to look into the matter while he is still technically on vacation. In the meantime, Gershwin approaches retired \\"legendary lieutenant\\" Joe Leaphorn with a list of the alleged perpetrators--all local \\"militia\\"-types, but swears Leaphorn not to reveal where the list came from. One of these is Everett Jory, whom Leaphorn later finds dead in his home, seemingly a suicide, having left behind a suicide note on his computer naming George \\"Badger\\" Ironhand, and Alexander \\"Buddy\\" Baker as the remaining perpetrators and suggesting their hideout. That's the setup.COMMENTS ON THE SERIESIn his Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee novels, Tony Hillerman, creates an almost \\"alternate reality\\", a world alien to most readers, but vividly filled with fascinating individuals and intriguing mysteries. The major \\"good guys\\", are very believable, likeable and admirable individuals (despite normal human flaws), who are easy for the reader to become emotionally attached to.COMMENTS ON HUNTING BADGEREarlier Tony Hillerman novels have been very \\"economical\\". That is Hillerman used the minimum words to present a simple straightforward story. In Hunting Badger, I have the feeling that filler (in the form of clever twists) were added after the novel was essentially complete, and the result broke up the flow of the novel. This is the first Hillerman novel in which I felt that some passages were tiresome.VERDICTA very good novel in a series of masterpieces."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Bought the book to replace a library book my dog destroyed.

I read and re-read them (both in print and as audio books). I was glad to see in this book that Jim Chee is getting over Janet Pete and starting to take notice of Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Chee and the retired Leaphorn solve the mystery long before the FBI guys which, of course, is pleasing. And then at the end of the book one of the robbers gets away. Now I need to be sure and read the next book in the series.

The mystery is good and watching retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn work it from one end and Jim Chee work it from another was interesting and enjoyable. The banter in the early parts of the book between Chee and Cowboy Dashee is very enjoyable. The irony of having a white rancher complain to a Navajo about the federal government taking away the lands that his family had lived on for the last 100 years was too much for me - I had to laugh out loud.The audiobook was read superbly by George Guidall and lasts about 6 hours."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"While retired Lt.

I have a hunch there were scenes left out better left in. I am really enjoying the developing characters and relationships. I enjoy that Chee and Leaphorn are actually realizing friendship and really hope to see it become a more solid and personal relationship. I disagree with another reader that Pete and Chee hardly had a relationship. But, it was never an easy one and like many young people it was not the level that should lead to marriage and I am relieved to see it come to this. Chee is exactly the type of romantic young man that would jump to this level in each relationship. I think Bernie is a great character but I hope that he doesn't &quot;fall&quot; for her quickly. I think Chee finally needs a friend first, much as the well developing relationship with Leaphorn and Bourbonette is taking.My burning question, laugh though you will, is HOW DID CHEE GET THE CAT BACK?? I really thought that it would be covered. DId Mary ship him a kitten? Was there another one out there? A cat seems like a perfect companion for Chee but where the heck did this one come from? I suspect, again, that editing fervor chopped out this piece of info. The one other thing that bothered me was that Nakai's revelations to Chee did not seem to have more immediate impact. Instead, seems like that got sidelined (the impact more so than the use of the info).Still, like always a good read. I hesitate to try any other book in the genre Hillerman fathered, because I know I would miss all the little daily, ordinary stuff anyone else would not take time to craft. The slow unfolding of the life is what I love about these novels. Slow but never, in my opinion, boring. I like that. Makes me feel like breathing."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"It was a good read, but nothing really new or exciting. Definitely not Hillerman's best work. It took only 5 hours to finish. It seemed to go by very fast--too fast. So I decided to determine why. In the following comparison, \`normal' is the result of examining two average hardcover novels of 500+ pages. Hillerman's book font size of 10 points is larger than normal (most novels use point size 8); big, wide margins all around, giving a text block size of 4.2 x 6.3 inches (normal is 4.7 x 7.4); 1 blank pages between each of 29 chapter (normal is blank page); 28 lines of text per page (normal is 40, or more) ; average words per line 9 (normal is 12 ); average number of words per page is 241 (normal is 424). Bottom line: Hillerman's book of 275 pages, if it was printed with \`normal' sizes, is about 130 pages, a short story, which is a quick read for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Not as tightly plotted as the other Leaphorn/Chee novels, but still very enjoyable.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I hated for the book to end. It left waiting impatiently for the next one."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Three armed men rod the Ute tribe's gambling casino, and then vanish mysteriously into the desert near the Utah-Arizona border. It looks like an inside job, and the deputy sheriff wounded in the crime looks like he might have been in on it. But when Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee and retired detective Joe Leaphorn start investigating, parallels emerge in this case similar to a legandary Ute outlaw. And \\"helpful\\" citizens look like they may have some hidden agenda or grudge to settle, and it's up to Chee and Leaphorn to get to the bottom of things and find who's responsible. This is of course complicated by patronizing federal agents, who are simply out of their element in tribal lands.Hilleman maintains a good story pace, that doesn't move too fast, as with the lifestyle of the four corners, and yet never meanders or drags. He gives us very human, believeable, and nuanced characters. And he keeps us guessing, yet engages us in Chee and Leaphorn's thinking. While first appearences can be decieving, the reader never feels manipulated. It's a very solid work."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hillerman has created a masterpiece series about Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Navajo detectives working in the wide open spaces of the Navajo reservation in the four corners country of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. But one can see this series beginning to trickle away. Former Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is now a talkative old duffer and maybe he should be retired (with laurels) from the series. Sergeant Jim Chee seems to have given up his ambition to be a Navaho singer and is now fully committed to being a cop. This story was simplistic and superficial compared to others in the series and the climax was flat and unsatisfying. Still, Hillerman at his worst has many virtues. Bernadette Manuelito is a great new love interest for Chee -- far more engaging and sexy than the unlamented feminist, Janet Pete. Cowboy Dashee and Captain Largo were more interesting in this book than in previous appearances. But the well seems to have run dry for Hillerman and Hunting Badger lacks the fascinating descriptions of landscapes and mystical ceremonies of his many previous books in the Navajo detective series. Try another one, Tony! How about sending Chee and Bernie Manuelito -- sans Leaphorn -- down to the Apache reservation in a really dark and enchanting story ?"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger ranks up there with Tony Hillerman's best, and he has written some very good novels so far.

You'll be in the plot almost all the time and also you'll learn something about the Navajo culture.

Other authors do this and you can pretty much jump right in. In the case of &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; I was left clueless regarding some of the characters.Whatever happened to Cowboy Dashee? Jim Chee? Bernie? Primm? Was anyone brought to justice? What about Bai? That was a weird twist for him. Maybe I should have given it a 2 star rating.I loved the story setting and found Mr. Hillerman's writing gave me vivid mental pictures of areas totally foreign to me.

His best work is available for everyone, screenwriters included, to enjoy and to see how brevity and clarity work in any art form.

He focused instead on the inter-relationship dynamics, doing a much better job with the older couple, Joe and Louisa. I felt it was badly proofed and edited poorly. His detective jargon was repetitive and sloppy, making the structure weak. The uplifting spirituality was best during the scenes with Hosteen Nakai, but it felt vaguely empty of feeling. The storytelling with the effervescent Bashe Lady was a great highlight. However, the landscape descriptions needed more intensity, although that remains to be the best part of this mystery. The ending was warm with camaraderie, but the last lines were cliched. I still recommend reading &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; for the continuation of a landmark mystery series. It is second draft of a great novel as this is a second draft of a great critique."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Having once been a big fan of John MacDonald's Travis McGee mystery series due to the settings and locations so familiar to me, I've found a new favorite with the Tony Hillerman crime mysteries and can see why he - the pioneer of this particular brand - has such a loyal readership.The writing is flawless and smooth, the characters are interesting and likable, the dialog is believable and the reading is easy, pleasy and addictive.Settings for the books I've read mostly surround the Navajo Reservation.

In 1999 there was a huge manhunt in the canyons of the Four Corners, which are in the southwest of the United States. They never did catch the two men. Now here they are one year later doing the same thing.Jim Chee is a man of the law, and he worked on the first manhunt in '99 and tries to stay hidden from his boss so he doesn't have to go on this manhunt. When the FBI gets in on the hunt he definitely doesn't want to go to work, because they get all the nice stuff and headlines in the news. Ex-cop Joe Leaphorn sticks his nose where it doesn't belong and comes up big for the case. Leaphorn was Chee's old boss and a good one at that.I really liked this book. If you like mysteries and suspense then this is a good book for you. This is also a very good book for young-adults and older. I would strongly recommend this book for readers who like an easy to read mystery.-Adam"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"In the previous Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn mystery, I sensed series fatigue and thought I would let go, but there was HUNTING BADGER and I thought well, one more time for old times' sake. Unfortunately, except for a strong portrayal of Chee and witty commentary on the FBI, this is tired. Female characters were never Hillerman's strong suit, but here they are mere shadows. There is no clear idea of just who the bad guys are, their characters and motives, though one is obvious almost from the beginning. Leaphorn does express chagrin that he did not see it coming and well he should. Perhaps it was intentional on Hillerman's behalf to build up the idea of Ironman, to comment on the power of legend in contemporary reality, but just letting that story line drop seems like a hurried rush to make deadline. There was another moment, an accident with gender pronouns, a his where there should have clearly been a her, that is yet more evidence of the sad lack of genuine editing skill in the publishing industry today. That said, this book does have Jim Chee, Joe Leaphorn and the remarkable landscape they inhabit, as well as Hillerman's swift, direct sentences. If someone has not previously read a book in this series, I highly recommend beginning with A THIEF OF TIME or TALKING GOD, to get a sense of its true power."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Having lived in Arizona for thirteen years and been up to the four-corners area a few times I know a litttle of the territory Tony Hillerman writes about. But no one writes about it better and certainly no one weaves such perfect stories into the awesome beauty of the Southwest as Tony Hillerman. I've read all the books as they have come out and followed the careers and adventures of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn almost as if they were the friends of a friend and I didn't even like mysteries before I chanced upon these.This latest one certainly does not disappoint; from a running start and with a good pace it keeps you turning the pages, staying up late, reading on your lunch break and wondering if traffic will be stuck long enough to get in a few more pages. It's a good story told by a master storyteller; you can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a &quot;My editors want another book.&quot; piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger is a pleasant, easy read, but it has to rank fairly low on the list of Hillerman's great Leaphorn-Chee novels. Although his previous effort, The First Eagle, got mixed reviews, I found it superior to this one in most respects. One question: Where did Chee find Eldon Timms's airplane? Mexican Water? Red Mesa? I'm not sure he found it at all, even though he's credited by several characters with having done so. Either Hillerman on his HarperCollins editor seems to have dropped a paragraph or two somewhere."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger is a worthy addition to Hillerman's already strong collection of mysteries. Although at the beginning of the book the mystery doesn't seem to be terribly mysterious, the plot twists a few times and is very satisfying by the end. But superceding the plot, and for the first time superceding the Navajo culture, is the character development of the two heros, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. It is high praise indeed that we care more about the characters than about the outcome of the manhunt. It is such a pleasure to follow series characters that progress through life in a realistic way, and Chee and Leaphorn have done so under Hillerman's direction quite admirably. If you've not read Hillerman before this is not the novel to start with, but I highly recommend all the Hillerman stories with these two characters and this is a fine addition to the series."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"If brevity is the soul of wit, then clarity is its heart.

No one is superior to Tony Hillerman in this aspect. He is also making Chee into a more rounded, and likeable, character. Who would have thought that he would take a vacation!I think the book is best read by those familiar with the characters and would not recommend it as a starter for Hillerman. But, I would not want to miss it or wait 5 years for something of epic proportions.I enjoyed reading it with one major exception. Apparently, the publisher relied only on spell check for errors. I cannot believe that this company actually had someone read the book to catch errors. I underlined the mistakes and a quick thumb through the book reveals at least a half dozen. This is frustrating as it breaks the train of thought. It does not speak highly of this publishing company."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Even for a light, unchallenging reading experience, I found this work to be disappointing. On the one hand, the plot is original, with unexpected twists. However, the story is somwhat flat and bland, with weakly drawn characters. Hillerman's much - vaunted knowledge of Native American culture here provides only a superficial gloss.A particular problem is that the book is very poorly edited, and replete with typographical errors and other editing mistakes. For example, main character Jim Chee is referred to as \\"Cree\\"; his love interest Bernadettee Manuelito is referred to as \\"he\\"; we get sloppy mistakes like \\"It you see\\" (rather than \\"If you see ...\\"); \\"Leaphorn had starting (sic) thinking about... \\" What's more, some conversations are redundant with those occurring earlier in the book. A few errors appear to have been corrected in a later edition.Given size of the text and blank pages between chapters, this is at best a novelette. Harper Collins should be ashamed at having published such a brief and unfinished work at the exorbitant price of 26 dollars. Readers deserve much better. However, fans of Tony Hillerman's western novels will not want to miss this work, as it does demarcate ongoing changes in the main characters' lives. Readers new to Hillerman's work are advised to avoid this novel in favor of his earlier work."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"In an Author's Note at the beginning of the book we see the reason for why this book was written. A story from the late 90's that involved a horribly mismanaged search for some cop killers in the Navajo area is the inspiration for this story. To summarize that event - and by extension, this book - a police officer attempting to stop a stolen truck is shot and killed. In the chase that followed, one of the criminals is shot and killed while the other two disappear after they've wounded a few more cops. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Ineptitude - as it is called in this book) takes over charge of the search in the area and after involving 20 different agencies, manages to bungle the investigation and tracking of the criminals so badly that they are never caught. As Hillerman relates, those people who know the local terrain were told to man checkpoints on the main roads rather than use their local knowledge.Hunting Badger is Hillerman's musings on how such an event should have been handled had the local cops been allowed to use their unique knowledge. The twists in the plot are that instead of a stolen water truck, Hillerman has the criminals come in and rob a casino and then disappear. Using his unique vantage point of being able to combine Indian lore with modern drama, Hillerman posits that one of the criminals is a Paiute Indian who is the direct descendant of an Indian that bedeviled the Navajos by leading war parties against them some decades before whom the Navajos believed to be a witch - due to his ability to move from the top to the bottom of a canyon with no visible means of climbing the sides of the canyons.Hillerman weaves in the story the ways in which both Leaphorn and Chee go about investigating the ancient story as well as the modern crime. As background, we see the impact of the Federal Bureau of Ineptitude in their self-important but utterly useless posturing. I was particularly amused by the reports of how the criminal's truck is discovered by an Indian policeman but then the FBI swoops in on helicopters to guard it, and the wind generated by the landing helicopters wipes out the tracks around the truck. Of course, then, the FBI assigns the Indian who discovered the truck the responsibility for guarding it while they swoosh off to fly over the area!No Hillerman story would be complete without the movement forward of the social life of his two heroes. And in this respect, Hillerman does not disappoint. Leaphorn is now retired and his relationship with Louisa is slowly advancing. Leaphorn is not feeling as much guilt about his relationship with Louisa given the past death of his wife Emma. In fact, Leaphorn is becoming less taciturn and more talkative and explains much more to Chee and even Manuelitto of what is going on - giving us a new look at how his mind works and why it works so well in resolving the crimes.Chee is moving beyond his relationship with Janet Pete. She appears in the book only as a cameo. Instead, he now has a new interest in the person of Bernie - a fellow cop who is interested in him enough that she nurses him back to health and Chee starts comparing her to Pete and finds her to be a better fit for him. So, I expect this relationship will be moving forward in future books. Chee's relationship with Leaphorn has also evolved and he is better at reacting to Leaphorn as a person and not so much in awe of \\"the Legendary Lieutenant\\".Like all Hillerman stories, the actual culprits and their motives are hidden initially, but get revealed as you read through the book. There are references to different kinds of militias that are prevalent in the southwest and the problems that they may cause, but in the end, the way the book ends is highly satisfying as the local police force figures out what happened and conclude the investigation.Clearly local knowledge trumps the big budget and importance of the outsiders who come flying in. What else did you expect?"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman scores again with his riveting tale of greed and pursuit in the American West. His descriptions of the landscape of the Navajo reservation are just masterful. The characters are well developed and the story is beautifully crafted as usual.

Hillerman is a great story teller and \\"Hunting Badger\\" will keep you turning pages until the end."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"If you want an action filled story that's full of blood and gore then this is not the book for you.

If you have an interest in learning about different cultures then you will definitely like this book. Even though he usually leaves his pistol in the glove compartment of his pickup officer Jim Chee always seems to get his man. In his spare time he is learning to be a Navajo medicine man."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This isn't his best effort but it is still Hillerman and therefor it is still worth the read. As always, Hillerman makes the Indian country come alive and for those of us who love wide open spaces, we come to his novels for a vacation from our everyday lives."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I find Tony Hillerman so relaxing. His descriptions of the desert this time were not as breath-taking, but they worked. I hear there's a map of sites mentioned in his novels. Some of these descriptions seemed written with the map in mind.Of course, the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn continuing affairs of the heart are fun. I mentioned to a friend that I had just finished the new Tony Hillerman. &quot;Is Jim Chee still in love with the school teacher?&quot; No. Now it's a fellow (sister?) police officer. The lawyer is definitely out.Then there's always something worth reflecting on - and this time it's on page 134, in a conversation with his uncle. While standing in a street, where a Navaho drunk is lying in the gutter, the two men watch as a white Lincoln Town Car driven by a Navaho glides by. &quot;Which one acts like he has no relatives?&quot;It is followed by a discussion on healing. &quot;To cure them, you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it.&quot;This reminds me of Parker Palmer, in the introduction to his book on teaching. He says, more or less, that we teach who we are. It seems that Tony Hillerman is saying the same thing about healing."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Those who love the Tony Hillerman books should really appreciate Hunting Badger. While it is lighter on some of the aspects of Navajo culture that we have come to expect in these books, the strong re-emergence of Joe Leaphorn's character is a welcome surprise. Even in retirement he is giving Sgt. Chee fits. And the introduction of a new love interest for Chee offers numerous possibilities for future stories.What makes Hillerman's books work are these characters and their struggle to live in the modern world and yet not forsake that of their ancestors. This dynamic, which plays a significant part in each of his novels, is what makes these tales something more than average who-done-its. In fact, it is seldom the solving of the crime that is the main focus, but how it is solved. Just as the workings of Sherlock Holme's mind is central to Conan Doyle's stories, the workings of Leaphorn's mind (and the influence of Navajo culture and tradition) play a big part in Hillerman's stories. In this one, the study of Navajo myths and legends plays a big part in cracking the case.I couldn't subsist on a steady diet of Hillerman, but I would hate not to have a new Leaphorn/Chee story each year or so to help me slow down the pace of my life and see, for a few hours, with a different perspective. Very pleasant reading."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Having traveled the Four Corners area a lot the past few years, as I read this book, I could envision all the locations that Hillerman cites in Hunting Badger - Tuba City, Chinle, Window Rock, Farmington, etc. I found myself enchanted and drawn away, driving down those dusty washboard reservation roads, imagining that I was riding along with Chee and Leaphorn as they chased down George Ironhand, Buddy Baker, and Everett Jorie.Hillerman's vast knowledge and familiarity with the geographical terrain and the Navajo traditions that are woven into his novels are a proven recipe for success. Though Leaphorn is still adjusting to his life as a retired Navajo Tribal Police Lieutenant, his sharp mind and investigative skills have not dulled. In Hunting Badger, Hillerman continues Sergeant Jim Chee's progression as a Navajo Shaman, in juxtaposition with his occupation as a police officer, which Chee's grandfather reluctanctly accepts as the way of this present world. Chee also moves slightly out of Leaphorn's shadow, taking on a less subservient role as the retired Leaphorn gives Chee more credit for his ability as an investigator.This novel is well-written from start to finish - several times I found myself following the wrong trail as I tried to figure out whodunit and why, only to be brought back on track by Chee and Leaphorn. Made me want to return to the Four Corners area once more, to look at the beautiful terrain as Chee and Leaphorn would see it.Peace Out."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"For me, the '5-star' book of Hillerman's canon is 'A Thief of Time,' which really had a gripping, suprising mystery, good villians, and a good dose of the Navajo culture/geography descriptions that set his books apart.'Hunting Badger' is, IMHO, a minor work in the pantheon, but extremely readable and enjoyable. It's good to see that as they grow older and more mature, Chee and Leaphorn are finally beginning to develop a relationship that transcends the mentor/acolyte status they've always had and becomes--dare we say it--friendship? Also, it's a relief to see that Chee is finally ditching Janet Pete and opening his mind to a relationship &quot;closer to home,&quot; while Leaphorn is finally acknowledging that there is a life after his beloved Emma. These are the real things that are interesting about the story, plot strands that all radiate from the wisdom of a central metaphor, the death of a central Navajo figure in Chee's life.The mystery itself is pretty routine, and the plot, always secondary in a Hillerman novel to the characters, culture, and landscape, is less important than ever. What ultimately makes this rewarding for long-time fans of the series is the satisfying direction Hillerman has established for future novels."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I've read all of Hillerman's series showcasing Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. I've not been disappointed in any of the stories, including the latest.Hillerman's characters are now so familiar to me that I fall right into their 'Navajo Time' rhythm and feel at home in their part of the world.To me, the plots/crimes are almost secondary to learning about the wise Leaphorn and the hungry for knowledge Chee.I'll continue to read Hillerman for as long as he writes. With characters like these, he will never run out of good plot lines.P.S. I like the new love interest in Chee's life. Janet Peete was never right for him....Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman has written another engaging Chee/Leaphorn mystery, and although it's not my favorite work of the series, Hunting Badger is an excellent read. As far as contemporary mystery writing is concerned Hillerman is one of the best. The continuing evolution of his main characters is as interesting as the plot. With each book we get to know new sides of Jim Chee and the Legendary Lieutenant Leaphorn who had always been somewhat aloof until his wife's death and his retirement. It's nice to see him tread new ground after all these years. As always Hillerman is extremely adept at evoking the beautiful landscape of the Four Corners region, which regular readers have come to know and love. Within the mystery genre you're not likely to find a better sustained series, and Hunting Badger, if not the best in the series, nicely continues the tradition."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I started reading Tony Hillerman 2 years ago because of a review I read here at Amazon.com. &quot;Fallen Man&quot; was highly praised for painting vivid word pictures of the Four Corners countryside. When I started I had never heard of the Navajo Tribal Police and did not know an area call &quot;four corners&quot; existed outside of the center intersection of Bowling Green, OH. What a delightful surprise the Hillerman book turned out to be and continues to be. In these days of fast action and superficial characters and violence for violence sake, The Chee and Leaphorn stories are a welcome change. Why? The pictures of the Arizona/New Mexico countryside that Hillerman enables my imagination to conjure up are mind boggling. Having never been to the area I could only picture in my head the sunsets over the mountains, the cold snow swirling across the lonely roads, the storms raising across the plains. These pictures forced me to visit the area last summer - and I was not disappointed. The Indian traditions are deeply related in detail. Why the Navajos live like they do, act like they act and their views on the rest of us non-indians were truly amazing revelations. Finally the relationship of Chee and Leaphorn of the Navojo Tribal Police. After reading most of the books I feel like Chee is a brother or classmate and Leaphorn is my older wise uncle. Some why am I telling you all this in a review of this book? Because Hillerman continues the process in Hunting Badger. Nothing flashy, no pulse stopping ending, just a story about Chee and Leaphorn and Chee's perhaps new love interest - Sgt Manuelito and some criminals set in one of the most beautiful parts of the United States. More traditions, more scenery and more insight into the two main characters. Another good NTP yarn."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I have read all of Hillerman's novels set in the Four Corners area. Must concur with other reviewers that (a) this story wasn't particularly strong, but (b) it was quite enjoyable, esp. if the reader already knows the characters. In most of Tony's other books, the villain and the weather play more of a role, so I was disappointed by the lack of importance given to them this time.But the proofreading &amp; editing of this book were Godawful. I would strongly suggest that serious readers avoid first editions of ANYTHING from HarperCollins. They left it all to the spell-checker, which can't be trusted to replace &quot;censor&quot; with the intended &quot;sensor,&quot; or to correct punctuation typos. Next time I'm waiting for paperback; hopefully it will be less buggy."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hillerman has written another great book. I read it in just a couple of sittings and it was hard to put down. Chee is back where he belongs as a sargeant and Leaphorn is, well, Leaphorn. It seemed a well thought out story with Hillerman's usual great writing. Some plot twists but I did get the &quot;right&quot; bad guy before the end of the story. He is building the relationships in the book, Chee and Bernie and Joe and Louisa. To me, this is a good thing. Note to Tony, let them both be happy with someone. Chee has had enough girl friends and it has been too long for Leaphorn since he lost his wife. My opinion is that this book deserves 5 stars. Read it."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger is another of Hillerman's novelistic odes to Indian Country, this time praising the eighty-five million acres known as Four Corners or the Big Empty. The cast of characters is familiar: the Legendary Lieutenant (Joe Leaphorn), the Woman Professor (Louisa Bourebonette), the Former Acting Lieutenant (Jim Chee), and What a Woman (NTP officer Bernadette Manuelito). As always, the characterizations are sharp and consistent, and the story line weaves through endless canyons of imagination before giving away the identity of the actual villain one-half to two-thirds of the way through.Like other Hillerman fans, I love these characters, their ever-present &quot;wry&quot; faces, the lightening-bolt transitions from scene to scene, the enriched atmosphere of painted sky- and landscapes and, most of all, the heightened anticipation as one closes in on the plot resolution (which here is not up to the standards set in previous Hillerman works such as People of Darkness, The Dark Wind and A Thief of Time, but definitely does increase your pulse rate and reading speed as the light at the end of the tunnel - a muzzle flash, in this case - intensifies.But a number of things about this work bothered me. The most obvious: the atrocious editing. The reader is constantly required to line edit: see, e.g., p. 18, line 2: &quot;... Leaphorn had starting thinking about ...&quot;; p. 19, line 3: a &quot;wasn't&quot; that should likely be a &quot;didn't&quot;; and you can find plenty more at pp 20, 35, 49, 64 (&quot;It you see ...&quot; rather than &quot;If you see ...&quot;), 66 (Chee referred to as &quot;Cree&quot;), 90, 95 (&quot;... he'd hadn't heard it).&quot;), 184-85 (&quot;... he was hunting tered around out of the trash can, ...&quot;), 189 (&quot;He looked a Chee to see ...&quot;), 192 and 244.The overall effect of the foregoing examples is admittedly de minimis. But the going gets worse. At p. 124, line 5, we have Special Agent Cabot's dialogue tagged as &quot;Lodge said.&quot; Then at p. 186 the page starts out with part of the paragraph missing entirely: &quot;reacted, Leaphorn thought. And he noticed ...&quot; What that refers to, I haven't the slightest. And back at p. 85 we have Leaphorn smelling &quot;... the outdoor scents of hay, horse manure, sage and dry-country summer invading through the open window&quot;, whereas the only prior reference to the window was at p. 83, lines 10-12, where Leaphorn was putting &quot;... his forehead against the glass, shaded his eyes and looked into what seemed to be a bedroom ...&quot; My margin note: What open window? A similar non sequitur occurs at p. 248, lines 9-10, where we discover for the first time that potential villain Jorie is &quot;... a lawyer and admitted to the Utah bar ...&quot; My margin note: Where did that come from?It also bothered me that at p. 192, lines 19-26, &quot;Leaphorn looked very interested ...&quot; when he hears essentially the same information (a description of the coal digs where Badger might be holed up) that he's already heard from Chee on p. 165 at lines 5-8. A similar instance of Chee and Leaphorn forgetting they've already discussed something occurs at p. 240, lines 12-18, where there is a repeat of their previous conversation at p. 216, lines 1-4.The bottom line here is that when I buy a first edition hardcover, I expect it to evidence some decent editing. Apparently Harper Collins doesn't share this opinion. Nowadays, speed is the creed and few publishing houses seem to spend time on essential details, perhaps because they're too busy distributing hype, counting beans and devising Internet wampum. It's like the biggest software company in the world, which leaves it to consumers to find all the flaws in its programs. I find myself asking: What ever happened to editors like Max Perkins? There's a photograph of Thomas Wolfe in A. Scott Berg's biography Max Perkins, Editor of Genius: Wolfe is standing over one of three voluminous crates of loose manuscript which, under Perkins' guidance, would eventually become Of Time and the River - a massive editing job which occupied Perkins for over two years. Today it appears that no one is willing to spend even two hours to tidy up a gifted writer's manuscript.All in all, Hunting Badger is a very good read. I only wish Mr. Hillerman would change publishers and get the editing his writing deserves. Some of us might even volunteer to do it in exchange for a sneak preview of what Leaphorn, Chee, Largo, Cowboy Dashee and the others will be doing in the twenty-first century. Do buy the book - but wait for the paperback version. Maybe by then the editors at Harper Collins will have read the hardback - and made some direly needed changes.JT Borst-Fuerst JTB@EnglishOnline.ch"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Like reviewer Billbowie (from Sac) below, I too was in the area of the 1998 FBI manhunt. I was actually in Cortez and missed the events that transpired by about 1/2 hour.Mr. Hillerman's book is a seperate story in itself refrencing the '98 manhunt and events, but enter Jim Chee and Lt. (now civilian) Leaphorn. The book opened fast and set up events that would eventually lead to the climax, but I must say I was a bit disapointed with the quick resolution.What make Hillerman's novels strong are the intricate chracter developments that carry over from novel to novel. You just can't get enough of Leaphorn's thinking outside conventional lines and Chee's attitude. What was missing from this novel was more of the Native American mythology/folklore that Hillerman is usually known for. Though not needed in this novel, it is generally a pleasure to read and learn about Native American spirituality and customs.The only frustrating aspect of this book is the overly drawn out love lives of our two main characters. With each novel, there never seems to be any progression over Leaphorn's deceased wife, or Chee's ability to really go after what he secretly wants (Officer Bernie). There is some hinting in this book, but I'd like to see Mr. Hillerman tie up one of these lingering plotlines in his next book.Otherwise, the book will keep you guessing and it is a real fun read."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I keep reading these because I like the characters and the location. However, I have yet to find one that has a plot that isn't superficial. They lack depth somehow. But, I keep hoping and reading."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I received this book, which I'd anxiously awaited, for Christmas, and was disappointed. Weakly plotted, not Mr. Hillerman's best effort."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Mr. Hillerman should at least get the facts straight in his author's note! Officer Dale Claxton was murdered on May 29, 1998 not May 4. Disjointed and poorly proofread, this novel is at least a short one. I find it unfortunate that Mr. Hillerman uses the tragic incident in Cortez as the basis for a diatribe against the FBI."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hillerman was in a rush to write this book. In comparison to his previous books, this is a disappointment. His dedication to the Navajo cop was appreciated, his message about the disorganized man-hunt clear, but his characters were old and tired. The description the usual greeting exchanges everytime his characters met became repetitive to the point where he might have been better off writing &quot;Yada, yada, yada.&quot; This book did not meet Hillerman's usual high standards of writing. If you want a great novel to read, try TALKING GOD, THIEF OF TIME, SKINWALKERS or SACRED CLOWNS."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I think it may be time for Mr. Hillerman to end this series of novels. I've read them all, but the most recent books, including this one, just don't measure up to the earlier stories. Leaphorn and Chee (and the FBI) are becoming caricatures. I think this series has run its course."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"The book Hunting Badger by Tony Hillerman is a well constructed book. The twists and turns make it unique, and the writing style lets you enter the book and become a character. Although this book was wonderful I would not recommend it for teens under the age of 16. The book was hard to understand, and it was difficult to understand the plot. Some parts of the book were just flat and Arid. Finally there were hard vocabulary terms and twists on sentence structure. I personally found it difficult to read.First, the book was hard to understand and follow. Although it had a good plot, it was difficult to keep track of all the facts. This book is a mystery and is in 1st person. Therefore you, the reader, had to put together the facts and remember them from scene to scene. Once you have connected all the facts and are starting to enjoy the book, Tony Hillerman jumps to a completely different scene. For example, in the beginning of the book it starts out with the murder and robbery of the casino. Next it takes place in Jim Chee, the head detectives, office, and then back to the murder. This plot hoping makes it hard to keep track of the facts. All in all, the plot was well constructed but long and painfully fickle for a teenager 16 or under to understand and enjoy.Next, some parts of the book were flat, boring and just used as page fillers. The author used wonderful ways of giving clues to the reader but in some parts he drags it on and on. This makes the book time consuming and frustrating. For example in once scene the head detective questions this man for a whole chapter even thought the suspect gave the detective all the information he had. At the end of that whole chapter the information proved useless. Also the authors character descriptions were either two in depth or not in depth at all. In the opening chapters you barley knew anything about Jim Chee but you did learn almost ever detail about his partner. The plot has to be mysterious, not the main character. So pretty much Tony Hillerman uses page fillers to make this book un appealing to teens 16 and under. It would be great if you had a lot of time on your hands or were an adult.Third, there were hard vocabulary words for teenagers to understand. This booked was aimed at the adult population. Personally I did not understand some terms with my 10th grade vocabulary so I don't think any one younger would understand them either. These words were twisted in to the arid plot of looking for 2 criminals who you had a 99.9% not to find made the book even harder for the youthful reader. If you are going to read this book you have to study your vocabulary and grammar books and get ready for the slow ride. Also the sentence structure and order of ideas were tangled up in to a confusing read. Again I personally think Tony Hillermans writing style is hard to read and aimed for the adults.Finally, after the twisted arid pot, and a long hard read I would not recommend this book for teens under the age of 16. The book was hard to understand, and it was difficult to understand the plot. Some parts of the book were just flat and Arid. Finally there were hard vocabulary terms and twists on sentence structure. I personally found it difficult to read. This book was aimed for adults, but if any teenagers want to read it I would recommend studying vocabulary and get ready for a slow confusing plot. I recommend this book to adults who have plenty of time on there hands and like a good old fashion mystery. This book was just not fit out for the modern youth."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman's Hunting Badger was the 412th book I have read since 1997 (I am keeping track). It is also the first and last I will ever read by this author. I finish everything I read, regardless of it's content, but this one was a struggle. Maybe if I had some of the background other readers have had with this author, I would have enjoyed it. But it is my contention that a good book can be picked up anywhere, at any point in the story, even within a series, and be enjoyed, even gripping. This story falls way short of that. In fact, I didn't keep the character's straight very well, I hardly followed the plot line, and I struggled to put it all together. I found Joe Leaphorn seriously unlikely, and the other characters bland and without taste. Even the scenario descriptions of Navajo country were disappointing, because I know how beautiful it really is. And of course, the editing was so atrocious I found myself wanting to grade it, and I'm not even a teacher. I don't think there was much Mr. Hillerman could have done to ameliorate his efforts, though, the whole idea behind the plot was not interesting. In all fairness, I'm willing to concede that if I was a fan of the series I may have gotten more out of this read. However, I don't plan on buying the series or any of the books in it to find out."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This was my first Hillerman book, but I don't know if I will be trudging my way through another. As a fan of the modern detective/crime genre, I thought it would be great to happen upon another prolific author. Instead, I found myself mired down in the multiple characters introduced in the first 100 pages or so, even going so far as to skip whole passages. My attention just was not grabbed, let alone held. I may try another of his books, as several of the reviews indicate this is not one of the author's best, but I'd recommend John Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series or one of Johnathan Kellerman's great Delaware novels long before this one."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hey readers out there.

If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"The characters are familiar to Hillerman fans and the plot and story are good enough for a decent read.

His retired former boss Joe Leaphorn gets involved incidentally when he discovers the body of a rancher in the area, who has a suicide note on his computer naming himself and two accomplices as the robbers.Of course, the feckless Feds who are in charge flub the case, and Chee and Leaphorn team up again from their separate sides of the case, though Leaphorn is now a civilian. The key to the complicated mystery lies in the relationships and background insights of the locals.The charm and mystery of the west and the Indian cultures flows through the story, as Chee's uncle the shaman nears death and hands over the Chee the final secret Chee needs to be certified as his successor. In the process, his uncle Hosteen Akai gives Chee a critical clue from the past to the identify the leader of the casino gang."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Thought I had read all of Hillerman's books but didn't remember this one so I bought it.

Having read all his previous mysteries, I'd conclude that &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; would place somewhere near the bottom of the pile if I were to rank them according to my enjoyment. This novel felt a bit &quot;flat&quot;. No real tension, no true mystery, no exploration of the Navajo culture that has become his trademark. No offense, but even Jim Chee's cat didn't stick around for the entire tale."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, &quot;Hunting Badger&quot;, is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! &quot;Hunting Badger&quot; is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff.

And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. \\"When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere... you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony.

First, there were three Joe Leaphorn novels, then three Jim Chee novels, then two pairs of three Leaphorn and Chee novels. Hunting Badger is the second of the Bernadette Manuelito novels. Whereas The First Eagle spends the majority of the time in the heads of its characters, Hunting Badger spends a mix of time between the internal landscape of the character's minds and the physical landscape of the Four Corners region. The crime: a ripoff at the casino on the Ute reservation. A manhunt ensues that involves all the usual law enforcement agencies, Chee, Leaphorn, Cowboy Dashee, Officer Bernie Manuelito, Professor Louisa Bourebonette [the mythology prof and Leaphorn's lady friend], and to my relief, the red rock canyons of Indian Country. To my delight, this novel involved some mining geology [my training in college]. I'm glad to see the southwestern landscape return as a major player in Hunting Badger, after sitting way in the background of The First Eagle. The First Eagle wasn't a bad book, but its lack of red rock made it a lesser Hillerman novel. As old characters continue to evolve and new characters come to the fore in Tony Hillerman's Navajo novels, I hope the physical landscape continues to provide the sturdy base that it always has."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This book has many appealing features. The usual reservation context is there, built up from a mixture of magic, myth, vistas, and cultural conflicts. My favorite characters in the series all have pretty good sized roles, including Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, Cowboy Dashee, and Bernie Manuelito. The mystery has lots of misdirection, but not so much that you can't separate the red herrings from the real clues. The context between the reservation and nonreservation worlds becomes richer. And finally, the characters develop new depth and expand their relationships in significant ways. The plot also has some twists in it that are different from other Hillerman novels.I particularly like balance in my novels, and this one is the most balanced I remember in the series. Almost all of the elements that could be touched on are, and they add to the enjoyment of the story and the reader's connection to the characters.The book opens with a violent crime in which three criminals working in close coordination hijack the Ute Casino's winnings. One security officer is killed, and another is seriously wounded. Soon, the FBI's theory is that the crooks are long gone, due to the disappearance of a small plane.Joe Leaphorn's retired, and Jim Chee's on vacation. Yet, soon they are at the point in tracking down the criminals. As usual, their superior knowledge and openmindedness about what they hear allow them to draw conclusions that occur to no one else.Where else are those who should know the most ignored? Find those people and listen to them. You may well have a Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee available to help you.Anyone who is a Tony Hillerman fan will have lots of fun with this one!"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this on audio tape. The narrator did an excellent job in emphasizing areas that needed to be emphasized. He also took the time to make sure that you could feel Hillerman's characters come alive, and almost see the territory. I found it hard to stop places and not sit in the car to hear more of the book.The story centers around Sargent Chee, Officer Bernie, Lt (oops retired) Leaphorn, and a few of the favorites thrown in to keep from being monotinous.The three start out interested in a Casino heist for different reasons. But, they find themselves being drawn together and putting their heads together to mesh mythology, history and the bandits of today. Hillerman also spent time to tell people how the different agencies work (or don't work) together and how they are viewed by each other. I am a huge fan of how he is able to work in the Navajo and Ute cultures into this novels.I loved the fact that Officer Bernie is starting to take on a more prominent role, and is a strong woman who says no!PS - I didn't geuss what was happening till the end."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hillerman has once again joined two fine characters into an engrossing mystery that the publisher has managed to hinder its effectiveness by sloppy editing. Hillerman has Jim Chee explaining to Leaphorn the exact same thing twice within a few chapters, page 162 and again on 192, 193; the editor misses the word &quot;never&quot; being leftout in paragraph 5 of page 226 (confirmed as missing on page 227). There are &quot;who&quot;'s used rather than &quot;why&quot;'s. There are commas placed because one had not been used recently and one was sitting idly by; and periods added where none were needed...then negelected where they should have been; I guess to bring the all needed &quot;balance&quot; sought by the Navajo storyline. Other than that...I enjoyed stumbling through a good story. It allows me the pleasure of knowing that I to could possible write."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman is my favorite author. I re-read his earlier books while waiting for the next in the series to arrive. I visited Navajo Country just to be near the land and people he brings so completely to life. Hunting Badger made me fear that there will soon be no additions to the stories of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Much of the plot seems calculated to tie up loose ends, to settle story lines. I read that Mr. Hillerman has been ill, and that he recently lost a beloved brother. I hope he isn't contemplating retirement. Please, Mr. Hillerman, send Jim and Joe to us again soon."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"[..]i have a very different opinion the adults. this is the third hillerman ive read and i was really exited to read this one. I WAS DISAPOINTED!!!! There is not much action as usual(not thats theres always much),its all driving and talkingThis book starts where 3 bandits rob a ute casino,kill a cop and fly away in a plane. Jim chee teams up with joe leaphorn and they work together to find these men.One ends up killing himself,the second is a ruthless killer and the last man they actually find.The problem is that the FBI keeps trying to stop the two from solvin the crime.The worst part of this book is that theres no climax. They kind of catch the badguys then it ends!!!!! I was very disapointed! Tony hillerman usually writes good interesting books but this was not his usual way of writing these books."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"This is not actually a review; its a question. I have Harper Torch soft cover edition. On page 318 the story just ends without tellin the reader what happened to the Badger aka Ironhand. Am I missing something here? If there is another reader who can set me straight, I'd be grateful. My copy just seems to end and then there is a promo for Hillerman's Memoir."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Is it possible to correct my review. In the last paragraph, it should refer to Gil Silverbird not Jay Silverbird."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I love this book if for no other reason than the personal connection I have with it. I was on a 4th of July weekend roadtrip to Mesa Verde in 1998 during the manhunt that formed the backdrop for this book. We were inquiring at Navajo NM as to the best route from Monument Valley to Mesa Verde, when the Park Ranger suggested that we check with the police on road closures in the area because of the huge manhunt near Bluff. With survivalists, a suicide, and law enforcement trying to burn them out, I remember saying at the time that this sounds like a Tony Hillerman mystery and now it is...I have read/listened to all the Tony Hillerman I could find and while this is not my favorite (Thief of Time), he does a great job of placing his cast of characters into this real context to tell a plausible rest of the story.In addition, to descriptive prose on the Four Corners and tribal mysticism we have all come to expect, I love Hillerman's development of the characters from book to book and ultimately rate the them as much for the breakthroughs and growth of the characters as for the plot. In Hunting Badger both Jim Chee and the supposedly retired Legendary Lt. Joe Leaphorn, seem to be ready to move on with their respective lives. Leaphorn is feeling his way into his growing relationship with Professor Bourboneux who actually contributes to solving the case. And while I was initially disappointed to learn that not much had progressed since First Eagle with local girl Bernie Manuelito, Chee again shows promise that he may really be over Janet Pete. Chee also shows personal growth by reaching resolution around his long-standing quest to be a policeman and Navajo Singer and in acknowledging his friendship with Leaphorn.Finally, as primarily an audiobook listener, I enjoyed the new narrator, George Guidall, who was more reminiscent of Hillerman than Gil Silverbird who sounded like Lou Diamond Phillips' Chee in the movie Dark Wind. But in my (audio)book no one can say Lucachucai like Hillerman himself."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I love getting Hillerman books for my birthday! How I enjoyed this book! I told my wife that I hated to keep turning the pages as fast as I was turning them...because the book would soon be consumed.Tony Hillerman provides exactly the sort of reading experience that I relish: believable, sympathetic characters; an outdoor setting where I would like to find myself; and a plot that keeps me guessing. I just wish the gentleman from New Mexico could turn out more than one a year."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"but I'd still recommend it.Hillerman's writing is, as always, excellent. I think, though, that in this particular novel, his characterization is weak and the plot is more predictable than in his other books. I read this book in one night, and it was a fairly easy read. Unfortunately, I was able to predict most of the &quot;upcoming events&quot; in the novel fairly well, and I was also right (much to my dismay, I prefer to be kept guessing!) I've always liked Hillerman's books because of the fact that he starts out with little pieces of the mystery and by the end has them all woven into a coherent whole--without giving any of the upcoming plot away. In this particular novel, it's too easy to see how they all fit together long before the novel ends. More specifically, I would say that I had the issue of the plane worked out long before Chee did, and the badger reference worked out long before it became a gleam in Leaphorn's eye.The characterization here was a bit weak. Maybe I missed one of the novels, but I didn't recall anything about Janet Pete and Chee having much of a relationship. I can't help but notice she's been dismissed so that Chee can find a full-blooded Navajo for a girlfriend. I think it would have been more interesting to have her wanting to return to her roots and the struggle she would have to undergo to make that work out. But here she's been dismissed as being corrupted because she's half white and she's lived in the cities too long. As a replacement, Leaphorn seems to be considering a relationship with the Professor (I can't remember her name), and of course a union between them wouldn't produce any children that were half white and half Navaho. Chee and Leaphorn didn't remind me of the Chee and Leaphorn in the other novels, and I think this has a lot to do with the way Hillerman's writing style has changed with this novel. He used to describe Chee's movements in a way that characterized Chee as a slow, thoughtful character whose actions were very deliberate and with a lot of purpose (and if I'm not mistaken, Chee in one of his novels was called &quot;Long Thinker&quot; or something like that). Simple sentences, which evoked the patience and thoughtfulness, but also the simplicity and spirituality of this character, have been removed and replaced which much longer sentences that describe the action. I realize the Chee in this novel has removed himself in a way from becoming a singer for his people, but I wouldn't think that he would completely give up on his spirituality. It seems the Chee here is more self-conscious, more aware of when he makes himself look like an idiot, which is often, and even though sometimes Chee berated himself for his stupidity in the other novels it wasn't a constant thing.Something else that has been removed is the in-depth look at Navajo practices and customs. I recall in one of his past novels the issue of Navajo clans became an important detail in the unravelling of the mystery. Although myths play a role here, they seem almost secondary, or kind of a &quot;going through the motions&quot; thing. In past novels if a myth or idea was important, it was treated with more weight, and often in his novels he would bring up more than one idea or myth. Here the only myth that is brought up concerns the &quot;Badger&quot; title character. The use of Navajo/Hopi culture here isn't as fleshed out as it had been in the past. I always enjoyed the descriptions of the ceremonies, or the songs sung by characters in the novels that were a part of their rituals. Here they are non-existant.Considering the fact that Hosteen Nakai dies in this novel, I would have expected more of a reaction from Chee. This was his teacher, and his passing seems almost trivial. I would have thought that Chee would have had more of a sense of loss at his uncle's death, but it wasn't to be found here.This novel also seems to put Leaphorn to the forefront, instead of it being a novel between Chee and Leaphorn, with them sharing the limelight equally. I never had a problem in the past with Leaphorn being in the books, but here it almost seems like Leaphorn has taken over the book and Chee is just an ineffectual background character. It's Leaphorn that seems to have found all the pieces to the puzzles and solved most of the mystery by the book's end, and Leaphorn giving the orders to the FBI, while Chee gets to make himself look like an idiot, gets himself injured--twice--and gets prodded with a lot of questions from Leaphorn and others. It seemed to me that Chee was there because he was the official police officer--Leaphorn being retired means that he doesn't have the authority to do a number of things, like make arrests. I did not really understand why the change took place. It has always seemed to me that Leaphorn and Chee were equally smart, with Leaphorn only having the advantage because he was older, slightly more attentive to detail, and a bit wiser in the ways of the criminal mind.I didn't find Bernie (I think that's her name) all that interesting. You could tell she's going to be set up as Chee's girlfriend sometime in his next few novels. It seems to me that more characterization needs to be done on her before she becomes interesting. She does seem to have some insight, but since very little of the book was devoted to her characterization it's hard to say whether or not she would be interesting enough to keep around for the next few novels.In all, though, I've read worse books. I don't know of any artist or writer that doesn't have a book or painting that &quot;could have been better&quot;. My feeling is that writers like Hillerman are entitled to them every now and then. Since they're human, they can't be perfect all the time, and it's times like these that an artist or writer can learn from their not-quite-there work in order to understand how to make it better. It's part of the learning experience, and most artists I know say that they never stop learning, even when they're no longer in school.It's still an enjoyable read, and the plot was interesting even if it wasn't as complicated as previous Hillerman novels. I may not read this a second time, but it was worth it the first time. I'm still looking forward to his next novel."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I caught up on the last four books in this series over the last two weeks, and I am now so sorry that I don't have any more Chee/Leaphorn mysteries to read. It is interesting seeing how Chee has moved to the center of the series, while Leaphorn intially provided the focus. But the books wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without either of them. The mystery in this book is typical Hillerman--suspenseful, atmospheric, puzzling, interesting. You really worry about the Navajo detectives as they hunt their dangerous quarry over the desolate terrain, miles from any possible assistance. And I have to express my appreciation for the emergence of a wonderful new character, Officer Bernie Maneulito, a traditional Navajo and Jim Chee's possible new love interest. What a charmer. This is one of the best books in the series, I believe--certainly the relationship between Chee and Leaphorn is presented more warmly and clearly than in any of the previous volumes."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"The audio version of this book made a 6 hour trans-Penn drive go very fast. Hillerman has a knack for weaving interesting characters, intricate plots, and Navajo mysticism into one cohesive package.&quot;Hunting Badger&quot; recounts a multi-departmental manhunt for three cop-killer/thieves through the area surrounding the Four-Corners region. Our familiar heros are faced with the task of solving the crime despite of the best efforts of both the criminals and the FBI.My only criticism is that I would have liked more explanation of the motivations of the criminals, and more of an aftermath. This book lacked some of the action of some of the other books, but what it lacked in gunplay it made up in interesting deduction.Like his other works, it is a quick read and a good book on tape. And, being a reflection of an actual event, the plausibility factor increases the interest."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger is one of Hillerman's best novels with Chee-Leaphorn. I thought the plot was well conceived, tight, and completely enjoyable. Its amazing how Hillerman can capture the scenery of the Southwest in just a few sentences. I found it so easy to picture all the scenes that were so vividly written. As for the mystery itself, the book was well paced and brought things to a satisfying ending. Hillerman just seems to get better and better with each new book. I can hardly wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Classic Hillerman, with a little growth on the part of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Loved returning to the high mesas and open spaces, visiting with these &quot;old friends&quot; and drawing myself into the magical landscape and native personalities Hillerman paints so well. Blessed with humor and clever insight, and yes, a little social commentary, our heros methodically solve the mystery that isn't quite as it first appears. And, yes, unfortunately this book should have been proofread."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"After seeking a role for a retired Joe Leaphorn I thought this volumne in the series was stronger than Tony's last effort &quot;Two Eagles&quot;.. Leaphorn was more forceful and showed the power and wisedom of his caharacter as he had in the past. He was more talkative also. The only thing that I didn't like as much was a little bit less less Navajo culture reflected in the story. If this was your first you would not be reminded of the Navajo way to acheive hozra or how to walk in beauty. Those moments were always the best part of any Hillerman Chee/Leaphorn mystery. Still it was a fun read.. a bit too short."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"The only trouble with Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn/Chee series is that a new one only appears every two years or so and they only last a few hours. I have to read them in one sitting, and then...it's over. The chance to visit, to watch them solve a mystery, is over all too quickly.Disappointing? No. This book delivers everything I want and expect from it. It entertains, it intrigues, it made time flash by. I picked it up and started reading and the next time I looked up it was 2am and I'd reached the end. Can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"As always, I loved the descriptions of the scenic southwest, the Navajo tribal setting, and being with Chee and Leaphorn again.My problem was, at the end of the book, I had a little trouble deciding what really happened. I am reading the last 9 chapters again, to make sure I &quot;get the message.&quot;Did others have this concern too, or was I just inattentive to my reading?"},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Tony Hillerman, the prolific author of the Leaphorn/Chee series, hits another bull's eye with Hunting Badger. I believe this novel is one of his strongest in recent years. As always, Hillerman captures the essence of the multicultural American Southwest with its ongoing blending of cultures. He also presents the cultural depth of the indigenous cultures that reach back to before recorded history. The plot involves the robbery of a tribal casino and the events that stem from that crime. The legendary Joe Leaphorn, bored in retirement, is drawn into the investigation as Jim Chee finds himself involved in investigating the case. All the expected characters appear in the novel, and Hillerman does an excellent job of allowing these characters to continue to grow even after so many books stretching over so many years. Leaphorn is adjusting to his new life, sans his job and his late wife. Chee is putting his latest romantic disappointment behind him. Both men are experiencing fresh romances in their lives, and their friendship begins to reach new levels. As he allows character, plot, and theme to play out, Hillerman tells a fabulous story. Hunting Badger should not be missed. It is one of Tony Hillerman's finest."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"The photo of the author on the book jacket might be more appropriate, if in it, the author were speaking into a telephone. Because Hillerman is just phoning it in, as he has for most of his more recent novels. Missing are the picturesque detailed descriptions of the southwestern landscape, the lessons in indigenous plant life and geology. The small amount of Navajo mythology, lavishly described in previous novels, leaves much to be desired in Hunting Badger. The characters are already developed and much of the plot is spent going over old ground.Even the layout artist is phoning it in. The back of the book jacket contains the headline from the previous book jacket, \\" Praise for the First Eagle\\", Hillerman's last book. (Was this because there was no praise for Hunting Badger?)The plot is OK. But the editing is atrocious. On one page Officer Bernadette Manuelito is referred to as \\"him\\", along with one or two other glaring typos. All on the same page! How could the editor miss these, unless he/she were phoning it in, too? Hillerman is in love with the adjective \\"wry\\", as in wry grin, wry look, wry smile, wry face, rye bread. If I had a dollar for every time Hillerman uses wry, this overworked and often inappropriate adjective, I could afford to retire. Microsoft Word's Thesaurus suggests some alternate adjectives that Hillerman can use in his next novel to spare his readers the annoying and distracting repetitious use of this term: twisted, distorted, bent, and crooked, among others.I can only recommend this book to diehard Hillerman fans who are starved for any story about Leaphorn and Chee. Regarless of how fragmentary it is. If Hillerman has run out of things to say, then perhaps it's time to turn off the word processor, get out from behind his desk, and take a long vacation and enjoy the Land of Enchantment. And if Hillerman and Harper Collins want my $26.00, they are going to have to work a lot harder than they have recently done. When the next Hillerman novel is churned out, I just might take a pass."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"In \\"Hunting Badger,\\" Tony Hillerman's continuation of the Lt. Joe Leaphornand Jim Chee mystery, the author once more captures, with vivid description,riveting detail, exciting plot, and superb characterization, life on and about theNavajo reservation.Leaphorn and Jim Chee team up once again to solve a crime in the Four Cornerscanyons. Hillerman takes a real-life crime (In 1998 three \\"survivalists\\" steal a truck,murder a policeman, and then disappear. The FBI and other law organizations failin their investigations.) and adapts it to his own fictional form. He does so,upholding once more his reputation as one of the most exciting writers around. His\\"police procedural\\" is in a unque--and original setting--in the middle of the Navajonation.\\"Hunting Badger\\" takes us in and around and through the ins and outs of that areabefore finally climaxing in triumph for Leaphorn and Chee, not to mentionHillerman.

This book, while not on par with the Thief of Time or Ghostway, is still enjoyable -- mostly due to Chee and Leaphorn. These are two well-developed characters ... old friends I like to check in on from time to time.I found the overall plot to be promising, but at times, the story seemed rushed and not thoroughly explored. I was disappointed by the ending. Starting with Leaphorn's sudden unraveling of the mystery, the end was too rushed and a bit non-eventful.For those who like Hillerman, this is a must read. For those that are new to his work, check the Thief of Time. Read this one later after getting to know the characters."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"I'll preface this with the statement that I'm a HUGE Hillerman fan, and have never been disappointed by his novels to any degree, and I've read all of the Navajo series, and Saving Moon. This story strikes me as unpolished and poorly edited, almost as though Mr. Hillerman was under undue pressure to get the book finished. I encountered with awe what appeared to be a rewrite of a conversation between Chee and Leaphorn (regarding coal mining sites). The conversations were repeated within 30 pages of each other (clearly as if they hadn't already discussed it) with only minor changes! There was a typo referring to Chee as Cree, and most dismaying, both Chee and Leaphorn seemed to be so weakly drawn that anyone picking up this book without having read the others could not possibly appreciate the great intelligence, honour and warmth both of these characters have always exhibited. I would welcome changes reflecting the natural progression of their ages and experiences, but in Hunting Badger they appear slow, insecure, dense and vague.If this is a case of publisher pressure: back off and let the man do his gifted best. PLEASE. If not, don't hold this book against Mr. Hillerman. He's a wonderful writer and this series will endure in my heart despite the apparent carelessness with which Hunting Badger was handled."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"Hunting Badger, set in the Four Corners region of the US (junction of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, which come together at four perfect 90-degree angles) which will be familiar to Hillerman's devoted readers, focuses on the violent ripoff of a casino on the Ute reservation. The wonderful character list includes the usual reservation cops, and a lady interest for both Leaphorn (whose beloved wife has died) and Chee (who took fer-frikkin'-ever to get over Janet Pete, his first love). But just as strong a character is the land itself, always a forceful and important presence in TH's wonderful books. There's even mining geology information in Hunting Badger. What you get in a good Tony Hillerman book is more than a story with memorable characters told in economical prose; you also get vivid mental pictures of the bleak beauty of the Southwest, insightful glimpses of Navajo culture, geology and geography lessons, and spiritual shaman lore.For character development and follow-through, don't read this first; go back at the very beginning of this Leaphorn/Chee series and start with the first one. But if you just want a good book to read on the plane and this is the one that's available in the airport bookstore, then go ahead and buy it.

Now I am an adult living in Chicago and my grandparents are dead, but I still get to go home and see the folks every time Tony Hillerman publishes another book.They purport to be mysteries and I admit, in the beginning the mysteries were what held me. But not any more. Who cares about flying Utes and convenient suicides when you've got Leaphorn watching another gorgeous New Mexico sunset, and Jim Chee finally about to pull his head out of the sand paintings and realize it might be time to settle down?Throw in some well-deserved humor at the expense of the FBI, the little-seen but always enjoyable Capt. Largo, and you have the makings of yet another wonderful visit over two cups of coffee at Chee's worn &quot;kitchen&quot; table.I am puzzled, though, at how a big house like Prentice-Hall could allow a book with this many editorial/typographical errors to leave its warehouse. There were some doozies, but the worst was a conversation which gave Jim's last name as &quot;Cree.&quot; If that isn't food for confusion, I don't know what is. Maybe two times within four pages where a person was referred to with a pronoun of the wrong gender?However, those are minor problems compared to the one facing me now: I read it in two days, and must wait a year for the next one. I hate it when that happens."},{"Title":"Three for a Wedding","review":"One year has passed since Navaho Reservation police Sergeant Jim Cheer participated in a FBI-directed hunt of two cop killers. However, though numerous law enforcement organizations joined the search, the suspects were never caught. Jim hated the incident, as the rival police teams seemed to trip over one another in their efforts to be the hero.Jim's wishes to never work with the FBI ever again when he hears three commandos attacked and robbed a casino on the Ute Reservation. One cop is dead and another seriously injured. Evidence points to the culprits hiding in the same vicinity as that of last year's killers. Against his own desires, Jim, accompanied by retired officer Joe Leaphorn, joins the latest manhunt.HUNTING BADGER is the great Tony Hillerman at his awesome best. By interweaving Navaho and Ute myths and history into a modern day story line, Mr. Hillerman teaches and entertains his audience. Adding to the warm feeling emitted by the delicious plot is the return of cherished friends.

I have a TomCat servlet server running and used this developer's guide religiously. It is actually interesting to read, not only as a reference. Of course, I'm interested in this topic, so I'm a little biased, but I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to use this EXCELLENT, free DBMS and write powerful apps using Java."},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"I'm currently enrolled in an Undergraduate Course in Relational Database Systems. I was getting tired of reading incomplete tutorials around the internet on how to use JDBC and MySQL effectively so I bought this book bought last week on Amazon Marketplace. It was ridiculously cheap (About $3), but after seeing how useful it is, I definitely would've paid the regular price. One of the authors, Mark Matthews, actually wrote the Connector/J driver for MySql!-This book is a tutorial, NOT a reference.-All of the code and examples used in the book are available online so you don't need to waste hours retyping code to get the feel of it.-The book assumes you are somewhat competent in Java and goes into applets, beans, and EJBs, but I think someone who knows C++ and really understands OOP will be able to manage alright.Good luck!"},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"I got this books few days back and started with a chapter and could not resist to read most of it. This books gave me answers to all my questions. This is a very detailed book. I did not look at it as SQL or Database book. It explains (VERY CLEARLY) what the title is about.The authors thought about all the issues (setting up, connecting, writing Java code) and explained them very nicely. I wish all the books are written with this kind of calrity! Sure we can get most of this material on WWW, but searching for the information is painful. This book saved me lots of time.Great job authors."},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"I have bought this book because I had expected to find there some more advanced hints and tricks, especially about performance tuning and bottlenecks of Java and MySQL applications. Unfortunatelly, this book only covers the very basic problematics. It is a good kickstart for beginners, but only for them. Experienced developers should pick a general J2EE book instead."},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"This book provided a decent walthrough of MySQL and its JDBC driver, however it made some shocking conceptual mistakes. For instance, the &quot;Consistency&quot; principle in ACID transactions has nothing to do with referential integrity, but dirty uncommitted reads. A type 2 and NOT 4 JDBC driver is frequently the best performing type (Oracle's OCI outperforms its Thin and DB2's App seriously outperforms its Net driver). Furthermore, it had one of the most shocking mistakes I've ever seen in a technical book: The &quot;JavaScript&quot; example provided is really just scriptlets inside a JSP -- To me, not even understanding what JavaScript is seriously undermined the credibility of this book."},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"Mark Matthews has done a great job with this book. His MM.MySQL has always been the best driver available, and now he has the best book. This thing covers a wide range of topics needed to develop MySQL applications with Java. It covers all the basics of course, but has a ton of high end info too including 10 solid pages on advanced connection pool management, excellent performance and tuning advice, EJB examples, and great info for working with BLOBs and CLOGs.I'm just moving up to Connector/J 3.0.x, so I appreciate that this book covers it and the older 2.0.14.

I am teaching myself Java and I have already read the 21 Day book and a book on Applets. This book adds to my Java education by teaching me how to connect to MySQL via Java. I am only one-third of the way through the book so far, and I already feel like I have accomplished my purpose for purchasing the book. The code examples that are available via download do not cover material in the book until Chapter 5 (which is the chapter I am reading now), so I cannot say anything more about the code as of yet, except that I made a couple minor rewrites to the code examples, which may not have been necessary to make the examples function, but seemed more up-to-date. All-in-all, I recommend the book to beginners who want to learn how to connect Java to MySQL; intermediary and advanced students of Java may get something out of the book as well, but being a novice myself, I leave that judgment to more advanced students of Java. A great book!"},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"Rarely have I been so irritated with a book that I felt compelled to write a review. I feel that the 5-star rating that the book had when I bought is undeserved. It's replete with errors. Even the URL for the companion website is incorrect. I tracked down the companion website with the help of Google and downloaded the samples, but of course, they wouldn't compile. The authors admit to the challenge of timing the release of book with the release of the Connector/J driver. Too difficult to allow for decent quality control it would appear. Detailed examples can be very helpful, but not when the details are wrong. That just makes for massive frustration."},{"Title":"MySQL and Java Developer's Guide (Java Open Source Library)","review":"I'd never done anything with databases, and SQL was an almost total mystery.

And while there are a lot of ways to develop a database application, I've always kinda wanted to learn Java.A search for references on databases and Java didn't turn up a lot of hits that looked useful, and this book was about the only serious or substantial work focusing on my need.

Armed with this book plus the MySQL PDF manual and Sun's online Java reference for additional details, I forged ahead and in a couple of weeks of \\"spare time\\" programming, I've designed a reasonable and usable database schema, implemented it, and populated my database with data recovered from various project archives. My tool's \\"not all there\\" yet, but I expect this book will remain relevant as I expand my humble command line tool into a servlet and GUI... it has good simple examples of all that, too.I wouldn't lay claims to being an expert database or Java programmer, but it's pretty cool to be able to say this book helped me become competent in just a few weeks of part-time development."},{"Title":"Hebrews (New International Biblical Commentary)","review":"Donald Hagner is an outstanding biblical scholar and he has spent many years studying the book of Hebrews. This is an excellent expositional commentary (based on the NIV) which deals with all the issues in a very clear and understandable way, and does so in a non-technical way. Hagner does a great job of bringing out the themes of the Supremacy and Sufficiency of Christ and He touches upon the main themes: Christ as Ultimate Revelation, Christ is Greater than Moses, He is Superior to Aaron, and His Priesthood (in the order of Melchizedek) is superior to that of the Levitical Priesthood. He deals with all the issues, including the difficult passage in Hebrews 6: 4-5 (apostasy); his take on Heb. 6: 4-6 is that this passage is dealing with genuine Christians, who prove that their faith is genuine through perseverance in the faith. (Those who fall away were not genuine believers to begin with). He does not believe in the hypothetical argument. In the section on Heb. 4: 1-16, Hagner sees the \\"rest\\" as both present and future.I liked how the NIBC commentary is organized. Hagner provides the reader with a general overview and explanation of each chapter in the book of Hebrews. Then at the end of every chapter, there is the \\"Additional Notes\\" section which provides further explanations of the specific words and phrases in Greek. I found the Additional Notes to be very helpful.If you want a solid evangelical commentary that is rich in biblical insights and is accessible to both layperson, seminary student, and pastor alike, I would highly recommend this commentary. It is a good starter. I would highly recommend you purchase Donald Hagner's fuller overview of the book of Hebrews \\"Encountering the Book of Hebrews\\" in the EBS series (ISBN: 978-0-8010-2580-8). Hagner goes into greater detail in explaining the background, themes, and passages in Hebrews.Other recommended commentaries on Hebrews from an evangelical perspective:Expositional: F.F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews (New International Commentary on the New Testament), Eerdmans, 1990.

Mesopotamian map to modern day animated and GIS maps. Thrower is careful to highlight cartographic advances distinct from geographic discoveries in Classical Antiquity, East and South Asia, European and Islam in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and then advances in the 19th century to modern times. Perhaps as a modern map maker, I forget that there was an early inventor of map projections (probably Hipparchus of Niceaes), contour lines (1791), and representative fractions (in France in 1806). The history of projections is presented throughout the book, and concisely in an appendix. The initial chapter on maps of pre-literate people was perhaps most fascinating to me with the Bedolina petroglyph (Northern Italy, 2000-1500 B.C ) and Marshall Island stick charts. There is now a 3rd edition, so perhaps the book was updated with recent advances such as Google earth and a dynamic GPS maps. The book is well illustrated, but sometimes the maps suffer from reduction and being in black and white.

Willoughby Nason was one of the people who did. Have you ever wondered what the people that came on the Mayflower did. When you read Descendents of Willoughby Nason, you'll get a great understanding of just how our country got started. The Indians were here of course, but most of us are relatives of early settlers. The book on Nason, will tell you if you are one of the descendants of those earliest settlers. It's a great book of sound facts that traces our ancestors back to the very first ancestors. It's a great book and if you have any interest in our American history, you'll enjoy reading this book. The book and other books by Douglas Chase, continues the tale of Willoughby's ancestors as the entire country is settled. You can't get any better idea of how America was settled. It should be recommend reading for all history students."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"With this book, Schaeffer touches on a lot of serious issues dealing with society and religion in America, and the difference between the attitudes of \\"Protestantized America\\" and the \\"American civil religion\\" to Orthodox Christianity. What he has to say is definately worth thinking about, especially for anyone who has felt an emptyness or spiritual lacking in most religion in America today.My problem was not in his message, but oftentimes in the way Schaeffer came across with it. In some places, it seemed like the book was more a collection of essays strung together to make a book. I understand his stance on abortion, but to compare it (especially in combination with prenatal testing) as being on par with the Nazi Eugenics program at EVERY mention did get to be a bit tiresome, especially for somebody like me, who does not need to be convinced of this. For somebody who did not agree with him, they'd probably be put off enough by reading that so many times, that they would either not read any further, or just use that as a reason not to think about the rest of his message.Furthermore, there were far too many quotes that were far too long. Some editor should have looked to see that he had quoted the same passage of seven or so Bible verses in the space of about 2 or 2 1/2 pages. I know he had slightly different points to make with it, but he should assume that his reader is smart enough to retain what they had read for the 2-3 minutes it took to get from his first point to his second point.Normally, it shouldn't make a difference, but the font for this book was TERRIBLE. It was distracting and ugly, and made the book, literally, harder to read.Again, I feel his message is pertinent and important, and there were passages of the book, especially near the end, that were brilliant. Had this book been written a bit differently, it would have been an easy five stars. As important as the ideas he has here are, those who are going to read this book through don't need to be convinced with the tone of his arguments, and those who don't agree aren't going to read it through."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I read this book once before but gave it away so I ordered it because I wanted to read it again. And just as I loved it before, I still love it now! It is a great read for those who are born into Orthodoxy as well as for those who have just been introduced to it. Schaeffer's writing is easy to understand and keeps you interested."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I have read _Dancing Alone_ several years back as a catechumen in the Carpatho-Rusyn diocese. It was a stumbling block for me, as I did not feel any hostility towards my background (Methodist), but rather was simply looking for the Truth (and I went searching in all sorts of religions - Buddhism especially was quite attractive, but still lacked 'something'). Perhaps those with a righteous indignation - windmills to attack, or legitimate issues - and there is a place for righteous indignation (or zealotry), and it can be a good thing. It is not my temperment however, so if you start reading this book and find it a stumbling block, then by all means, put it down and read another text on Orthodoxy. But for many, this book has been a help in their journey, and these are my mere opinions, from somebody who really doesn't know much of anything, so take that into account."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"This was one of the first books I read when becoming Orthodox. The first was an obscure Ethiopian Orthodox book that I loved, the other was The Orthodox Way, which I found boring. When reading this at times I wasnt sure if I should be offended or not. Frank Schaeffer is very direct and unwavering in his belief that Orthodoxy is the only possible answer to the question of, \\"what is the true church\\"? What is even better is that his research is flawless and erases even more doubt that one may have had. This book is a book that will either be loved or hated but what lies within cannot be denied, it is a healthy dose of truth, spiritually and historically. If after reading this book you are not Orthodox, then you are lying to yourself."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I loved this book when I read it almost two years ago. Yes, it is polemical, even harsh at times, but that is how you feel when you have been lied to by historical revisionists or mislead by well meaning, but ignorant people. I have no problem with his calling Protestantism counterfeit, because it is!!! Orthodoxy isn't a denomination (politically correct term for schism), but rather the unbroken apostolic faith of nearly 2000 years. Orthodoxy has had two major schisms from its apostolic tradition; the monophysite schism (politically correct term: non-Chalcedonian or Oriental Orthodox) of 451 AD and the Latin schism in 1054 AD in which the Roman Catholic Church was formed. Prior to this Rome was mostly Orthodox, with notable exceptions such as 9th century Pope Nicholas the land greedy (Bulgaria), presumptuous (claim of universal authority)and heretical (filioque) western patriarch. He was a true proto-Protestant who was proven in error by St. Photios the Great of Constantinople. Protestantism is not a schism from Orthodoxy, rather it is a schism from Roman Catholicism which is itself a schism.I can understand Schaeffer's frame of mind when he wrote this book and have shared it. It's too bad if some readers got their feelings hurt because they had harsh truth shined in their faces. Schaeffer's righteous indignation reminds me of St. Nicholas of Myra (yes, the real life \\"Santa Claus\\") who slapped the piss out of the heresiarch Arius at the 1st Oeceumenical Council when Arius denied the Lord's deity. St. Nicholas was stripped of his episcopal office until the head Bishop of the council received a divine dream instructing him to restore St. Nicholas. I happen to like cold hard, and yes even blunt, truth and political correctness be cursed. If you are the irenic, ecumenical, theologically & historically weak type, who just wants to go along to get along then this is not going to be your type of book. On a side note I have not read Schaeffer's newest books, but if they are nearly as bad as his latest video \\"Faith Through Doubt\\" then he seems to have lost his righteous indignation and became more politically correct."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Schaefer's historical arguments interesting and basically accurate. There is little doubt the Orthodox Church of today is connected in an unbroken chain to the origins of the faith. However, when Schaefer strays from historical and theological discussions, he quickly shows us that he is still a Bible-thumping evangelical protestant at heart, more concerned with overturning Roe v. Wade than bringing the true Church to the U.S. After accurately explaining the dangers of a world where fractured denominations are just stand-ins for various single-issue political causes, Schaefer turns around and tries to make Orthodoxy a stand-in for the usual causes of the American culture war! He apparently hopes to use the ancient Church as another tool in his political crusades. But does he honestly believe the Church's main reason for being is to stamp out homosexuality and abortion in modern America? Has he simply failed to understand that the key is bringing the light of faith to the shadows, *not* in burning the supposedly &quot;evil&quot; ideas at the stake? He looks to me like a Calvinist with some icons around."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Another reviewer who gave this book two stars is right -this book is polemic and I agree with the Orthodox Father to some degree - It may not be a good place to start. Why the high rating?Well, first, Schaeffer does fail to chronicle a personal journey which a conversion title would suggest. But I think that he was not really trying to accomplish so much a chronicle log of event after personal event, but instead, deal with the issues he found as a crisis in Protestant and Catholic doctrines and views.This he does exceptionaly well using, much like his father (the late Dr. Francis Schaeffer), a presupposational approach to the present conditions in our society. He critques protestantism the most out of the three branches of Christianity. To a large degree, his analysis is dead on.Schaeffer, however, fails in large with regards in the second half of the book when he deals with Orthodox doctrine. He still can't quit baggering Protetsant doctrine and this is a distractor. He should have presented the positive doctrine of Orthodoxy and lett it speak for itself. For a look at Orthodox basic beliefs, read \\"The Orthodox Way\\" by Bishop Ware.The first half of the book is outstanding, the second half poorly presented. Four stars because the first half is that good."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Frank Schaeffer provides an excellent historical overview of the history of Christianity, which alone makes this book worthwhile. He's judgmental of Orthodox Christians who were born into the faith, but his fervent zeal for Christian Orthodoxy shines through. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"What strikes one about this account of one person's move from Evangelicalism to Orthodoxy is that one, he is passionate about his new church body and two, he constantly quotes not usually from the Word of God(and when he does, he quickly interprets it from Holy Tradition's stance), but the Holy Tradition.Thus, the heart of Orthodoxy is just that, the Holy Tradition interprets Scripture, not Scripture interprets Scripture (the Lutheran and Reformational principle). As Luther said it so well at Worms with his very physical life on the line: Although I have great respect for the hierachy and councils and ancient church fathers) my greater respect is for the Word of God.One cannot help in reading the ancient church fathers to find there a wide variety, diversity of theological opinions. Thus, the confusion of Orthodoxy. Pick and choose to quote from your favorite, or that which supports one's opinion. Thus the suspicion of the fathers being the ultimate norm for Biblical interpretation.This then exhibits itself most glaringly in Schaeffer's move in its position on original sin. Schaeffer says Maximus was right, Augustine and subsequent West had it wrong. Sin is not that bad in its original sin concept. It is just as tarnish on silver as leading American Orthodox spokesman said recently on radio. Just needs some polishing. Contrast this with writings of Paul quoting from the apostles' and Lord's Bible from Psalsm and Isaiah in Romans 3 and one gets idea that since fall into sin it is spiritual death, not just a freewill choice to not follow God willingly. Paul writes against this repeatedly.It seems that Schaeffer is into Christianity's engagement with and influence of culture, and thus frustrated with lack of such in his view. With this most of us Christians would agree. However, he totally reduces much of Christianity in a false generalization way to the worst of Calvinistic and fundamentialist position when he needs to be the most critical.Real Lutherans don't fit his mold. Some of Calvinists don't either. He paints a real false straw man here. I agree with most of this criticism, but don't see turning to Orthodoxy as solution, since by creating a false problem (free will following) rather than original sin, they than get the solution wrong.Much that can be supported with Schaeffer's critique of American Christianity (e.g. liturgy, morals,sacraments, confession/absolution,etc.), but his solution doesn't correlate with Scripture, unless one sees the Holy Tradition as presented as the God given only choice of interpretation. I'll go with the Apostles' as inspired by Spirit of God to put down into words that this day also may read for ourselves, rather than wait for other writers' to interpret for us."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"One's trek from faith to faith can be exhausting; Frank Schaeffer's pilgrimage has apparently left him a bit furious as well. Mr. Schaeffer's father is the late Presbyterian notable Dr. Francis Schaeffer, author of &quot;How Shall We then Live?&quot; among other Protestant works. One wonders how Dr. Schaffer would respond to the vitriolic onslaught that characterizes his son's only attempt (hopefully the last) at theological explication. &quot;Dancing Alone&quot; is little more than the product of obvious disillusionment and anger over a past religious pilgrimage that was less than fulfilling. His hatred for Reformed Protestantism drips off of ever page and his theological assertions (more like &quot;misadventures&quot;)generate more heat than light. When Mr. Schaeffer characterizes the majestically sovereign God of the Reformed faith (cf. Isaiah 45:6ff.) as a &quot;devil-god&quot;, it becomes impossible to take this imputent upstart seriously! Anyone who has perused the pages of Mr. Schaeffer's Orthodox newsletter &quot;The Christian Activist&quot; will recognize the same theological snobbery that imbues &quot;Dancing Alone.&quot; Hopefully, history will remember Dr. Francis Schaeffer's momentous contribution to Christianity and leave Franky Schaeffer's unfortunate record uncovered and forgotten!"},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I bought this book out of curiosity, having long ago read the author's father (Evangelical/Presbyterian/Fundamentalist/Dispensationalist Protestant minister Francis Schaeffer)'s books, and some of Franky's as well. Franky--or Frank--usually sounds bitter and sarcastic, but I did enjoy his novel Portofino. Twenty-some years ago, I was a Protestant, and was, as a youth, somewhat impressed with Francis Schaeffer's works. (I am not impressed now.) Anyway, I was interested in learning about Franky's pilgrimage to Orthodoxy, and was expecting a personal account. Instead, I find a bitter diatribe against Protestantism and Catholicism. Schaeffer's words are obviously those of a new and zealous convert. He warns us in his \\"Note of Acknowledgment\\" that he is not an historian nor a theologian, nor a scholar. Yet he proceeds to write as if he were all three. He is not convincing. He does, however, make some good points regarding Protestantism, and much of what he says concerning the Orthodox churches apply to the Catholic Church. He bitterly attacks the Papacy, having thoroughly absorbed the resentment towards the West of many Orthodox writers. (Of course I am admittedly biased, and consider \\"the Schismatic Church\\" an apt appellation for the Orthodox!)Nevertheless, I think Shaeffer has moved in the right direction, and it is better to be \\"only\\" in schism rather than in heresy and schism. But for a good short introduction to Orthodoxy, I think Timothy Ware's The Orthodox Church is a better treatment of the subject. At least you will get the perspective of a longtime adherent, and more reliable historical information. Frank Schaeffer is much better at writing fiction (and I really do recommend Portofino, especially if you have ever been an Evangelical Protestant--it'll keep you laughing)."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I recently read Frank Schaeffer's &quot;Dancing Alone.&quot; I was expecting to hear of his joy in his new faith (thus the dancing) and the sorrow of his possible estrangement from his former extended family of believers and how he dealt with it (thus the alone). However, the book revealed very little of the author's personal odyssey. It was more on the lines of a very long sermon or perhaps, term paper, analyzing the decay of western versions of Christianity and promoting the eastern version through somewhat rose colored glasses.I have read other books by this author, fiction and non fiction and he always comes off so angry. Sometimes humor and pathos is mixed with the anger making him seem more human but not in this book. I was disappointed.."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Whereas Kallistos Ware's treatise, The Orthodox Way, is a balanced work, the product of a life devoted to scholarly reflection, the zeal of a recent convert characterizes Frank Schaeffer's Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religions (Brookline, MS: Holy Cross Orthodox Press, c. 1994).Schaeffer's father, Francis, whose works are known to most of you, espoused a strongly Reformed version of evangelicalism and influenced thousands of thoughtful young readers a generation ago. (Young Schaeffer's portrait of his father and mother, incidentally, seem clearly drawn in a novel, Portofino {NY: Macmillan, 1992}, which is an interesting account.) Frank's spiritual quest brought him to Orthodoxy, which he now believes, as a result of historical and theological study, is the true Church of Jesus Christ.Part One of the book deals with \\"the age of false religion.\\" Here Schaeffer discusses the culture wars which polarize Christians and secularists. Needless to say, he thinks the secularists have largely won and now occupy positions of strategic strength. Much that he says here was anticipated by one of C.S. Lewis's incisive remarks in a 1954 letter: \\"'I do think the State is increasingly tyrannical . . . {it} exists not to protect our rights but to do us good or make us good--anyway, to do something to us or make us something. Hence the new name\\"leaders\\" for those who were once \\"rulers.\\" We are less their subjects than their wards, pupils or domestic animals. There is nothing left of which we can say to them, \\"Mind your own business.\\" Our whole lives are their business.'\\"(p. 27).The secularism which strides triumphantly under the guise of the therapeutic state came to power, Shaeffer argues, as a consequence of the \\"reductionistic rationalism\\" launched by Reformers such as Calvin.Protestant reformers didn't reform the Roman Catholic Church. They \\"created a rival Augustinian religion\\" which overemphasized original sin, predestination, justification by faith, etc. In denying freedom of the will, in desacramentalizing worship (and thus creation), in making faith purely subjective and individualistic, in creating pluralistic religious communities, the Reformers unwittingly sowed the seeds of destruction for Western Civilization.Consequently, there is little coherence to what we call \\"Christianity,\\" especially in America with its plethora of denominations and entrepreneurs. Everyone seems to decide for himself what constitutes the Faith. \\"Once it had been held by all Christians that one's Christian life rested on three equally important sustaining legs, much like a three legged stool. The first was adherence to changeless doctrine. The second was moral behavior. The third was participation in sacramental worship. These three interlocking facets of the Christian life were understood to provide the basis for how one went about being a Christian, as opposed to merely saying how one became a Christian\\" (p. 127).The legs of the stool have been strangely warped (if they still stand at all) in many \\"Christian\\" groups. Thus there has developed an amorphous \\"civil religion,\\" a political creed which carries with it a certain religious mood. Some of this took place as revivalists such as Charles G. Finney injected social reforms into their religious movements. Some of it occurred as politicians such as FDR devised \\"new deals\\" which stirred religious currents in adherents' souls, allowing folks to feel righteous by supporting (usually with other folks' money) entitlements for social justice. Lost in the process was the historic faith, the Church established by Christ and His Apostles.What's been largely lost in the West, Schaeffer argues, has been preserved in the East. Here, he says, in Part Two of the book, one finds the ancient truths of the \\"authentic orthodox faith\\"--the apostolic doctrines, the unchanged sacramental form of worship, the traditional standards of morality, which have always characterized true Christianity. Here he summarizes material found in works such as Ware's The Orthodox Way, accurately explaining basic tenets of the faith.Importantly, especially to us in the Wesleyan tradition, he stresses that Christians are not merely forgiven. If they're real believers, they're in the process of spiritual transformation. Too often Protestants have equated conversion with salvation, while in fact they're fundamentally different. Conversion starts the process of salvation, but \\"We are taught by the Church that the crown of salvation goes only to those who finish the race, not to the so-called Elect or to those who merely believe they are 'born again,' regardless of the content of their characters or actions\\" (p. 254).Though admitting Orthodoxy's own unique problems, Schaeffer urges spiritual pilgrims to find their way home, to the \\"Orthodox Faith.\\" It's the true Church, the presence among us of the ancient Truth. In the process, he hurls anathemas against the Reformed Protestants his father represented--and Roman Catholics of the liberal American sort. His turn to Orthodoxy (like Thomas Howard's turn to Roman Catholicism), it seems to me, helps us understand something of what's lacking in American evangelicalism.

His unresolved anger with his former evangelist self clouds his arguements."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I also found Frank Schaeffer's book to be something of a stumbling block. To describe the worship of Protestant Christians as &quot;counterfeit&quot; is really rather arrogant. How would he know (unless he's COMPLETELY hung up on the form it takes...and that would be a mistake)? Can he judge the content of every person's heart (spirit)? I, for one, leave that to God, in fear and trembling!Overall, my sense of the book was that it was an attack on something despised from someone who is very bitter. Makes me wonder how his relationship with his father was? (This is just an aside)I DO like his contention that the Orthodox Church doesn't try to figure the Living God out, as if we could. It seems profane to me that Western theologians (sorry Augustine, pardon Aquinas) would approach the non-corporeal, Transcendent Lord of the Universe with the intellectual equivalent of a broken ruler. Adoration and submission to His Holiness and Mystery do seem appropriate. Maybe there ARE better introductions to the Orthodox Faith out there (there MUST be)."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"_Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion_ by Frank Schaeffer is an attack on the current secularized American society from the perspective of a convert into the Orthodox Church. Shaeffer acknowledges that his book is not supposed to be scholarly, and that any errors in it are his own. First the negative things about _Dancing Alone_, and then I will describe what the books strengths are. It is typeset in some kind of goofy, rounded font where the \\"C's\\" look like \\"G's\\" which makes the text hard to concentrate on. The writing in the second half of the book is close to being done at random. Shaeffer makes endless references to Protestantism and to a lesser extent to Roman Catholicism and how they differ from Orthodox Christianity. The problem is that he tends, as another commentator noted, to make many vague generalizations about Protestantism. Protestants come in all shapes in sizes, and Schaeffer provides no research or insight into the specific differences between them, or how their different sects arose so that his statements could be placed in a more tangible context. He does not strike at the root of the problem by simply blaming Protestantism for the rise of modern secular society. Protestantism undoubtedly played a major role, but was not necessarily the sole determining factor. Also, Schaeffer goes way overboard in denigrating St. Augustine. Although St. Augustine did make some minor errors in his teachings on grace, he was not a \\"Calvinist\\" or a determinist in today's definition. St. Augustine's foibles do not take away, as Fr. Rose explains in his book on the controversy, St. Augustine's status as \\"a Father of Orthodox piety.\\"Now for the strong and insightful parts of Schaeffer's book, which is mostly contained in the first half. He is so radical that it is difficult to place him in any specific American political tradition, especially considering his criticism of Protestantism. He really is \\"dancing alone\\" as the title indicates. Schaeffer traces the Western deviation from St. Augustine's \\"overly rational\\" theology that took root in the Western Church under the Roman Popes. After the schism between the Latin speaking West and the Greek speaking East, the Roman Catholic Church officially adopted the theology of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas' theology was extremely rational, seeking its basis in the Greek philosophy particularly of Aristotle. The Roman Church developed a system of indulgences and the doctrine of Purgatory. Martin Luther, in his own interpretation of the Bible, condemned the Catholic practices as an unwarranted addition to the Scriptural teachings. The Protestant Reformation he touched off acted in reaction to many Catholic practices, which were derived from the original Orthodox Church. Protestantism became radically opposed to many sacramental aspects of the Christian tradition, particularly Calvinism and the Anabaptists. Calvinism came to influence the ultra-rationalistic notion of an entire mechanistic universe that God had predetermined according to set natural laws which could be quantified and expressed in mathematical equations. Anabaptism and the other groups of the \\"radical Reformation\\" brought subjective individualism to the Christian experience, instead of relying on the authority of Apostolic tradition. This has paved the way for feel-good materialism, Romanticism and the lack of unity when it comes to Church teachings and theological questions. As Protestant Christianity became either dry and rational on one end and wild and crazy on the other, modernism and materialism set in under the Capitalist and later Communist and Socialist varieties. The common heresy throughout all these groups is that they seek to replace God's revealed Truth with a kingdom of God on earth that is perfected through Human action. The road to Hell is indeed paved with good intentions. Calvin set up a dictatorship in Geneva, which ironically in many aspects was similar to Communist tyranny. The two movements had the similar goal of legislating morality to shape mankind. Such movements are bound to crash and burn eventually because they simply cannot accomplish what they do because of humanity's fallen nature. This has carried over into the founding of America following Revolutionary War. Contemporary American culture has developed from seemingly unrelated ideologies: rigid, self-righteous Puritanism; Romantic belief in good outcomes and progress; materialism embodied in the \\"American Dream\\"; militant secularism; a neo-conservatism which is actually the same as classical liberalism, and a host of others. One strong point of Schaeffer's book is how he notes the failure of the \\"secular right.\\" Despite the entire liberal whining about Ronald Regean, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Rush Limbaugh, George W. Bush, Richard Nixon and Bill O'Reilly, none of the \\"conservative\\" Presidential administrations have done anything to stop the flood of social liberalism. Today's academic conservatives are mostly concerned with economics. Instead of classical Marxism, Adam Smith's free market will bring salvation to the world. Despite the outward success of the West, an ungodly, anti-traditional, anti-Christian void beneath its surface is revealed. All in all, Schaeffer's _Dancing Alone_is a good book, but not a great one. He is definitely onto something very interesting in his outlook on American culture."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I am an Orthodox Christian (like Schaeffer, coming from Protestantism) and, after having watched a few of Schaeffer's talks on the Internet, bought a copy of \`Dancing Alone'. Unfortunately the book is seriously marred by Schaeffer's continual, and I would almost say obsessive, use of the hyphenated term \`Judeo-Christian'. Hardly a page passes with reference to our so-called Judeo-Christian tradition.Old Testament Judaism, as it existed at the time of Jesus, died with the destruction of the Temple in 70AD. What we have today is Rabbinic Judaism, a virulently anti-Christian revolutionary creed which has the rejection of Christ as it core founding principle. In this regard readers are encouraged to read Michael Hoffman's studies, \`Discovering Judaism' (or, a shorter version published as of \`Judaism's Strange Gods') and E. Michael Jones's \`The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit: And Its Impact on World History'. If the term \`Judeo-Christian' does have any meaning, it could only refer to the longest and most famous war is all of history. Otherwise, like \`political correctness' it is simply a silly oxymoron.Furthermore, although I agree with much of what Schaeffer writes about our degraded of the modern I do not consider \`Dancing Alone' the most useful book for anyone interested in learning about the Orthodox Tradition. For such readers I would recommend \`Bread & Water, Wine & Oil: An Orthodox' by Father Meletios Webber, and, particularly for Catholics and Protestants, Matthew Gallatin's \`Thirsting For God in a Land of Shallow Wells'. On a deeper level readers might want to study or the \`Life of the World: Sacraments and Orthodoxy' by Alexander Schmemann."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"All the reviews of this book give you a good idea of how this title can impact various people such diverse ways.All I want to add is that in May of 1997 as a &quot;freelance Evangelical&quot;, I went to hear Frank Schaeffer speak simply to find out what happened to &quot;Franky,&quot; son of Francis Schaeffer, the influential Evangelical thinker. I walked away overwhelmed and with an autographed copy of &quot;Dancing Alone&quot; in my hand. I devoured this book within days, and it set me on a course of studying the Early Church, re-evaluating the Protestant Reformation, and eventually &quot;coming home&quot; to the Orthodox Christian Church on Christmas Eve 1999.Thank you Frank, for speaking out as forcefully as your blessed dad used to do. You took me by surprise and got my attention."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"My journey was similar to his in some ways, although I didn't come from a strict Protestant family, we occaisionally went to a Methodist church a few times each year. Then I married as a young man and begrudgenly converted to Roman Catholic but didn't take the whole thing very seriously (unfortunately). Protestants to me always seemed like a bunch of bible thumpers who are obsessed with two things: sex and end times prophecy. To me many seemed so far out there that it surely seemed to be part of some science fiction freak show. Roman Catholicism on the other hand seemed more \\"traditional\\" but yet Americanized. And both seemed to be materialistic, greedy and consumerists.I'm a traditionalist. I want the REAL thing (I can't even stand the Designated Hitter in baseball!) So I began my journey with many, many books and college classes on \\"Historical Christianity\\" which led me to Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic churches, where I found Christianity that hasn't changed in 2000 years. I remained Catholic but now attend a Byzantine Catholic church. (The 22 Eastern Rite catholic churches came back into communion with Rome but mirror their Eastern Orthodox counterpart churches). To me, Eastern Christianity is the REAL DEAL! Everyone else has just changed too much (since Constantine) or just makes it up as they go (since Martin Luther).The American Roman Catholic or Protestant of today in no way,shape or form really resembles the original Christians the way the Orthodox do. This is a \\"must read\\" for people searching for the real thing!There is also a good book called \\"Will the REAL heretics please stand up\\" that was written by a Fundamentalist who brings up many of the same points.

Schaeffer's book patiently argues why Protestantism and the Latin Church are distortions of the Truth in their own respective ways. Schaeffer's book provides an analysis of the problems with our own American culture of individualism and ambition and demonstrates how much of it is at odds with Christ's message and the life we are called to lead. Pious Protestants and Catholics would agree but the life of these churches and their spirituality is not complete. Schaeffer does not claim that you have to be Orthodox to be saved or that you cannot lead a God-pleasing life as a Protestant of Catholic. This book is addressed to those who are interested in the full encounter with Christ's True Church and the life if affords one. He provides a discussion of the various doctrinal distortions of the Latin Church and its members in schism with it, all the Protestant denominations -- numbering around 26,000 apparently. He provides a clear explanation of Orthodox doctrine and provides other sources for consultation. Schaeffer's book is especially important for those considering the Latin church since many in the West are unfamilar with Orthodoxy. Some Catholics, who admire the Orthodox Liturgy because they have destroyed their own, and admire Orthodox spirituality involving -- among other things -- keeping the tradtional fasts, praying with icons, maintaining prayer rules and emphasizing monasticism, try and portray Orthodoxy as a part of the 'original Latin church.' Schaeffer's book provides a discussion of the erroneous, dangerous claims of the papists in this regard. Since the pope is consider by many as the universal spokesman for Christianity, those interested in Orthodoxy would do well to read this book before falling victim to Rome's claims that cannot be substantiated historically (as discussed by Clark Carlton, Lord Acton -- a Catholic himself, and Michael Whelton). The present pope's betrayal of Christianity through all manner of ecumenical activity, involving his receiving of the mark of Kali by Hindus, his ecumenical meeting at Asissi where he allowed buddhists to place a pagan idol on the Altar of St. Peter's Cathedral there, and his claim to non-christian religious leaders that Christianity has something to learn from these 'ancient traditions,' suggests that the pope thinks Christianity is incomplete and needs pagan, man-made thought systems to complete what Christ promised the Holy Spirit would guide! If you are interested in the Ancient Church, Schaeffer's book is an excellent place to begin. (For a video of the pope's strange, ecumenical activities -- including footage of liturgical dance in his presence which the catholic catechism forbids! -- consult the Center for Traditional Orthodox Studies; they have a 2 hour tape with the proof!)"},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"DANCING ALONE is a very well reasoned, no-holds-barred indictment of Roman Catholic structure, Western \\"Protestant\\" Christianity in general, and American Protestant Fundamentalism in particular. Mr. Schaeffer also dissects and flays cherished Protestant ideas which are, too often, poorly conceived, unhistorical, and downright silly. He also takes aim at nominal Christian theology, which the Church Fathers and Councils put to bed more than 1,700 years ago, yet are blindly touted as \\"new\\" or \\"modern.\\"Mr. Schaeffer's overall scholarship is excellent, if not near-flawless. To see how this so, and expand one's knowledge, I suggest perusing the book's fascinating bibliography (with comments). Then delve into studying these key works. Most all the books in DANCING ALONE's bibliography are available via Amazon.The critics of Mr. Schaeffer's book mostly whine about his no-holds-barred, tell-it-like-it-is style -- as a lame substitute for real, substantive criticism of his (perfect) grasp of theological and historical facts. Others prattle on about Mr. Schaeffer's so-called \\"lack\\" of compassion because he makes very clear, scholarly theological points, which may -- all too often -- indict someone's long-held and emotionally mired belief system; Mr. Schaeffer tears apart faith which is at odds with history, facts, and logic; he unflinchingly unveils what for too many of us, nothing more than long-held falsehoods, half-truths and wishful thinking -- not reality; not Truth."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"It's unfortunate that Schaeffer, like so many Protestants who search for the truth, stop at Constantinople rather than completing the journey to Rome. Despite enormous patristic and historical support for Rome's papal claims, so many move from the Protestantism stemming from the heresies of Luther and Calvin to the Protestantism stemming from the grandfather of them all, Photius the Proto-Protestant. I made the same journey as Schaeffer, at the same time, but I actually read the Fathers and ended up in Rome. A much better select would be &quot;Rome Sweet Home : Our Journey to Catholicism&quot; -- Scott Hahn, Kimberly Hahn (Contributor); Paperback"},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Frank Schaeffer's book is an excellent introduction for those interested or curious about Eastern Orthodoxy. As the son of perhaps this country's most famous Protestant theologian, Francis Schaeffer, Mr. Schaeffer's book is instructive on a number of levels. The book is part testimonial, part explanation and defense of Orthodox theology, and part cultural critique of contemporary American culture. Mr. Schaeffer sets out to explain why our individualistic, feel-good social ethic has compromised many denominations and why Orthodoxy offers an organic, living form of worship and piety that is Christianity in its completest form. Mr. Schaeffer references Church Fathers and the Ecumenical Councils in his explanation of Orthodox doctrine in his defense of Orthodoxy's claim to being the living, True Church of Christ. This may upset or surpise some who accept today's ecumenical claim that all the denominations taken together are branches of the one true Church; but, as Mr. Schaeffer points out, you cannot have a number of Churches who all claim different things that contradict the claims of each other comprising the one True Church: this is a contradiction that makes no sense. Mr. Schaeffer's book will be of particular interest to anyone interested in Orthodoxy, whether he be Orthodox, Protestant, or Catholic. This is important since Mr. Schaeffer IS NOT saying (nor does the Orthodox Church teach as much) that you can only be saved or please God if you are Orthodox; the mystery of a man's salvation is something man cannot judge and is for God alone to know. However, Mr. Schaeffer is interested in establishing the historical and theological case that establishes Orthodoxy as the one True Church of Christ that possess the fullness of Christ's Truth that other churches that split from Her do not possess. In a world where many traditional forms of worship and piety have been forgotten or dismissed, where other liturgical churches have abandoned or gutted their liturgies, taking a serious look at Orthodoxy might be of value for those disaffected with modernist denominations and parishes."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Frank Schaeffer's &quot; Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion &quot; is a challenging book. Not necessarily because of it's effective reasoning but because of its flaws.Like many other converts, Schaeffer is attracted to the most &quot; traditionalist &quot; theology and has become a bit of an extremest. I found a great deal of his writing to be overly strident and often repetitive. I agree with many other reviewers that believe that this books cries out for editing. I think he could have made his points very effectively in a book half its size. There are places where he seems to be ranting. His attacks on homosexuality, abortion and feminism are lacking in depth and poorly fashioned.It is important to state that, contrary to how this book is presented, it is not about one mans journey to Orthodoxy. Rather it is a lengthy presentation of the authors belief in the errors of thinking that typify the theological underpinnings of Protestantism, and to a slightly lesser extent Roman Catholicism.I am, like Schaeffer, a convert to Orthodoxy. However, though I fundamentally agree with much of what he has written, but I do not like the anger that his writing reflects. I also was very disappointed that he didn't write a single word about the Orthodox view of capital punishment. What he does offer is a very descriptive ( but hardly unique ) critique of the history of the Reformation.I was taught by my father to never pin your adversary down ( in a debate, formal or otherwise ) with no wiggle room. The most successful approach to persuasiveness is to let your competition agree with you in a manor that doesn't insult their dignity. This book possesses no such tact, and as a result I suspect that a non Orthodox individual might quite reasonably feel insulted and put on the defensive by its aggressive nature.I believe that this is not a good introductory book on Orthodoxy. Its ideal audience might be individuals who have been born into Orthodoxy or whose conversion is complete. Sadly, I think that Schaeffer has forgotten to describe the extent to which Orthodoxy is a faith of deep compassion, with an unshakable foundation built on the unconditional love of God for his people. It is a tradition that has tolerated dissent within its ranks and has been ( at its best ) highly reluctant to pass judgment on others."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"When Frank Schaeffer spoke at the Festival of Orthodoxy in Dallas in February 2005, he said that he was too harsh in this book, and that were he able to do it over, he would rewrite half of it. I don't know which half or which parts he would rewrite, but I agree with him about the harshness of his tone, which to me seriously degrades the value and trustworthiness of this book. It's interesting, but Schaeffer's jeremiad makes for wearisome reading after awhile."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"I found this book to be stunning. There are two main theses I see in the book. One is how first the Catholic Church and then especially the Protestant Church are responsible for the malaise of today's Western culture (the Catholic Church is primarily responsible because its excesses caused the Reformation backlash). The other thesis is his attempt to show that the Orthodox Church is the one true church.Schaeffer does not mince words in this book; he writes with a hard-hitting style that has no problems with giving out devastating criticism. He goes after both the political Left and Right in America; some prominent figures in church history that he levels harsh criticism against include St. Augustine, Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, Charles Finney, and Billy Graham. He attacks Anabaptists harshly, accusing them of anarchy, and gives Quakers a similar rough treatment. If you get offended easily, don't read this book.I find his thesis that Protestantism is the cause of the secularization and moral downfall of Western civilization to be convincing in itself, although I can't help but wonder if the same secularization might have eventually occurred anyway even if the Reformation hadn't happened. It was enlightening to me because I had always attributed the sad state of our society, dominated by the idea of relative truth, as going back to Darwin, since the elimination of a Creator God meant man could do whatever he wanted. But this book convinced me that the roots of our current cultural war go back way, way before Darwin, to the early centuries of the Christian church, although the biggest changes were brought on by the Protestant Reformation.The second thesis of the book I find to be less convincing. In itself, his argument that the Orthodox Church is the one true church is relatively convincing, but when I step away and consider where the Orthodox Church is today, and compare it to the vitality of the Protestant church, I have a hard time agreeing with Schaeffer that the Protestant church is a scourge to Christianity and separated from the body of Christ.On the other side of the coin, his book has created in interest within me to do more research about the early church and about the Orthodox Church in particular, since I know virtually nothing about it, apart from what I've read in this book.This book would get a 5-star rating because of its ability to radically change my way of thinking and outlook on history and the church. What drops it down to the 4 level: 1) This book badly needs a competent copywriter. There are way too many spelling and punctuation errors, which are distracting, especially in a book with such heady material. (My copy has a different cover from the one pictured, though, so I hope there is a new edition that took care of all the spelling and punctuation errors.) 2) The font is distracting. 3) The book seems a bit unorganized. For example, there is a chapter on abortion thrown in between chapters describing the teachings of the Orthodox Church. Why is it there, rather than with the rest of the chapters on societal issues? So these weaknesses drag the book down to a 4 level, but 4 in my book is \\"Excellent.\\" (See \\"About Me\\" for a full description of my ratings.)If you want to be challenged in your thinking and can take someone hitting you over the head with their beliefs and the butchering of sacred cows, go for it. This book will certainly engage you."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"At first read, Frank Schaeffer's diatribe against Protestantism is unsettling. It would be simple to write off his fervor as pent-up anger if his subject was anything else. However, Mr. Schaeffer is writing of the ONE, TRUE, CHURCH &lt;sic&gt;, which he has come to believe is the Orthodox faith. The correct tone when instructing others in a serious matter in which they are mistaken is staunch authoritarianism, mixed well with compassion and personal relevance. Mr. Schaeffer combines these elements well, and takes the reader on a soul-wringing trip through history.In the first section of the book, Mr. Schaeffer documents the history of Protestantism and draws connections between its strayed theology and many of society's ills. Though this section is dry if you are not a history buff, it is necessary to set up the argument for the Orthodox Church.I grew up in a very Protestant home, and after a period of soul-searching and questioning, motivated by the desire to be &quot;different and separate&quot;, I chose a Protestant church home. What characterizes Protestantism above all else is incessant questioning-a personal proof of faith based on what the individual chooses to believe and how they interpret scripture. I have yet to lose this knack for picking and choosing, so in my very Protestant way, let me tell you what I like about Orthodoxy as Mr. Schaeffer describes it:1. Orthodoxy is a sure thing! If I'm right, and in the spirit of democracy, you are right, then I end up being wrong. Not so in the Orthodox Church. There: &quot;this is right, this is what the Church has always taught.&quot;2. I have always believed the Bible to be the infallible word of God, protected and passed down to us through the ages. The Orthodox Church didn't even have the canon of the New Testament when it began. That part of the Bible grew out of the tradition and development of the Church!3. Who is the Orthodox Church to say they have the ONE TRUE WAY ?!? Well, they do have documentation of the succession from the apostles, and Christ gave special dispensation to those MEN to carry out the work of the church. Ok, well, who's to say that they haven't had outside influence and that their worship is just as different from the New Testament Church as Mine is?!? Ok, but the apostles to whom Christ gave those special powers and instructions to start THIS Church said, &quot;...The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&quot;I received this book as gift from my step-father (who I love, and who loves me as real as you can get!) He sent this book from Amazon.com via post while I was making wedding preparations (and almost got me in trouble for spending money on-line!) and then called two days later to see if I had read it, and what I had thought. I hadn't even touched it yet. I did get to read it in the Mojave on my Annual Training with the Texas Army National Guard. I can't say that I am converted because I have yet to do all of the research (and there isn't an Orthodox Church where I live). But it has certainly made points I can not ignore. Frank Schaeffer continues in his father's footsteps as an insightful theologian, sensitive to the evil of relativism in our society."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Frank Schaeffer, a.k.a. Franky, was an inspiration to many evangelicals in the 80s. The opening chapter of his book \\"A Time for Anger\\", in which for several pages he documents the lunatic contradictions of advances in prenatal medicine contrasted with pro-abortion militancy is one of the most brilliant and compelling satires I have ever read. But Franky became disillusioned with the wishy-washy response of evangelicals to the issues of the day, Evangelical provincialism related to the arts and soon seemed to fade from sight.This book documents that disillusionment, as he studied the early church with others and eventually embraced Orthodoxy.He provides many insightful critiques of the shortcomings of Evangelicalism. His methodology follows in father's, in many respects, seeing roots of ideas in earlier eras which blossomed into worldviews that ran counter to essential Christianity. Why did Frank wind up in a different place than Francis?Francis was often accused (unjustly) of reductionism, condensing complex historical movements into tidy little compartments. But Francis was at least careful to hedge his conclusions and tended to connect the dots well. Frank, on the other hand, speaks in bold and sometimes condescending terms, and frustratingly makes huge leaps of logic. He builds a foundation from A to B to C, then leaps all the way to Z and pronounces his conclusion inevitable.Hence, where Francis Schaeffer lamented the rise of rationalism and its effects on secular and Christian thought, Frank instead blames rationalism on Augustine and the Reformers. It is as if all ideas which have developed in the Western world are constructions of confused Western theology and no ideas sprung from thought outside the church. He criticises virtually everything in the west, democracy included, and lays the blame for every ill from rampant abortion on demand to even theological excesses within the American Orthodox church on Protestantism. The key point, hammered mercilessly, is that rationalistic theology led to individualism, individualism led to endless division, and endless division led to pluralism and a lack of any solid moral compass. Western Christianity was not influenced, then, by secular and anti-Christian philosophies, rather Protestanism caused those philosophies by cutting theology away from \\"holy tradition\\".It is not that his logic from A to B to C is faulty or that his base points are not well taken. In fact some of the early points are rather compelling. But his leaps from C to Z is so outrageous as to make every previous point irrelevant.Daniel Clenendin's, or Kallistos Ware's books on Orthodoxy are much more worthwhile for a Protestant who wants to understand the Eastern Church. If you are just curious to know what happened to Franky Schaeffer, this is the definitive answer."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Considering the author's willingness to lay bare aspects of other people's lives in his autobiographical novels (_Portofino_ and _Saving Grandma_), his reticence in discussing personal aspects of his conversion from evangelical Christianity to Greek Orthodoxy suprised me.In many evangelical quarters in the United States (and perhaps to some extent in Europe), the surname &quot;Schaeffer&quot; carries a particular intellectual and spiritual cachet. On the former, this book does not disappoint. As neatly and thoroughly as ever his father fileted and dissected secular humanism, Frank Schaeffer carves up the failure -- in his perhaps less than completely objective view; see his novels -- of evangelicals to push back against the incursions of modernism.Some people will find this approach sufficient; I did not. First, as I have already indicated, Mr Schaeffer does not to my thinking adequately -- or, really, at all -- address the personal quest that is the foundation of religious seeking. He tars evangelicals and Roman Catholics with a broad brush, without explaining the effects that his own steeping in this kind of &quot;old time religion&quot; had on him, his marriage, his work, and his parenting. He has gone over to Mount Athos, in a sense, without a personal explanation, rather like a young man who drops out of school and enlists in the army unbeknownst to his parents because &quot;there's a war on&quot;. Well, yes. But there's always war _someplace_ in the world; what were YOUR reasons for enlisting now? In this book, we read the philosophical, historic, and ultimately political reasons. I don't think Mr Schaeffer addresses, even obliquely, the personal reasons for his enlistment.Yet Mr Schaeffer in his foreword frames this as a personal work and thus begs to reference all his mentions of American history, for instance, to a single source. This I could understand and even accept if he were to address the often painful issues that accompany any kind of religious conversion. But I don't think he does. He makes grand arguments and draws conclusions based on patently (and self-admittedly) limited sources, which in some ways represents the greatest weaknesses of his father's works.I would welcome a more introspective work on this subject and I suspect that many readers would anticipate this being such a book. It is not. In a Greek sense, broadly one might say that this is far more Thucydides than Herodotus: lots of speeches, little conversation. Some readers, as evidenced by other reviews, find that approach more than satisfactory. I did not."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"Frank Schaeffer well articulates the tensions, frustrations, heartbreaks, and yes, the anger, felt by many pious Christians of Protestant Confessions whose Churches never 'fed' them very well, and then left them entirely for the stagnant pools of political 'correctness' and wanton secularism.I read this book after having left Protestantism, as practiced by the Episcopal Church of the USA. I was exploring Orthodoxy in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. I found Dancing Alone to be enormously instructive in that the author's focus, logic, and sound research articulated why I had become so ill-at-ease with my former church, and why the Orthodox Church has offered (for nearly 2,000 years) that which I sought.A rather glaring drawback of this book is the lack of editorial intervention. Mr. Schaeffer makes his points over and over again within the respective chapters, often coming close to beating the proverbial dead horse. Once you have gotten the argument in a chapter, and read enough substantiating evidence, you may proceed to the next chapter without fear of missing new material.I was baptized into the Church on Transfiguration Day 1997."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"As a new convert to Orthodoxy from absolute athieism, I was thrilled to read this book. Yes, Frank seems a bit bitter, but so am I. I went to a &quot;Christian&quot; school and learned the wonders of Luther and Calvin and how the end justified the means, no matter how abrasive their tactics were. Church was tedious and either entertaining or incredibly dull and life was a series of listening to the latest Christian band or of reading the latest book, always modernised and changing. I ran from Protestantism, screaming and pulling out my hair.Orthodoxy was different. As I began relating my experiences to one of my parishners, she suggested I read Schaeffer's book as I'd connect with him. He so blatantly uncoveres the mediocrity to which modern day Protestantism and Modernised Roman Catholics adhere to. He shows how Christianity is an adjective that anyone can use in these faiths, but how there is One True Church that has not changed in almost 2000 years.He shows where we as an American society started to go wrong and how we are more concerned with feeling good than in working on getting closer to our Creator.He just doesn't slam Protestants, he shakes up many Orthodox churches that are no more than ethnic Elks Clubs. Frank searches for authenticity and he has a right to be upset where his anger shows."},{"Title":"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion","review":"In &quot;Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion&quot;, Frank Schaeffer argues that the Orthodox Church is the only church that has remained faithful to the ancient Christian Church. All of the evils that we are experiencing in America today are a result of the paganism of our culture on the one hand and the relativism generated by an array of false religions on the other hand. Noteably, these false religions include the Roman Catholic Church and its invention of a &quot;papal dictatorship&quot; and the various schismatic Protestant churches who have &quot;rebelled against the Holy Tradition of the Church&quot;. The cure for much of the evil that we are currently experiencing is for Roman Catholics and Protestants to return to the Truth and the true worship of Jesus Christ which can only be found in the Orthodox Church.Faithful Protestant and Catholics would agree with Mr. Schaeffer's critique of the immorality of our generation and the need for people's lives to be transformed by Jesus Christ. But as a person whose life has been changed by Jesus, whose faith has been established and nurtured in one of the Evangelical Protestant churches, it might not come as a surprise that I can't accept all that Mr. Schaeffer has to say.While his viewpoint is theoretically possible, it fails an important test: it doesn't agree with reality, that is, the reality of God's Spirit working in the other Christian churches. If the exclusive claim he makes for the Orthodox church was true, we should not see the things that we do see occurring outside of the Orthodox church: people trusting in Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Lord when such faith did not exist before, people acquiring a thirst for the Word of God when it did not exist before, people displaying the fruit of the Spirit when it did not exist before, relationships being healed that were broken before, people being physically healed who were previously afflicted with disease or disability. For example, our church supports a native missionary in India who has witnessed tens of thousands of Hindu converts to Christ in his lifetime. In some cases, entire villages have been converted as the result of physical healings by the Holy Spirit. Seeing the fruit and power of this ministry is like witnessing scenes right from the book of Acts. These observations remind me of Jesus comparing the Holy Spirit to the wind. The Spirit operates in a mysterious way that is not subject to human control or the exclusive claims of men.Mr. Schaeffer addresses many doctrines of the faith but the dispute over authority in the church is the heart of all of the issues. Mr. Schaeffer argues that because the Protestant churches cannot trace a physical succession of Christian leaders back to the apostles they are not legitimate inheritors of apostolic authority and are rightly characterized as &quot;false churches&quot;.Let me compare the Orthodox view of authority, as it has been vigorously stated by Frank Schaeffer, with the Evangelical view of authority that I have been instructed in. There is a tendency in people to elevate form over substance. To insist that a church must be a part of a physical succession of Christian leaders going back to the apostles before it can be regarded as having apostolic authority is one example of elevating form over substance. For example, John the Baptist rebuked the Jewish leaders who prided themselves as being physical descendents of Abraham. He said, &quot;Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.&quot; (Luke 3:8) The substance of the matter is this: having apostolic authority is contingent on fidelity to the apostle's teachings as they are revealed to us in the Scriptures.Evangelicals do not throw out the authority of the Church, the Apostle's, Nicene, and Chalcedonian creeds, or the wisdom of previous generations of Christians. The dispute between the two viewpoints concerns the relationship between the authority of the Church and the authority of the Scriptures. The Orthodox view of authority is that the Church and the Scriptures are intimately related sources of authority standing together on the same plane. Moreover, the canon of Scripture was established by the Church when she accepted certain books and rejected others. By contrast, Evangelicals understand that the Church's authority is always subordinate to the authority of the Scriptures. For example, the creeds of the early Church are authoritative because they are in agreement with the Scriptures. Evangelicals understand the canon of Scripture in this way: Just as Isaac Newton did not create the law of gravity, the Church did not create the canon of Scripture. The Holy Spirit enabled the Church to recognize the canon of Scripture that God had already sovereignly determined. Therefore, God and His inspired Word is always the primary and absolute authority. The Church's judgments are authoritative when she speaks and acts in agreement with His inspired Word. For example, Saint Paul asserts &quot;but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!&quot; (Galatians 1:8) This passage implies that the gospel message itself has an antecedent authority to the apostle who delivers the message.Both Orthodox and Evangelical Christians esteem the Scriptures as the Word of God. But I choose the Evangelical viewpoint because it does not deny the work of the Spirit that is indisputably present in other Christian churches. I don't disrespect the Spirit's work in the Orthodox church. But I am unpersuaded that the exclusive claim that Frank Schaeffer makes is true."},{"Title":"Sheltered by God's Love: 52 Bible Lessons for Senior Adults","review":"&quot;Sheltered By God's Love&quot; is an excellent adult bible study resourse for groups or individuals.These 52 Bible studies are a resource for anyone wanting or needing to hear the Good News.

The actions and accomplishments of the Royal Navy is known to many people but somehow, the deeds of the Royal Navy during the last year of the Pacific War remains somewhat casted in the shadows of the mighty American Navy that dominated the show. In this book, the author John Winton attempts to remedy that oversight with a very interesting and reflective book on the British naval activities in the Pacific during the last year of the war.The book reflects not only the military activities of the British navy but also the initial shortcomings of this overstretch navy and the initial disdain that many Americans felt toward them. Its interesting to read how the British overcame their design flaws (like wooden carrier decks) and managed to gained the respects of the American naval leaders to whom they were closely allied to. It also tell how the British naval efforts helped win the war in Burma and against Japanese territories elsewhere in that general region.The book proves to be well written and easy to read. I thought the only real weakness came when the author insert too many accounts of the European theater of operation as the background material. But this book covers an area of military history in the Pacific War that haven't been written up in great detail.

It begins just after the Ides of March assassination of Julius Caesar in the Senate and the inheritance of his nephew Octavius (who was adopted as Caesar's son) to his titles and wealth at age 18. Octavius evolves into the Caesar Augustus of the book's title. The novel ends with the death of Augustus.The novelist assumes some familiarity with the main characters and events of that time. If you are not familiar, then before taking up the novel I would recommend at least reading Encyclopedia Brittanica articles on Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Octavius, Cleopatra, and perhaps Cicero and Brutus.

The action in this book is nonexistent,too much 3rd person telling of events that happend to others, and not enough of Augustus own words.All in all a very well written book, but this is not a book for an action fan like me."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"Despite being only 305 pages long, this book took much much longer to finish off than another book of similar subject and similar length.A warning: this novel is made up entirely of fictional letters written by various characters, some apparently randomly chosen to write, others very important characters. They essentially relay the story through their own eyes for the reader.Some of the letters are superb, good reads, and provide some unique and indepth insight into the book. Alas, it appears Julia, Augustus's daughter, provides the best of such, describing her sordid affairs with her friends, her momentary status as Goddess of a cult in an eastern Greek village near Ilium. She is a great writer and her tales hold some of the most interesting and appealing aspects.Other letters are very short, tart, and seemingly pointless, such as Livia's stern letter to Tiberius telling him not to divorce Julia despite knowing about her affairs, which is then rendered useless when his spy who has been feeding him information tells him the exact same thing with better vocabulary, and mentioning Livia agreeing with him.Much of the letters drag or drift on listlessly for long gaps of time, finally addressing the issue at hand as an afterthought, while they're busy chuggering on about Roman honor and virtue or whatever, the same stuff over and over and over.Some of the more philosophical and poetic writers, being given by the author the role of telling us indirectly some of the more important information, end up rambling on and on about how great Rome is, or what a character Augustus is, or essentially doing the monotonous intellectual doublespeak that seems to serve no purpose, not even to insult or compliment anyone. These parts get very difficult to read, as you are constantly drifting off the page and having to start over again.At last comes the end. After Julia's last journal entry (a very good one) we come into a whole chapter written by Augustus himself (who had received very little insight throughout the entire novel) written over a period of three days only weeks away from his death.Augustus is absolutely riveting in telling us about his life, how he feels about it, how he feels so cold and alone with all of his true friends---Agrippa, Maecenas, Salvidienus Rufus, Horatius Flaccus, and Vergilius Maro---and contemplating in very rich, almost Shakespearean language, his thoughts on life and death, the regrets and accomplishments of his life, etc.It's an utterly astounding chapter and really is the best part of the book. Unfortunately, it's flawed by being WAY TOO LONG.For THREE DAYS worth of letter writing, Augustus goes on and on with his philosophical bantering, and after the ninth page out of twenty or so, you start to get sick of hearing him drone on and on like a broken philosopher. It starts out powerful, and begins to steadily slip as Augustus repeats himself multiple times and accomplishes nothing in his mindless droning.The epilogue is a somewhat pointless addendum by Augustus's physician for the last few months of his life, who has the least amount of insight it seems, talking about Rome (what a surprise) and what Augustus did for Rome, and hoping Augustus's Rome will prosper under its new hope, Emperor Nero3.5/5"},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"\\"Augustus\\", by John Williams, I can quite contentedly report, is equally as robust as Robert Graves' \\"I, Claudius\\", while being readable, true to history (or as close as one can come with a thorough, but not quite complete, historical record), and remaining undeniably literary. This is most definitely a character-driven novel and, at under 300 pages, tautly evokes the lives, politics, regrets, loves and emotions of the Roman Empire's elite.Somehow John William's \\"Augustus\\" flew under the radar of my historical fiction passion until I was recently prepping for a family vacation to Italy. During my first visit to Italy three years ago, I dutiful read Graves' \\"I, Claudius\\", and thoroughly enjoyed the vividly detailed Roman Empire replete with the larger than life soap opera-like affairs of it's colorful characters. For me personally, Graves set a standard with his seamless blend of history and fiction.The narrative is comprised of letters exchanged among a number of the nobility of Augustus' world, with focus on his friends Marcus Agrippa and Maecenas, a smattering of other well-known personalities from this early period of the Empire, like the poet/philosophers, Horace, Virgil, Nicolaus of Damascus, foes like Marcus Antonius, his wife Livia, and his daughter Julia whom he was forced to banish from Rome towards the end of his reign.Through their pens and correspondence, we learn about the life of Augustus, who actually never accepted his role as Emperor, but history defines as the first Emperor nonetheless. His closest, and lifelong friends discuss Augustus as a teen - when he was still known as Octavian; Maecenas recalls, \\"I thought that he might become a scholar of leisure, or a man of letters; I did not think he had the energy to become even a senator, to which his name and wealth entitled him.\\"In a particularly poignant scene, Augustus' friends describe his emotional reaction to the news of his beloved uncle Julius Caesar's murder, but only later do we read his first-hand account of the world-changing event. In fact, Williams quite deftly builds his narrative around Augustus without incorporating him immediately into the flow of the correspondence. It's not until the last 50 pages or so that we read directly from the Emperor's own pen, as he reflects upon his life and legacy. He, in fact, constructs his own eulogy: an ode to Rome and its people. He sees his 40+ years as ruler of the Roman world through clear eyes as he openly and honestly discusses what it means to be Emperor and what it means to be Roman.Williams captures the strong spirit of both Augustus and his daughter Julia. He conveys the equally painful elements of their existence that are not about living a life, but living a life as dictated by culture, by honor, and by a quiet acceptance of a fate imposed on their lives, rather than a life chosen to live.The heart of the novel resides within Augustus' only blood child - Julia. We read through the eyes of a daughter, her unique perspective on arguably the world's most important person at the time. Her innocent view is first warped during a Triumph held in the streets of Rome honoring Augustus' triple victories over Dalmatia, Actium, and Egypt. When she sees her father approaching the city, the people of Rome cheering wildly by the side of the parade route, she writes, \\"...when he came near enough to recognize us, he spurred his horse ahead of the soldiers he was leading, and caught me in his arms, laughing...and he was my father. It was, perhaps, the last time that I was able to think of him as if he were a father like any other.\\" She writes later, \\"...during his speeches and the sacrifices and the presentations, I felt him drawn away from me in the world that I was beginning to see for the first time.\\"We learn through friends and foe alike, of the unique love the Emperor had for his daughter, and we learn of the singular spirit and sharpness embodied within Julia, rare it seems for women of the time. She decorously serves her role as a political pawn in her father's machinations, marrying a cousin while still in her teens intended to seal Augustus' succession. Widowed only a few years later, she's then asked to marry her father's closest friend, Agrippa, a full generation older than she, bears several children, and again finds herself widowed when Agrippa suddenly dies. When forced to marry Augustus' stepson Tiberius, Julia finds it too much to bear, and while Tiberius protects the empires most extreme borders, she discovers her inner woman, and finally allows herself enjoyment in a newfound sexual freedom.In a stirring scene, Julia remembers the meeting with her father, as he calls her out for adultery and explains to his daughter that almost every one of her lovers was found to be plotting against Tiberius, and Augustus himself. Her banishment was intended to protect her from the political forces that would implicate her as part of the conspiracy and ultimately doom her to execution. I couldn't help but feel the fatherly pain, strong and bitter as one's child absorbs the shock of such a severe punishment.This is an absolutely wonderful book and would serve as a terrific way to expose a reader to this amazing period of history. I highly recommend \\"Augustus\\" which reads as a singularly successful work of literature."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"This book really connected me with the life and times of Octavian. I felt a very strong personal connection that I have seldom felt in other historical fiction I have read. The early part of the book describes his attempts to establish himself as more than just a curiosity(a 17 year old heir to Caesar)in Rome after returning, against his parents advice, following the assassination of Caesar and the reading of his will, which left him sole heir to Casar's fortune and power, if he can only find the will and path to pursue it. He is pitted against the likes of Antony and Cicero, major powers that have stepped into the power vacuum left after Caesar's assasination. This portion of the book conveys a very strong sense of how Octavian must have felt about his ultimately successful campaign to take what he felt was rightfully his, political power. He worked , with his small group of loyalists, very hard to be taken seriously, and was beset by doubt and fear. The uncertainty he felt, in his polical manuevering, is palpable. The end of the book is exceptionally lyrical and beatifully written, as Augustus reviews his life. It is a powerful but also quiet book that elicited within me strong feelings of fear, melancholy, sadness and, ultimately, hope. Augustus led an incredible life that he made for himself through his intellect, courage, stubbornness, and will. His life confirmed the potential that Caesar saw in their short time together in Gaul."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"The author, John Williams, died in 1994. I'm not sure but I believe this is the only book he wrote about ancient Rome. This makes this work all the more amazing. It is told from a series of fictional letters and journal entries but is historically accurate. I assume it should be classified as a novel, but the 'letters' are so real, and the characters writing them are so fully evolved, that you feel more like a voyeur than a reader. Cleopatra's doublecross of Marc Antony, Marc Anthony's doublecross of Octavius, Livia's doublecross of Octavius' daughter, Julia... it is all laid out in a way that answers the questions about Rome in the years leading up to ZERO and beyond. A note of caution, however. In order to get the most fun out of reading this book, I recommend a fairly good grounding in this era of Roman history. In particular, I would suggest RUBICON by Tom Holland and CICERO by Anthony Everitt. But for those who know their Catullus from their Brutus and their Ovid from their Virgil... feel free to dive into a wonderful and almost poetic experience. The last 20 pages of the semi-divine Augustus Caesar reflecting on life are among the most moving I have ever read. Fun!"},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"If you love Roman history, you'll love this book. It'll give you interesting and new details, as well as new perspectives from which to look at the history of the late Republic and early Roman Empire.If you don't have any background in Roman history, however, this book may mystify you. It's extremely detailed and well-researched. There are some arguments that can be made about his using kid-gloves with Augustus regarding Cicero's death, the proscriptions, and a number of other dastardly deeds. These are never Augustus' fault, and if they are, well, they are what any of us would have done in his place the author seems to say. And Marc Antony is not just presented here as a loser, but also as a madman. Still, this is a book about Augustus written with great affection, so I don't find anything unnatural about the author choosing to interpret all events in his favor.The story is written in non-chronological order in the form of letters and journal entries, from various perspectives. I personally felt that this made the story hard to follow. Moreover, because of this, it's almost impossible to get to know any of the characters particularly well as they must share the stage with so many others. If there is any character we get to know well, it is Julia, who all but steals the show. This is unfortunate because the one person we end up knowing the least is the subject of the book. Augustus.When you close the book at the end of the night, you have learned a great deal, but you know little more about Augustus the person than before you started reading. And that's regrettable."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"I generally do not seek out \\"epistolary\\" books (isn't that what this is?), but Williams' novel really works. There are so many characters chiming in, and it's like watching a chess match from above; we are at a distance which allows us to see all the players and their moves, though not necessarily the entire psychology behind their motivations.On that note, the way the story comes out is (as some of the negative reviews suggest) rather impersonal, and the reader does feel somewhat distant from Octavius pretty much throughout the novel, but I don't see this as altogether a weakness. We see the young man's pain and hesitation and resolve through the words of his friends and enemies, and the effect of this is, for me, very moving. When Rufus tells us, in a letter, that 19-year old Octavius (who soon must go to war with Marcus Antonius) is not his former self, that the gravity of his new life has made him humorless and cold, we can feel Octavius as a friend. We don't have to be inside his head to understand why he is acting the way he is, and we can easily imagine his overwhelmed state of mind. Though we do get Octavius's worldview quite clearly at the end of the book, in a wonderful letter to the Syrian Nicholas.The story does slow down in places. Julia takes over a good fourth of the book, which is a bit too much for me. But, for the most part the letters and journals weave very well with each other. There are a few seemingly unnecessary tangents, but not as many as I anticipated from a novel in letters/journals/etc. Williams gets the story out and it's a good one. Also, for those who may shy away from historical stuff: I don't know anything about Roman history, and I'm not that smart, but I was able to follow the book and characters all the way."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"I had previously read Williams' \\"Stoner\\" -- and thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect when he tackled an historical subject, but should have figured that he'd get the human aspect of it just right. That's exactly what he did. \\"Octavius\\" retells the story of the Roman Empire in the years of Octavius Caesar's reign, following the assassination of his adoptive father, Julius Caesar. The story is riveting -- well told through excerpts from the diaries, memoranda and missives of Octavius and many of his contemporaries. The characters are wonderfully drawn. A very easy and informative read. I have no idea if Williams' depiction of the title character's humanity and personality is accurate, but if so he was a remarkable ruler. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"Lovers of historical fiction, which I count myself among, can justly complain that standard HF often lacks psychological depth. Run of the mill work focuses upon the denouement of a well-known historical event, a revisionist theory (the bad-guy-not-so-bad genre) or 20th-21st century values hoisted and foisted upon long-dead people who shared none of our morals or mores.Augustus is so much more than run of the mill. Williams portrays Gaius Octavius Caesar as the consumate politician: talented, determined and ambitious. Especially ambitious. In a career that spanned 60 years, Augustus as he came to be known ended civil strife that had plagued Rome for centuries, expanded and secured the Empire's borders, and chaperoned the fractious and violent Italians into a Golden Age. In doing so, he sacrifices every happiness \\"ordinary\\" folk hold dear, myopically focused on exercising the levers of power to enact the reforms and stability he values.The book is divided into three parts. Part I focuses upon his rise through the defeat of Marc Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. Part II introduces Augustus' daughter Julia into the narrative--a lovely relationship that sours in large part because of the father's absolute willingness to sacrifice her happiness to his ambition. It is a credit to the author that our protagonist is willing to look at Julia's betrayal and not only understand it, but forgive it as well.The third and briefest section is a mediation by the Emperor about his life and its value. It is unflinching in its honesty a thoroughly unsentimental look at what Augustus did and whether it was worth it.

Almost all the characters in the story (one even gets to read a letter from Cleopatra) leave an account of events. Even though the correspondance dates from different years the story is told in chronological order.

Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction in 1973, this is the work of a writer whose skill with language has probably not been equaled since his death some ten plus years ago. \\"Augustus\\" is a personal history of the remarkable man who inherited from his uncle, Julius Caesar, a sense of mission to save the faltering Roman Republic and succeeded in making the city state into a well organized, stable and prosperous empire. The author argues, through fictionalized letters between Augustus, his family, friends and rivals, that the reluctant emperor, who preferred the title \\"First Citizen of Rome\\", made painful personal choices and sacrifices throughout his life, all in the interest in protecting the Roman state. The last chapter of the book, written as a letter to his last living old friend--Nicolas of Damascus--is Augustus' final reflection on his life. It is as poignant a swan song as you can find in literature and probably captures the man and his life as well as anyone has to date.\\"Augustus\\" has been compared to the \\"Claudius\\" books of Robert Graves, which are quite fine as historical fiction. In my opinion, this work by Williams is even better in its language and scholarship and, overall, as a novel. Really one of the best books I read in some time."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"John Edward Williams won the 1973 National Book Award for 'Augustus' and deservedly so. This amazing piece of literature masquerading as historical fiction (and I like historical fiction) draws the reader into the world of Gaius Octavius, later to be Augustus, first emperor of Rome.Williams tells his tale by the unusual technique of presenting letters, journal entries, and memoirs. By this method he allows the reader to gradually enter, indeed become immersed in, the world of Augustus, his family, friends, enemies, and most important, his Rome. 'Augustus' traces his rise from the vulnerable adopted son of Julius Caesar through a steady accretion of power as he becomes first a triumvir (with Mark Antony and the nonentity Lepidus), and then settles in as emperor of the world.The historical record for Augustus's life has gaps that challenge an author and Williams grasps the challenge deftly, just as Augustus grasped power. We see Augustus as an aloof, cold and calculating politician whose assiduous pursuit and cautious exercise of power allows him to hold that power for over four decades, but always using that power for Rome, always for Rome, his Rome.Yet many people suffer from their close contact with this man - his equally calculating wife Livia, for one, his dear friends Maecenas and Salvidienus, to name two more, but none more so than his daughter Julia. The last third or so of the book focuses on the break between Augustus and Julia. Williams presents an interesting and shocking explanation for Julia's exile - at least an explanation that Augustus believes or claims to.The penultimate chapter draws Augustus's life to a close with a lengthy letter to Nicolaus of Damascus in which a dying Augustus bemoans his fate and the weight of authority he has had to bear - it is really most unattractive for one of the most powerful men in history to indulge in such self-centered despair, but it also rings true because Augustus spent his life denying himself so many pleasures in order to hold on to power for the good of Rome, as he convinced himself. In the end, Augustus saw himself as the embodiment of Rome - anything that threatened his power, threatened Rome. This is so well done that one finds oneself becoming angry with Augustus, who is after all just a character in this brilliant work of historical fiction.'Augustus' is not an easy read. Prior knowledge of the historical era certainly aids the enjoyment and comprehension of the book. Ultimately, however, this remarkable work of historical fiction and literature deserves the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"For me, the greatest interest in this novel was the explanation of how Augustus came to power at such an early age. Like most educated people, I , too have read histories that cover this period in detail. And yet, descriptions of events that historians gloss over with one sentence statements are not really enlightening. Here's an example of such a description from a typical history book: \\"Augustus, using the power of his uncle's name and money, soon became a force to be reckoned with in Rome.\\" Well, excuse me, but there is a lot left out of a statement like that. And history books are full of such examples. Precisely HOW could an eighteen year old kid persuade enough people to have confidence in him so that he could effectively challenge a military veteran and street fighter like Mark Antony? This is where John Williams shines. He gets into the interstices of history and demonstrates the human element at work in ways that can be understood. Step by step, we follow a callow youth as he becomes the most powerful man in the world.The plot does tend toward some confusion as a result of the device of using correspondence to carry the story. This means that digressions in the plot must take place in order to make the letters, diaries, etc. seem realistic. However, once you're accustomed to this device, the story manages to maintain its own velocity...PROVIDED that you are interested enough and knowledgable enough about Octavian to want to know the kind of details that emerge. If you are like me, you are absolutely dying to know."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"This complements the better known \\"I, Claudius.\\" Comparing the two has me wondering what's actually known about that era, and I will probably read more about it as a result.Williams, for example, portrays Augustus' third wife Livia as maneuvering coldly and relentlessly, but within the bounds of propriety, to position her son Tiberius as Augustus' successor.Graves, meanwhile, shows Livia in a darker light, responsible for numerous deaths in so doing while somehow maintaining her image of virtue. And he makes her the central character.Williams does a better job than Graves at capturing Rome as Augustus found it - rotting and a republic in name only, controlled by a few families - and the Rome that Augustus fashioned, economically healthy, at peace, with the most powerful families held at bay, an orderly government that citizens of all classes could depend upon, and led by an emperor who himself led a plain life as a moral example. I didn't realize so many of the key names of Latin literature - Livy, Horace, Vergil - lived at that time and were intimates of Augustus.\\"I, Claudius\\", seen through the eyes of Livia's grandson, perhaps does better at portraying the shocking and lurid decadence marking the beginning of the empire's decline. But \\"Augustus\\", starting earlier with Julius Caesar's assassination and Octavian's rise to power, does better with the broad sweep of Augustus' life and detailing this peak period of the Roman Empire, before the real decline began. It's more upbeat. Williams does a nice job using Julia to capture the tragic contradictions at the heart of the period.The format, with the story being told through letters of various characters to each other, can be a bit disjointed. I think this is a product, however, of Williams' determination to cover all key events in Augustus' reign. It can be a bit tedious as many detailed non-fiction histories are, but Williams generally keeps the story moving. He has an interesting life and times to work with."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"I first heard about this extraordinary novel of ancient Rome during one of the regular Wednesday afternoon \\"Dirda On Books\\" discussions conducted on the Washington Post website. I began reading the book on a long air flight to Finland and became entirely engrossed. It is easy to understand why the book won the National Book Award in 1973--it is superbly written. The novel follows Octavius Caesar from early adulthood through his battles to become Emperor Augustus, and into old age. The author does not utilize a straight narrative but instead tells the story through the use of documents such as letters, diary entries, and Senate proceedings. All of this material flows very smoothly as the story unfolds. I found it particularly interesting to compare and contrast the author's portrait of Augustus with that developed on the recent HBO \\"Rome\\" series which covers much of the same ground. As the helpful introduction by John McGahern explains, the author was not a classicist and undertook substantial reseach in order to make the novel as historically accurate (with a few exceptions) as possible. While not quite as exquisite as Yourcenar's \\"Memoirs of Hadrian\\" (also reviewed on Amazon), this fine novel comes very close to it in quality. For anyone interested in Roman history or just an outstanding read, this is a book well worth considering."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"I'm just going to tell you to do yourselves a favour and check this book out. Allan Masse, bow your head to the lesser known an appreciated John Williams. \\"Augustus: A Novel\\" is written in a very original way, using drafted letters, diaries, memoirs and even poems to tell the story making it a very easy read. You feel that you get to know each of the historical characters and they are written in a believable and stunningly truthful way, it is practically un-faulted. Its only fault is the title, which would have been better, titled as \\"Augustus and Julia.\\"Why?Because the book is told in three parts, and each part has a theme. Where part one is about Octavius and his rise to become Augustus, part two and three revolves around mainly him and his daughter Julia, and it is Julia who dominates the eyes and excitement of the reader making her out to be the more interesting and certainly the more likeable of the two. Nonetheless, the father-daughter relationship between the two is quite touching and you can tell honestly that Julia means the world to her father. Other characters there to excite and delight you are Livia, Maecenas, Agrippa and various other people like Tiberius and Julia's partner-in-crime and ambitious lover Jullus Antonius who also draws your attention as the only living son of Mark Antony, falling in love with Caesar's daughter, Julia, in a non-typical Romeo and Juliet way.Without a doubt, the best Augustus fiction I've read. If you want a good Roman book to read then I advise you to get this out of the library and give it a go."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"With a creative style, John Edward Williams presents the life of Augustus Caesar, Julius's nephew then adopted son, who ruled and remade Rome. Rather than using a more conventional literary style, Williams unravels the novel as a series of letters, journal entries, and documents from the diverse characters that surrounded and often vexed his subject. Cleverly, Williams leaves Augustus silent in this exchange of letters until the novel's end, so that the reader can see him from varying perspectives, through the eyes of friends and enemies alike.Critics have compared Williams' novel to Graves' excellent I, Claudius from the first, and though many prefer one or the other, they are both so different as to be almost from different worlds. While both deal with Rome in the rise of the Caesars, Graves offers at once a more limited perspective, as it comes from the single narrator Claudius who remains in Rome, but also broader as Claudius lives through the reign of four different rulers. Graves' style allows for greater intimacy with the characters because he writes from the honest place of one character's internal musings. Williams offers a more global view from many different perspectives, but only hinting at the character's depth. This style, far from inferior, is merely different and makes for an extremely interesting reading experience. It is true, the reader must work a bit harder, tracking characters can at time prove a challenge and you must remember who is writing and to whom. Yet, that in some ways adds to the fun. Indeed, one of its great strengths is that we learn many views on Rome's decline and Augustus' success.Only a scant few decades ago this work won the national book award and now is hardly read. However, with its interesting structure and clever prose, readers will certainly enjoy this recently reissued edition by Vintage."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"Augustus, by John Williams, is an overlooked gem! This National Book Award winner describes the life of the Caesar Augustus, probably the most influential of the Roman emperors. He is famously reported to have remarked, \`I found Rome in brick and left it in marble.' His reign was a time of peace and prosperity compared to the ruinous civil wars that preceded it. Unfortunately, there are few good yet accessible popularized accounts of his life. The lives of other Roman emperors have been defined for us by outstanding books. For Marcus Aurelius we have his own famous Meditations, for Hadrian there is Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian, for Claudius there is Robert Graves' celebrated I, Claudius, Tiberius is rehabilitated in the somewhat imitative Tiberius: The Memoirs of the Emperor by Allan Massie. Accounts of Julius Caesar are plentiful, my favorite being found in the last books of Colleen McCullough's excellent Masters of Rome series. Yet for Augustus, we are left with the idiosyncratic characterization in Robert Graves' I, Claudius. For reasons about which I cannot even begin to speculate, Robert Graves painted Augustus as a remote grandfatherly figure while his dominating wife Livia was the villain of the piece.Although John Williams was clearly familiar with the earlier works, balance is restored in his Augustus. The picture here is more in keeping with the man's known historical achievements. The novel is in epistolary form, i.e. a series of letters by the protagonists. This is a hard style to carry of. Bram Stoker did it in Dracula. John Williams does a great job. Once you get used to the rhythms of the text, you will find yourself immersed in the lives of the characters seen from their own perspective. The reader will encounter famous men such as Agrippa (he whose name can still be seen on the Pantheon in Rome), the wayward daughter Julia, and the poets Virgil, Horace and Ovid, to name but a few. They all come alive as living, breathing people. I regret that this book is not more widely known. This should be the book that defines Augustus in the mind of the modern reader."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"i am absolutely galled that no one has reviewed this classic tale of Roman life in the empire's infancy. As the publisher stated, this work was meticulously researched, seemlessly combining a tawdry soap opera-esque element with a hard, eloquently written, historical narrative.This book should be required reading in every high school in America! .I much preferred it to the often-tedious, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;"},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"Caesar Augustus ponders on his deathbed why people become agitated and divisive in good times but unify during strife. Told through supposed diary entries and letters, this fictional account plumbs the mind of Augustus, showing us his development into the skillful leader who guides his people from chaos, through civil war, to peace and prosperity.Some of his seemingly cold-hearted decisions, such as the exile of his beloved daughter Julia are seen in a new light. Perhaps her banishment wasn't his arrogant punishment of a perceived betrayal, but protection from charges of treason.An entralling read, especially following the enjoyable run of HBO's \\"Rome\\" series. As good as \\"Rome\\" was, this is better. Augustus is three-dimensional here. Williams delivers with solid history with mythology and poetry mixed in. He is an impressive writer, heretofore unknown to me.Some noteworthy snippets:\\"Her mind had never been violated by a serious thought\\" says Julia\\"Cicero and others of his odor\\" Marcus AntoniusThe final musings of Augustus, as his purple-sailed ship wends along Italy's coast to Capri, concern Romans' uneasy relationship with the sea. He refers to Vergil's \\"conceit\\" that the gods had \\"separated land from land by the unimaginable depths of the ocean so that the peoples in those lands might be distinct, and man in his foolhardiness launches his frail bark upon an element that ought not to be touched.\\" In the end, Augustus recognizes himself as a frail human, just as any other Roman.Williams has definitely made it on my list of authors to explore."},{"Title":"Augustus: A Novel","review":"At the age of eighteen, after the murder of his uncle Julius Caesar, Gaius Octavius becomes emperor of Roman Empire.

Having lived and worked in Northern Ireland for almost 2 years, to say that the problem is the 12,000 British troops is to vastly oversimplify the situation. Similarly, in my time in the North, I have become friends with Gaelicists who don't feel any emotional connection with or desire to unite with the Republic; so again, it's not a simple question of Irish nationalism denied.The thirteen essays that Anderson & Goodman collect in their book makes substantial headway in identifying and delineating the cultural/political fissures within Northern Ireland: Loyalist perceptions of the Peace Process, Women's issues, the problems with conventional Irish nationalism, the strategies of the Britsh Labour party, and hypotheses for new paradigms of nationalism to cope with the two antagonistic cultures who split the province.This book, along with Clayton's \\"Enemies & Passing Friends\\" and Coulter's \\"Contemporary Northern Irish Society\\" are essential reading for anyone seeking to discard simple fixes and understand the society."},{"Title":"Dis/agreeing Ireland: Contexts, Obstacles, Hopes (Contemporary Irish Studies)","review":"This book addresses the vital issue of what to do about Ireland. Unfortunately, it muddles matters rather than clarifying them. The key points, surely, are that 12,000 British soldiers are still over there, in what almost all British people consider to be a foreign country, and that these soldiers should not be there.Liberation from the occupier has to be the main aim of a country still partly occupied by the forces of a foreign power. However, the book's editors, Anderson and Goodman, explicitly reject this, writing, \\"national sovereignty is the problem not the solution.\\" In effect, they back successive British Governments' claim that Ireland's difficulties are peculiar to Ireland, rather than the result of the British state's continued interference in Ireland.The book's contributors generally advocate cultural not political change, avoiding the necessary, difficult, political work of moving the peace process forward. They seem to see nationalism in general as the enemy. One contributor wrongly asserts that \\"British nationalism has state-sponsored, imperialist and sectarian origins.\\" This implies that the British people's feelings of patriotism and national identity are not really our own, and that we are just stupid dupes, to be filled with whatever ideas our rulers pour into us.We should support the Good Friday Agreement as a step towards peace and towards the withdrawal of the troops. The IRA cease-fire is, thankfully, still in effect, as are the other ceasefires. No longer are terrorist groups murdering innocent civilians in Ireland and Britain.But we have to do more than just support the Good Friday Agreement, because it is not the end result of the peace process. We have to make the Government set a date for complete British withdrawal from the whole island of Ireland. When it finally pulls out the 12,000 British soldiers, all those who live and work in Ireland, free at last from the foreign occupier, will be able to build their future in peace."},{"Title":"What's in the Attic?","review":"I loved this book.

His seminal essay, \\"The Hedgehog and the Fox: An essay on Tolstoy's View of History\\" is included. It is the best selection and does more than discuss Tolstoy. It delves into Berlin's philosophy regarding influences upon an individual that go far beyond commonplace discussions about power and relationships. He identifies Tolstoy's struggle to seek out pragmatic evidence while secretly longing for evidence of a grand vision or theory. The Hedgehog is the seeker of the big idea, the fox digs for individual idiosyncracies.The other discussions about Russian writers and thinkers provide details about each man and what Berlin thought of his writing, regardless of his respect for the author's ideas. I was so intrigued by Berlin's insights, that I wrote an article based on it published this week, \\"Reading History: Hedgehogs and Foxes with the National Association of Scholars (see \\"Articles\\") at [...]"},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"Consider Isaiah Berlin a leading expert on theories of history and Russia an immense problem. The first step is the realization of how big this problem looms in the history of the world. The approach taken by Isaiah Berlin is a combination of history, philosophy, and literature. The most famous chapter of this book, &quot;The Hedgehog and the Fox,&quot; examines the falsifications used in WAR AND PEACE to belittle what is usually considered historical in order to prove what Tolstoy believed about real complexity. Some knowledge of calculus (college-level mathematics) might be helpful to get the overall picture. &quot;Our ignorance of how things happen is not due to some inherent inaccessibility of the first causes, only to their multiplicity, the smallness of the ultimate units, and our own inability to see and hear and remember and record and coordinate enough of the available material.&quot; (pp. 44-45) The ludicrous embrace of a doctrine like communism was doomed as soon as communism became an enemy of the multiplicity involved in actually getting anything done in a reasonable way, but the people involved needed an ideology to convince them that they had a system for generating nuclear power at Chernobyl, for example. That example is the best, at the moment, for showing how right Tolstoy could be at times. More recent efforts to make Russia function as a free marketplace have demonstrated a danger to which any notion that might be used as an attempt to free a people who don't know the first thing about doing things right could fall prey. All in all, I would rather read this book, as difficult as it is, than be the president of Russia or worse, a newspaper reporter there."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"Actually, I've only skimmed this book, not read it yet. It seemed to be worth five stars, but maybe AFTER I read it, I may revise my opinion. But I'd have to know more about the thinkers before I rate it again."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"It should be noted first that Isaiah Berlin knew his material backwards and forwards; the book bears the mark of exhaustive study. Russian Thinkers is a collection of essays on Russian luminaries, including Alexander Herzen, Belinsky, Tolstoy, Bakunin, and the populists (including Chernyshevsky). It would be helpful to have background knowledge about Russian history in this time period (mainly 19th century) before reading the book, but it is also intersting as a philosophical text, and Berlin expertly outlines the thought of these major figures. The main obstacle to reading this work may be Berlin's writing style, which is initially somewhat clunky (strangely, I found this to be the case mainly in his famous essay \\"The Hedgehog and the Fox\\"), but it does flow better once one gets used to it. Like all philosophical texts, though, what at first seems abstruse often proves rewarding and enriching. This book would be of interest to those who enjoy history or philosophy.

All the Russian 19th century greats (except Pushkin and Dostoevsky ) are here: Herzen, Belinsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Bakunin. In a book so saturated with ideas, it is not easy to make a pick- my favorite ones are:-the hedgehog and the fox metaphor (&quot;The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing&quot;). Human beings are categorized as either &quot;hedgehogs&quot; (whose lives are embodiment of a single, central vision of reality according to which they &quot;feel&quot;, breathe, experience and think- &quot;system addicts&quot;, in short. Examples include Plato, Dante, Proust and Nietzsche.) or &quot;foxes&quot; ( who live rather centrifugal than centripetal lives, pursue many divergent ends and, generally, possess a sense of reality that prevents them from formulating a definite grand system of &quot;everything&quot;-simply because they &quot;know&quot; that life is too complex to be squeezed into any Procrustean unitary scheme. Montaigne, Balzac, Goethe and Shakespeare are, in various degrees, foxes.)-precarious position of liberalism-something Berlin was well aware of. A &quot;non-belief belief&quot;, liberalism certainly doesn't satisfy &quot;deeper&quot; human needs; also, it managed, following its very nature, to stay away from planned genocides &amp; siren songs of totalitarian power. Yet- Berlin has failed (maybe due to the &quot;history of ideas&quot; nature of this compilation of essays) to answer more fundamental questions plaguing liberal mindset: is it fit to grapple with the 20th/21st century burning issues ? Or- has it mutated into a dark parody of itself, making a pact with postmodern imperial power(s) as represented by X-Filesque military &amp; financial &quot;Free World&quot; greedy elites which batten on the unenviable position of the much of the globe (Latin America, Africa, East Europe &amp; the greater part of Asia) ?-on strong side, essays on Herzen (Berlin's hero), Turgenev (&quot;Fathers and Children&quot; controversy) and Bakunin (juxtaposed to Herzen) are fresh, universal &amp; not dated at all. Tolstoy is covered unsurpassably, and I doubt it can be done better. On the other hand, some essays, like those on Russia and 1848 revolutions, German Romanticism and Russian populism, although brilliantly weaven, are, in my opinion, more of historical interest than pertinent to our contemporary metastable anxiety condition.Be as it may: this is an exquisite intellectual tapestry.

Isaiah Berlin was capable of writing about 'ideas' and their ' development' in a constantly fascinating way. His most well- known essay ' The Hedgehog and the Fox' is in this volume and it seems that Berlin himself was one of those who knew many things and wanted to know many things. His political ideas also took the shape of recognizing conflicting value systems as having validity even when those came from within a single person. Here he writes about the great Russian social and political thinkers Tolstoy, Herzen,Belinsky , Bakunin , Turgenev with characteristic insight, irony and sympathy.This is a volume anyone interested in the history of ideas should not miss."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to the history of Russian thought. I supplemented it with the pertinent chapters of Billington's &quot;The Icon and the Axe&quot; to piece together a general outline of the evolution of Russian political philosophy. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to Berlin's own philosophizing, but then that wasn't my objective. I found one of his general observations about Russian thought to be particularly useful, i.e. the tendency to follow an idea through to its fullest consequences, no matter how extreme or objectionable. The book nicely sets the stage for how Marxism was able to take hold, showing that it was in some ways an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, intellectual development. The problem is, now that the book has allowed me to cobble together a general framework of Russian thought, the only possible next step is to start directly reading Hegel and Marx!

His ideas of freedom are on the mark, but in the post-Communist world they don't quite get to the point. I highly reccomend papal biographer and political pholosopher George Weigel's recent commentaties, (available online). Liberalism was not and is not a sufficient answer to utopian ideology, which Berlin nevertheless correctly asserts will inevitably degenerate into totalitatianism. Even more, in the post-cold war world, relativism has usurped &quot;true&quot; freedom, which presents perhaps an even more dangerous problem than the Soviet one."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"This is a very important book in my opinion, because it analyzes certain utopian ideas that produced chaos during the 20th Century, but remain popular today despite their horrible track record. Basically, this outstanding work of historical scholarship is about a group of Russian intellectuals who believed if they rid Russia of the monarchy, capitalism, and Russian Orthodox Church, life would be wonderful. So the Tsar and his family were killed, capitalism was wiped out, and the Russian Orthodox Church was suppressed. As we all know, paradise didn't ensue. Instead Russia ended up with the Gulag Archipeligo. How could so many brilliant intellectuals be wrong? Well, perhaps brilliant intellectuals aren't as brilliant as they imagine. If you want to understand the modern world, and the pitfalls of seemingly wonderful utopian ideas, this is the book to read.

There are many philosophical angles from which one can interpret Berlin's analysis of the Russian intelligentsia, the one that stands out the most is the question that defined nineteenth Russia, as well as Europe:'What is to be done?'There are two strains of thought in the Russian intellectual circles of this time, the Slavophil movement and the Western-oriented intellectuals. Berlin notes that these were not organized political camps engaged in constant debates of any sort (as there was no political movement to speak of at this time in Russia) but rather unsystematic frames of thinking with which Russian intellectuals of the time identified.The advocates of the Slavophil idea maintained that the salvation of Russia was to be found within Russia; that Russian lifestyle, Russian simplicity and modesty was superior to Western complex theories for the advancement of society. Berlin penetrates Tolstoy's consciousness and deciphers the characters and plots of War and Peace for what they represent i.e. the clash between Western scientific thought and the fundamentally Russian way of life. He argues that Tolstoy would have us believe that, in the end, it is the wise Russian General Kutuzov who wins, not because power or strategy had any significant consequence in the battle itself, but because he has not been infiltrated with Western military tactics and in part because he used his, to use Berlin's words \\"...Russian, untutored instinct...\\" and it is this Russian untutored instincts that Tolstoy wants to triumph over scientific rationality.Western oriented intellectuals on the other hand, most of whom were in exile throughout Europe at this time, believed that the solution to Russia's problems could only come through the kind of reform being introduced in Western Europe, not necessarily the revolutionary kind, for Chadaaev the most ardent Western oriented mind in Russia at the time was by and far an ardent conservative who believed in aristocratic virtues, but a representational government like that of Britain.Berlin engages Tolstoy in the center of nineteenth century European philosophical discourse on account of his views on simplicity (the hedgehog) and complexity (the fox) of both his work and personality (if we come to understand the simplicity to represent the adeptly Russian and the complexity to represent the ineptly Western European.) Tolstoy had managed or rather convinced himself that scientific theories are all assumptions and that if one is not exposed to these theories he/she has a better chance of knowing the truth, in Berlin's words \\"He [Tolstoy] believed that only by patient empirical observation could any knowledge be obtained; that this knowledge is always inadequate, that simple people often know the truth better than learned man, because their observations of men and nature are less clouded by empty theories, and not because they are inspired vehicles of the divine afflatus.\\"Berlin was a mastermind in interpreting and deciphering the Russian intellect, because his knowledge of Russia was unparalleled for his time, which is why this collection of essays is one of the best anthologies on the evolution of the Russian thought. Reading Berlin can sometimes be a frustrating experience because one feels that the interpretation of literature can only stretch to a certain limit and you wonder if indeed the author was trying to get to where Berlin is taking you or if is what Berlin wants to find in the subliminal nature of the author (in this case Tolstoy) and perhaps that's what attracts one to Berlin's brilliant mind."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"This is probably the best single collection of Berlin's essays. Berlin wrote a number of notable essays but this collection has a thematic integrity not found in most other collections. One unifying theme is that all essays in Russian Thinkers are concerned with 19th century Russian intellectuals. These essays are divided into 2 types; those devoted to analysis of individual writers and those analyzing broader currents in Russian intellectual history. A second theme featured in many essays, and an issue that greatly preoccupied Berlin, is the opposition of a pluralist view of human thought and life to ideas stressing a unifying or ideal view of human life and society. Berlin presents this opposition as a recurrent theme in Russian thought in the 19th century. Berlin's most sympathetic portrayals, those of Herzen and Turgenev, are of individuals committed to pluralist views. The most famous essay in this book, The Hedgehog and the Fox, is a justly celebrated analysis of Tolstoy as a thinker caught between these opposing approaches to life.While the essays devoted to individual writers are probably the best known essays in this book but the broader and more historically oriented essays are equally interesting. Berlin's analysis of the difficult position of the small number of Russian intellectuals in a primitive and repressive society, the impact of German romanticism and Hegelian idealism, and the populist movement and how it prepared the way for the Leninist version of Marxism, are superb. Like all of Berlin's work, the quality of writing is outstanding. Berlin's command of and love for Russian literature, his own concern with the issue of pluralism versus idealism, and his evident sympathy for individuals like Herzen who shared Berlin's liberal pluralism, give these essays a personal dimension that adds to the quality of the work.This is a very nice edition and the insightful introduction by Aileen Kelly is a very good introduction to Berlin's thought."},{"Title":"Russian Thinkers (Penguin Philosophy)","review":"In this collection of great essays, Isaiah Berlin examines the development of Russian intelligentsia; the circumstances that surrounded the formation of Russian philosophy and the role of ideas in the history of philosophy.In one of the most enjoyable essays \\"the fox and the hedgehog\\", Berlin divides writers and thinkers into these two categories and focuses on Tolstoy's theory of history. My favorite subject is Russian philosophy and Berlin examines in great detail how Russian philosophers enriched and contributed to philosophy in Europe and the world.Admittedly, Berlin's writing and thoughts are sometimes difficult to follow and the reader has to pause frequently to digest Berlin's big intellectual morsels. The most rewarding accomplishment my struggle with the small print in this book is that it increased my understanding of Russian philosophers, or as Berlin describes them: \\"Philosophers are adults who persist in asking childish questions.\\""},{"Title":"The Hero King (Varyan Memoir)","review":"I first came upon this series at my local library and fell in love with all three books instantly.

Teaching is inherently political and this book doesn't try to feign some mythical objectivity.If you want to teach with traditional, back-to-basics methods, then read this book to at least see the other side. Use it to develop your own disagreement. If you want to teach in a way that encourages students to create knowledge and think critically, read this book to understand how this is even possible, but also go find another book which takes the opposite perspective so you can fully develop your own understanding of teaching.Its true, you have to take much of this book with a grain of salt. But the fact is that there is no &quot;center&quot; to the politics of teaching, and there is no fair and balanced way to present any political agenda. The choice to teach in a traditional manner is a political choice as well.What this book lacks is a deeper description of traditionalist/conservative motives in the educational arena. Too often it glosses over the desires of traditionalist motivation and insituates consipiracy theory about the true goal of such groups' agendas.However, if you keep all this in mind as you read it, you'll learn some rather fascinating things."},{"Title":"Teaching To Change The World","review":"This book is very upfront with its goals. It advocates the examination of every aspect of schooling in an attempt to overhaul the system to maximize the effectiveness of learning.Such an examination has at its core three questions. As they were expressed by the professor of the course for which I read this book, they are \\"What knowledge?, Why that knowledge?, And who benefits from passing on that knowledge?\\" It is obvious, even from the title, that the authors don't believe that the benefits of traditional education practices are widespread. Indeed, they advocate a progressivist philosophy with a particular emphasis on multicultural education.I'm not sure how this really affects my opinion of the book. While I do tend to believe in a fairly student-centered approach to teaching, and I do appreciate the need for greater cultural awareness in this increasingly globalized world, the tone of the book seems a little too forceful for my tastes, neglecting the fact that many Americans work from a basis of the western culture they grew up in, and insulting that culture, which this book borders on doing at times, is not a good way to convert people to your side.What I did like about this book is the completeness of its history, as it details events that are both notable and not so notable that have had impact on the development of educational theory and educational politics, even if the impact isn't so obvious. And even if the tone does bother me at times, I must admit that the numerous examples of young teachers trying to implement the favored philosophies are quite convincing, maybe even more so than the rest of the text.So, in short, I find the book a strange mixed bag of philosophies I largely agree with presented in a way that inconsistently works to advance the adoption of them."},{"Title":"Teaching To Change The World","review":"This is a required book for one of my education classes. It is really interesting and has some good information. I have other required books and they all reference this one.

Throughout this book there is the smug certainty that the postmodernists have advanced beyond silly mistakes, like believing in truth, that afflicted the poor benighted thinkers of the past. The writers set up false dichotomies and straw men, such as the naive view that if one thinks that a text has a meaning to be discovered in it, then one must think that that meaning must be precisely what the author intended (1999 ed., p. 130). Throughout all of this there are some good insights, such as that \\"the tension of 'not knowing'\\" is \\"a productive and necessary element of learning\\" (p. 71). But many of these ideas owe to Piaget or the constructivism of Jerome Bruner, and there is no need to lump such ideas together with the authors' \\"postmodernist\\" doctrine. While the authors pursue their agenda of \\"social justice,\\" and their readers hop on the bandwagon, are our children in fact getting a well-rounded, intellectually rich education?"},{"Title":"Teaching To Change The World","review":"&quot;It is neither honest nor objective to describe popular teaching practices in a neutral manner if they do not stand up to the standards of social justice or education research.

He concisely describes how giving away seemingly useless bits of company information can have devastating results for private corporations.

By which I mean it isn't too technical. And when something technical does arise, Kevin writes little 'Mitnick Messages' which explains it all using simple, easy to understand language.NOTE: For anyone out there who may be a budding Social Engineer/Hacker/Phone Phreak.

Plus it was written by the one and only Kevin David Mitnick, probably the greatest hacker on the face of the earth."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The bulk of this book consists of a series of fictionalized narratives designed to show how social engineers can trick their unsuspecting victims into revealing sensitive information. The overwhelming majority of these attacks take place over the phone, simply by tricking the victim into thinking the attacker is someone he or she is not. While each chapter tweaks the formula slightly, the stories get repetitive rather quickly.The books final chapter offers a welcome change to the phone shenanigans: A recommended set of policies for securing an organization. While handy, I'm not totally sure this chapter is enough to redeem the book as a whole.The whole book can best be summed up as \\"Never assume someone is who they say they are. Always verify identity. And never assume any piece of information is not valuable.\\"If information security is your business, you may want to grab a copy of this book, if only for the final chapter (which, by the way, is roughly a quarter of the book). I really can't recommend it for anyone else, though. And if phone pranks are really what you desire, you might be better off picking up a Jerky Boys CD or something (it would probably be more entertaining, anyway)."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This is a great, but frightening book. The book explains many, many ways how \\"social engineers\\" (what the author calls those who manipulate strangers) can take advantage of people. These stories are clearly and convincingly illustrated by examples. Unfortunately, when one realizes all the people who have access to their private information and that it only takes one to fall for the kind of tricks mentioned here, it is clear that safety is all but impossible. That said, this can serve as a wake up call to fix what we can, especially in our own workplaces. My one complaint with the book is that the sample security policies in the last chapter were not available electronically."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The Art of Deception is a must read for EVERYBODY, not just those directly responsible for securing information and/or computer systems. Becuase, as Mitnick points out, those individuals in corporations who are furthest removed from creating or enforcing security policies are often times the most common targets of social engineers becuase of this very fact. Reading this book, you will begin to realize that every, single one of us is a potential security vulnerability waiting to be exploited by a social engineer. In fact, many of the stories will probably have you recalling certain situations in your own past, and wondering if you've already been a target.This book is totally unique in the information security field, because it focuses on strategies, tactics, and results and not on tools and technologies, which often times serve only to provide a false sense of security. This point is made most succinctly in Mitnick's tale of compromising (at the challenge of the manufacturer at a trade show) of a supposedly un-hackable operating system. Mitnick and his companion succeed in gaining administrator priveleges on the machine not by using traditional hacking techniques, rather by combining guile, amateur lock-picking skills, and exploiting carelesness and cockiness on the part of the developers (think of the Germans rolling around the Maginot line into France). After reading the stories in the book and the chapters at the end on security assesments and policies, you will have the knowledge to recognize the potential threats and to defend yourself and your company.In addition to all of this, The Art of Deceptions is a captivating and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"First of all we all have the right to speek out but i do want to mention that Kevin Mitnik is no criminal if he were he would be outside he'd be inside, and about the book it is very interesting, we all in some day in our lives fall for some kind of deception some of them which we unfortunately can even detect until it's to late so in other words i thank Kevin Mitnik for giving me an inside look at reality that can happen to anybody, good work Kevin...............Thanks"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This guy has done the things he writes about, and is considered the Godfather ofhacking.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The Art of Deception is written by a hacker (or, as he calls himself, a \\"social engineer\\") and describes the ways in which hackers can exploit human nature to bypass security measures. The book was hyped as being \\"like reading the climaxes of a dozen complex thrillers\\", but I don't think it lived up that hype. Although I found it interesting to read about the clever ways hackers go about getting very classified information, it wasn't exactly edge-of-your-seat reading. It was interesting to get a glimpse of what motivated the hackers as well.The description of each hack was presented as a series of conversations between the hacker and their target. This felt very factual and straightforward, with no build up of suspense. We are some times presented with the story from the hacker's viewpoint afterwards and I think this was a much more interesting way to hear the story. First the hacker is presented with a seemingly impossible challenge and then they find a creative way to get the information they need. The author added little convincing details which made the hackers and their targets seem more human, perhaps a skill he picked up convincing people he was someone else to get information. I wish more of the book had been written this way!Finally, the conclusion of the book was a bit of a let down. The last two chapters focused on security measures that companies could take to prevent hackers from targeting them. Since these two chapters weren't particularly interesting to me, I simply finished the last anecdote and suddenly the book was over. There really wasn't a nice conclusion available for the average reader"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This is one of the finest books I ever read not just on this subject but also just as a book. The Authors outline what has happen and what can happen if you do not at least become aware of your vulnerability to Computer Crime.Kevin Mitnick and Bill Simon provide a detailed method how humans use computers to cause all kinds of trouble for fun and intentional hate. I came away actually admiring Kevin Mitnick for the way he has approaches many trials in his life since being a former hacker himself.He is refreshing in his honesty, clearly contrite in his admissions of what he feels he did do wrong and has paid the price in my opinion to be welcome into society as an asset today. He is a prime example of an American turning adversity into opportunity and becoming a far better person in the end.He is now going to use his talent to help many people help defend themselves in this brave new world of technology. He is still an advocate of liberal individualism knowing it is the sacred heart of a free society. I highly recommend this book written in easy to read style and complete integrity but making you realize anyone is susceptible to computer crimes in the future.It is time to arm yourself with knowledge and assistance as Kevin Mitnick provides in this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This is one book that every security manager NEEDS! So often (too often), information security is only addressed at a purely technical level (e.g., firewalls, IDS, etc.) while &quot;traditional&quot; types of security are completely ignored or (worse yet) ridiculed as &quot;old fashioned&quot;.If you're expecting Mitnik to dive into the IP stack headfirst, this book is NOT for you. No fancy tools are needed for these &quot;hacks&quot;. Instead, it shows how a slick tongue, human nature, and a bit of logical thinking often combine to wreak havoc. This is hacking at its finest - no audit trails, no intrusion detection - just pure system access that somebody handed to you in a basket!If you're an INFOSEC manager, read this book. Learn what you can from it, then take an honest look at how easy it is to get around security measure in your own organization.

All done in an entertaining way by relating exploit stories to the reader.You could even use the book to challenge the way that you think by trying to guess what steps might be taken to achieve the social engineer's goal....or devise a policy that could have been put in place to prevent the exploit from working. This type of mental gymnastics is not only entertaining...but can teach you volumes at the same time.If there is one category of people who should not read this book...it would be those who have a heart towards mischief and lack the good sense to know not to act on their desire. For these individuals, this could be a text book for learning how to reserve their own room at a local federal facility!All in all....I highly recommend the book to everyone.

It goes to show how little the reviewer understands about the subject.The fact of the matter is that social engineering has changed little over the decades, let alone since the 80's. The entire point of the book is that no matter how much technology you have, no matter how amazing your whiz-bang toys are, your network is *still* in danger. I don't care what physical security you have installed and working, the people you rely on to use and protect that network is, and in all likelyhood always will be, your weakest link. I paraphrase the book when I say that a computer that is turned off is not secure. You can always talk someone into turning it on for you.The book itself is amazing. Easy to read, easy to understand, and insightful in it's illustration of social engineering. Unfortunatly, a lot of the security procedures reccomended can be draconian, but when there's a lot riding on the line, you have to take a lot of steps to make things secure.I heartily suggest this book.

A must read!"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"What is a computer networks greatest vulnerability? Turns out the weakest spot of any network (computer or otherwise) are the human elements. Solution: kill everyone with access to your computer system. Just kidding. The solution, predictably, is training and awareness. Those are the conclusions of The Art of Deception and I suppose more training and heightened awareness of system security is solid advice but only a few folks are going to read The Art of Deception for the insights into system security. The majority of readers are going to pick up The Art of Deception to read the delicious subterfuges and insights into human credulity (a very few may pick it up to hone their own scamming techniques).If you want to learn a bit about hacking and/or conning people (called social engineering by Kevin Mitnick) or just read stories about the aforementioned topic Kevin Mitnick is the guy with the best stories. For the uninformed reader Kevin Mitnick is probably the most notorious hacker in US history. He's served jail time, company's claim he cost them millions of dollars and the government tracked him for years before capturing the super cyber fugitive. Of course some argue that Kevin Mitnick really didn't do too much wrong and even if he did it was more out of curiosity than malice. I haven't researched the topic enough to form a definitive opinion but I have seen and read enough to know that Kevin Mitnick is hacker supreme. Once you read The Art of Deception you won't doubt Kevin Mitnick's abilities and you'll see why he was able to get away with so much for so long. All this adds up to making Kevin Mitnick probably the single most authoritative person to write this kind of book.First off let me say the scams that Kevin Mitnick references actually work, I know cause I tried one. I picked a company I knew a little about called the receptionist and asked for her user name and password. She told me her password and user name, no questions asked. I was startled by how easy the process was but I attempted no further hacking (not because I was scared or suddenly moral but because the company makes extremely boring stuff). Calling up and asking someone for a password is the simplest ruse of all and probably the most often used con. The trick, naturally, is to make the person on the other end of the phone think that you're entitled to the information somehow, and that's where the real \\"social engineering\\" starts. While the crux of any scam may be the same the road getting to that point can be very interesting. In The Art of Deception there are some scams so complicated they would make David Mamet salivate and these are the scams that are particularly enthralling to read even though the occasionally stretch the limits of plausibility. Regardless of the believability of the retold ruses they all have a common theme: they are very enjoyable short tales of human fallibility.The cons and seductions are enough to carry The Art of Deception; less entertaining are the solutions to prevent said miracles of flimflam. Of course the prevention of the scheme is always less exciting than the actual scam so it's no surprise when you find yourself skimming the \\"what Bob could've done\\" sections. There are a few scams that may be directly useful to the average Joe (which one of these says PAYPAL: paypal or paypa1?) but most of the beguilements solutions will be of interest to IT directors and tech support folks. In fact I can reveal the solutions to the scams: know whom you're talking to and don't give out your password. That advice, while predictable, doesn't carry as much weight as it does when coupled with the scams and schemes presented in The Art of Deception. If you're one of the folks who think that you could never get suckered Kevin Mitnick will make you a believer.Who is this book really for? Well if you're an IT director the book will be very useful. If you're a company that deals with very sensitive information you may want to make The Art of Deception required reading for anyone with a password. If you're in Sales and don't mind walking on slightly on the seamy side (if you're the type that snatches business cards out of restaurant fishbowls and passes the cards of as \\"calls\\") then some of the information gathering techniques may also be of interest. The casual reader will not find the information as useful as the previously mentioned professionals but will find The Art of Deception very diverting.Bottom Line: Anyone who reads The Art of Deception will find it entertaining, and some people will find the book very useful.MacMice Rating: 3 out of 5"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I enjoyed the first more-than-half of the book which dealt with various kinds of social engineering attacks. Each was at least plausible and usually interesting. I was constantly aware, however, that the titles of the chapters only vaguely correlated to the examples given: there must be a better way to structure the content (possibly starting with defining various kinds of attacks then identifying those techniques as they come up in the examples.)The latter part of the book dealt with corporate solutions and fell short of its mark. For instance, the audience is constantly reminded to keep their employees vigilant and interested because it's easy to let security policies slip, yet the methods advised were right from the corporation playbook: the kinds of things office workers love to make fun of and always circumvent for convenience.

If you have to own it, buy the book used.These strategies will help you reap the &quot;benefit&quot; of this book just as much as anyone else and the author and publisher only get paid once. Share the love!In short, I don't believe in legitimizing Mitnick's criminal past by turning his exploits, stories and strategies into &quot;advice&quot; for those of us that should already know better. However if you're interested in the subject then you might as well read the book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"It's amazing that on the book jacket bio of Kevin, it is NEVER mentioned that he was in jail.Kevin is a criminal and even less of a hacker than a complete con-man. Kevin positions himself as a Security Expert when all he could really advertise himself as a BS-Detector Consultant.I agree the legal system failed in the case of not actually charging him while holding him for so long. But he ain't exactly Snow White, he had MANY chances to go straight after being constantly caught, yet he kept up like an addict.The only Art of Deception in this book is the con of getting you to buy this."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Hmmm. Amazon seems to have deleted my earlier review - I'll make it short. Mitnick is not a great hacker, he's a con artist. After reading his book there is virtually NOTHING about protecting yourself from hackers but maybe some ideas about protecting yourself from ex-convict con artists."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Don't forget, when you buy this book, the author is profiting from the crimes he commited. It's like buying a book by Jeffrey Dahmer on how not to be murdered. Criminals should not profit from their crimes. If you feel you /must/ read this book, check it out of the library."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I'm sorry, but a book by an ex-hacker who got caught in 1981 isn't my idea of hacking educational material. Those who know Mitnick's background know exactly why he is being pushed upon us as a 'reformed' expert hacker. A 'hacker' who last practiced his criminal behavior in 1981 knows less about today's technology than an AOL user does."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Prior to purchasing this book, I had a basic understanding of what social engineering was and how it was used to infiltrate information systems. However, after reading the book my knowledge went from a 3 to a 10 on a scale of 1-10. Art of Deception explained not only what social engineering was in its most rudimentary form but how the art of persuasion or should I say deception attacks the human nature to help people out. This is a must read for any criminal investigator regardless of what they investigate. It really shows you how easy it is to get information. Some of the tactics would even help out in police interviews and interrogations."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Mitnick never described himself as a \\"hacker\\" but rather a \\"social engineer\\".

This is some great education for the naive people of the world."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The Art of Deception teaches how we can protect our information from those who enjoy breaking our technology systems only with their own social engineering, and prevent our technical security investment failure. Mitnick could be one of the most famous hacker but confirm the necessity to instruct the human behavior to prevent any intrusion."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Mitnick shows that he is a master of the obvious. Guess what? Untrained users are the weakest links in your company's non existent security policy. The book is a set of long rambling stories about fictitious amateur con artists designed to be thinly veiled as Mitnick's own personal conquests... There isn't anything in this book that would help anyone but the truly clueless and seems to be written for young misguided computer enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The stories told by Mitnick in this book are very entertaining to read, but I do think that businesses today (certainly enterprises) have done a lot of work in countering practices described by Mitnick. After a story, there is always an explanation of the con and what you can do about it (which is usually not much). These comments are very obvious most of the time. So of the 368 pages, there are about 200 that are an entertaining read. The last chapter covers how you can improve the security (and security procedures) of your company. Again, some are obvious, some of these notes are already widely implemented today. It's a fun read but the book hasn't aged well."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Probably one of the very best books I've ever read in my life. This book follows through some of the life of hacker Kevin Mitnick. A lot of good laughs and some surprising and eye opening admissions that are full of lessons for anyone who uses a computer.Without being condescending or preachy, Kevin shows people the ways around the easiest element of security to break, the user themselves. For anyone who's been involved with computers from the beginning of the first pre-PC's it's like a page of reminiscences from your own brain 20 years ago.To newer users it's bordering on the insanity that is hacking lol.This book is worthy of any home user or even IT professionals attention. Mitnick reveals many of the flaws in the human personality that allow people to abuse them, be it verbally, socially or even physically. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who's had a problem with a hacker or spyware. It will show you, your and everyone else's major character flaw that can be managed effectively to eliminate the naivety that is the Internet."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"In The Art of Deception, Kevin D. Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the \\"human element.\\" With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource getAbstract. directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The Art of Deception is a must read for EVERYBODY, not just those directly responsible for securing information and/or computer systems. Becuase, as Mitnick points out, those individuals in corporations who are furthest removed from creating or enforcing security policies are often times the most common targets of social engineers becuase of this very fact. Reading this book, you will begin to realize that every, single one of us is a potential security vulnerability waiting to be exploited by a social engineer. In fact, many of the stories will probably have you recalling certain situations in your own past, and wondering if you've already been a target.This book is totally unique in the information security field, because it focuses on strategies, tactics, and results and not on tools and technologies, which often times serve only to provide a false sense of security. This point is made most succinctly in Mitnick's tale of compromising (at the challenge of the manufacturer at a trade show) of a supposedly un-hackable operating system. Mitnick and his companion succeed in gaining administrator priveleges on the machine not by using traditional hacking techniques, rather by combining guile, amateur lock-picking skills, and exploiting carelesness and cockiness on the part of the developers (think of the Germans rolling around the Maginot line into France). After reading the stories in the book and the chapters at the end on security assesments and policies, you will have the knowledge to recognize the potential threats and to defend yourself and your company.In addition to all of this, The Art of Deceptions is a captivating and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick was a gifted social engineer, so I was looking forward to reading about the tricks he'd used. Instead, I was disappointed to see the book is totally geared to the corporate director that has NO clue about computer security. The vast majority of the 'lessons' are embarrassingly common-sense:- lock your computer- don't write down passwords or codes- don't give out confidential information- check everyone's creditentials or IDThat's about it. Of course, you're missing out on the pages upon pages of rehashing the same lessons over and over, but if someone needs that kind of reinforcement to learn, maybe they need this book. :)"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Having read several positive reviews and recommendations of the book, I picked up a copy. Only a quarter of the way into the book, a growing sense of dread came over me as I realized that in finishing the book, I would put it down unsatisfied and disappointed. Having just completed the book, I can report that my initial feelings held true.The book provides little insight and repeatedly makes the same points: 1) the quality of one's security is only as good as the weakest link. 2) you must analyze your security, determine the weakest link, and take appropriate measures to correct for the weakness. 3) there are numerous individuals who for innumerable motives wish to compromise your security in order to achieve some gain. 4) if it just doesn't look right (jdlr), it probably isn't. 5) be wary.The book prosaically presents various forms of social engineering attacks to demonstrate how a given attack may achieve its purpose. None of the examples were very artful, enlightening, or innovative. Many center around the art of conning others and bootstrapping bits of information for maximum effect.Very little insight was provided within. The book seems a rehashing of existing warnings and knowledge, but a rehash provided by an infamous author (and, therefore, saleable).This is not a how-to book either for executing an attack or preventing one. There are far better volumes to understand both of these. It will tell you no more than what you already knew or should know from other security resources which can provide much more helpful information much more succinctly. At best, it can depict potential compromises for those who haven't the time to put their imagination to work.This is certainly not a book for information security professionals. I think it would prove a dull read even for those unfamiliar with the topic."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I purchased this book based on several reviews including the few in amazon.com. What a disappointment. The book is a compendum of anecdotal evidence presented as \\"true stories\\", all of them of varying degrees of credibility.All the stories can be summed up in two words: identity theft. each story is told twice, once as Dr. Watson would have seen it at first, and once as Mr. Holmes would have explained it.At the end there is a review of what are the \\"best practices\\" of security, which is quite superficial to be interesging or valuable. All in all, the Sherlock adventures are a better reading; and a serious approach when drafting a security policy would be more useful than wasting time on reading this book.Get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"extremely boring... nothing in here about hacking or protecting yourself from hackers...very dissappointed. waste of my time and waste of my money"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I had been looking for this book all over the Internet.

I was very disappointed. The book is nothing but a collection of anecdotes most of which are very much the same. Over and over the same little story is told with very little value. I read half this book then just couldn't do it anymore. It was horrible. To top it off Mitnick admits that these stories are fiction. A collection fictitious stories on how someone might dupe someone else to get their password. This Mitnick guy is just using his name to sell books. The content obviously doesn't matter to him. The first few little stories are amusing and then disappointment sets in as the rest of the book is basically the same little stories over and over with a name change here and there. Complete filler. For those of you that think this is a computer book - it is not. Nothing about computers here. Its all about social engineering aka &quot;con games&quot;. The writing seems to be targeted towards teenagers. That or Mitnick is very immature."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"As the previous reviewer pointed out, you have to get past the fact that the author of this book has been convicted of a heap of crimes due to his application of the techniques he lays out in this book. I admittedly was a bit indignant about taking Mitnick's advice at first, but recognized early on that this is judgemental and immature, and this book has good info in it.So basically this book is almost a &quot;must-have&quot; for the infosec professional because ... it's really the only book like it right now. Most well-rounded infosec books *include* info on social engineering. This book is *about* it, meaning you finally get an in-depth analysis of the techniques and methods used by social engineers, and suggestions to stop them.Actually my biggest problem with this book is that the author(s) couldn't seem to figure out their target audience. They wrote a book that filled an infosec niche, then constantly defined terms like &quot;Brute Force&quot;, which everyone reading this book probably figured out at the kindergarten level of infosec. They do this a lot and overall I found this, coupled with the simplistic writing style, to be a bit condescending. That's why I say this is a 3.5 and not a true 4.SUMMARY - Good info, more in-depth knowledge of social engineering than anywhere else, dumb writing style. At least worth borrowing or picking up used like I did."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Overall, presents a good perspective of social engineering from a layman's point of view. Most of the stories Kevin tells in the book are related to exploiting the phone system and \\"mainframes\\", so you have to shift his theories and points into today's frame of reference in order for them to be relevant. That said, Kevin is a cornerstone in the information security arena and this book is considered a classic among professionals. Buy it, read it, and then pass it on. Not something I'd read twice..."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is definitely useful for any IT manager who wants an insight to the thinking of hackers--it recounts several stories about how various criminals broke into secure systems targeting the weakest link--the human element.But I think I would like it better if someone with a little more maturity and broad intelligence interviewed Mitnick and then wrote a book on a similar topic. Mitnick, like a lot of young computer hackers, still carries the self perception that anyone he can defraud is stupid and naive. He makes broad generalizations about why people trust each other (Our parents were the first cons we knew).His attitude reminded me of college students who think that just because they could find fault in a person or theory, then they were suddenly elevated to a higher plane. It's usually not for a few years that they realize how remarkable and insightful those theories are--and that their superficial criticism itself was somewhat naive.Overall, I found it to be an interesting, if somewhat repetitive read. I definitely recommend it for the awareness it creates about vulnerabilities in security."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"An important book for anyone involved in security (computer or otherwise). The book recounts the real life exploits of a smart young kid who went bad and eventually got trapped by his own hubris, so it's a pssedo-biography. It shows that the real security weak-link is the human (no surprise there). Eliptic curve algorithms and 2048 bit encryption don't prevent people from just telling someone their password.The examples used to illustrate techniques are somewhat artificial, but it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see the real world case behind it. It reveals how we are socially engineered and how that was exploited. The modern equivalent, adapted to new technology isn't laid out, but i don't think we have quite reached human 2.0 yet to make that a big intellectual stretch. It is both fascinating and scary how personal weaknesses and prejudices can be used to extract confidential information and gain access.Mitnik's exploits also included a thorough understanding of phone systems and technology (phreaking) as well as human nature, but these are not discussed in detail in this book because he's prohibited from doing so and probably because the security holes are still there on some systems. Most of these technology based exploits utilized features designed to help field engineers and remote offices. this should help inform system designers, architects and implementors to consider mal-use cases as well. That is, think about how a requested feature could be used improperly and develop appropriate human as well as technological protocols.The book is not the greatest read and is somewhat repetitive, with many of the exploits seeming somewhat dated. It would be nice to get an update on Mitnick's analysis of risk in current systems and social trends. With the popularity of social netwoking sites that update could help those participants develop a society and human 2.0 awareness.I think the authors and publishers didn't want to write a handbok for cons, so this has made the book seem obtuse to some readers. I think the intention was to get the reader into the mindset of the con, so they can consider issues from that perpsective. Which is the old economics standard of \\"what is the maximum reward for minimum risk\\"."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I found this book an unpleasant but valuable read. Unpleasant because who wants to read lots of stories about how innocent people were cheated, lied to, stolen from? Valuable because it makes clear in great detail how computer security is only as strong as its weakest link -- people. Both their good qualities, like the desire to help others, and bad ones, like laziness or inattention, allow the determined thief to bypass computer security and steal information or money. Yes, the book finishes with guidelines on how to better secure your business, and whom to train (everyone). But you may find it hard to imagine how people, naturally open and helpful, could do what it takes to avoid deception."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The book explains the phenomenon of \\"social engineering,\\" which is basically how deceivers entice unsuspecting people to give them information or access they aren't authorized to have. As I read through the different scenarios, I couldn't help but look back over my days in business to see if I had been duped into giving out information I shouldn't have.The author walks you through several situations, such as a private investigator looking for hidden assets, a corporate spy looking for industrial secrets, or hackers looking for fun. In each of the chapters, he gives the reader an example of the con, then explain how the con works. Although he does leave some of the steps out (to prevent this from being a self-help book for hackers), he does give the reader enough information to see how this could happen.The end of the book is intended as a checklist for all businesses. Even though a true hacker or social engineer (the difference is explained in the book) could still get through, all businesses should look at the list to ensure that they have done everything they could to prevent a security breach. In a nutshell, the biggest thing businesses can do is educate all employees, because humans are the weakest link in security.For formatting, the author includes quick notes throughout the book. These get a bit monotonous after a while as the information in the note is already on the page in the text itself. It seems a bit repetitive. In all, however, this is a very informative book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"As the author brilliantly points out, the human element is the weakest link in IT security. It doesn't matter how much hardware stands in the way of the hacker (or \\"social engineer\\"), security is often compromised by the unsuspecting employees who operate the computers, and are in most cases just asked for the passwords so the hackers can gain access.Full of examples of attacks on companies and individuals, \\"Art of Deception\\" is a must-read for anyone who works in the IT field, as well as anyone who uses a computer. It also contains practical ways to safeguard information, and most of it is pretty much common sense.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick has put together an excellent book, that fills a major gap in the computer and network security literature. The examples are realistic (I suspect more than one is a thinly-veiled example from real life) and clear depictions of the principles they illustrate. The book is well-organized, and most importantly, it gives sound advice on how to defeat the social engineer. The suggested information security policies at the end of the book are worth the price of the book all by themselves. This is a must-read for information security professionals and corporate executives.

If you read the book, pay attention with an open mind and use common sense, you will gain tremendous insight into effective ways of implementing security. Mr. Mitnick points out how most of us can be watching the door carefully while the intruder walks past us completely unnoticed. I would recommend reading through this book occasionally to keep the methods fresh in your mind, because the art of deception is exactly what it is about; computer knowledge and programming are only secondary skills."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"There are plenty of other so-called 'hackers' who are 'coming out' to help the world and writing books about it, and I have read most if not all them.When I ordered 24 copies from Wiley & Sons [the publisher] for resale at my eBookstore, I thought it would be just another hacker book that would sell well, but would leave it's reader not knowing a whole lot more about the subject of information security (InfoSec) than they did before they picked up the book and parted with their funds. I was wrong.Mitnick's book is full of useful information that can [and should] be put to use in any organization. The advice provided is not only practical but detailed and logical. The stupidity or carelessness of one user on the corporate LAN can render millions of dollars in gee-wiz security gadgets useless, allowing hackers into sensitive severs housing customer contact lists, proprietary trade secrets and internal memorandums containing confidential and personal information.For those of you who don't know, Mitnick breached the security of the largest corporations in America, including Motorola. After one of the most exhaustive manhunts in FBI history, and Mitnick's subsequent release from federal prison, he has been the most sought-after security consultant in the world.Mitnick, who is probably the world's foremost expert in trickery to gain access to sensitive information (known as 'social engineering'), reveals exactly how vulnerable you and your companies' personal information is to someone posing as an IRS Agent or as a AT&T; Customer Service Representative. You could say that Mitnick either had god's unlisted telephone number, or he could trick someone into giving it to him.Full of information that any company can use to implement effective security practices and make sure they are followed, The Art of Deception is a book that every corporate security manager, investigator and hacker alike should have on his or her desk."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Story by story, Mitnick (once described as the FBI's \\"most wanted hacker\\") reveals some tricks-of-the-trade. Fair enough. But if you are expecting technical details about defeating system login controls or busting through firewalls, you will be disappointed. Mitnick's favorite hacking tools are the telephone, plus the experience and nerve to deceive unsuspecting members of the organizations he is attacking into defeating the controls from the inside.Reading this book, you will quickly come to realize that Mitnick's toolbox is every bit as effective as the hacking and cracking technology ... and as you read further, it may dawn on you just how hard it is to counter the social engineering attack. After all, much as you might like to, you can't simply plug in a new program to security-patch your employees!Mitnick's suggested countermeasures in section 4 of the book are fairly straightforward (a wide-ranging security awareness program and a decent set of policies) but implementing them effectively and persuading employees to pay attention requires those very social engineering skills described in sections 1-3.I'm left with the distinct impression that Mitnick is teasing us by describing a few simple deceptions whilst keeping the best to himself. But think for a moment about the success of the \\"419\\" advance fee scams. Otherwise sane, intelligent individuals are evidently being drawn into parting with their hard-earned cash on the basis of these crude deceptions. The implications are truly frightening.My bottom line: take this book on holiday with you. Once you start, you will not want to put it down and you can reflect on it at the bar. Free drinks anyone?"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Since my first book on hackers (Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage by Clifford Stoll) and reading about Mitnick in the early 90s, I was expecting a fantastic book outlining how he managed to do so much while on the run.Unortunately, the writing style is quite repetitive and boring. Don't get me wrong - the substance is there, and there is plenty to be learned from Mitnick's 'fictional stories' that illustrate the concept of social engineering. However, as I said, the style leaves a lot to be desired, and after reading the firsy half of the book, I struggled motivating myself to grab the book and finish reading it.I recommend it only if you do not understand how social engineering works and don't mind putting up with a professional social engineering with amateur writing skills."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"There's nothing new about debating a criminal's right to publish his story. Frank Abagnale Jr, hero of the excellent \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" movie, wrote two books about his escapades. Concentrate on the message, not the messenger, and you'll learn something from either Mitnick or Abagnale.Mitnick's message is frightening: the easiest way to get what you want may be to ASK for it. \\"The Art of Deception\\" (TAOD) is built around dozens of realistic scenarios, showing how con men (and women) deceive victims and defeat security. It's easy to dismiss Mitnick's insights as trite. For example, it makes sense that \\"valuable information must be protected no matter what form it takes or where it is located. An organization's customer list has the same value whether in hardcopy form or an electronic file.\\" (p. 227) This \\"Mitnick Message\\" seems obvious at first glance, but how many company's act on that truism?\\"TAOD\\" shares technical, procedural, and psychological insights which aren't normally discussed by security personnel. Mitnick mentions secrets of the telecom system, like reprogramming caller ID on phone switches. He dances across company lines, shuttling information among secretaries, fax machines, voice mail, and other vulnerable parts of business life. His understanding of human nature shows he treats his craft seriously, believing security awareness is the best defense against social engineering. I found his \\"Security at a Glance\\" chapter indispensable, especially its 'Warning Signs of an Attack' and 'Responding to a Request for Information' sections.Mitnick's security policy recommendations in chapter 16 appear to be squarely based on military information handling guidelines. I followed all of his ideas, like data classification, need to know, cover sheets, and so on, as a military intelligence officer in a top secret facility. The corporate world, particularly the financial sector, is implementing some of these practices already.It's still too easy to defeat the technical defenses of many organizations. Those who do have their networks locked down leave social engineering and insider fraud as the best ways to steal information and money. As more organizations fall victim to \\"the art of deception,\\" they will turn to the wisdom of books by Mitnick and others. While they won't follow Mitnick's advice to provide \\"copies of this book to all employees\\" (p. 257), they will learn how to improve their \\"human firewalls.\\""},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick has been arguably the most famous computer hacker out there. His story has been told by others in several books. But here Mitnick is not trying to really share his experiences - rather he calls upon his collection of acquaintances and others he knows to illustrate how people can be engineered. Most of the book is essentially a series of stories of social engineering (getting someone to do what you want without their realizing it) and then some superficial analysis of why it worked. He then tries to synthesize his earlier chapters into a set of practical security precautions, many of which are common sense, and most of which the reader would have already figured out from reading the book. The stories he chooses to share are fairly interesting, both in their daring and setup and in their simplicity. What this book would be best for would be handing it to a corporate manager and allow him or her a wake up call as to security. As we try to work together, have things automated and available on-line and as our organizations grow the catchword is results, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. This is what the social engineer can exploit. Many of the stories skate along the edge of the law, and Mitnick points out when it would cross into illegal. While interesting, after a while the book becomes more tedious in structure and what is being said. Still it is very accessible and would be a great book for someone not so familiar with computers and hacking to see how some of it is done. It should serve as a wake-up call for management as to some of the dangers we face every day. And while most of the stories presented are more in the spirit of curiosity, or fun, or revenge, it would be easy to take them up a notch into activities with serious corporate impact."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Perhaps one of the best known social engineers is Kevin Mitnick. He was a master of the game, that is until he was caught. Sent to prison, and barred from using computers and the Internet for years because of his actions, he emerged a reformed man and set out to educate companies and users how to best protect themselves. One of his efforts, in collaboration with William L. Simon, was the 2002 book entitled The Art of Deception (368 Pages, J. Wiley, ISBN 076454280X). Since I was getting ready to read his new book (The Art of Intrusion), I wanted to read and review this title first so I would have context for his stories. Without I doubt, I am glad I did and this book is now on my \\"must read\\" recommendations list.The reason this book needs to be read is because it was, and really remains, a definitive work on Social Engineering. Too many security consultants and businesses focus time and money in hardware and software solutions, when the reality is that social engineering is the tool that can make all of that worthless and for naught. As prevalent as it is in our everyday lives in good ways, it is often is not recognized and understood when being used by the \\"bad guys\\".Mitnick and Simon take the reader step by step through a number of scenarios which probably did happen. Not only do they lay out what was done, but they analyze how it was done and why it was successful. If that is enough, they also present recommendations on how to counter the attacks at the end of each chapter. They also cover a broad range of attacks from technical to just getting inside the doors.The greatest asset of this book, which more than makes the book pay for itself, is that fact that the authors include a complete training and security awareness program outline, AND sample security policies to address social engineering. Too many times, this is left out of the picture. With this book as a resource, it is a very easy task to include it in all awareness programs.Who Should Read This Book?Information security officers and consultants need to read this book and incorporate the lessons into their own best practices. CIOs and CEOs need to read this book, which is very readable, to understands the nature of the threat. Employees need to read this book to understand how vulnerable they are. Maybe they might say,\\"Hey that happened to me!\\". It should even be read by anybody who is concerned about the privacy of their lives and information.The ScorecardDouble Eagle on a long Par 5"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought - Wow! these writers are telling everybody how they can steal a company's most secret information just by telling a few lies. But there's more to it. If you want to tell a bank how to protect itself against bank robbers, you have to tell them what tricks bank robbers use and how they think. That's what Kevin Mitnick is doing in this book. He's actually teaching every company how to protect itself. And when really think about \\"social engineering,\\" you can even imagine how it can easily entrap individuals as well."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"To many in the tech industry, Kevin Mitnick was elevated to \\"hero\\" status following his capture in 1995. More than other hackers that were prosecuted, Mitnick attained this status, because he was able to penetrate networks of some of the world's largest corporations, but never profitted from his exploits.His book, The Art of Deception, is a thrilling read for both the technology sector and the average person on the street. Mitnick shows that even with the most sophisticated hardware and software in place, networks are still vulnerable and can be easily compromised by attacking the weakest link---humans.In today's world, most of our personal data lives on a computer or computers somewhere. Identity theft is quickly becoming the crime of the decade, and a criminal doesn't need that much information to become someone else. Corporate and government espionage are also at an all-time high. One of the easiest lessons we have been taught as humans, is that if you act like you belong, others will usually accept that you do. Mitnick shows that by using this information, you can find out almost anything you need to know to attain entry into a computer network.I think that this book is a \\"must read\\" for all individuals working in the IT/security sector, and its examples and techniques should be implemented into security awareness training programs everywhere. Forewarned is forearmed."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"How shocking to learn how easy it is for a person to find out virtually anything about you by asking a few measly innocent questions to the right people.

While that is sometimes true, it is in fact not the most common form of access. The successful strategy is more often an application of social engineering, where the attacker speaks to another human and convinces them to bypass some form of security restriction. Kevin Mitnick has often been lauded for his computer skills, but I have read in several articles that his technical expertise is not outstanding. However, he is an expert at the social engineering (con game) side of breaching computer security and this book is a series of case studies describing successful attacks.The good con artist has several approaches and all exploit the fundamentals of the human element of computing. The people who manage systems or work at the help desk are trained to help people and follow the instructions of those in authority. Therefore, when somebody asks for assistance, describing a set of circumstances that have put them in a bind, the natural response is to do a \\"simple favor\\" to help them out. Of course those \\"favors\\" are in fact an attempt to penetrate the computer system for nefarious purposes. I have read several books on computer security, and this is one of the best. Mitnick describes in detail how the attacker prepares to \\"meet the mark\\" and how information that seems to be completely innocuous can be the opening to a successful attack. As the experts will tell you, all of the spending on software and hardware solutions to the security problems might as well have been spent on pizza if the people cannot recognize and deal with a social engineering attack.This book should be a mandatory item of study for all people who may even remotely be in a position to allow an attacker access. This includes security guards, secretaries, receptionists and even those that empty the garbage and mop the floors at night, for Mitnick describes successful attacks involving all four."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The psychology of a Con Job is more the issue here.

The bad thing about the book is that itis a con job in and of itself. Mitnick is profiting from hiscrimes.

And the only reason I give this book ANY stars is for the credit Mitnick deserves for convincing us to pay for and consume his advertisement. This book is filled with lame and repetitive anecdotes of how some employee got duped into disclosing internal company information, followed by \\"Mitnick Message\\" which boils down to: your company needs pen-testing and ALL your employees need security training. And who is better suited to provide the training than the guy that himself wrote the book...? I'm guessing his target audience is clueless management, who he hopes will be scared, impressed and buy his services. And if those of us with a clue that pick-up his book and leave a negative review: WHO CARES? WE ALREADY PAID HIM! :-) So kudos to Mr. Mitnick for being a brilliant salesman! Be warned - you won't find anything here about \\"CONTROLLING the Human Element of Security\\", you will only be repeatedly told the obvious: \\"the Human Element of Security\\" sucks.Don't get me wrong, everything Mitnick talks about here is mostly true, but extremely dragged-out, self-serving and does not deserve a book. Had this been a dramatically shorter magazine article, I'd rate it 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I just finished Kevin Mitnick's Art of Deception. I started the book after I saw 3rd episode of The Broken and a friend told me he has just bought a copy while visiting London.I expected an eye opening and high-tech hacker book, but I was very disappointed. In his book Mitnick lists plenty of social engineering stories, couple of which do represent a fresh way to look at things, but after reading couple of them, he just starts to repeat himself. Another disappointment was that there are absolutely no practical hacker hints or tricks and almost no computer related stuff in this book. After every story Mitnick gives advice, but that is typically just common sense and I have doubts how his methods of keeping a company safe of social engineers could be practical in a professional world.So, if you don't have any other idea what to read on the beach this summer, you can grab a copy. But if you are into computers and over 14, you'll probably struggle to read the book to the end"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick&#65533;s &#65533;The Art of Deception&#65533; is his greatest (to date) successful attempt of the &#65533;hacking&#65533; on a mass scale.

Bravo.The content - amusing (hence 3 stars) mix of anecdotes and corporate manuals, presents no news to a professional. Better books were written on the subject.

When hearing testimony from some criminals, serial killers for example, it is much harder to separate psychological problems from physiological problems from societal problems and so on. With crackers (bad hackers), it is a little easier. When one of them lays out all this material in an informational organized manner, we need to take note. This book is such a case.Many crackers will brag about their technical prowess and escapades. Very few will brag about their social equilance. By far, the latter is more dangerous, as any (good) computer security expert knows.The book starts out with many good examples of vulnerabilities in an easy-to-read manner. I learned several new areas where I need to tighten my OWN security. Kaching!Where it really starts getting good is in the applications. Sections 2 and 3 are good, but especially good are chapters 11 (&quot;Combining Technology and Social Engineering&quot;), 15 (&quot;Information Security Awareness and Training&quot;) and 16 (&quot;Recommended Corporate Information Security Policies&quot;). Chapter 16 is well worth the price of the book, all by itself.If you are serious about REAL computer security that is effective, you must read this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"In The Art of Deception, Kevin D. Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the \\"human element.\\" With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We from getAbstract recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Although many of the examples detailed in this book are dated , the concepts are still as easy to leverage as ever.Mr. Mitnick offers some possible solutions in this book, however he wasted his effort. As any security expert knows, getting upper management buy in to security is difficult at best. Management pays lip service to security, but they are typically more concerned about privacy issues than taking meaningful steps to address known security risks.When my organization tasked my team to perform a social engineering assessment of their network, that's what they meant. Over and over, we tried to suggest processes that would be easy to manipulate for even the most amateur attacker, only to be immediately cut off and told no. If there is no technical attack to guard against, management can't begin to process the implications."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"NOTICE: If you work in computer security in any capacity, you MUST read this book. You will learn tricks used by the most successful \\"social engineers\\" in the world, and you will learn what you can do to prevent these issues from ever happening to you and whoever you work for.Now that we're done with that, my first reccomendation if you plan to purchase this book is that you search the internet a bit more and dig up the \\"unreleased\\" first chapter to this book (freely available if you can find it)- in which Mitnick planned to release what is essentially his autobiography. You'll gain a new appreciation for exactly how hysterical people became trying to take this man down, and more importantly, you'll learn exactly what all the fuss is about.As for the actual book, Mitnick on computer security is akin to reading a book on how to play basketball from Michael Jordan, or how to direct a film by Steven Spielberg, or on how to make money by Bill Gates. There is simply no better source. Mitnick's writing is generally non-technical so that it can be understood by anyone, and personal enough that it's always involving. Remember- the skill that this man is famous for is the art of telling a convincing story, and he was so good at his skill that he became the most wanted criminal in the world for it.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, it probably does rate 5* as a primer.Like other reviewers I didn't enjoy Mitnick's self-congratulatory / self-apologetic tone.What it did remind me of is the lack of security at my own company :* our employee car park beneath the building is permanently unmanned, so multiple passengers could enter the building piggybacking - and they have access to the office space behind the 'firewall' of the reception desk.* in common with many companies we know have outsourced lots of things, including our Systems Security. So who's protecting who? I get lots of requests to send e-mails of commercially sensitive material outside our network to developers in India; but I refuse.

It is both an enjoyable and informative read.

I have actually inadvertently used some of these techniques when troubleshooting network issues or having forgotten my passcard to gain access to systems and rooms. It is often easier to bypass the rules than to go through the steps needed to obtain proper access and people are surprisingly willing to cooperate \\"just this one time\\".This book will help you sensitize your employees to the risks of bypassing security policy and recognize when this might be occurring.Highly recommended!CFH"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick has put together an excellent book, that fills a major gap in the computer and network security literature.

Mitnick is the authority on the subject. And even though the techniques in this book used in the scenarios might seem dated, they still still get the point across, that the 'Human Element', is one of the greatest security holes. In this day and age network administrators feel that they have an edge against hackers with firewalls, and proxies, and what not...but when somebody wants to really get in, and they have the skill of somebody like Mitnick, then trouble is at hand. Though when reading the book, most people will probably get the feeling that Kevin Mitnick is just skimming the surface, or giving us the shortened version of each scenario. Even so this is great reading, and a great addition to anybody interested in corporate security, 'dumster diving' type of techniques, or hacker/anti-hacker techniques. Definite must reading for anybody that would train employees about security, and privacy/sensitvity of material and documents. Truly the art of being sneaky is a gift to Mitnick, alongside his hacking skills. One of the greatest lessons learned in this book is the fact that most people are just not paranoid enough, information that you think isn't sensitive, or important, could just be the key to any hacker's plan.

It is written with an example of a con and then analysis how to protect by it.The book is split into chapters with similar cons and is very attractive for teaching classes.The cons are marvelous, but most of them are appearing in \\"Ghost in the Wires\\" so I was acquaintance to these tricks.This book is a must for security personals. To enjoy the experience of a life of a hacker I recommend to read the \\"Ghost in the Wires\\""},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The book has real value. Mitnick demonstrates how very important it is that corporations and institutions train their employees in properly controlling all information pertinent to protecting electronic security. On the other hand, you may feel, as did I, that Mitnick takes his past crimes very lightly... While one hates to see any criminal benefit from his or her crimes, this book is a valuable one for anyone interested in securing valuable information. The many examples of actual scams demonstrate the many human weaknesses in most security programs. The last two chapters lay out the broad outlines of possible corporate training programs intended to keep others like Kevin Mitnick out of their computers and are well worth reading by anyone involved in protecting computer systems...For a full review see Interface, Volume 3, Issue 5."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick relies heavily on the stupidity of people to make his points in all of his stories. Supposedly, many of the stories are based on actual events, but I find it very difficult to believe that Mr. Mitnick didn't take a few liberties in adding a few more \\"fantasy like\\" portions to the stories. I can also appreciate the point that he made that (paraphrase) \\"you're company is only as strong as your weakest link\\". However, I find myself a little confused as to why Mr. Mitnick felt it necessary to make this point 3, maybe 4, dozen times through out the book. In my opinion I feel like this few hundred page book could have easily been summed up in one simple 20 page document that could easily be circulated around an enterprise level business for increased awareness. The document would say, don't give any info to anyone unless you know them personally, don't give out passwords to other people(no kidding), patch your systems, run vulnerability tests, and harden your end user systems.I feel like this book is way more geared toward somewhat non-technical readers, like managers that just want to know the basics of how they can harden their security policies and baselines. For security and IT professionals this book is nothing more than an interesting set of stories. I found myself slapping my forehead multiple times wondering if Mitnick was really saying that half of the stories were due to good social engineering / hacking skills or more on the luck of the stupidity of people. There is a BIG difference between using good social engineering / hacking skills to get into an organizations information and the stupidity of people that just allow you to walk right in and take what you want. Sorry Mr. Mitnick, but distracting someone while your friend picks a lock to change a cable's port is not social engineering, it's picking a crappy lock. Look up the definition of social engineering if you think I'm wrong.I just want to say that I don't think this book is useless. There are some very good points made, and there are a lot of companies out there with really stupid people working for them that are creating a huge security gap that would benefit greatly from reading this. I just think there are a lot of better options out there than this, especially for those of us professional IT people."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"If you had to get some inside information from a company- be it development work, financial data, or the credit card number of the guy at your last poker game that won't pay up- how would you do it? Crack the 128-bit or higher encryption most people use on electronic messages? Who has that kind of time? How about buying an employee of the company several rounds of drinks? Could be expensive, and its easy to get identified later. As it turns out, your best bet is likely to just call up and ask for the information. Seriously.Kevin Mitnick, likely the most notorious hackers in history, has written a book containing 'fictional' accounts of how \\"social engineers\\" (basically just con-men, but also private investigators) can talk their way past people and get to whatever information they need. You rarely need a computer, let alone one powerful enough to crack encryption and passwords, to get the information you want if you can simply talk the talk- convince people you are inside the company and know what you are talking about, and more often than not they will tell you what you want to know. The beauty of stealing information is that it is difficult to know that a theft has occurred. After each story Mitnick analyzes what happened and how it could be prevented. The end of the book summarizes with a list of security policies to help prevent social engineering attacks. Admittedly, a lot of the policies are common sense, like don't give out your password, but that should help to illustrate just how much of a vulnerability we humans are to information security.The book is not very technical at all, so if you are looking for detailed technical accounts of Mitnick's exploits, look elsewhere. The book does suffer from poor organization and there is a fair bit of redundant material, but I didn't find it to be a major drawback. This book should be read by just about anyone and everyone- we are culturally expected to be helpful to strangers, and should remain so, but there is a need to be vigilant when people start asking for sensitive information. I would imagine that identity theft would be reduced if more people were aware of the tactics that the ne'er-do-wells use."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The author has journeyed from one side of the law to the other and explored every nook and cranny of both internet and human security vulnerabilities. He brings his knowledge and experience to the forefront to help protect companies and individuals from falling prey to what he used to do. In this book you will find helpful weblinks, dos and don'ts, and tons of precautions you can take. At times, I couldn't help notice that he sounded like he was bragging about how easy it was to dupe people. This book might just teach you more than you wanted to know. Let's hope you're one of the good guys."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I could not put this down! It reads so well that i could hardly put it down. I kept laughing out loud at the stupidity of the people only to realize that they really weren't that stupid. Mitnick is a great con man / social engineer. His exploits / fictional accounts read like an eery account of what to watch out for. Yes, we all think we are smarter than him and all those guys out there, but we really aren't (or at least, not as devious).I bought this book as I was interested in the subject. I am not a hacker, but technically able... it is not about hacking, and is not a technical computer \\"how to\\" book, but as I learned, a how to on social engineering... the funny thing (I did not know previously) Mitnick, really did very little with computers. Most of his crimes were with social engineering.What he did show is how easily people part with sensitive information. In turn, how that small piece of information could be leveraged into more information, until you have all of the pieces of the puzzle and you have some seriously compromising information that nobody would like to have released.Don't buy this if you are looking for a computer book, but do get it if you are looking for a book that reads easily (I attribute this to his co-writer) and is a fun, yet scary read."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick, probably the most famous (and controversial) computer hacker of the 1990's, has spent several years of his life on the run, as well as a few years in jail. For years after leaving prison he was forbidden to log on to a computer, a prohibition he appealed successfully. He now runs a computer security business, lectures to large corporations, and has co-authored two books on computer network security.This book focuses on the human element of computer security. Reminding us that even the most sophisticated high-tech security systems can be rendered worthless if the people running them are not sufficiently vigilant, Mitnick goes on to point out the myriad ways in which human carelessness can contribute to security breaches. An experienced con artist who is well-versed in social engineering techniques can often do far more damage by manipulating people to provide information they shouldn't than by relying on technologically sophisticated hacking methods.The book is interesting for the most part, though it would have benefited from a 25% reduction in length, and there are some annoying stylistic tics. Throughout the first 14 chapters, each of which reviews a particular type of \`con' used by hackers/social engineers to breach computer security, the chapter setup follows the same schema:(i) an anecdote or vignette, involving fictitious characters but based on actual events, which lays out the deception as it unfolds, following it through to the successful breach (ii) analysis of the \`con', focusing specifically on the mistakes or behaviors (at the individual and at the organizational level) which allowed it to succeed (iii) discussion of the changes that would be needed to stop the con from succeeding (e.g. behavior of individual employees, corporate policies and procedures, computer software and hardware). This is actually a pretty decent way to make the points Mitnick wants to get across - starting out with a concrete example of how things go wrong gets attention and motivates the reader to read on to figure out the solution.One feature of the book which was meant to be helpful started to annoy me by about the third chapter. Interspersed throughout each chapter, the authors insert highlighted textboxes of two types: \`lingo' - repeating the definition of a concept already adequately defined in the text, or \`mitnick messages' - which seemed superfluous, and a little condescending, as they generally repeated what was already obvious. In general, this is not a book you will read for the delights of its prose style (after successfully gaining access to a cache of hidden documents, one hacker is described as spending his evening gleefully \\"pouring over\\" the documents); however, the prose is serviceable, managing to avoid lapses into the dreaded corpspeak, for the most part.For some readers, the most useful part of the book may be its final two chapters. Here the authors lay out, in considerable detail, outlines for recommended corporate information security policies, and an associated training program on information security awareness. Though I am no expert in these areas, the outlines strike me as being commendably thorough - complete enough that they could be fleshed out without too much difficulty to generate a comprehensive set of policies and procedures.Despite some redundancy, and occasional infelicities of style, this book seemed to me to be interesting, and likely to be practically useful."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Overall I'd say this is a must-read for anyone interested in corporate data security. It definitely gets you thinking about the vulnerabilities in your company. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because if anything it give TOO MANY examples of how social engineers can fool people into providing seemingly innocuous information and use it to achieve ther goal. If you are in IT or care about your companies data security, READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I was in shock after reading the first couple of chapters. I now have a completely different look on security. After reading this book you will see how easy it really is to get someones password, or get a business's internal phone directory with a phone call or two. This book is a great guide for creating a security policy within your company. After every &quot;story&quot;, Mitnick provides his advice on how this was accomplished and what you can do to stop it. The only problem with the book is that Mitnick's solutions to these problems are almost identical in every chapter, just with different wording. Once you understand this, you will probably skip his advice on the last few chapters. Overall a great book though!"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Other reviewers write that this book is repetetive, and I agree - I believe that Mitnick is trying to convey a mindset. Each scenario in the book, taken alone, is insignificant. You can skip through the book, reading here and there, without losing much. Don't expect to learn much in this book about technicals of network security. But then again, all the computer and telecommunications savvy in the world does not make a hacker.The right technical skills and knowledge, plus the mindset presented in this book equals hacking. If you are on the security side of things, reading this book (or a few chapters of it, at least) will help you get into the mindset of a hacker, and thus better detect weaknesses in your organization or system.By the way, I thought the book was an entertaining read. Others say it was boring. I think they expected the wrong thing out of the book. For those of you that have read Harvey Mackay - this book is a lot like &quot;Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive&quot; - he tells parables to get the message across."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I'm responsible for securing our company's network, which includes writing security policies and guidelines for users to follow. Like many people in the industry, much of my security training has been focused almost exclusively on the technologies used to attach and defend networks. But more and more, I think we are all beginning to realize there is a very important human element involved as well. Mitnick does a great job in this book of giving the security professional insight into the social engineering techniques used to take advantage of either weakness or ignorance in a particular target. I've found this book as useful as any in my library."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The human factor is truly security's weakest link according to Kevin Mitnick, famed hacker, now turn security consultant.Mitnick, based on his illustrious experiences, writes about social engineering; the human factors involved with information security. The book goes into multiple ways of showing social engineering in practice, such as convincing an employee to reveal his computer username and password or tricking someone to download spyware.The book is definitely an eye-opener, bringing awareness of such devious, unorthodox tactics and attacks that users, net administrators and companies are commonly uneducated about. For counteractive measures, Mitnick goes on to recommend the establishment of training and awareness programs in addition to security policy guidelines.But an interesting note surrounding the publication of this book was \\"the lost chapter\\". Much of the preface section never made the final cut but happened to mysteriously turn up on the Internet.It revealed a lot more of Mitnick, with him recounting his life as a hacker and fugitive, about incidents whereby he was wrongly accused and his later arrest and incarceration where he was denied his constitutional rights...and John Markoff of the New York Times who couldn't get his facts straight.At the end of this \\"lost chapter\\", it's safe to say you'd have some sympathy towards the legendary Mitnick, a hero in his own right. But then you'd have to give it a second thought, wouldn't you? After all, the book is about deception. ;-)[+] Many methods of social engineering, an eye-opener.[-] The scenario examples are fictionalized. He doesn't regale us with his actual stories."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"After reading it, the book makes one more aware of what to be careful when giving out information of any kind and how to protect yourself and your company's assets. I've heard alot of &quot;Don't ever give out your id/password&quot;, &quot;Always have firewalls on your network.&quot; One hardly ever hears about 'make sure you're giving information to someone who's supposed to have it'. There's tons of books on security with respect to technology but this is the first one I've seen that actually focuses on the weakest link when it comes to security - the human element.All the firewalls and software can't prevent a social engineer from getting in if he/she knows justs how to act and/or what to say to get what they want. Reading the scenarios really opened my eyes. Theres a scenario where a social engineer pretended to be a manager of a video store. After enough talking to another employee at another branch, the social engineer was able to get enough information to obtain the credit card # of someone who owed money to the client the social engineer was hired by.In reading the scenarios, I'd seen examples where I'd asked for the type of information described for perfectly legitimate reasons. I'd never imagined how someone could take just 1 or 2 pieces of information and create chaos for a person or a company. If you're in the IT industry, or work in any kind of customer service, you really need to pick up this book. This book doesn't bash people for being as helpful as they can be (team player, etc). He's just saying to be more aware of what's going on and when giving out any kind of information, being a little cautious doesn't hurt. As humans, we're not perfect to begin with, but a little awareness will make it just a little harder for that social engineer to get what they want."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"There are over 70 reviews on Amazon so I will keep this short. Since I work for a security research and education group, I get proposals to do a social engineering course several times a year. In general they can only come up with 6 or 7 attacks. Nothing I have seen has the depth and breadth of this work."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I will not get into the irrelevant debate (pro or con) about Kevin Mitnick's personality. What matters is this: Social engineering, the art of talking yourself into places you don't belong, is one of the largest, and most poorly understood, security exposures that most organizations face.This book provides excellent insight into how the process works, what elements the social engineer relies on for success, and what you can do to make the social engineer's job more difficult. In order to fight this threat, you have to understand it. The book's approach is to present a long series of \\"fictional\\" (sometimes very thinly disguised) episodes, with some commentary and analysis. This structure, essentially a string of stories, can make the book seem rambling and unstructured at times.Some of the stories may seem unsophisticated, glaringly obvious, common sense. Two things to keep in mind: (1) the reader has the advantage of knowing that a scam is being perpetrated, and (2) obvious or not, this stuff does work! Could it work on your organization? How sure are you?Management wants to believe that security is a product, sold in a shrink-wrapped box, that you can install and then \\"be secure\\". The security industry wants to sell you those products.The real truth is that security is hard work, it's never done, and it has much more to do with people than with the latest whiz-bang technology. Not a popular truth, but still true.If you're not familiar with the ins and outs of social engineering, this book will help you figure out what it's all about. If you are already familiar with the concept, you'll still find value here -- something you'd never thought of before, or at least some new stories to help you convince management that this stuff matters. The story that sticks in my mind is the one involving a site using hardware \\"smart card\\" access tokens. Very good security, right? Well, the intruder gets in anyway....I rate this book 4.5 stars, rounding up to 5."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"As a Technology Director, security is a huge risk. I purchased this book to find out what it was all about. Social Engineering is an incredible Psychological episode, and the authors have explained it very meticulously that hopefully everyone will get a warning before an attack occurs. If you are in the Information Technology field I highly recommend this book on everyone's bookshelf. If you are not in I.T., I would still recommend reading it, because you may not be ready for a social engineer attack. My congratulation goes out to the authors of this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick says \\"the term 'social engineering' is widely used within the computer security community to describe the techniques hackers use to deceive a trusted computer user within a company into revealing sensitive information, or trick an unsuspecting mark into performing actions that create a security hole for them to slip through.\\" It's suitable that Mitnick, once vilified for his cracking exploits, has written a book about the human element of social engineering - that most subtle of information security threats.Some readers may find a book on computer security penned by a convicted computer criminal blasphemous. Rather than focusing on the writer's past, it is clear that Mitnick wishes the book to be viewed as an attempt at redemption.The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security states that even if an organization has the best information systems security policies and procedures; most tightly controlled firewall, encrypted traffic, DMZ's, hardened operating systems patched servers and more; all of these security controls can be obviated via social engineering.Social engineering is a method of gaining someone's trust by lying to them and then abusing that trust for malicious purposes - primarily gaining access to systems. Every user in an organization, be it a receptionist or a systems administrator, needs to know that when someone requesting information has some knowledge about company procedures or uses the corporate vernacular, that alone should not be authorization to provide controlled information.The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security spends most of its time discussing many different social engineering scenarios. At the end of each chapter, the book analyzes what went wrong and how the attack could have been prevented.The book is quite absorbing and makes for fascinating reading. With chapter titles such as The Direct Attack; Just Asking for it; the Reverse Sting; and Using Sympathy, Guilt and Intimidation, readers will find the narratives interesting, and often they relate to daily life at work.Fourteen of the 16 chapters give examples of social engineering covering many different corporate sectors, including financial, manufacturing, medical, and legal. Mitnick notes that while companies are busy rolling out firewalls and other security paraphernalia, there are often unaware of the threats of social engineering. The menace of social engineering is that it does not take any deep technical skills - no protocol decoders, no kernel recompiling, no port scans - just some smooth talk and a little confidence.Most of the stories in the book detail elementary social engineering escapades, but chapter 14 details one particularly nasty story where a social engineer showed up on-site at a robotics company. With some glib talk, combined with some drinks at a fancy restaurant, he ultimately was able to get all of the design specifications for a leading-edge product.In order for an organization to develop a successful training program against the threats of social engineering, they must understand why people are vulnerable to attack in the first place. Chapter 15 explains of how attackers take advantage of human nature. Only by identifying and understanding these tendencies (namely, Authority, Liking, Reciprocation, Consistency, Social Validation, and Scarcity), can companies ensure employees understand why social engineers can manipulate us all.After more than 200 pages of horror stories, Part 4 (Chapters 15 and 16) details the need for information security awareness and training. But even with 100 pages of security policies and procedures (much of it based on ideas from Charles Cresson Wood's seminal book Information Security Policies Made Easy) the truth is that nothing in Mitnick's security advice is revolutionary - it's information security 101. Namely, educate end-users to the risks and threats of non-technical attacks.While there are many books on nearly every aspect of information security, The Art of Deception is one of the first (Bruce Schneier's Secrets and Lies being another) to deal with the human aspect of security; a topic that has long been neglected. For too long, corporate America has been fixated with cryptographic key lengths, and not focused enough on the human element of security.From a management perspective, The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security should be on the list of required reading. Mitnick has done an effective job of showing exactly what the greatest threat of attack is - people and their human nature."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Mitnick has his own reputation to live up to with this book, which sets a pretty high bar for the audience who knows him as the \\"World's Most Notorious Hacker.\\" Unfortunately, while he knows the material cold, his skills as an author are less stellar.The vignettes describing various cons are, in the large, very entertaining. They're fictionalized, and sometimes the dialogue feels artificial. This book is supposed to convince us how easily people are victimized by social engineers. When the victim's dialogue plays too obviously into the con man's hands (for the purpose of illustrating the point relevant to the enclosing chapter/section), this goal is to some extent defeated. It's too easy to read unnatural dialogue and use that as an excuse to tell oneself, \\"I don't have to worry about that sort of attack -- I'm not that dumb!\\" More effort could have been expended in fictionalizing these scenarios without making them so difficult to relate to. Seeing how a con is performed is kind of like learning how a magic trick works -- it holds a similar fascination. Imagine seeing an amazing magic trick performed on television, wondering how it was possibly accomplished, and then learning that the trick was all in the video editing. That really sucks the fun out of the magic -- analogously, when the \\"trick\\" in one of these cons is just that the victim does something obviously stupid at just the right moment, the believability and enjoyment are damaged.Despite what I've said, the cons are definitely enjoyable to read and do offer some genuine insights. Not all suffer from believability problems. However, the supporting material discussing these scenarios is pretty weak. There's a rigid format (\\"Analyzing the con,\\" \\"Preventing the con,\\" etc.) which leads the author to repeat the same points over and over again with very little variation, at times seemingly just to fit the format. The purpose of all this material is to give useful security recommendations and proper motivation for following them. The recommendations are on-target, but repeated ad nauseum.The descriptions of social engineers also suffer from a tendency to stroke the author's own ego -- the bigger the con, the thicker the language about how smart, handsome, and clever the con man is. I'd like to be convinced by facts, not hyperbole.I think this would really have worked better as two books, for two different audiences. One for entertainment, to read about all the cons and how they work, to get a little history of social engineering. And one for serious security discussion. The blend of the two leads to a schizoid work that's simply mediocre."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Now that Kevin Mitnick is out of prison he has written \\"The Art of Deception\\". I rate this book as four stars. Has good insight regarding how Kevin was able to gain large company employee's trust by using social engineering methods. He gives great examples of how he would simply use a telephone to gain user id's and passwords, even from high tech security departments.Most employee's don't think they are allowed to say 'no' to giving out information over the phone or email in the name of great customer service. There may be company policies but they 'still try to do the right thing' to help a co-worker regain access to the system, when in fact the person is a hacker.Many solutions are offered to help small and large companies balance the choice of customer service over security and trust. One funny chapter was how Mr. Mitnick's used the same social engineering methods in prison to get additional phone calls, better food, and increase family visits. Classic... He didn't stop even in prison.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book cuts to the chase, and exposes what was, currently is, and will continue to be the weakest link in computer security... the human element. Historically, people seem to take the path of least resistance. Give them a reason to believe you are who you say you are, and they will accept it. Give them a reason to think you're helping them (even with a problem they never knew they had until you pointed it out to them), and they will put at your disposal all their tools and information. We won't be able to make much inroads into security (of any kind) until we being to change the essence of human nature... and that, my friend, is unlikely to change. Kevin Mitnick tells it like it is -- from the voice of experience. As obvious as some of the pretexts are, they worked for him... and will likely continue to work for the next generation's social engineer. Remember, the difference between truth and fiction is but a state of mind. Persuasion is still the key element... one that Mitnick has mastered. Read, learn, and avoid the simple mistakes of others.

You know, don't leave your network password on a post-it on your bulletin board, be aware of strangers in your office, that kind of thing. Then, I finished reading the book, and realized that it challenged all the assumptions that I had about the way I react in these situations. Mitnick's right - we as human beings are conditioned to be polite and trusting, and as horrible as it seems, that's not always right. But you don't have to become nasty and distrustful, just aware. That's what this book is talking about. The examples are wonderful - they really do read like a mystery thriller. And the advice is really sound. It doesn't mention it here, but there is a great flowchart in the back of the book that I've copied for everyone in my office. It details what to do if someone calls you for information that you are not sure they need or should be getting.

The book was almost worth the wait!Its a fun book with lots of entertaining and education stories on whatis possible by means of social engineering attacks. The charactersclearly push the limits of this \\"human technology\\".One of the articles I have read on the book called it \\"Kevin Mitnick'sLatest Deception\\" due to his downplaying of technology securitycontrols and emphasizing people skills and weaknesses. However, thehuman weaknesses do nullify the strengths of technology defenses andhumans are much harder to \\"harden\\" than UNIX machines.The attack side is stronger in the book than the defense side,naturally following from the author's background. However, there aresome great defense resource on policy design, awareness and neededvigilance. However, there is this \\"minor\\" issues with defense againstsocial engineering: one of the definitions called it a \\"hacker'sclever manipulation of the natural human tendency to trust\\". The word\\"natural\\" is key; if we are to believe the definition, all defensesagainst social engineering will be going against _nature_ and, as aresult, will be ineffective for most environments. Author alsoadvocates social engineering penetration testing, which appears to bethe best way to prepare for such attacks. Security awareness, whileneeded, will get you so far.The book's stories show examples of hackers defeating firewalls,passwords, token and two-factor authentication systems, multi-layerdefense, financial institutions security, armed guards and many othercommonly believed to be effective security controls. While some of thestories first seem to defy common sense, upon more detailedinvestigation there are clearly believable. Dialogs, stories,situations are described with terrifying reality behind them: \\"So what is the money transfer code for today? - Its this-and-that...\\" Socialengineers bravely attack and conquer on the pages of this great book!The book will give lots of ideas to those involved in penetrationtesting. Using the book, it is possible to extract a structure of asuccessful attack, gather some target selection criteria, learn how tocombine social and technical attacks and then use it for thepentesting.The biggest shortcoming of the book is that it has no \\"attack HOWTO\\"part. It has zero content on developing, improving and polishing thesocial engineering skills. While it might seem that natural ability isall it takes, the author _knows_ that there are methods to developsocial engineering skills, but chose not to disclose them and I regrethis decision to withhold such information.Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA is a Senior Security Analyst with a majorinformation security company.

He gained access to our network through an elaborate pretext; gaining access to systems that were secured by firewalls, dial back modems, extensive security policies and (unfortunately) many humans like myself. Everything but the humans worked flawlessly.The art of the con is as old as anything. Con artists know that any system, yes ANY system, can be compromised as long as humans are involved. All the technology in the world (alone) isn't going to stop a creative and motivated social engineer.Sadly, the focus of IT security today is on technology and technology alone. Very little attention is paid to the topic of social engineering and how to mitigate this threat. \`Human nature' is, once again the culprit here, as people view controls that reduce social engineering threats (strict process controls, seemingly redundant and repetitive procedures) as unnecessary or overly paranoid.This book goes a long way to illustrate the wide applicability of this type of threat, even describing social engineering attacks against the traffic court systems and the Social Security Administration.This book is a \`must read' for any serious security professional, and a very interesting read for anybody wanting a look at the way a real hacker's brain works."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"After all the media hype and disinformation surrounding his past \\"hacker\\" exploits, it would have been easy for Kevin Mitnick to just sell out and pen a cheesy \\"How To Be a Hacker\\" book, or even a simple autobiography setting an objective balance to sensationalist Mitnick-centered books such as John Markoff's \\"Cyberpunk\\" and \\"Takedown\\".

No author has ever tackled this tremendously important--and consistently ignored--aspect of information security with the same amount of depth, specificity and firsthand knowledge that Mitnick documents in this book.Despite the book jacket's description of Mitnick as a \\"legendary hacker\\" and \\"cyber-desperado\\", this book is decidedly NOT about \\"hacking\\" in the purest form in the word. In fact, it's rather ironic that for most people, the name \\"Kevin Mitnick\\" is synonymous with the profile of a stereotypical \\"master hacker\\", because he is much less regarded in the underground hacker scene for his technical skills than for his adept social engineering skills. Some would even say that without his social engineering chops, Mitnick would have been nothing more than an average geek with knowledge of common computer intrusion techniques.Even if you accept that opinion as true, it truly underscores the very real threat social engineering poses to ANY organization, and also proves one of the underlying themes of this book, which is that an attacker doesn't need to possess exotic and hyper-advanced \\"hacking\\" skills (or in many cases, even a computer!) to get at your company's sensitive data. All it takes is a phone call and gullible employees who aren't aware that answering a caller's seemingly innocuous questions can ultimately compromise the security of the entire company. Like the blurb on the book jacket says, \\"the gravest security risk of all is human nature.\\"The renowned cryptographer Bruce Schneier once wrote, \\"security is not a product, it's a process\\". \\"The Art of Deception\\" bolsters that notion, and completely shatters the myth that technological measures can ensure information (or even physical) security. If anything, a company's security technology can be artfully used against itself in ways that completely negate its effectiveness. There is a very enlightening section on Caller-ID spoofing which will definitely open the eyes of anyone who thinks that a Caller-ID display is positive proof of a caller's identity and location. Mitnick claims a 100% success rate in getting information out of people using a spoofed internal company Caller-ID name and number. Because of this, he continually reminds the reader of the absolute worthlessness of Caller-ID as a security mechanism. I'm glad he does this, because almost no one outside of the hacking and phreaking scene even realizes that Caller-ID spoofing is possible, and the more this fact can be beaten into the heads of I.T. or security managers, the better. You can have millions of dollars of firewall products, encryption technology, password policies, and intrusion detection systems in place, but if I can simply call up your company's new intern on the phone (using spoofed Caller-ID, of course) pretending to be a company executive, and social engineer him into divulging information or even sending out sensitive files or faxes directly from internal computers, then that \\"technology\\" is nothing more than a heap of black boxes with lots of pretty blinking lights. An iron door on a cardboard house.There are many people who have automatic biases against Mitnick (due to his past record as a convicted felon) and will cast off this book as nothing more than a how-to manual on conning corporations out of their data. The debate on whether he deserved the treatment he received from the U.S. Federal Government and Justice Department, and whether he is truly a \\"criminal\\" or not, is completely ancillary to the value and legitimacy of this book. It is not an I.T. or con man's version of \\"The Anarchist Cookbook\\". He devotes 78 pages at the end of the book specifically outlining recommended corporate security policies. The book is always written from the perspective that the social engineer is the \\"bad guy\\", and Mitnick makes no concerted attempt to justify social engineering as a legitimate activity.The only problem I see with \\"The Art of Deception\\" is, ironically, not the book itself. It is with the very people whom this book seeks to educate regarding the dangers of social engineering. No doubt, most IT managers will come away from this book as if they had a religious epiphany. However, knowing the time and budget constraints placed on employees by many companies, I am extremely skeptical that you can instill the same sense of urgency and vigilance in employees who don't have a direct, firsthand reason to care about information security. If you can social engineer the overnight janitor to turn on a restricted development server, or get an intern to divulge the name and internal phone extension of a project manager, then you're still screwed. It's difficult to see how it's possible to effectively guard against all forms of social engineering without making every single employee in a company act like an annoying paranoid twit in response to even the most truly innocuous situations.Regardless, this book should be required reading for all company executive and managers, in both large and small organizations. When it comes right down to it, \\"The Art of Deception\\" is fundamentally a book on psychology than actual information security techniques, and as such, the principles demonstrated within are equally applicable to any company that has information or resources that need to be protected from outsiders. For example, Mitnick explains a hilarious, and ridiculously simple social engineering scheme that can get your traffic tickets dismissed. And with no computers required from the social engineer's end. The book is at least funny, if nothing else."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"When I picked this book up, I thought it was going to be an apologia from Mitnick for his prior life's work: cracking into supposedly secure phone and computer systems and networks. I read the book just before Hallowe'en, and that was appropriate, because the stories Mitnick recounts are really scary. Instead of wasting words explaining his own actions, Mitnick gives scores of fascinating examples of how most &quot;security&quot; proved to be simply non-existent. In the end, all security systems depend on humans, and therein lies the weakest link. The books shows how easy it is to gain people's trust- over the phone- and by getting them to reveal little bits of seemingly harmless information, gaining complete control over any data the con man (or woman) wants to get.The book sets out security policies, and there's also a whole chapter on security training. One of Mitnick's recommendations is for companies to supply each employee with a copy of the book. Normally I'd dismiss this as blatant self-promotion. But believe me, in this case, the more people share the book's stories with each other at the water cooler, the closer the company will come to being a secure environment.Mitnick makes it clear that everyone in the company has to be aware of security issues, and of the many types of attacks he describes so well, and know how to react to any demand for information, even from someone who appears to be an insider. By the time you finished the book, you'll be a believer, and you'll think two or three times before giving out information. And company security officers may want to stop simply sending e-mails about security, and get all employees (including the receptionists!) into classroom training.The only problem I had with this book was Mitnick's use of the term &quot;social engineering&quot; to describe the manipulation of employees and security systems. Social engineering is what the conservatives accuse the liberals on the U.S. Supreme Court of doing.But that's a minor item in an otherwise overwhelming and totally convincing book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"While it's a temptation to impose value judgement about the author who is a convicted felon, I strongly urge anyone who is involved in security (IT and corporate), internal auditors and fraud prevention specialists to suspend any opinions of the author and to carefully read this book.What we in the IT world call 'social engineering' is nothing more than a con that exploits human trust. Mitnick was highly effective at social engineering and this book provides a wealth of information regarding his views of 'social engineering' vulnerabilities and how he exploited them. He exposes the details of some of the most effective techniques used by those who use social engineering to accomplish their goals - whether those goals are as sinister as corporate espionage or fraud, or merely to prove that they can gain access to systems and information. While some of the recommended countermeasures in this book may seem Draconian there is middle ground to implement effective controls that do not hamper business processes or impose overly restrictive policies.The bottom line, though, is to learn from this book and distill the key lessons into knowledge throughout your organization. Awareness is one of the most powerful security tools, and this book promotes that. Also, while this book is ostensibly about IT security, the lessons imparted are as applicable to any other aspect of a business as they are to IT - in many ways there are even more applicable because the exploits are based on effective con games that were in existence long before computers came on the scene."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is about you. Yes, you. The carbon-based life form in his natural habitat - the cubicle - tapping high-spirited and without worries on the keyboard. In the age of abundant security hypes and the painful, daily confrontations with the insecure reality, you finally managed to build a secure environment. Life is good.A system is technically perfect when the only flaw in the system is the Human that operates, maintains and works with it. That makes you and every employee in the organization a target.Organizations in the world invest massive amounts of money in firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection ,VPN technology... but often neglect the most important and vulnerable security component: humans.Kevin Mitnick brings you an essential piece of valuable awareness training packed in an easy reading book. Using realistic cases, interweaved with side notes, tips and lingo explanations from the master, you can start to mature and to fill the gaps in your security policy.Review: The art of deception, controlling the Human Element of Security.By Kevin D.

But not quite as complete as Mitnick intended. Mitnick had wished to include a brief biographical sketch debunking the legendary persona created by New York Times tech hack John Markoff and detailing his ordeal at the hands of federal prosecutors. Unfortunately, the publisher rejected what were to be the juiciest parts of Chapter One."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is an eye opener. The stories are entertaining, yet sometimes frighten that it could really happen. I defiantly recommend this book. The only down side is that he never shows what would happen if the social engineer would fail or make a mistake."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"If you're reading this, you're already a victim of &quot;social engineering&quot; as Mitnick calls it. You somehow believe that reading these reviews will tell you whether the book is OK or not. But these reviews can be entered by anyone. Perhaps Mitnick has entered most of them himself or his publisher did the same; you'll never know.So instead go down to the local bookstore, handle a copy and determine for yourself."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Kevin Mitnick IS a criminal. I have problems abetting his profiting from his crimes. However, that aside; this is a useful book. I am also put-off by his boastfulness.A well-run and maintained network is difficult to attack. Not impossible, just difficult. The easiest way to subvert most systems is the weakest component - the people. People want to be helpful and too often are not aware of the impact of even simple slips. People are also lazy. They write down passwords, circumvent security systems that seem burdensome, and do not report obvious attempts to access system.Mitnick show us that the most difficult part of any security system is to educate the users and to obtain their buy in that a secure system is a benefit."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Adequate for noobs and pros to understand how important social engineering in our security is, this applied not only in software; you can relate it with anything in your live.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is filled with information that you would not believe.

Typically information security discussions center on technology (antivirus, firewall, intrusion detection), but this book makes clear that the weakest link in most security chains are the people in the organization. Only through a good policy and training can this weakness be addressed. A must read for anyone seriously interested in information security."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Wow! This is a must read book for just about everyone, even those who have not entered the information age yet.In a world that incessantly grows complex and beyond the understanding of the common man, one simply cannot cope with the new risks and threats that arise on a daily basis. This leads to innocent mistakes that can cause us serious harm.Often - techies and geeks believe technology is the answer - and to an extent that is true; however, the human element is the weakest link - and this book shows that in a nice way.Read this book to understand the ploys used, the tactics of a vicious mind (or mischevious), and how easy it is for a vast majority of the people to fall victim. The good thing is that you will get ideas on what you and your company should be doing different.Remember - although you will learn a lot - maintaining your guard and building immunity against deception is a moving traget. As such - you will need to strive and go beyond the many points covered in the book.Read it and implement better practices in your work and life without any delay...the risks are not worth it."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Read this book or become a victim! Not only will you learn the how's and why's of social engineering, but you will also be thoroughly entertained by Mitnick's stories. Everyone in the security field should consider The Art of Deception required reading. Let me rephrase that - everyone should be required to read this book. Period.This would be a great book to recommend to your employees as part of security awareness training. The text is accessible and drives the message home that social engineering is a very real threat."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This is a great starting point for anybody interested in deceit. While the book focuses on \\"real-world\\" deceit, many of the principles carry over to online crime. It is very easy to read, and yet, informative and helpful. If you want to find an answer to the question \\"Just how much will people agree to?\\" then this is the book for you to read -- whether you are a system administrator, security researcher, policy maker, or simply interested in understanding fraud and psychology better.Markus Jakobsson[..]"},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"Some of the elements of this book are hard to swallow, bordering on pure fiction. Although supposedly based on actual events, the wording (\\"A Large Telco\\" or \\"An Electronics Firm\\") makes it difficult to mentally follow the story by visualizing the events. A lot of key detail is left out, which makes this book a 4 star.If you plan to take this book as a literal account of social engineering, it's a 1 star at best. If you hope to gain some general insight into social engineering, backed up heavily on theory and anecdotes, this is a solid book."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"I'm a business person turned technical and have mixed opinions about this book. I would recommend it to people who have no awareness of how social engineering can compromise computer security above any physical security countermeasures.It is repetitive in its warnings and examples, but one's reaction to that repetitiveness (boredom, apathy) only serves to illustrate how one can easily become a target of deception. One must analyze all social interactions within any high-security context to decrease security risk. This book emphasizes that a situation can actually be high-security without the average business person knowing it."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is a very interesting read, and can be helpful in identifying social engineers at work in the workplace."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The book was OK but it's a few years old. The techniques the author used to defeat computer networks and the people that use them have changed a bit. Interesting stories but not as relevant as they were when he wrote them."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"This book is geared towards BDM (Business Decision Makers) who need to decide if and how they should secure their assets. If you live or work in an environment that is still unsure if they need to protect themselves in this way, then you should absolutely read this and share it with other decision makers. Hopefully it will open their eyes to the dangers of information leaks.While the book is a bit dated with all its talk of security your incoming analog modems, it is an easy read with good examples of discussions and sceneries that at face value might seem harmless, but when collected in the larger attack scenario become important pieces of the puzzle. This book is essentially a series of anecdotes about social engineering attacks from multiple perspectives. This makes it useful since this presentation provides both the attack and the reasons for choosing the method of attack."},{"Title":"The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security","review":"The item arrived in the specified time and was exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"Biology Revisioned","review":"In this remarkable book, two great biologists hold a speculative conversation about the true nature of &quot;life, the universe, and everything,&quot; and you get to eavesdrop. Your world view will never be the same.Following in the tradition of James Lovelock and Lyn Margulis, the late Willis Harman and his protege Elizabet Sahtouris here take Gaia Theory (the notion that our planet is a superorganism not merely hosting life, but in itself alive) to its next logical extension. Gaia, this duo speculates, is conscious. Indeed, they postulate that not only is Gaia conscious, but every level of life is conscious. From the atomic components of each cell in your body to the unimaginable vast Body of which Gaia herself is only one cell, all...All...ALL is conscious.The adage, &quot;As above, so below&quot; has never had more compelling meaning.Harman and Sahroutis base their logical groundwork on a concept of all being organized into holons (identity units) which are part of a larger holarchy (complex of identity units). Holons, say these two, take their purpose from the holarchy in which they are embedded, and take their ability from the holons which are embedded within them. Thus, your liver exists to serve your body, and draws its capacities from the health of its individual cells.Take this concept outward to Gaia--nay, to the penultimate Cosmos--and you may find, as I do, profound spiritual implications. You will also understand why these two respected scientists had to present this book as a speculative conversation. Pushing the outer edges of thought, challenging academia's entrenched mindset, is professionally risky. But Sahtouris has no less a motive than the saving of the planet. She holds that only by understanding what We are, can we save Ourselves from physical destruction.With the greatest of delight, I recommend this book to your consciousness."},{"Title":"Supplement of the genealogies of the Morr and Myers families,","review":"I rated this book with 4 stars because overall it exceeded my expectations, but I did see some areas that others may factor in their decision to purchase.I have the paperback version. The pages may come loose with moderate use within 3 months. The text and picture quality, however, are both great.I do not own a copy of the original book written by Calvin Moyer and published in 1896, but there are many references to the book and much of the critical information on dates of birth, death and marriages are provided going back to Andreas Mohr, Jr. (pages 16-66).The genealogical numbering scheme is a little difficult to follow since it continually references the original text and since the family is so large and the book covers such a large period (1750 - approx. 1968), it is a little challenging to find family members from different lines.If you are not interested in the annual family reunions dating back to the late 1800s to the 1960s, you may be disappointed that pages 67 - 214 cover these reunions. The data covering the supplement was obtained by questionnaires to family members during the 1960s, so some of the dates are likely not completely accurate as I found when looking at my own family covering the most recent 3 generations."},{"Title":"Wet-Into-Wet Watercolor: The Complete Guide to an Essential Watercolor Technique (Practical Art Books)","review":"Ms Speckman's book helped me break through to a new level of watercolor painting. She deals entirely with &quot;wet-in-wet&quot;, breaking it down into three sections: The Saturated Approach, Painting by Sections and the Painterly Approach. Beginning with a practical and thorough discussion of paper and pigments as they apply specifically to wet-in-wet watercolor, she proceeds to original and effective step-by-step instruction. Although I have purchased and worked from many books on instructional watercolor, I found Ms. Speckmann's techniques to be unusual and exciting. I particularly enjoy her iconoclastic preference for opaque pigments and the way she showcases their unique qualities. Well written and lavishly illustrated, this book is a valuable reference work."},{"Title":"Wet-Into-Wet Watercolor: The Complete Guide to an Essential Watercolor Technique (Practical Art Books)","review":"I found this book at a Book Outlet store and thought &quot;for the price, I should get it&quot;, so I did.

Each chapter is fun to read and the examples (step by step) are so easy to follow that they help you become an &quot;expert&quot; by the end of the book. I have lots of watercolor books and have found this to be one of my favorites on wet into wet technique for the above reasons."},{"Title":"Preliminary Design of Boats and Ships","review":"Cy Hamlin is a designer with a broad range of designs to his credit - from the Hudson river sloop Clearwater to the Controversy series which he co-designed with Farnham Butler. In Preliminary Design of Boats and Ships he has written a very clear and sensibly organized treatise on his approach to the design process.In addition to his work as a designer Cy Hamlin has taught design to students at the Landing School of Boatbuilding and Design for many years. The text has been informed by this experience. The basic terminology, physics, mathematics, construction details, and aesthetics relating to boat design are described with enough detail and clarity that any one with a pencil, ruler, calculator and clean sheet of paper can create a preliminary design in which all the basic parameters of the boat are defined.This is a great reference book for amateur designers, design students, and curious boat owners."},{"Title":"Preliminary Design of Boats and Ships","review":"This book is filled with the 'rules of thumb' a boat or ship designer uses to create a new design. The idea is to develop the design to the point where it will function at all levels. The 'rules of thumb' are clearly developed and include the significance of each one. The book takes you through the design process, balancing each feature against others until a complete preliminary design emerges.The next step in the design process, though not covered by the book, would be detailed design. This is where serious mathematics, hydrodynamics and so forth would be used. Cyrus Hamlin does not go into these more advanced aspects of boat and ship design. Besides the physics and math being beyond most folks, many hundreds of pages would be needed for even a cursory review of detail design, so this is a good thing.I am a Professional Yacht Designer and a Naval Architect and refer to this book fairly regularly. I also recommend it to customers and associates who are interested in yacht design. They usually find the book informative and helpful. It does a very good job of explaining the inter-related aspect of design and allows one to quickly realize what is practical and what is not."},{"Title":"Preliminary Design of Boats and Ships","review":"This book is mainly written for the general people who have no any basic ideal in ship hydrodynamics."},{"Title":"Where Do Grandmothers Come From?: (And Where Do They Go?) : A Close Look at Four Generations, in Three Parts","review":"I was delighted to be introduced to Frances Allison Weaver.

Enjoy the comic aspects of the moment; the play will take care of itself. Downer argues that Sheridan envisioned The Rivals as a series of comic scenes, not necessarily a tightly woven plot.In his preface Richard Brinsley Sheridan reminds the readers that this play was not initially well received and, in fact, he had to withdraw the play to remove imperfections. His later version was more successful and today The Rivals is one of the few English comedies from that period that continues to interest modern audiences.I found the beginning slow. The author's wordy preface was followed by a prologue in which two lawyers plead with the audience to give this play fair consideration. On the tenth night a new prologue replaced the pleading as it was now obvious that the revised play was indeed successful. In Act 1 I had some difficulty keeping track of the characters and I chose to reread the first act before proceeding. Thereafter, the going was much smoother and I began to appreciate the foibles of the characters and their confused machinations.The protagonist, the young Captain Absolute, was sensible for the most part, although his plan to woo the capricious Lydia Languish was obviously destined for trouble. The other characters included his excitable father Sir Anthony Absolute, his father's patient ward Julia, the silly Mrs. Malaprop, the comic gentleman wooers Faulkland, Acres, and Sir Lucius O'Trigger, and the conniving servants Fag, David, Thomas, and Lucy. While Sheridan does encourage us to laugh at his characters, his satire is gentle. His characters are not at all unlikable, just a little eccentric and possibly not overly intelligent.I recently read and reviewed Sheridan's enjoyable The School for Scandal and I recommend that the reader new to Sheridan begin with it rather than The Rivals. Both plays are short and can be read with little difficulty with the help of an occasional footnote. For my reading of The Rivals I used the Crofts Classics edition in which Alan Downer provides a useful introduction, a list of key dates in Sheridan's life, footnotes, and a bibliography. I give four stars to The Rivals. I previously rated The School for Scandal as five stars."},{"Title":"The Rivals (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"This is the first major comedy by Sheridan, a radical Irish actor and politician in George III's England. Not quite as complex and astute as his later She Stoops to Conquer, the Rivals remains a warm, unforgettable, and very, very funny play.Here we meet the chatty Mrs. Malaprop, who proudly tells us &quot;if I reprehend anything in this world, it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs&quot;; her niece Lydia, lost in the world of lurid half-bound romantic novels; Sir Anthony Absolute, often wrong but never in doubt; Sir Lucious O'Trigger, of BlunderBuss Hall; and the rest. The dialogue and plot devices are well-crafted and funny; the social commentary is perceptive and satisfyingly naughty; but what stays with you is the humanity of each of the characters. These are not the charicatures of Restoration comedy, but personalties the reader will remember; ridiculous like all humans, but engendering empathy as well as laughter."},{"Title":"The Rivals (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"My review is not on the content of the play, but on this particular edition of the play.I know everyone has their own reading style, so this may not bother everyone. However, when I'm reading an older piece of literature, I enjoy looking at footnotes. I'm sure that some skip over them, but I do not. In this edition, however, the footnotes were there, but there were no indications in the text to let me know when to look at the footnotes. The only indication was the line number, which was written right before each footnote. This was irritating to me, and so I went through the whole play ahead of time and marked the parts where I had to look for footnotes, which was very time consuming.I would definitely recommend reading the play, because it is very funny and there are a number of interesting literary devices going on that I won't go into here, but I would not recommend this particular edition (New Mermaids)."},{"Title":"The Rivals (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection)","review":"Ordered this book for a college english class.

The book covers foods that heal, foods that kill, nutraceuticals, exercise and virtually every proven method to prevent and/or reverse most every common disease of aging.

In general, his books are hard to read. But, he puts more ideas and thoughts into one book than any other novelist I have read. The Magic Mountain brings before the reader, in one novel, the entire spectrum of European thought in the time preceding World War 1. I found the book very slow going. But when you have finished the book, you will be overwhelmed by the greatness of the book and of Thomas Mann's mind. If you want to read a book by him that is easy. try The Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man. Highly enjoyable"},{"Title":"The Magic Mountain (2 volumes)","review":"Thomas Mann's Der Zauberberg was my introduction to the finest of literature, the kind to which too few of us have ever been introduced. For months, I found myself completely absorbed in the world of Hans Castorp. I lingered through this novel, never truly wanting to reach the end, knowing how difficult it would be to find comparable reading material. Although I have not yet read a translation of the few pages written in french, at the time I read it, I found myself effortlessly moving through the story as if I'd been viewing english subtitles in a foreign movie. Thomas Mann is the kind of author who makes you yearn for his writing over and over again, and Der Zauberberg is the perfect introduction to his many works."},{"Title":"The Magic Mountain (2 volumes)","review":"Mann succeeds in giving the reader a different perception of the passing of time in this secluded place in the Swiss Alps.

Mann delves deep into the psychological aspects of his characters to create profound understanding of each. I felt very well acquainted with the charachters like Frau Stoer, the Hofrat, Mm Chauchat, and of course, Hans Castorp. Not all have the same vocabulary as we do today but it's easy to relate these characters to similar people I have met in my lifetime.The metaphors are not so well hidden that one cannot extract their meaning with a little effort. I sum this book up as an effort to convey to people to examine themselves where personal balance and understanding leads to good health physically and mentally. And that personal success is the beginning of the path to freedom and salvation. That is what I personally felt more so than the relationship to Europe pre WWI.Do yourself a favor though and get the modern edition by Woods.

I won't give a summary here; many other reviews have covered that territory. I want to comment about the brilliant writing. As the back cover describes it: \\"This taut, multilayered story of dangers lurking inside and outside a house, of old secrets, of deceptive enemies, and of two friends who must each find their own ways of fighting back.\\"The Art of Keeping Cool, set in a small town in the northeast during WWII, dives into the quirks and frailties of characters that really come alive--not all at once but slowly unfolding. We are shown how vulnerable everyone is and at the same time each character's strength is revealed. Sometimes what looks strong is really weak and what looks weak is really great strength. The story is thought provoking, at times blurring the lines between who is good and who is evil. The story is complex in its exploration of relationships and like all good stories, the characters are different at the end of the story. The journey is not an easy one. Every one struggles through trials as they discover who they are, who they want to become, and the love or the dark side of family.This was a family read aloud for us and it held everyone's interest the whole way through. Lots to talk about. I loved it and recommend this for families and young people who like books that touch you or that you can think about deeply.(Laya Saul, author of the self help book for teens, \\"You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way\\")"},{"Title":"The Art of Keeping Cool","review":"The Art of Keeping Cool-AWESOME!

The Art of Keeping Cool is a brilliant novel with Robert Saunders and Elliot Marks as the main characters. The story takes place in the 1940's during World War 2. When the Germans attacked. Basically this novel is about how Elliot, Robert, and Abel Hoffman embark on a journey through war, hardship, and misery. With Abel being a german artist, many people despise him and think he is a spy. But Elliot doesn't see that. What he sees is an inspirational, talented artist. Whilst Robert is a tad bit suspicious about whom Abel really is.I recommend this book for all ages, especially ages 10 and up.

In the book there are boring parts and great parts. It is a story when Robert and Elliot becomes closer friend the less shy Elliot gets. I really enjoyed this book because Roberts's dad is out in a war and both of them help each other get through there problems. I really enjoyed reading the book and you can too.I was impressed about how the author Taylor Janet Lisle made this book a book about war and friendship. I thought it was funny when ever the grandpa tried to put people on the spot and sometimes they got embarrassed because of what the grandpa said. Sometimes the people said something to make the grandpa embarrassed. So it has some funny parts too. But all together it was a great book. So you should try reading it sometime your love it.I would recommend this book for both children and adults. This was my first time reading it but when I had to go do something and stop reading that book at good parts I just really wanted to read more and more. To tell you the truth I usually don't like reading books but this one I enjoyed reading and I just wanted to keep reading the book till the end of it.

So they went to go live with their Grandma and Grandpa and Elliot. Robert did not like Elliot at all because in school he chewed on skin and he would also be selfish. Other than that he would make really good drawings and not tell anybody that he had amazing drawing skills because he could have became an artist.The book took place in Rhode Island. I don't know what other books Janet Taylor Lisle wrote because this is my first book by this author.

Elliot and Robert join a German artist, turning the whole community against them, because of the fear that he may be spying for their enemy in war, Germany. Grandpa and Robert don't get along, and family tensions boil again as \\"civil war\\" breaks out with the next generation.I loved this book because of the build up of character that Janet Taylor Lisle creates. Everyone is an individual. Grandpa is always angry. Grandma is always trying to protect people from Grandpa. Robert's mother is always quiet. Elliot is always drawing life in W.W.II. And father like son, Robert and his father always think things through and stand up to Grandpa. I would contrast Janet Taylor Lisle to Philip Pullman because they are the exact opposite. Pullman likes to write deep fantasy while Lisle likes to write shallow fantasy. Pullman writes about things that he imagined while Lisle writes about history."},{"Title":"The Art of Keeping Cool","review":"It is the spring of 1942, a few months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.America is at war with the Germans, and the Japanese. Also known as World War Two.

Robert is the main character of the book, with his cousin, Elliot at his side. Elliot is the kind of boy who is shy, and sits in the corner at dinnertime. He is not really notices by, but that doesn't stop him from drawing his amazing artwork, and seeing Abel Hoffman. Abel Hoffman is a German artist that lives in the woods of Sachem's Head. The whole town has turned their backs on him because he is German. People start to think he is a German spy, so they start terriorsing him, and soon it comes to the F.B.I searching his house. He didn't even do anything, but they have to be suspicious for their own safety.

Tell his family?, or ignore him? This is only one of Robert's fears (or conflicts of the book) that he has to deal with including war, his hot-tempered grandpa, and discovering the family's secret.If I could only tell you the ending, because it's so shocking and exciting, but your going to have to wait and see what happens with Elliot, and Abel. Does Robert come to find the family secret? Or will this war ever end?I think that this book tells me, or teaches a lesson about life, that you have to learn to face your fears, and learn to trust people, like Abel. It also tells me when war comes, and your right in the middle of it; it can lead to many problems in the world, and questions.

Robby's father, an air force pilot, was deployed and sent across the Atlantic to Europe. Without his help on the ranch, it would suffer so Robert's mother resigned to the safe quarters of her father-in-law's cottage. There, along with their other relatives on Sachem's Head, Robert grew to become good friends with his cousin Elliot, a young but gifted artist. As Robby grew closer to Elliot, he was trusted with the friendship of another artist, a poor German exile who escaped to America and found shelter in the forests of Sachem's Head beneath an overturned sailboat. The German, Abel Hoffman, never did make friends with any others in the village for they thought of him as a burden of the war and sometimes a spy, something that for Elliot never crossed his mind. Because of the town's distaste for Abel, he was sent reluctantly to prison several times and while gone, his paintings were burned. When Abel saw the smoke, he sprinted towards his makeshift home, and after witnessing the burning works of art, Hoffman strode into the flames, killing himself and leaving Elliot without a close, understanding friend and teacher. Though it may seem as if that were enough wrongs to go on in one read, it was not, for at home other troubles arose. It was a great relief when Robby's father finally returned to America and life went on, Elliot attending an arts college in Chicago and Robby going on to medical school. The Art of Keeping Cool is a multi layered tale of the hardships of war at home for the families. Janet Taylor Lisle conjured up a heart wrenching read that helps you to see in others' eyes. It is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.The Art of Keeping Cool is complex and has many different stories intertwined that make up one. One of the most prominent elements is Elliot's relationship with Abel and how that affects his friendship with Robby. Another is the secret of Robby's father's injured leg and the mystery of its cause. The elements that make up The Art of Keeping Cool help it to be much more interesting and intriguing, that make you want to read further.The character Abel Hoffman brings the war to Sachem's Head. I like how his presence in Rhode Island connects the World War and Robby's father to the story and compares between places. This element ties the entire novel to the small town of Sachem's.Elliot Marks is a complex character in The Art of Keeping Cool. His personality and down to earth perspective makes him a prominent character in the story. His connection with art and the world around him is much like that of the German's. I like how Elliot is unlike others of the town and finds that he himself can be compared to Abel more than anyone else.Lisle's The Art of Keeping Cool is a fantastic tale of family, friends, and the acceptance of others unlike yourself, and it is a worthwhile read for anyone ages twelve and up. The Art of Keeping Cool shows you an altering perspective of the hardships that involve a secretive family and their war at home.E. Knipp"},{"Title":"The Art of Keeping Cool","review":"Lisle, J. T.

Thirteen year old Robert does not understand why his father who is a fighter pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Force in England becomes estranged from his family. Robert and his mother are not the only family members displaced and living with their grandfather in Rhode Island. Robert meets his aunt, uncle and cousin Elliot. Elliot, an artist, has mastered the \\"art\\" of keeping cool while Robert is confrontational with his acerbic grandfather. While Elliot befriends a reclusive German artist, the prejudiced townsfolk and their anti-German sentiment, rages on with tragic results. Not long after moving to Rhode Island, questions begin to arise in Robert's mind that only time will begin to answer.

As Lisle writes about the tensions within this family, readers are able to see the events of WWII from Robert's perspective.

I would have never thought that a book about World War II would intrigue me as much as The Art of Keeping Cool has. I give my recommendation to people of all ages as long as you are into World War II, drama, and a family who has many hidden secrets to reveal.Robert and Elliot Saunders are cousins and the main characters.

He doesn't stick up for himself.Robert and his mom, along with his younger sister Carolyn, are moving from their farm to Sachem's Head because Robert's dad is serving in the war. The family is going to live in a cottage next to Robert and Carolyn's paternal grandparents. Grandma Saunders is very nice to every body in the house, including Grandpa Saunders even though he doesn't deserve to receive kindness.Living in the town of Sachem's Head is a German man named Abel Hoffman. Since Abel is German, the people of Sachem's Head have their suspicions about Abel Hoffman being a spy but, what they don't know is that Abel is only a man living in Sachem's Head making paintings, waiting for World War II to end, or is he?After awhile of Elliot not choosing to see Abel's drawings after Abel had asked him, Elliot secretly takes art lessons from Abel and Robert doesn't like it at all.

They end up moving next door to his grandparents, and over time, becomes friends with his cousin, Elliot.The story is rather quite dull at times and slow moving.

It captured my imagination when thinking about what went on and what people were feeling in a small New England town. The main character, Robert, and his best friend, Elliot, have a few obstacles that they have to tackle in the book. The novel takes place in early March of 1942, about three months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Since World War II is occurring, Robert's father, Ken, joined England's Royal Air Force. Since Ken is away, Robert's whole family moved in with his grandpa, which displeased his father. There has always been trouble between Grandpa and Ken, but Robert and Elliot do not know why. The two boys are energized because they both like all of the military actions that hare going on near the town. One day, Elliot and Rob go exploring and meet a German painter named Abel Hoffman. Is Abel a spy for the Nazis? Is the town ever going to accept that Robert and Elliot are nice to the German painter?This book deals with a lot of emotional conflicts, both internal and external. I would recommend this book to people in 8th grade and up, and also to anybody who enjoys a well-written war book."},{"Title":"The Art of Keeping Cool","review":"The Art of Keeping Cool is about a story of a young boy named Robert, who used to live on a farm with his mother and sister while his father was at war.

It's a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; type book -- not a novel. I read most of the &quot;plotlines&quot; without properly playing the game. Nye developed several interesting storylines(occurring between &quot;The White Dragon&quot; and the last few chapters of &quot;Renegades&quot;).

Until now, a reader was hard-pressed to find details about this part of history. It's a poignant story. The writer says that a group of infant-chimps were taken away from their mothers in Africa, who were likely killed. They endured rigorous training before it was decided that Ham had the &quot;right stuff.&quot; After his successful launch, no ticker-tape parade down Madison Ave., instead Ham was put on display in a cage by himself in the National Zoo in Wash. D.C. She ends the book telling the reader about Ham's eventual rescue to a sanctuary in North Carolina where he finally got to live his final years with other chimps. I hope the author does an updated version of the book telling readers about the new sanctuary in Fort Pierce, FL built just for the retired Air Force chimps, descendants of the space program."},{"Title":"Spacechimp: NASA's Ape in Space (Countdown to Space)","review":"If you are susceptible to falling in love with the wonder of space, of the bond that develops between humans and animals working together, and the pathos of a simple story, &quot;Spacechimp&quot; will be an unforgettable read...even for a grown-up! Children of all ages will delight in the wonderful way that authors Farbman and Gaillard bring sophisticated scientific concepts down to earth. The workings of gravity and related forces and phenomena are presented in simple terms that form a solid foundation for understanding the 1961 Mercury mission. No one will forget that astrochimp Ham's diet included strawberry gelatin and banana-flavored pellets! Photographs in full color and black and white complement the text beautifully. This book is worth reading just for a look at one particularly poignant image, taken by an automatic camera during a moment of peace while floating without the pull of gravity: spacechimp Ham gazing out at the intimate vast space just outside his capsule. You'll never forget it."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"This book is the best one to get, whether you're a beginner or an old pro, it tells you everything you need to know, not just about mixing the drinks, but what you need to stock your own bar, the equipment, and the glassware. If you're looking for a guide to bartending, this is the one to get."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"I bought this book years ago when I first started bartending. I was quickly distressed and disappointed by what isn't included- especially on a busy night. Many of the drinks are for older drinkers, ie- Whiskey Sours, Mint Julips, Manhattans, etc.The younger crowd of drinkers- not so much. I'm assuming it must be a regional issue as well- but there isn't even a listing for a basic Texas Margarita. The Mojito in the book doesn't have Sprite, but the local bars here use both Club Soda and Sprite. A lot of currently popular drinks are either not listed or are made completely different in the region that I bartended. For instance, there is no listing for a Check Ride and the Lemon Drop is completely different here than what's in the book. You may be better off learning from experience like I did."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"Bought this book specifically because I needed a recipe for the \\"Remus gin fizz\\" and was disappointed.While it does cover the basics i.e. the equipment list it has one, but it does not offer any guidance or recommendations on the equipment. for example that the strainer in unnecessary if you know how to use the Boston shaker."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"The kindle version of this book is well formatted to the kindle medium, and easily utilizes the kindles search features to find the drinks that you want by name OR scan through the index by ingredient and simply point to the drink that you want to see.With some good looking variations on classic cocktails (as well as a lot of new ones) I think this will be a very helpful for me.If you're mixing drinks or cooking with the kindle I recommend sealing the unit into a clear ziplock-type bag.

This is the only book I currenlty allow my bartenders to use behind our bars. The glossary and ingredient index are very helpful. This book has helped greatly in getting some consistency back among my bartenders. I have run across only a couple of problems with it. The binding. If this book had been spiral bound it would be much easier to actually use while working. Because it is in a paperback format it is more of a reference than a tool. The life expectency of any paperback behind a busy bar is about one week. Glossy or laminated pages would extend it's life. I'm sure that cost is a factor with both of these problems, but any working bartender would gladly spend a few more dollars and consider it an investment."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"This book is a must have! The entire book is layed out perfectly! The recipies are very easy to read and they're well layed out. They're alphabatized as well as the index and the glossary. The table of contents breaks the book down into catagories from stocking your bar, party drinks, to nonalcoholic drinks. Beginning with a list of mixers, 'Odds and Ends', measurements in ounces, standard bar measurments, and garnishes. Included is a section on 'Bartender's Secrets' that gives tips and tricks the professionals use to make drinks such as choosing glassware and how to open a bottle of wine.One very important point discussed is the importance of being responsible while drinking and also on being a responsible bartender. Included is a body weight chart giving the ratio of weight to the number of drinks a person consumes and how long it takes the body to matabolize it.One of my favorite parts is the index because it makes the art of bartending professionally or unprofessionally much simpler taking a lot of the guess work out. If you don't know what to make with that bottle of flavored liqueur or you want to use some wine just go to the index and it will give you a list of drinks that can be made using whatever kind of alcohol you have. For anyone watching their calorie intake the book also includes an Index of Low-calorie Drinks.I agree that this book would greatly be improved if it were spiral bound and was somehow protected so it would avoid liquid damage. I wonder....since it's so thick, making it a bit bigger, allowing more space for text and minimizing the amount of space the recipies take up on each page, in turn minimizing the depth, would make it easier to spiralbound it. Other than that this is an outstanding resource guide!"},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"Working in the tourist area of San Francisco, we get drink requests from people who are visting from all parts of the world. This was the only book we used out of four, and now that a parting bartender has made a momento of this one we either already know the drink or can't find it. It may be a bit light in other areas, (I never checked) but if you need a 'drink dictionary' behind the bar, get this one. Then give your boss the receipt and tell him to cough it up."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"\\"The Complete Bartender\\" is far from complete. Even though it looks like a hefty book (560 pages?!), it really leaves out quite a bit.Of course, all of your standard drinks are included: martinis, margaritas, manhattans, and the like. But there's no recipie for cosmopolitans, apple martinis, or any \\"dirty\\" drinks (e.g. b.j.s or sex on the beach). And some of the recipies that are included are questionable at best - wrong at worst. The recipie for a zombie included cherry liquor; while the recipie for kamakazie did not include sweet and sour.This book also lacks color pictures. If you think your presentation is perfect and you don't need any illustrations, then by all means go out and purchase this book. For most of us, it's helpful to have a few pictures to let us know if we're on the right track. In my opinion, a really good bartending book would illustrate the presentation for each drink.This book isn't all bad. What it lacks in quality it makes up for in quantity. Despite the sometimes iffy drink recipies, the lack of color pictures, and the noticibal absence of several very popular drinks, it's still got tons of drinks and a helpful glossary that explains what different liquors are. There are some illustrations of the various tools and glasses needed to bartend.I bought this book in college, thinking it would have every recipie I'd ever want. It's a big enough disappointment that I wouldn't really recommend it, but you do have to keep in mind that - with the internet - it's pretty easy to get just about any recipie you'd ever want for a drink. So if you're willing to look up the occasional drink, and you don't need pretty color pictures, this book might be right for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Bartender","review":"I am an idiot when it comes to making drinks and I felt this guide was wonderful!

As with any recipe book, you'll have to customize things to suit your taste. The biggest problem is the binding.

The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is scattered and rarely cohesive, and the themes struggle to convey some deep hidden meaning. I also find it slightly presumptuous for a girl not yet in Junior High to be giving philosophical life lessons. I hope, however, that Ms. Burton remains a dedicated writer, as she clearly has talent; she simply needs the maturity and life experience to back it up."},{"Title":"Father Luigi's Chameleon","review":"When I found out that an eleven-year-old writer had published a philosophical book, I was skeptical, to say the least.

I stayed up until 3 am reading it in one sitting. The book is amazing.

I would recommend this to everybody, and have already forced everybody I know to buy copies."},{"Title":"Father Luigi's Chameleon","review":"I was disappointed after completing this \\"novel\\".

I definitely recommend this novel to any and everybody willing to read something more intellectual than a cheap romance novel or thriller."},{"Title":"Father Luigi's Chameleon","review":"I loved everything about this book, from its rich descriptions of the Italian settings, its intriguing characters and their complex relationships, its original religious ideology and philosophical viewpoint, as well as the offbeat allegorical subplot of the chameleon.(This is a copy of what I said in my review on another online site, where I bought my first copy, as I felt compelled to put in a word after seeing the last two reviews...having noticed them when I was buying a second copy for a friend, and afraid people would miss a great read)"},{"Title":"Father Luigi's Chameleon","review":"This was a thrilling book. I read it quickly, waiting to look for the deep motivating things. As an editor, I found many mistakes, and did not seem to find what she was trying to get at. Miss Burton, you tried very well indeed. Like I said, WOW... It was a very good try, and my advice to you from experience is: if one tries to be deep, one stays in shallow waters until they see what it takes to swim deeper.Very good attempt, but I hope your next novels create a better atmospherical sense. I didn't catch your message. GREAT TRY, AND KEEP YOUR BOOKS COMING. WE HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU!"},{"Title":"Father Luigi's Chameleon","review":"I found the book to be just that of an eleven-year-old; while not intensely awful, it seemed to be something not particularly good cleaned up by an editor.

I give Misery a 10 out of 10"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I think perhaps what makes Misery one of the best books that I have read is its potential for happening. In an age where so many people are concerned about stalking and laws are being implemented in states across the nation, the thought of a woman like Annie is both frightening and eerie. King does himself a bit of justice by finally creating a piece of fiction that examines the consequences of the meeting of two people who should never meet. The book gave me the same feeling that walking down a dark alley a two in the morning gives me. Although the thought of such a meeting seems slightly far-fetched, it is forgivable by the depth of the psychosis that King builds into Annie. This story begs the reader to ask, &quot;What would I do in this situation?&quot; I have followed King's controversial career for many years. I am in agreement with the critics who are now classing him as the greatest writer of horror in this era. Poe is the founder of modern horror, King continues to develop it. Misery is the most frightening of his books. I am not afraid of monsters, clowns, vampires, cars, or dogs. I do not cringe at the thought of sleeplessness or travels through the desert. I am not even afraid of little girls who can burn me alive. BUT, a woman who can tie me up and torture me, a woman certified to know how to treat pain (and thereby how to inflict it), a woman who is all too human.... now that scares the living daylights out of me."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and I read it quite a while ago, so I may be a bit rusty on the deatails, but ever since I read Misery, I have been reading Stephen King books. At the moment I am reading IT. I find the story of Misery so good, as it is somthing that could possibly happen. All the other horror writers seem to think that if you write an experience that is totally untrue to life and would be scary if it did happen to you, then you will be scared, but Stephen King recognises that the only way to write a novel that if scary and people will want to read, is to write one with events which may well be similar to what has happened to you in your life.I found that Misery was not only an interesting and compelling read, but it also was scary, and in some places true to life.An excellent read, and Stephen if you are reading this, you have now got yourself a full time reader.I AM YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I first read this book a year ago.

Most people don't get as crazy as Annie Wilkes. A perfect 10."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I'm not a Stephen King fan, but I must say this is one of his better books. The plot was interesting, suspenseful, and even believable. However, I've always wondered why SK has to put extra words, thoughts, &amp; dangling sentences in his novels. It gets so frustrating to read about EVERY feeling or disjointed thought going through Paul Sheldon's head. Too much of that minute detail and not enough dialogue in my opinion. Mr. King has a very annoying writing style, he writes as if he's jotting down everything going through his mind when he's creating his stories instead of pulling the pieces together to make a more jointed, cohesive tale. So, for writing style I give Mr. King 2 stars and 4 stars for creativity."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"With the other \\"King/Bates combo\\" Dolores Claiborne, I don't have enough words to describe how lousy the screenplay adaptation was relative to the book.In Misery, not only did the story benefit greatly from a stellar performance by Kathy Bates, but the subtle changes made in the characters and sequence of events for the film serve the story well. Paul Sheldon and Annie Wilkes are both more sympathetic in the film.In the movie, while Sheldon goes gradually from grateful to fearful, here he despises Annie from the outset.The book is still very good, but like Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs or Jaws, the film took it a half step further.The particular version of the paperback I have is also worth grabbing for the inner cover that features an idealized Stephen King on a romance novel cover."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"There are already so many reviews out here, so I'd keep mine short.What's good: It's one of the best among King's psychology-thrilling type of horror books.(That is, no paranormal activity or formidable creatures). The thrill comes from within human psyches, and he has the ability to make readers actually feel how the protagonist feel in the novel.What's not-good: Still, King's extreme devotion to play word games shows in this book. It's so wordy that you could read through a couple of pages but nothing of the storyline actually goes on. Maybe it's his unique scenario setting but it'd be unquestionably slow-paced. If you've read rather fast-paced novels by writers such as John Saul or Iris Johansen you'd know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is one of those few books that has made me want to read more and more. I forgot if the beginning was slow or not but believe me, if you give it a chance it will make you want to know what's gonna happen next. I'd read it every night and it would suck so much having to stop due to having to turn off the lights at a certain time. But anyways, you will get hooked and maybe even mad like me and boy did it end how I wanted it to(Or else I would've been so pissed!) So yea it's a good read, an addictive read that you just can't let go of unless you really need to."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book is about Paul Sheldon, a best-selling novelist (from his Misery Chastain romance series novels) whom unfortunately gets in a car-accident in a nasty Colorado blizzard. Annie Wilkes, a fat woman who lives alone in her isolated cottage in the middle of nowwhere, comes to Paul's aid and rescues him from the rubble. And oh, I forgot to mention: Annie Wilkes is an ex nurse...and is Paul Sheldon's number one fan.At first, Annie takes care of Paul in her cottage, feeding him, giving him pain-killers, tending to his shattered body, being all nice and gentle...but that soon changes drastically, with Pauls latest and last Misery Chastain novel: \\"Misery's Child\\" where Misery gets killed off at the end of the book. Once Annie finishes reading the book, and realizes that Misery gets killed off and that this is the last Misery Chastain romance novel and that there will be no more Misery Chastain, she goes absolutely gorilla sh*t. She savagely forces Paul to bring Misery back to life, buying him a typewriter, sheets of paper, and setting up his own 'writers' desk in his room, beside the window looking over the Colorado mountains.Paul really doesn't have a choice at all but to follow Annie's orders...besides, who's the one with the shattered body rendering to be transported around in a wheelchair? And it's not only Pauls disablity that leaves him no choice but to follow Annie's orders...there is of course, the prospect of Annie being very dangerously psychotic. Very violently psychotic...and she's not going to let Paul go until he has finished the new Misery novel and it is to her complete satisfication. If not, she will make him write it over and over again until it is to perfection. But once Paul does actually finish the novel and it is to her liking, Annie will still not let him go, for she is his number one fan.....even if it means killing both Paul and herself...Paul Sheldon is in one 'hell of a jam' and if he wants to make it out alive and in one piece, he's going to need to use his mind, need to use his cunningness, but most of all he will need to use all of his courage.\\"Paul Sheldon used to write for a living. Now he's writing to stay alive.\\"This is one of King's shorter novels coming up a little over 300 pages. But in the end, those 300 pages will have seemed so short, and you will be begging for it to be longer. This was my third King novel that I have read and finished, and probably my very favorite of his(aside The Stand). I haven't read many King novels but I plan on reading his whole collection eventually...someday. I have only read of his: \\"The Tommyknockers\\", \\"The Stand\\", \\"Misery\\", \\"IT\\", and \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\\" The best of those are \\"The Stand\\", \\"Misery\\", and \\"On Writing\\" which I highly recommend not only if you want great novels of Stephen King's but just great novels in general. Though, I still recommend \\"The Tommyknockers\\" and \\"IT\\"; those are really good too, even if it's not as good as the latter three.If I were to recommend you just one book of King's out of the whole 5 of his that I have read so far, I would definetly recommend, \\"Misery\\", the most. I'll tell you why. \\"IT\\", \\"The Stand\\", and \\"The Tommyknockers\\" are too long. The first 2 tip over 1000 pages. The third one is almost 1000 pages. But they are still amazing, even though they are long. Sometimes you want it to be even longer just because it's so good and gripping and you can't stop reading it. Those 3 are like that, especially \\"The Stand\\"(which would be my 2nd highest recommendation out of the whole 5.).\\"On Writing\\" is a part autobiography, and a part writer's manual, and I only recommend it highly if you are an aspirating writer of fiction for that is the only type of writing this book scans upon...or if you want some good chuckles, for this book is full of those.I recommend \\"Misery\\" the most for it's shorterness, therefore it's more quicker, thrilling, blood-gushing pace, for it's lively, real, memorable characters, for it's sense of humor(cockadoodie brat!), for it is very well-written, for it's realistic situation(meaning that it could happen), but most of all for the great, horrific, compassionate, and memorable story it tells of \\"the price of fame\\" of \\"obsessiveness and psychoticness and the dsyfunction of the human brain\\" of \\"twisted love and admiration\\" of \\"a writer's struggles and trials and attempts of escaping the harsh circumstances\\" of \\"helplessness and the long gone end of free-will and how one will cope with such formidable climates\\" and of \\"the dark, sarcastic rendevouz of one twisted, obsessed, lonely and insane mind and another 'supposed literary genius mind' as they tangle with each other to reveal the darker, more unpleasant sides of human nature.\\"If you don't know where to start with Stephen King books(for he has many-and at that, many great ones as well)than I highly recommend starting with \\"Misery.\\" \\"It's classic, vintage King; one of his very best.\\""},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Paul Sheldon is a writer of the famously popular Misery novels.

She was a big mystery novel fan and was crazy about Stephen King. I said, &quot;why bother&quot; the movie was great, suspenful and Kathy Bates was Annie Wilkes as far as I was concern and besides, I didn't really like reading mystery novels. I found them boring and overly meticulous with the details. Then I saw the movie again on television and remembered how that co-worker said that after reading the book, you'll be dissapointed with the movie. So, I made the monumental effort to read this book. I couldn't put it down. And yes, the movie adaptation paled in comparisson. So much detail was left out from the book. And although Kathy Bates, was great in the movie, King's Annie Wilkes is a hell-of-a-lot scarier. And the way she died in the movie is sooo sanitized. How very dissappointing that the movie makers bowed out and chose a more cleaner, neater death for this &quot;number one fan.&quot; King is very skillful in bringing out the fears and weaknesses of the main character Paul Sheldon. In the movie, James Caan portrayed a bravier character, but the book clearly shows that Paul Sheldon all but lost hope in seeing another day, except for who he is, a writer, and a writer must see the book to its fruitition, just like just readers must find out what happens at the end. I love this analogy and it makes the story more palpable, more real. I have to admit that the book is so much better than the movie. I have gained a lot of appreciation for Stephen King. I can see why he has so much appeal to the masses. He knows how to tell a story. You feel like a kid sitting around a campfire, while a skillful grown-up spins a really scary story. To that co-worker, yes you're right, the book is better."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is one of the first Stephen King books I read. I remember seeing it in the book shop when it first came out. The cover had Paul Sheldon in his wheelchair, writhing in agony - Annie Wilkes looked like a witch. The cover did its job in getting me to pick up the book and read what it was about.Paul Sheldon, a bestselling romance novelist, has killed the woman that made him a household name - Misery Chastain. Many writers see themselves as gods - they decide what happens to their creations. Was it karma then, when Paul Sheldon was nearly killed in a car accident- to be discovered by the ultimate crazed fan? Forced to bring a woman back to life for her &quot;great return&quot;?The situation King writes about here is frightening because it is possible. There is nothing supernatural in this story. Psychotic admirers are very real, and King makes Annie Wilkes sound like the fan from hell. At one point Paul actually thinks Annie is the devil. Later he sees her as a goddess - someone who can bring pain (with a variety of tortures), or take it away (with powerful drugs).In &quot;Misery&quot;, there is a feeling of confinement, much like &quot;Cujo&quot;. One of the things I found interesting about this book was when Annie was talking about one of her past victims - an artist doing sketches of the ruined Overlook Hotel, which was burned down by a crazed caretaker some years back. I thought it was a pretty clever way of including an advertisement for &quot;The Shining&quot;. I found the sections of manuscript for &quot;Misery's Return&quot; a bit dry. I'm not a fan of romance novels.Although this is a good book, I still prefer &quot;The Stand&quot;. I lent my first copy of &quot;Misery&quot; to someone - and never got it back. My new copy had a different cover: Paul Sheldon in his wheelcahair, with a shadow of Annie holding an axe. I've lent it to so many people, the pages are starting to fall out."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I enjoyed this book soooo much i read it three times in a row. Stephen King has really outdone himself with this book by using some of the most creative imagery i could have ever thought of. I thought the movie was great, but the book is even more detailed and gives a better sense of what is going on eachtime the psychotic nurse(Annie Wilkes) and captured author(Paul Sheldon), meet. I like how King symbolized Paul's feelings as those of a bird from Africa he saw as a child in the zoo. He knew that the bird didn't belong there, and that it was going to die there, as he himself, didn't belong in Annie's house, and knows if he doesn't get out of there, he will die like the bird eventually did. The way King shows the hardships of being an author, made me respect the intelligence of all authors around the world, that publish books only to be read and perhaps forgotten by most. It is well worth anybody's time, but they need to make sure they have time to get into it, because once you get into it, it's hard to get out until you finish reading the fine print on the last page."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I read Misery and I thought it was OK.

All I can say is when I was reading and waiting for Annie to break out her sledgehammer like in the movie's infamous hobbling scene, I was shocked, disgusted, and grossly satisfied by what happens instead. I read once that Misery was supposed to be King's next Richard Bachman novel after Thinner, but his cover was blown before it could happen.

I can remember the epigraph for part I of this book, the quote by Fredrich Nietzsche &quot;When you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you.&quot; Because the abyss is where Paul has fallen. I liked this book, because it was both a romance, and a psycho-thriller. We see the relationship between Paul and Annie evolve. She is not only his nurse, but also his jailer, tormentor.

His protagonist has written to live well (the frothy romance novels make him rich), while the &quot;real&quot; work goes unappreciated. In the horrifying situation he finds himself in, he literally *must* &quot;write to live&quot;, or as King notes, he becomes his own Scheherazade.

With few exceptions, Stephen King has not resorted to building fantastic and horrible creatures to scare his readers. Even when he does resort to \\"monsters\\" they're not typical but rather they can be seen as a combination of terrors that take the form of something more concrete. In \\"Misery\\" King is truly at his best by presenting the every day life of a woman named Annie Wilkes whose psychotic tendencies are enflamed by the man she is caretaker to as he recovers from a nearly fatal car accident in the mountains of Colorado. This man happens to be Paul Sheldon, Annie's favorite writer and creator of her favorite heroine of all time, Misery Chastain. The catch is that Paul just killed Misery off, and Annie wants her back. There are no monsters that don't exist in the minds of the characters which are both masterfully drawn and brought to life in their struggle to maintain control over one another- one through manipulation, the other through subterfuge.This is- and I admit a bias, here- one of my favorite Stephen King books. It was also the first book I ever read from him almost fifteen years ago. That said, he draws you into the world of Paul Sheldon through the only thing that Paul knows he has- that thing which begins to slip in the face of almost certain death at the hands of Annie Wilkes- his own sanity. He draws you in through allowing the reader into Paul's thoughts and the play-by-play he keeps on the situation, and then he draws you into the experience again by including excerpts of the book that he is writing to appease Annie.There are some who are annoyed at King's inclusion of \\"Misery's Return\\" in this book, and to a degree I understand the irritation. But my initial response to it when I read it the first time was that it was just another way to show the insanity of living in Annie Wilkes' world. Any writer will tell you that no matter how you may try to exclude yourself from the story pool where ideas find their footing, eventually your life becomes reflected in the pages of whatever you are working on- not your whole life but key points which are important at that time- and so every book is semi auto-biographical if only to the writer himself. Viewed as an extension of Paul Sheldon's mind under the circumstances, the excerpts which some feel so meaningless take on a great meaning and add depth rather than simply pages.With \\"Misery\\" I have always believed that Stephen King wrote one of his best stories, but he fleshed out truly brilliant characters as well, and he brought to his readers one of his most bizarre villains. In the litany of Stephen King \\"bad guys\\" I think that Annie Wilkes often gets overlooked because she's just crazy. But she's not just crazy. She's terrifying and she's also remarkably human. She makes this book one hell of a ride.

Unfortunately, for Paul, the esteemed Miss Wilkes is crazy as a loon and it becomes obvious pretty quickly that he's a prisoner, not a patient or a guest. I don't want to give away much of the plot, but she coerces him into writing a new novel just for her. One that will resurrect a character that Annie loves but that Paul had killed in his latest book. Paul's struggles with Annie to survive, write the book, keep his sanity, and escape are what form the core of the story.Misery is a tense read from start to finish. From the time Paul wakes up and meets his \\"benefactor\\" the suspense starts to build and it gets worse and worse as the story builds to a climax. For nearly the entire book, it is just the two characters and the relationship between them is pretty horrifying. Paul is completely dependent on her and feels empathy with her in some ways. At the same time, she's clearly psychotic and her sadistic treatment of him justly inspires him to hate her intensely. Both characters are well developed although the primary point of view is Paul's so we come to know him best. The pace is excellent, this is one of King's shortest books and easily the most taut of any that I have read.It is hard to find any significant fault with Misery. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart or young children but that's about it. King has crafted a true page-turner combining his strong characterization with a riveting and suspenseful story that had me on pins and needles the whole way. Prior to reading this, I had consideredThe Dark Half (Signet)to be his most intense book. This one gets my highest recommendation and gets added to my short list of his very best novels."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is an incredible book. One of King's best. It was nearly immposible for me to set down this book.If you've watched the movie than you HAVE to read the book. The movie does it NO justice. Don't get me wrong the movie was good but the book was... read it. You'll understand then."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is one of my favorite books i've ever read. I've been a King fan since i was a kid and this is my second favorite of his (the first being The Shining). I had seen the movie prior to reading the book and i was still on edge with the book and constantly surprised. Theres so much in the book that is not in the movie. Also you really get to see the deconstruction of a human being. Paul Sheldon starts out as a normal guy and by the end of it he is reduced to his animal nature. Its a great read from start to finish and trust me you will not be disappointed. The character development is amazing and the suspense is worthy of sitting on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Great book, definitely one of my favorite King novels. A lot more brutal and a lot better then the movie (which was great). The only thing I didn't like were the exerts from \\"Misery's Return\\", I hate romance novels even if they are written by Stephen King so I skipped over most of them. But the rest of the book was amazing and even though I'd seen the movie and pretty much knew what was going to happen it still had me in suspense and hooked through the whole thing, I didn't want to put it down and finished it in 2 days (which is fast for me). So if you've never read a King book before this would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is an excellent novel by Stephen King. Fast-paced, suspenseful, an d chilling all are words that could be used to describe this story. King does a good job in setting the mood of desperation but determination on the part of its protagonist, Paul Sheldon. I love how King puts his characters through their paces without them becoming cartoon-like or boring. Very unpredictable story and thought provoking. This is a good read."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I have never read anything written by Stephen King as I don't particularly like that genre. But a friend insisted that I read Misery, and I was astounded by King's talents. I was hooked from the very first page, and Misery is a book that will haunt yours days and nights long after you've finished.Paul Sheldon is a popular writer celebrating the completion of a new book, when his car goes off a mountain road in a snowstorm. He finds himself with shattered legs, being held captive by a former nurse, Annie Wilkes. Ironically, Wilkes just happens to be his number one fan. While she's nursing him back from near death, Wilkes reads his latest book, where he kills off his popular character, Misery Chastain (a sappy, high-drama character whom Sheldon has come to loathe). She decides that Sheldon will write a new novel (just for her), in which he brings Misery back from the dead. And believe me-Wilkes has her methods to keep Sheldon writing! Sheldon soon discovers that he's like Scheherazade, and the best way to stay alive is to keep the stories coming. Wilkes is a true psychopath, and the mind games that Sheldon plays will have you riveted. His ultimate goal is to escape, but Wilkes is one shrewd character, and his getting out alive is slim at best.Misery succeeds on so many different levels. The characters are so very well developed. In trying to figure out how to deal with Hurricane Annie, Paul also learns much about himself while he is trying to survive. Misery is filled with lots of symbolism-especially in the writing of his new book, Misery Returns. King also gives us a good look at the art of writing. He talks about the difference between a hack, a popular writer and a literary writer. While King is certainly a popular writer who is sometimes accused of being a hack, Misery reads more like a work of literature. We see what sometimes motivates a writer to write, and we can only imagine the rabid, crazed fans that any popular figure must contend with. It's also interesting to see how readers take ownership of fictional characters, and how distraught they can become over their demise. Also, as gruesome as much of this book is, Sheldon still can see much humor and irony in his situation which lightens the load just a bit.I never expected to enjoy Misery (or any Stephen King for that matter) as much as I did. It certainly won't be my last."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"It's common knowledge Stephen King can take a simple idea and turn it into a 500,000 word marathon; it's one of the reasons MISERY is one of my favorite King novels, because--for a change--King gets into the meat and potatoes of his story from the first page (and he doesn't let up until the last). Consequently, the novel is one of his shorter works.The beauty of this book is not so much the helplessness and horror of being captive to Annie Wilkes as it is the inner workings of Paul Sheldon's brain. Bestselling author of the Misery Chastain series (a character he has come to loathe), Paul talks to himself throughout his ordeal in Annie's Rocky Mountain hellhole. This self-dialoge is riveting, entertaining, and often downright funny. In fact, the humorous undertow throughout the book makes Annie's \\"behaviour\\" even more alarming and frightful. Nothing like copping a chuckle while Annie is wielding an axe or being destructive on a riding lawnmower; yet King pulls it off, page after page.I'm an allegorical kind of guy, and I can't help but think MISERY is a novel about Stephen King himself and the hell he was putting himself through during his substance abuse days. Writing, euphoria, pain, addiction, terror: all were in vogue for both Paul Sheldon and Stephen King in the 1980s. MISERY is King at his dysfunctional best.--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is my first Stephen King novel and I have to say, I loved it.SUMMARY: Paul Sheldon, a bestselling novelist gets into a car accident. His NUMBER ONE FAN, Annie Wilkes, takes him into her home and nurses him back to health. In a way. Holding him captive, she makes him write his greatest novel just for her.UPS: This book has a lot of detail and really makes you feel like you're right there with Sheldon, keeping you on your toes. It is suspensful the whole way through and gets even more spine-chilling towards the end.DOWNS: About 40 pages of the book is the book that Paul Sheldon is writing. It gets a little boring reading these parts and there doesn't seem to be any importance in reading them.OVERALL: This book is hard to put down, indeed. Even though I haven't seen the movie, the mental image I had of Annie Wilkes was exactly that of Kathy Bates. It took me only a few days to read and I really enjoyed it. I recommend this book to anyone who's going for a good horror novel."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"There is one big problem with Stephen King: he interrupts my life. What I mean to say is that once I start reading one of his books, I can't stop. Nothing gets done around the house, I have less time with my wife and children, the dog doesn't get walked, and you can forget about the stack of papers I brought home from the office to review over the weekend.This is exactly what happened when, on a Friday night, I decided I needed something easy to read, a page-turner, a plain old story-in short, something by Stephen King, the modern American master of the ripping yarn, replete with its baggage of cultural references no one will be able to decode a hundred years from now and deficient only if you cannot abide horror or terror or the macabre. Once I started &quot;Misery,&quot; I didn't put it down until I was finished, and I loved every reading minute of it.&quot;Misery&quot; is not one of King's typical horror stories, that is, it does not require &quot;the willing suspension of disbelief&quot; that is needed when you read about telekinetic powers (&quot;Carrie&quot; or &quot;Firestarter&quot;), monsters from sewers (&quot;It&quot;), vampires (&quot;Salem's Lot&quot;), or any one of King's many other supernatural or unnatural characters (a very long list of King's books). &quot;Misery&quot; is, instead, one of King's stories that, while extreme and terrifying, is also realistically possible. It is one of his better books, written during a time when he wrote a string of similar, realistic horror stories that I consider among his best, including &quot;Dolores Claiborne,&quot; &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;Rose Madder.&quot;The plot is straightforward. Paul Sheldon is a popular author known for his series of novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Sheldon finally kills off Misery, thereby ridding him, once and for all, of the pulpy best selling series and allowing him to move on, living off the royalties, to write more highbrow literary novels. Sheldon has, in fact, just finished writing such a novel and is driving home, manuscript in tow (the only copy, in fact), when he drives off a road in the wilds of Colorado during a blinding snowstorm. He is severely injured and, under less fortunate circumstances, his car probably would have been buried in snow and he would have died of exposure. Instead, he has the blessed fortune to be found by Annie Wilkes, one of his most devoted fans, an avid admirer of the Misery Chastain novels, and a reclusive-and deadly-psychopath.Annie, a nurse by training, takes the author to her home, where she holds him captive for several months while he resurrects Misery Chastain, writing a new novel in the series for Annie Wilkes's private enjoyment. The Babylonian Captivity pales in comparison to the mental and physical tortures that author Paul Sheldon endures, and King keeps the reader turning the pages, wondering what cruel or grisly event will follow one of Annie's many mood changes. It is vintage Stephen King, one of his better efforts, a book that I highly recommend if you're a King fan and, if your not, a good place to get some insight into King's imagination and skill as a story teller. It is also an interesting book for many other reasons, not the least of which are the way in which the plot of his novel is a kind of horror-writer's take on the relationship between author and editor, as well as between author and reader (Annie Wilkes, his mentally deranged, sadistic fan becoming not only his reader, but also his editor-in-captivity), the way in which an author who may have more serious literary aspirations can become captive to a reading public that becomes enthralled with his commercially-motivated work, and the way in which &quot;Misery,&quot; as well as several other works written around this same period, embody things going on in King's own life (see, in this regard, his autobiographical piece in his book, &quot;On Writing&quot;).While &quot;Misery&quot; may not be a great work of literature by highbrow standards, it is a great piece of storytelling by an author who is, perhaps, America's foremost popular, contemporary storyteller. For that reason, if no other, it's worth putting everything aside for awhile and just reading."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Well, back when &quot;Misery&quot; was first published, I had no interest in it at all. I was more of a fan of King's horror/ghostie stuff, and the premise when described to me (I was all of 15 at the time) sounded like a major snooze. I finally got around to reading this book last week, and I have to say, &quot;Misery&quot; is probably King's equivalent of Shakespeare's famous tragedy that begins with &quot;M&quot; whose full name we dare not invoke due to the curse. &quot;Misery&quot; is lean, yet muscular. It is a book with tunnel vision, it does not digress from the major plot, but rather keeps the reader staring straight ahead and biting their nails. Annie Wilkes has to be King's most monstrous (yet ironically, literally the &quot;least&quot; monstrous) creation he ever dared breathe life into. As such, after a while the reader, like Paul Sheldon wants to take Noveril to take us out of the realm of Annie, yet unlike Paul, we just can't WAIT to see what Annie will do next. King replicates the formula of &quot;person trapped in a small space trying to escape&quot; in other books (most notable in Gerald's Game) but this is truly his finest hour at getting the reader into Paul's head, and feeling his pain (and as I said before, his drugged bliss on Noveril). I even give credit to King for making us just as excited as Annie to see how Paul will resolve bringing Misery back from the dead. It's in the story within the story that shows that King is a master of his game, deftly parodying the gothic romance drama, while at the same time, presenting it in a very straightfaced manner. This is definitely the book that I would say defines King and his body of work. And the fact that it's a not so gentle look at the limits of fandom that make this a book that you won't put down."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book was amazing.

Annie reads this and decides that Paul must write another and bring Annie back from the grave.This is a gripping book that you will find hard to put down. King does a great job at making the characters so real. When she chops off one of Paul's feet with an axe and then cauterizes it with a blow torch will make you get chills up your back.If you ever see the movie, Katheryn Bates portrays Annie just as I pictured when reading this book. And much like Jack Nicholson in The Shining with the famous line &quot;Here's Johnny', the same holds true with Annie and &quot;I'm your number one fan&quot;.This is definately a great read.

Very few books actually live up to those words and phrases though. Misery is one those novels. For me to read a book in two days is a phenomonon. Not because I'm an \\"ijit\\", but simply because I don't have the time to kick back and read like I used to. Misery made me find the time though.Writer Paul Sheldon gets caught in a blizzard and winds up in a brutal car accident. He shatters both of his legs, and probably would have died except for the fact that he was rescued by a woman named Annie Wilkes. A woman who loved his writing and in her words was his \\"number 1 fan\\". Sounds like Paul got lucky, but Annie just happens to be a homicidal maniac.This is a book of pure action from the first page to the last. It was written in a period when King was at his best. This book stands out though. At a time when it seemed all of his novels were gigantic, rambling, character driven, and epic(IT, Tommyknockers etc.), Misery was the opposite. This book is short and sweet and the perfect book for non-King fans to get into. This also is the perfect book for a King first timer to pop his or her cherry.Highly recommended for all readers. If you're a King fan, what are you waiting for? If you're a non-King fan, swallow your pride and give this book a shot. You will not be dissapointed.

Misery is a King classic- psychotic, violent, complex, symbolic and affecting.In some parts, the sheer weight of Annie's insanity renders this book also very humourous, in a macabre sort of way.Misery is also claustrophobic. We are witness to the goings-on inside the mind of a captive man- write Paul Sheldon, who must write his way out of his own misery. He must resurrect Misery, the heroine whom he despises as a 'lessor' star of a 'lessor' series of books. Paul does not want to bring her back, but he must, if he wants to escape Annie's depressive/schizophrenic whirly-wind.Buy this. Borrow it too.

The story was creepy and thrilling. I liked the characters quite a bit; I could feel the anxiety when Anne would enter Paul's room because even I wondered if this was a good day or a bad day for her. Each event had me guessing if Anne would be a kinder person or the crazy psycho she truly is.My only real complaint about this book was the Misery interludes. Of course Anne who is a dedicated fan of his series Misery, makes him write the next book in the series. I can understand explaining what he is writing so the reader can follow along as he works. My problem is that whole sections were the book he was writing. A whole new set of characters and plot to follow along with that deterred from the story of Paul and Anne.

The movie is but a shell of the real story told in the novel.This is why I prefer reading over watching cinema. The book took me 2.5 days to read; the movie was less than 2 hours long-again the film is a shell. All the meat is in the book. Lots of good, tasty, savory 'black-angus' meat. The movie is fine if you want beans and franks. I would add that the film director took a lot of independent liberty with the screenplay that ultimately became the film.I think this is one of King's best works. I give it 5 stars. I highly recommend this as a psychological thriller with a touch of horror. This is a good gateway to other King novels if you are looking to venture into King's work for the first time.It's a dark book (as the title warns), which I prefer-and that is typical for Stephen King anyway. There in lies my attraction to King: He writes 'dark' tales, and he does so with literary qualities that are unrivaled by most other popular-fiction writers.In summary, the book is a masterpiece. I put off reading it for many years because of the movie. I'm sorry I did that because when I started reading I couldn't stop. I was not disappointed. Only disappointed that I didn't read it sooner. There was nothing about the film that served to spoil the book."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery was actually my first Stephen King book, which I decided to read after seeing the movie at the theater with some friends. After realizing how much more intense, disturbing, and graphic the novel was compared to the movie, I was hooked on King forever. It's not all just blood and guts, though; Annie and Paul are fascinating characters and the plot is incredibly suspenseful. This novel offers no supernatural elements. The horror comes from seeing the insane depths of psychosis and the extremes of human cruelty, something much scarier than make-believe monsters because it seems so real. All I can say is when I was waiting for Annie to break out her sledgehammer in the infamous hobbling scene, I was shocked, disgusted, and grossly satisfied by what happens instead. I read once that Misery was supposed to be King's next Richard Bachman novel after Thinner, but his cover was blown before it could happen. You have to believe that on the strength of Thinner, this one would have put Bachman at the top of the bestseller lists. As it turned out, it became one of King's most popular and successful \\"realistic\\" horror stories."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"... and I've read a lot of them.

I'm not going to get into the story because a) you probably already know what it's about, and b) if you don't, that's all the better. If you haven't read this book yet, I envy you in many ways.

I thought it was very creepy. The novel surprised me by managing to be more creepy and much more sickening that the movie was. Of course, I pictured Kathy Bates and James Caan throughout my reading, but that didn't effect my enjoyment of the story any.Ask most people about Misery and they'll mention the part of the movie where Annie Wilkes hobbled Paul Sheldon. It's a classic piece of horror movie history. It's also not in the book. The book goes far beyond what the movie portrayed in this and many other instances. Misery is gory, but not gratuitously so. The disgusting scenes in the book enhance the psychological horror already deep at work.The real horror is being stuck in Paul's head. His hopelessness, coupled with his unending struggle to survive in the face of pure, unadulterated crazy is maddening. The combination of Paul's mental anguish, his physical torture and Annie's insane demands creates a situation in which Paul is never safe, not for one second.The premise holds a lot of appeal for any reader. We all have our favorite series that we obsess over. Annie is no different in her love of Paul's character Misery. If the author killed off your favorite character, you probably wouldn't hold them hostage while forcing them to write her back to life, but you may see the appeal. In some way, as crazy as Annie is, a reader can relate to her. That, in itself, is scary.Misery gets a little slow in places, particularly during Annie's many rants and Paul's incessant need for painkillers, but the pace is rather quick through most of the book. Misery isn't going to have you jumping at shadows, but will make you want to keep your inner fangirl in check."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I saw this movie a while ago and saw the book in the bargain bin, so I decided to see if Stephen King was a good author. I assumed he was since so many great movies have been made from his books, but now I have confirmation. Misery is a tense, scary and grippingly written novel. My one and only complaint of this book is that I think it rambles a little, and King has the bad habit of doing this. He does it in Dreamcatcher, but in that book he does it for many more pages than Misery. Other than the occasional rambling this book is fantastic. I'll say that I do enjoy the movie a little bit more b/c of what it takes out. Same goes for Dreamcatcher, but Misery is better on all accounts. Btw the only reason I'm comparing this book and Dreamcatcher is b/c Dreamcatcher is the last King book I read.

It was the first SK book that I read also. I don't particularly like a few things about it, but more importantly I love a lot about it. The things I dislike are the fact that he put in chapters of a book within a book. During the novel, Paul Sheldon is forced to write a new book called, \\"Misery's Return\\" and we are given some of those chapters. I found them boring as all hell. I'm sure SK had his own reasons to put them in the book. Also, I didn't like that SK went too much into Paul Sheldon's thoughts. I mean, there is a limit to how much we can take in while reading a good book. I found myself wishing that Paul Sheldon would shut up so that I can see what the next scene held. However, I LOVED this book. With those two things aside, it was amazing. Good story and both the main characters, Paul Sheldon and Annie Wilkes are like-able. Paul because we are rooting for him and Annie because she's just such a sad story and could have avoided a lot of mistakes she made in her life with some proper medicine and therapy. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story. Just don't give up when you get to the \\"Misery\\" chapters."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is a great story. I've read the book several times and I've also seen the movie by Rob Reiner numerous times. King vividly portrays all of the characters. It is very suspenseful and the action plays out nicely. You really feel the emotion and the terror. It is a top 5 Stephen King book in my estimation. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery was my first Stephen King Novel. Word of mouth was that King has volumes of great books, and so it was mentioned to me that Misery would be a great Stephen King starter. There was not a time during my reading where I was flummoxed with the plot. The novel was shocking, suspenseful and engaging.Why did I find it shocking? This was my first \\"horror\\" novel so I was not prepared for the edgy traps King set me up for. I could picture Paul Sheldon's pain, the main charter, with every new scenario that popped up. As I read, I thought to myself: What would I have done in that situation? King painted a mental picture that took me back a couple breaths each time I read.The novel was suspenseful and engaging because there was always a new step occurring towards Paul Sheldon's hopeful escape from Anne Wilkes. Also, Paul Sheldon wrote a story during his captivation which became a parody to the callousness his enemy put him through. Anne Wilkes being Sheldon's number one fan makes its irking to read what happens as he is domiciled into the hellhole. It's a book you will not want to put down."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Sean Douglas HannumEnglish 912/12/2010book reviewSDH's book review''Misery is one of Stepten King's best books in my opinion. The book keeps the reader on their toes the whole time, and makes them wounder what is going to happen next.Misery's plot is some thing from a night mare by having to go though the touchier the main character goes though. Reader will have a image that is so descriptive the reader will think that they are a book writer and all their books are number #1 Sellers and they get in a car crash. Then, the next thing they know their in there number #1 fans house and she is not all there. She also is holding them hostage in her guest room and they don't even know where they are. Then they fear that if they say or do something wrong they might be killed and they're unable to protect them self . Then it all comes to the final thing they might do for the rest of their lives.Even though there is not a lot of charters there is a lot of conflict in the story. The conflicts in the story are man vs. man and man vs. fate. The man vs. fate in the book is when he is when a woman saves him for the car crash that she found him. Then man vs man every time Paul the main character and Annie the other main character fight.The themes in misery are very simple they deal with being abducted. One of the themes are you being saved from a car crash by a woman you don't know. Then the next theme is having to write a book for a psycho woman. The last theme I got was you have to fight to live when your abducted by a psycho woman.This book is worth the time to read it if you are a person that is OK with gore. I think this is the best book I've read by Stepten King. Over all this book is a good book.'''''''''Work CitedStephen King. Misery.

So I'm one of his new fans. I've had reservations about picking up his books before because I didn't think that I would really like horror stories (even though I absolutely love horror movies). So this year, as I started venturing a bit into the horror drama, I picked up a stack of his books on ebay. And since then have bought every single book I've seen in of his in used bookstores and library sales.While I was reading Misery, a lot of my family members said that I should just pick up the movie because it was so great. I've never really seen the movie version of Misery. I've seen like bits and pieces of it (the leg scene in particular), but not the whole thing. So, I liked the fact that while I was reading this, I had no idea what was going to happen, just that it would be gruesome (again because of the leg scene in the movie). The book was one hell of a ride. I find stories like this much more terrifying than the supernatural ones (though those scare the hell out of me, also) because crap like this can actually happen. I'm sure there are quite a few Annie Wilkes out there in this world, which is probably not a thought I should be dwelling on seeing as how it's 2 in the morning and everyone else in my house is asleep which is when, let's face it, most disturbing thoughts take place.I thought that King's character development was really great in Misery, although there are only two central characters in the novel, so that could have something to do with it. Annie Wilkes in particular was very well written. At first, I found myself feeling a bit sorry for her (feeling sorry for the psychopath? I know...), but as the novel progressed, my sympathy waned and I kept reading with disgust (and fascination, I'll admit it) at what she was doing to this man. It came to the point where I didn't really want to turn the page because I didn't want to see what else she was going to do. The book is pretty gory. I found myself covering my eyes while reading these parts even though the logical part of my brain was screaming at me \\"Alisha, it's a book, not a movie! You can close your eyes all you want, it's really not going to do a damn thing!\\" So, I was way into this book.I have much love for Misery. Sure, it disgusted me, terrified me, made me question my own sanity at one point, but it was entertaining. I recommend that everyone who loved the movie pick it up (unless of course, you're not that into gore. Even though, that may not even factor in considering I don't watch those torture porn horror movies, and I didn't find the gore in Misery over the top) and hopefully feel the intensity I felt reading it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Annie Wilkes is Paul Sheldon's #1 Fan, a devoted reader of his best-selling &quot;Misery&quot; romance series.

Not only does Nurse Annie get to restore her writing idol to health, but she also entices him to bring back Misery, a character he killed off in a previous book, much to Annie's disdain.Or that's how Annie sees it. From Paul's point of view, he is being held captive by a crazy woman all-too-capable of murder, and his only chance at self-preservation is to write what Annie wants to read.

Of course, that only contributed more to a wilder imagination! Like all other SK novels, Misery carries an element of supernatural. I couldn't consider the story as horror since there were no ghosts,apparitions nor exorcism --- but still paranormal in the sense that Annie Wilkes was acting abnormally. She was sort of a lunatic too obsessed with &quot;Misery&quot; &amp; its writer.

You always had something that you were dying to find out. Stephen King often just threw surprises at you that made you want to jump out of your skin or pull your covers up over your head at night with the shivers. In Misery, you are always in touch with what Paul Sheldon is thinking and feeling. I would recommend this book to all readers that can withstand the dismay, the agony, and the consistent curiosity of what is going to happen next to the unlucky victim, Paul Sheldon."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The book Misery by Stephen King is a gruesome, yet amazing book. The plot of this book is a very original and unique story about a writer named Paul Sheldon who is kidnapped by a psychotic. The psychological plot of this book is extremely unique. Annie Wilkes, Paul's kidnapper, is beyond crazy. Her unique view of the world that consists of two types of people (Annie, and poor poor things) is unheard of. The characters are just Annie and Paul, and Paul is a very imaginative, successful writer who just wants to get out of his mess. His character is exciting, exhilarating, and it always makes you want to keep reading to find out what will happen next. Annie is psychotic, and oblivious. She just makes you want to kill her. this book is very exciting and always fulfilling. It is also very graphic and gruesome. I think this is a great book and I would suggest it to anyone over the age of eleven who loves exciting gruesome books."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I'll be the first to admit that I was a bit disappointed when I first started reading Misery. It sounded a bit different when compared to other Stephen King openers where the first sentence immediately grabs the reader and introduces the first character. This book begins with the main character, a romance writer by the name of Paul Sheldon, thinking about how, when he was at the beach during his early years, the waves of the oceans always grabbed shells, carried them out, and brought them back to the shore. It's only when the evil character is introduced that the story evolves into a King novel, showering us with gruesome thoughts and graphic scenes like in all of his books.Suprisingly, the book got more interesting as I continued reading it. I do not agree with the reviewers who state the you will not put down the novel until the end. About 75 pages before the end is where all the thrills begin and the fun starts. The book is one of those where we are desperately waiting for the battle between good and evil, have to read 200 pages to reach it, and then be satisfied until you finish the book.After reading Gerald's Game (one of Stephen King's worst) and reading several reviews about the events that happen in this novel, I was not so sure that I wanted to read a book where everything happens in one place (In Gerald's Game, the whole novel takes place in a bedroom). Once again, I was pleasantly suprised to see that King managed to turn the one-long-scene book into a very satisfying, scary novel.The story is about the romance writer, Paul Sheldon, who after getting into a serious car wreck is suprised to find himself in another person's home. Annie Wilkes, the woman who owns the house, says that she is Paul's number one fan and that she rescued him from the wreck. Paul, of course, believes that he'll get out as soon as he heals from his broken legs but as the story progresses we find out that Annie's actions are not what they seem.My favorite part about the book would actually have to be Annie Wilkes. Unlike Stephen King's horror books, this would be considered more of a thriller, because there are no supernatural events and everything is realistic. Which brings us to Annie Wilkes: She was King's most shocking villain because I felt that there could really be people like her in the world (Unlike the clown in It). Sometimes I wanted to know her thoughts and feelings instead of always being bombarded with Paul's. She feels an awful lot like the main character in the story.Overall, Misery is a definite must-read. As for buying, if you read it three or more times and feel you liked every time, go ahead and buy. Misery is a pleasure to read and will keep you up all night. It's one of those books where you cant put the book down from the middle to the end and are forced to read the beginning. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I love Stephen King. As I read more and more of his novels, I think that he will be one of the authors that is remembered and studied long after his death. I think it's interesting that he has been labeled a horror writer alone. While nearly all of his novels contain unsettling elements, life itself is unsettling. Some of his novels are bloody thrillers (Desperation, e.g.), but many more are just disturbing character studies of society's misfits. Misery is one of the best of this genre. It contains a powerful character study of two such misfits: Paul Sheldon and Annie Wilkes.Though Paul is \\"successful\\" as the term is generally defined, he is clearly depressed and lonely. Annie is unsuccessful by society's standards, and also depressed and lonely. Annie clearly shows her depression and loneliness in more alarming ways, but the underlying emotions are similar. That is what allows the characters to interact in such a fascinating manner. Paul understands what makes Annie tick, even when she has crossed over into the bounds of lunacy. This understanding is what makes it possible for Paul to survive so long with a murderous bi-polar child-woman like Annie.The plot in this novel is simple, and there are really only two characters in the entire story. That is enough. King doesn't need an elaborate setting or a bevy of entertaining characters to create a compelling tale. There is nothing more suspenseful than Annie during one of her psychotic episodes or Paul when he makes his desparate and sometimes ill-conceived escape attempts. I read this novel years ago, but I had forgotten how complex and mesmerizing it is. When I reread it last week, I devoured it in a couple of hours.This is an excellent tale of loneliness, resourcefullness, and the battle between good and evil in all of us. It is also your worst nightmare, and an excellent public service announcement warning of the possible unforseen dangers of drunk driving."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is it.

I thought the movie was great, but the book is even more detailed and gives a better sense of what is going on eachtime the psychotic nurse(Annie Wilkes) and captured author(Paul Sheldon), meet. I like how King symbolized Paul's feelings as those of a bird from Africa he saw as a child in the zoo. He knew that the bird didn't belong there, and that it was going to die there, as he himself, didn't belong in Annie's house, and knows if he doesn't get out of there, he will die like the bird eventually did. The way King shows the hardships of being an author, made me respect the intelligence of all authors around the world, that publish books only to be read and perhaps forgotten by most.

Annie's bizzare behavior, kindergartner curses, and vividly described bad hygiene make her all the more realistic. Paul Sheldon's character is typical of a writer held captive by a deranged fan, but he fortunately lacks banality.The film is superb with wonderful acting, but the presence of the unnecessary character Buster is a good reason to read the book before. And the book itself can get dull at points when King pours into the progress of &quot;Misery's Return,&quot; but this low point harldy leaves a bruise.

Every year he always goes to the same place to write his books. He had just finished his newest novel, Fast Cars. As he is driving home the radio says that there is a storm coming. He decides that he's far enough ahead so decides not to stop. The storm catches up with him and he crashes. He cant move. Luckily, a nurse, Annie Wilkes, is driving home and finds his car. She takes him back to her house without telling anyone. She cares for him for a few weeks. His legs are beat up and he's in terrible condition. Paul soon realizes that Annie has mental problems and cant control herself when shes upset. She is also obsessed with his Misery series of books. All she does is talk about them. SHe is more than obsessed. She even named her pig Misery after the books. After awhile Annie finds Paul's new book, Fast Cars, and asks him if she can read it. He says that she can, so she reads it. Afew nights later, she finishes the book and doesnt like it because its not part of the Misery series. Also because there is so much foul language in it. She makes him light a match and burn the novel, if he doesnt than she wont give him any medicine. Annie comes home a few days later with the newest Misery book that just came out. Paul gets nervous about her reading it. She has just finsihed it and she gets really mad at Paul because the main character dies and she realizes that that was the last Misery book. Finally she forgave him and bought him a present. She bought him a typewriter and paper. She wants him to write a new book called Misery's Return. Where the girl comes back to life and its a whole new story. She is making Paul write it. She buys him the most expensive paper that was at the store. Paul tells her he can tuse that paper becaue it smudges. So she tells him that she'll go get some new paper and slams the expensive paper down on his legs.

Scary because it is something that could happen in real life. A famous writer (Paul) of women's romance novels is injured in a car accident and kidnapped by a crazed fan (Annie). Annie will let Paul go on the condition that he resurrerect a popular character (Misery) that he killed off in one of his novels.Sounds easy, except that Paul must make it totally convincing (not just a dream like Bobby Ewing) or he will suffer excrutiating consequences. Annie makes for one of the most horrifying jailers. Someone that is very demanding and will go off the deep end for any little thing.Loved this book through and through. One possible drawback to some readers may be that King presents many pages from the Misery transcript that Paul was prepares. If you are not a romance novel fan you could find those parts boring.

One of my favourite aspects about Stephen King's writing is the description, from the taste of raw Novril, to the poster in his room of L'Arc de Triomphe. The originality of the plot is amazing. Another favourite aspect, though a small one, is when Annie is telling Paul a little story. It is about the Overlook Hotel, which is the hotel in the film/novel \\"The Shining,\\" where Jack Torrence goes crazy (I have not read the book, but I have the DVD, which I understand is completey different from the novel).The plot of this novel is about Paul Sheldon, bestselling author of the romance series about a woman named Misery.

After she reads the latest Misery novel, she despises it. Misery Chanstene, the main character of the novels, dies in the end.

It took me a while to get through the small boring part at the beginning. However, once I got through that boring part the rest was non-stop, heart-pounding suspence and action.

Then Paul is in a car accident and his legs are crushed, then he's rescued by Annie Wilkes. Annie gets him addicted to pain medication and soon Paul realizes that his is her prisoner. Annie forces Paul to write a new MISERY novel bringing her heroine back from the grave. During this the dangerously insane Annie does horrible things to Paul. She crushes his knees, chops off one of his feet, and other various mental atrocities. Yet Paul needs Annie to survive. Despite her wicked deeds, you almost pity Annie Wilkes and her suffering. The reader in subjected to incredable amounts of suspense, wondering wheter Paul will ever escape his deranged warden. This is one of King's best books ever, the action flows so crisply that the reader feels right on the scene. A darkly comic scene has Annie disposing of a nosy police officer by running over him with a lawnmower. Once you start reading MISERY, you won't be able to stop until you've finished. Astonishing achievement by the master of the macabre, a sick love letter to all his number one fans."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"MISERY is a book created by Stephen King that terrified me. Misery is about a famous author named Paul Sheldon who has made many series of books that were all bestsellers, but his most popular series of books is the MISERY series. Paul was angry because he wants all his other books to be more popular than his insipid unrealistic series Misery. Paul finished his new novel FAST CARS one icy December day. Paul believed this book would be able to surpass (in popularity) MISERY. On Paul's way to New York to get his book published he crashes and shatters his 2 legs. Luckily he survived. Unluckily the person who saved him is a mentally insane sociopath (Annie Wilkes) who claims to be his \\"number one fan.\\" Paul learned that she was insane when she made him burn his book FAST CARS. Soon after, Annie finished reading the final MISERY book. Misery the main character of the novel is killed. Annie goes on a rampage leaving Paul without food and painkillers. Paul sneaks out of his room by picking the lock and steals a knife and painkillers. Annie had a book lying on the fireplace. It was a huge book with newspaper cuttings in it. Paul read it and found out Annie has killed thousands of people. Paul went back to his room and locked the door. Annie some how knew this would happen so she taped a string of hair to the book. The hair broke. The next morning she cut off Paul's foot then burnt his wound until it fused so he wouldn't die. Annie then picked up his foot and pulled out the knife he stole. She laughed hysterically then left. The next day Annie bought Paul a typewriter and then made him type a new novel of MISERY called MISERY'S RETURN. Paul gets a couple great ideas and decides to make the book then kill Annie. Paul Sheldon is typing for something more valuable than fame, than money, than popularity. PAUL IS TYPING FOR HIS LIFE.My favorite part in this book is that the typewriter he wrote the final book on had no N. So Paul slowly went insane because he had to rewrite each N on every word. What I really enjoy about the book is that the scariest thing isn't Paul getting tortured or Annie killing people, it's the physical entrapment that Paul has because he can't walk and how you never know if Annie will come back to give Paul his food or painkillers.If you want a book that can make your stomach drop, a book that can make you not sleep at night, a book that can make you keep a light on in every room, then you should read this book."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery by Stephen King was the second Stephen King book that I have read and I enjoyed it as much as the first.

In caring for Paul, Annie makes Paul write a book that he does not want to write, she tortured him, and killed a man because she did not want anyone to find Paul until he had finished the book.

I don't recall ever reading the development of psychosis in a character being accomplished so clearly, so chillingly realistically.This may be King's most symbolic, significant novel.Throughout the book I wondered, is this what it would feel like to be a famous author, a creative soul trapped by the tastes of fans? One of the worst spiritual imprisonments would be to become known, loved, and sought after for a certain quality in a product, then be held hostage to that quality, to be compelled to continue to recreate, regurgitate that quality forever and forever with no hope for an amen, with no hope to ever take a tangent or get a new lease on writing.\\"I'm your Number One Fan.\\" Each time Annie Wilkes said this, my hair would have stood on end if it weren't so thin, limp, and lacking, if I hadn't already pulled it all out in the first couple chapters of the book.If anyone understands the very essence of misery, it's Stephen King. If anyone can impart the ultimate in that feeling in a novel, it's King. Man, oh man, he did it. Her put misery on the bookshelves for keeps.I'll bet he thanks God 24/7 that he didn't EVER write a Romance novel! Or did he, somewhere in his deep, dark past? Ashes to Ashes!Speaking of a man who writes love stories being held accountable by fans who've come to seek a certain type of plot from him, is that what's happening to Nicholas Sparks and his novel TRUE BELIEVER?The symbolism noted above seems to be prophetically in play.Has MISERY manifested?Is King a prophet as well as a master storyteller and major figure in the literary world? Well, yes, most of his readers know he is.Some of Nicholas Sparks's fans seem to be compelled by genuine disappointment to leach the appeal out of his latest hardback, mostly feeling a lack of anticipated depth and intensity since TB didn't make them cry, as Sparks's other books have religiously done.I had been dragging feet about picking up TRUE BELIEVER as my first novel in Sparks's collection of romances. The nearly daily repetition of comments about how disappointing the book was had made me believe it was not worth reading. A few honest raves, though, kept the pilot lit for my desire to read TRUE BELIEVER (see my review) and draw my own conclusions.Maybe the ending to this story will be that Sparks agrees with Donald Trump's belief that any publicity helps his cause, even bad publicity. Likely the regular rips of TRUE BELIEVER, balanced with the raves, will increase Sparks's sales, and he'll continue writing with new leases on themes as his evolving talent demands.I have a question, though. Why is criticism so mesmerizing that I swallow it whole, yet praise always feels too sweet to be real? Is there something in that dichotomy which explains why horror usually feels honest and somehow true, while romance sometimes feels like a renewing wellspring of wishful thinking?Maybe we're dust to dust, with life and a few book preferences separating the entry/exit sandstorm.With Admiration For Craft and Shivers Forever,Linda G.

Three of my friends had even recommended the book to me. I just had a feeling this book was gonna be good. Boy, was I wrong.In the fictional world of Misery, best-selling novelist Paul Sheldon is rescued after an automobile accident by his number one fan. Annie Wilkes saved his life, and Paul as a prisoner, is forced to pay her back with his greatest work. If it isn't perfect, she's got an axe on one hand, and a rifle on the other.I like action. Everybody likes action. Don't get me wrong, for I did not expect Misery to be action throughout but the repetitive imaging and symoblizing just does it. It becomes a real drag. The story begins to pick up around page 70. Then it slows down after a few pages. Then it speeds up again around 250, only to mire until the last couple of pages.The worst part of Misery is reading the novel Paul is constrained to write for his number one fan. As a reader, I was tortured to read fifty or more pages of Paul's writing. No exaggeration, nor offense when I say that I thought Charles Dickens took over. At one point, Paul can no longer type so he begins to write the story longhand. You would agree that he has the worst handwriting because you cannot read a thing. I don't know if this is only the case for the mass paperback edition, or King intended it.Misery is all in one setting - Annie Wilkes's territory. With this drawback, King is left with no choice but to fill it up with an indepth description of the captive's mentality.

Annie later forces him to burn an unpublished manuscript of his new novel, \\"Fast Cars\\" he was carrying at the time of his accident, disgusted at its radical departure from the Misery series. Eventually, Annie forces Paul to write a new Misery novel \\"just for her\\" and bring the character back from the dead. Paul works on the book as Annie's violent mood swings and her psychosis deepens. Her insanity escalates as Paul tries to escape; she eventually chops off one of Paul's feet, one of his thumbs, and murders a police officer investigating his disappearance. As the authorities begin to close in on Annie, Paul's plight--both in his writing and his attempt to save his life--becomes more desperate.Paul eventually defeats Annie by smashing her over the head with the second hand typewriter she had given him to write \\"her\\" novel. After he escapes, he publishes the new Misery novel to great critical acclaim.\\"...enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I thought that Misery would be a really boring book, becuase the whole story takes place in one setting (think 12 Angry Men) and there are only two characters. Well, Stephen King's writing and insight makes the book interesting. Stephen King is probably the only author who can make a story of a man lying in bed for months on end be interesting. Paul Sheldon, a writer, has a bad accident and his car skitters off the road in a snowstorm. He is saved by Annie Wilkes, who just so happens to be his #1 fan. Annie is not a normal person, however. She is a manic depressant and takes alot of her anger out on the helpless Paul. By the end of the book, Paul's body is nearly mutilated by Annies horrific acts of violence. It's a pretty gruesome book at times, but overall it's a good read at about 350 pages."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

The reader feels as if he or she is in the story! I felt trapped in that room with Paul Sheldon. You feel his anguish and his profound desire to be free!! On the other hand, ambivalance arises and makes you love, hate and loath Annie. Annie is insane, but you just love it when she talks, and you look forward to reading her in the scenes. She is the star. I really did not feel anything for Paul except,\\"Pieta\\" or pitty.This book is so worth the money. I love hardcovers so I buy the used hardcovers here; they only cost $.01. Well, the shipping and hadeling is like $5, you can go from there. However, you still get a great deal because hardcovers cost almost $30 in the stores!

Having just finished a new manuscript of serious fiction, pulp novelist Paul Sheldon crashes his car in a mountain snow bank. Sheldon is secretly rescued by a nurse and obsessed fan named Annie Wilkes, who takes him to her remote home. When Sheldon awakes, he's badly injured, locked in a bedroom, and denied contact with the outside. Now a medical hostage, Sheldon realizes that he's in danger from his captor, who is both his \\"number one fan\\" and a violent psycho. Wilkes simply adores Sheldon's soapy novels about a young lady named Misery Chastain - whom Sheldon has just \\"killed off\\" in his latest book hitting the stores. When Wilkes gets the new book and discovers what he's done, she burns his new manuscript in revenge, and nearly sets her hostage ablaze. Then she orders him to return to the typewriter to write a sequel that returns Misery to life. Sheldon now must either write well or die. As Sheldon slowly heals and types away, he contemplates escape - which won't be easy.Misery is concise, gripping, and suspenseful. Readers immediately identify with Sheldon as he lays injured and trapped. I liked the book better than the entertaining 1990 movie starring James Caan and Kathy Bates (who won best actress)."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Paul Sheldon's very life is at stake. To write Misery's Return or not is a question such that for a man in his in his position is terribly risky. Confined to a wheelchair and missing a foot and a thumb, Paul Sheldon's not in a good place to bargain. His captor and number one fan, Annie Wilkes, pried his unconscious body out of the wreckage of his car and carried him back to her dilapidated home, where she played nurse to him for months. When he finally woke up, he found himself addicted to Annie's Novril capsules, the only way he survived the excruciating pain of two broken legs and a crushed pelvis. A short time after meeting Annie, she finished reading his latest book, and decided she didn't like his ending. So she forced him to write a sequel and bring Misery back to life. As the months dragged past, he became more and more aware of her insanity, and realized he was slowly becoming that way. She had several particular moments of insanity, where she cut his foot off with a dull axe and later took off his left thumb with the same axe. But in a way, Annie helped him. She got him that typewriter that kept losing keys, and in the end killed her. She made him write that book Misery's Return, which eventually helped him let off steam and remain in a stable condition.When Paul finally finished Misery's Return, he called her into the room, took out matches, and burned it. She tried desperately to save it, but it ended up giving her a severe full body burn. In her agony, she stumbled over to his desk, tripped, and hit her head on the typewriter. In her final death throes, she climbed out the window and made it to the barn out back, where she later from a traumatic head injury. Paul was found by neighbors who heard both of their screams. He told his story to the police and finally got it off his chest.All in all, Misery was easily Stephen King's best work yet.In Misery, Stephen King used his psychotic mind to shape his characters into something never seen before. He creates characters like Annie who readers just flat out want dead. And then he creates characters like Paul whose pain is shared by each and every reader. I personally love Stephen King and his style of writing. He really could lay off the profanities, though.In speaking of Stephen King, you can never talk about just one of his wonderful horrors. For instance, in speaking of Misery, I sometimes relate it to each of his books in general. And although Misery is my personal favorite of all of his novels, I cannot be too partial to it. I must take into account The Eyes of the Dragon, another of his fine works. As in Eyes, he throws characters into situations where they either get out miraculously or die trying. Unfortunately for readers, the latter usually prevails.In conclusion, Stephen King's Misery is above and beyond the literary world's call of duty. Mr. King owed his audiences the best horror story in decades. Ladies and gentlemen, we have it!-C. Edwards"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery was a terrific book to read. It has been five days since I read it and I am still scared of Annie, the sick woman who keeps the famous author Paul locked in her house for months. The movie was alright but compared to the book it was nothing. It left out some of the scariest parts and the death of Annie was more violent in the book. In the movie Annie, although still terifying, seemed more likeable and Paul never seemed to be in as much pain as the book. I would reccommed this short novel to everyone and anyone."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is the best stephen King book ever! in the movie you know Annie is crazy but in the book you really see just how crazy this woman is. the movie is good but the book is much better a lot more things happen to poor paul in this book. it will keep you reading to see just what crazy annie has next in store for paul. i have read a lot of kings books but this one by far is the best if you are a king fan you need to read misery.great story for all of stephen's number one fans!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"To be truthful, I wasn't much into Stephen King. Until a friend recommended Carrie to me, I never much cared for his works. But after reading Carrie, I began to realize why people like him.And after reading Misery I'm willing to admit I like him too.Misery is more than just your typical novel. The style in which it's written is actually a little different than what I'm used to (some chapters are only ONE WORD LONG), but let's be honest here. It isn't how the story is written, it's the story itself. I can deal with horribly written books (and Misery is NOT horribly written by the way) so long as the story is good for me. Misery is not a horribly written book, just different. It'll take a moment to get used to but you'll manage.Misery is a story about a man named Paul Sheldon who was in an accident (cause of alchohol) and nursed back to health by his \\"number one fan\\" Annie Wilkes. Paul is famous for his \\"Misery\\" books, that Annie has taken a real shine to. But when Annie is disappointed with his latest book, it's only convienent that she has the author there. So what does she do? She keeps him hostage and forces him to write a book just for her. She has many ways of convincing Paul to stay. One is with a needle, and the other is with an axe.Perhaps the most perplexing thing about Misery is that the story takes place in only one setting. That setting is in Annie's home, a barn. But the book still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.There's something even more interesting about Misery. The characters. Paul Sheldon, the all around do-gooder begins to learn things about himself by being held hostage. He begins to learn that he really does love to write. And as he clings on to life in his cunning ways, he'll learn he can do more than in his situation than meets the eye.But the true spirit of Stephen King's \\"Misery\\" is Annie Wilkes. She is by far one of the most interesting characters King has ever created. Not just because she's a psycho path, but because King manages to really show us why she is so miserable. He manages to make us feel sorry for Annie WHILE hating her.The book seems to have a message too. \\"Misery\\" seems to be that message. What does the title really mean? Is it to portray Annie's misery throughout her life? Paul's Misery with being stuck with Annie? The book series \\"Misery\\" in the book? Or does it have to deal with life itself. The book can be interpreted in many different ways.This was a riveting read. One of the shorter books I've read, but quite possibly one of the best books I've read. The central message and characters make this one of the most worthwhile works Stephen King has ever produced."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I believe this to be Stephen King's best book. This book represents a benchmark between King's earlier campy, almost horror movie-like style books (Carrie, etc) and the more psychological, almost surreal thriller type books that characterize his later writing years.Without giving too much away: the story revolves around two characters. A world-famous writer, physically incapacitated by a car accident, and an insane ex-nurse who loves his books, and has had the strange coincidence of rescuing him from the wreck. The writer is holed up in the nurse's house, and is witness to/victim of her descent into complete insanity.I am a fan of most Stephen King books but found this one to be most \\"effective\\", because it was actually a pretty quick read. Stephen King is a phenomenal story teller but at times his books can get a little slow. I always stick with them because I get a kick out of the bites of factual info that he inevitably inserts in his ramblings. I can see how a reader could get bothered by that though. Misery however is not like that. It has no slow or dull spots at all.The characters are intense, really strong, and will stay with you for years. The plot is suspenseful and perfectly paced.Read this one! It is well worth it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stepehen King had a way of making us terrified whether he is writing a horror story, a thriller, or even a love story. And MISERY is no exception. When writing this book, King took a break from the blood and guts of his horror novels and gave us a thriller. A thriller that made me as nervous as some of his freakiest to date.At least once in every persons life, we wonder what it would be like to be trapped. Held prisoner by someone else, and not able to do anything about it. This is a terrifying nightmare that King brings to us with this book.Annie Wilkes is as psycho as they come. A deranged murderous ex-nurse living deep in the mountains of Colorodo. When her favorite author crashes his car near her home on his way to get his manuscript reviewed, She finds his crippled body barely alive and takes him home. The terror begins.At first you want to believe that Annie is a good person, helping a crash victim back to health. But why did she not call 9-1-1? Why was Paul still in her home when he awoke, two weeks later?As the story progresses Paul Sheldon is put to the test. A test that will find how mentally stable a perfectly normal person can be after having body parts amputated with an ax, having to drink dishsoap water, and getting beaten physically and mentally.Again, although this is a change in pace for King, he still hits his mark. I was purly terrified and as nervous as Paul Sheldon every time King entered Annie into the story again.Another perfect story by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is a fantastic Stephen King book and after reading it, its easy to understand why its been parodied millions of times.

Although I think Misery should have been a Bachman book just to get Bachman more fame."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Probably the greatest piece of work Stephen King ever did, \\"Misery\\" tells the story of how a famous writer, named Paul Sheldon, drives his car off a road in the middle of a snowstorm in Colorado. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes who brings Paul into her home where she nurses him back to health. She confides in Paul that she is his #1 fan as she loves his \\"Misery\\" novels, a series of books that Paul is most famous for. However, once Annie realizes that Paul has killed off Misery in his latest book, Annie displays signs that she is totally unhinged and Paul is swept into absolute horror. It is then up to Paul's writing skills to escape the hell that Annie has put him in. \\"Misery\\" would be turned into an excellent motion picture in 1990 directed by Rob Reiner, and it would garner Kathy Bates the Oscar for Best Actress for her mesmerizing performance of Annie Wilkes.

For it's insight into writers and writing alone, Misery is a gem. oh, and it's pretty darn oogy too.listen, people, and get over it: you can call him a hack, you can call him a writer of mere penny dreadfuls. but the guy has an incandescent imagination (so vivid!, thinks paul), can tell great stories as only a master craftsman can, and can, from time to time (when he wants to, one gets the feeling) put together lines and passages that are worthy of the word Art. he's the Dickens of our times. deal with it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is my first review ever here. This is the first book of Stephen King I have ever read.Misery. I first saw the movie long ago and thought it was great. I believe that if King writes the way he wrote Misery, I will always prefer the books better. Misery is a great book; fast moving, well written, just overall great... except... for the parts where Paul writes the Misery books and we get to read that. To me, that was kind of uninteresting and at moments, very boring. I read because I thought it was somehow going to be connecting to the actual story, but not really.This was a great book, and I will sure be reading more of Stephen King in the very near future.For the slow moving feeling the Misery writings made the book feel, I give this book a 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Whew. This is a book I will never forget. I saw the movie first, actually, when I was younger but did not remember much of it. Then when I was a freshman in high school, I got it from the library to read. This truly is a thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. I didn't want to put it down and just wanted to keep on reading, this book was SO good. After I rented the movie shortly after that, I was able to further appreciate the awesomeness of this book. In the movie, I'm sure you remember the scene with Paul's feet and a psychotic Annie and a hammer. In the book, what happens is actually quite different - and more gruesome.

The sense of isolation and fear is almost tangible. The bad thing about this audio version is Lindsay Crouse's unimpressive narration. A lot of audio books have this flaw, a reader who isn't really capable of putting any variation into the voices and moods of the characters and Crouse is guilty of this and that is the reason I'm giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 (the paper version of Misery is definitely a 5). It would have been fantastic if Stephen King would have read this himself or perhaps a great reader like Frank Muller (who did a lot of other King stories) or perhaps Stephen Lang or Kathy Bates (who, after the film, we all think of as Annie Wilkes)."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Terror, horror....I could just feel everything that was happening.You want to stop reading, but can't.

As many complain, some of his books suffer from literary bloat, massive buildup to disappointing payoffs, and too much suspension of disbelief. Misery avoids all of these. It is by far the most realistic novel King has written, stemming from his own personal experience and fears of obsessive fans. A great \\"what-if\\" scenario for any writer. Annie Wilkes is truly one of his most terrifying villains. This story is classic King from start to finish, and the situation becomes more and more horrible as the story progresses. If you've seen the movie, I recommend the novel as they toned down some scenes and left out a lot of interesting dialogue/scenes for time. The \\"you-know-what\\" scene is different in the novel, but every bit as disturbing even without the visuals. If there's one complaint I do have about King, it's that his stories are very long, but end extremely abruptly (The Shining, Duma Key), and Misery has this happen as well. Some more backstory about how the aftermath unfolds would have been nice, but the ending is still great and the story is riveting. It's hard not to picture Kathy Bates as Annie as you read, a rare Stephen King movie that's as good as its source material. The story is much more detailed though. Worth reading if you're a king fan, or want to dip your toe in his work."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Overall, Stephen King is probably my favorite author. I like just about anything he writes, but I would have to say that Misery is my favorite King book. It just gets to me more than anything else that I've ever read by him. The thought of being held hostage by a crazy person is just terrifying, and the scene in the book when he gets punished for trying to escape is almost too hard to read. If you are a King fan, or a fan of the horror genre, then you have to give this book a try."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This was bone chilling. This book was hard for me to put down, and the movie never came close to be as exciting as the book is."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I've read many of King's books, but Misery has really stuck with me and become one of my favorites. Misery has the right balance of suspense, tension and shock; it is a bit atypical to many other Stephen King novels in that it is less horror and gore, but more psychological thriller about obsession and being held hostage. In this case, Paul Sheldon, a famous writer, has decided to pull the plug on Misery Chastain, protagonist for his popular romance series. Celebrating liberation from this series, and the chance to write other types of novels, Paul heads out in the snow but loses control and crashes. Saved miraculously by his \\"number one fan\\", Annie Wilkes, Paul awakens to terror. Paul quickly reasons that Annie is a bit \\"off\\"; his situation is made worse by the fact that he is basically immobilized from the accident, having to depend on Annie for survival. However, when Annie finds out that her favorite character, Misery Chastain, has been bumped off, then Paul is really in for it. Annie's psychotic behavior surfaces and Paul feels the horror and unnerving aspect of being stranded out in the middle of nowhere with her. Annie has a bit of a past, it seems...What I really enjoyed about King's Misery is the level of characterization. He takes Paul Sheldon and makes him a deeper level of character. Held prisoner, and forced to bring the Misery series back to live, he begins to question everything about writing and life in general, good choices he's made and what he'd done differently. There's a claustrophobic feeling we experience during his imprisonment with him; he must find a way to physically survive, but also mentally outwit Annie if he plans to make it back. With no one in close contact, and the expectation in the small community that the famous writer Paul Sheldon has met his demise in the snow storm, only he is left to figure out his mess. Annie Wilkes is also a masterful villain, one that is hard to figure out; under a faade of caring and nurturing, there is a bit of viciousness that makes you squirm. She gets under your skin.Misery has some effective atmosphere, chilling tension and well-timed suspense, especially as Paul boldly ventures out to explore Annie's house. Misery is one of King's best efforts, and it is always a thrill to read."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"You can read and enjoy Misery for many reasons but among the most rewarding is the deliciously evil Annie Wilkes. King delineates her character so we feel she is as real as any great member of the Society of Insane Villains: Fred Clegg (The Collector); Norman Bates (Psycho); Hannibal Lector (the series); Jack Torrance (another King nut); and others. King hit upon two masterstrokes that make Annie fearsome and unforgettable. First is her wildly unstable personality; she can switch from nice to hellion in the space of an ill-considered intonation. Second is her special vocabulary of dirty birds, cockadoodies, and the like. Of course, she possesses most of the other endearing traits of a sociopath, paranoid, and schizophrenic, endearing in a purely literary sense. Among Steven King's best creations. If you like raving mad characters, try these: THE COLLECTOR, PSYCHO: A NOVEL, the Hannibal Lector series, THE SHINING, and I, KILLER."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is not a typical piece of horror fiction. There are no ghosts or goblins or even rabid St. Bernards to scare you. What I find so terrifying in Misery is how perfectly ordinary the villain Annie actually is. Or at least appears to be. She has her flashes of insanity, but you never really imagine how dangerous she can be until it's too late. A well written and instantly engrossing book."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I have tried to read many different books by Stephen King, but never really got hooked on any of them. Misery was different. I started reading it and could not put it down. The story is moving and you both want to know what is going to happen next and the opposite because your scared for the main character. It is a really page turner and my favorite Stephen King book. This is a good book that I think that everyone should pick up and read some time in their life. If you do end up reading this book and you really like it, you might not want to see the movie because the movie is a real let down compared to the book!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is one of those books that I've always wanted to read. I finally found a hardback copy in great condition and jumped in straight away. I found it to be far better than I could ever expect.The start seems a little sudden, it begins after Paul Sheldon's car accident but we are quickly brought on track as to what has happened to him. Instead of calling an ambulance or taking him to the hospital, Annie Wilkes \\"saves\\" Paul from his wrecked car and takes him to her house, where she uses her nursing skills to \\"take care\\" of him.From the start you know something is seriously wrong with Annie. It isn't just the changes in attitudes, but the fact that she has kidnapped this severely injured man. After forcing Paul to burn the only copy of the manuscript for his new book, she forces him to write a new book in the Misery series that she loves. She hates that he killed Misery and wants her back, \\"without cheating\\".Annie Wilkes herself is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read. Her obsession with the dirty birdies, the don't-bees, the poor things all around her is chilling as it as but even when she was coldly cutting parts off of Paul or killing the cop with the lawn mower, she was not a terrifying sort of character. The end is the only time she really had me looking over my shoulder. Despite Paul's revenge and attacks on her, she continues to come. She doesn't stop until she reaches her shed and finally, finally dies. The writing towards the climax of the book is frightening. I certainly sympathized with Paul at the end, wanting to peek around corners and make sure this crazy number one fan wasn't waiting for me.There is, to me, a nice break during the story. The glimpse we get of Misery's Return was a welcome release from Annie's odd behaviors. It was corny and a nice little bit of parody towards romance novels and a little part of me would like to read the Misery series now."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"King is a master at suspense for I have read most of his books and this one has to be in the top five."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"MISERY is painful. Agonizing. Excruciating. Miserable. I liked it a lot.Here's a study in pain. An author (Stephen King's favorite protagonist archetype) wrecks his car off the side of a secluded road and is rescued from the wreckage by his biggest fan--who just happens to be a homicidal, psychotic ex-nurse with an obsession. That obsession is the \\"Misery\\" series by Paul, our author hero.Complications emerge when it becomes clear that the \\"Misery\\" character dies in Paul's latest and last (?) novel in that series. This does not bode well ... for now, in order to keep the psycho nurse happy, Paul--who lies in bed with shattered legs, stoned on painkillers--must somehow write this character back to life, or he will clearly die himself.Now, if that won't ruin your weekend, you're a true optimist.Intended as the next in the Bachman run of Stephen King books, Misery had to come out under King's true name when the pseudonym got leaked. King has theorized that this book may have catapulted Bachman to the center stage of writer's respect had it been given that chance. It probably would have. The book is that miserable--and good.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"In this book you will find out about this man named Paul Sheldon.

She wants him to write a stoy about Misery's Return.well this book is getting good, well then read this book and find out."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I started reading King with some of his worst novels (think Insomnia, The Gunslinger..), so whenever I saw this book in the store, I was relucant to pick it up. I'm glad I did. This novel seems to be more fast paced than a lot of King's other work, and it doesn't drag. It is a very plausible story line, in that it could actually happen. It is one of his best. My five favorite Stephen King novels are listed below.1. The Stand (Also, my favorite book of all time)2. Needful Things3. Misery4. Pet Semetary5. Firestarter"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery, though one of King's shortest books, is definitely one of his best. Paul Sheldon, author of the infamous Misery series, is taken hostage by his \\"number one fan\\" Annie Wilkes(a psychotic woman who's best friend is her trusty axe). Through a series of tremendous trials and pain, Sheldon conveys to the reader his gruesome story and thoughts which create an image so vivid it is seemingly real. Misery is an enticing read the entire way through and pleases 'til the final page. Even if you have never picked up a Stephen King book before, give this one a try and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Although Misery has only two main characters and one setting, this book manages to astound you with surprise at every turn. This is a book where King uses suspense very well, and I found this novel almost impossible to put down. I was horrified by Annie, and at one time almost puked at the thought of her (so go out and buy this book right now!) King made us almost feel sorry for her, and as you see into her past, you can start to see her slow decay into madness. Paul's inner strugles to write a good novel instead of the Misery trash is also intriuging, and that part almost seems to come from his own life. Overall, this book is up there with Salems Lot and the Shining, and is a \\"must have\\" in any horror collection."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is a peak in King's ability to write amazing thrillers, much like The Dead Zone, there is not a lot of horror here, going for the psychological frights, scores in aces with this #1 fan gone on the rampage via the form of Anne the wrestling nurse who drugs up the missing writer Paul Sheldon after finding him a car crash, very few characters, mostly just the two, suspend this book till the final shell-shocked writer flashback syndrome, Misery just shows how crazy good King is at his craft. It is also one of the better movie remakes from the same director who filmed the other good one - Stand By Me. Read it!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I have read every single book that Stephen King has ever written (yes, including The Wolves of Calla) and out of all of his books, Misery blows all of them away. The way that King implements sheer horror into the novel has me spellbinded. The thing that makes this novel much more horrific than the other novels is that it is set in a real-life situation. Everything that goes on in this book can and probably is happening even as I type this review. The way that King has created Annie Wilkes is unbelievable. She is so strong a character that she could only have been created by King. The way that he actually delved into the mind of a psychotic person and then transferred that personality to Annie Wilkes is un-matched by any other author to this date. The way he shows the utter fear in Paul Sheldon's mind as Annie goes off on one of her psychotic frenzies is remarkable. I have read this book 8 (yes, eight) times. 7 times in English, and once in Spanish. And it never ceases to scare me silly."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I would like this review to be taken seriously regardless of my age. This book is absolutely superb. A terrifying thriller about how Paul Sheldon, a famous author, is nursed back to health and kept captive by the psychotic nurse, Annie Wilkes who while being his #1 fan also feels the need to punish him as gruesomely as possible whenever he does something she doesn't find to her liking. This book is so wonderfully written. King describes every last detail so everything is crystal clear. I would suggest this book to anyone with the exception of those with weaker stomaches. This book is not for people who cannot stand some violence. It is so frightening you are pretty much forced to turn the pages. It took me little more than one day to finish it. It is made even more scary because of King's technique of taking realistic characters and a realistic plot go more and more sinister as the book goes on so you think \\"this could really happen.\\" This is a spectacular Stephen King book. I ate it all up and I hope this review encourages more people to do the same."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book is amazing! I was surprised at how different, yet brilliant this book was. The first thing I've heard from many people is that they saw the movie and that was good enough for them. I have to admit, the movie was great, but terrible if compared to the book. For those of you who have seen the movie and loved it, you should read the book for a pleasant surprise. If you have read the book, don't see the movie, because it is utterly disappointing. In the book, a famous author, Paul Sheldon, is in a huge car crash and taken in by his #1 fan, Annie Wilkes, a former nurse who knows what she is doing. She nurses him to health, and there is only one problem: she is nuts. She is extremely angered when she finishes Sheldon's latest book about his great character, Misery Chastain. In that book, Misery dies during childbirth. Now Annie wants him to write a new Misery novel: Misery's Return. He can't escape, and she will, and does, torture him until he writes it. Intrigued?? You should be! Read it!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King is the undisputed master of horror, and in 'Misery' he more than lives up to this title. This book has no monsters, no demons, no ghouls; only Annie Wilkes, and she is infinitely worse than any supernatural creation as she terrorizes protagonist Paul Sheldon while he lies crippled in her back bedroom. 'Misery' is not only a novel, and not only a novel about how to write a novel, but it is a touchstone for any writer - this book is rich in metaphor of the trials of creating a book that someone, anyone, will want to read, and it is impossible for anyone who has known the pain of writing, and wanting to write, not to identify with Sheldon. Amazingly put together, 'Misery' is a perfect example of simple plot woven into rich tapestry. At no point does it degenerate into predictability. There is always something gripping to tempt the reader into turning the next page. The fact that the whole novel revolves around the character Paul Sheldon holed up in one room, and still being able to capture the audience is a true test of any writer's skill and creativity. And the way that the story unfolds through the eyes of a writer is a great device that already worked in &quot;The Shining&quot;. The only (very slight) downside was the ending... I wanted Sheldon to cause Annie Wilkes more pain in vengeance. Even if you have watched the film it is definitely worth reading the book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book is amazing! From the first pages in which Paul's life in almost ended by a car accident, to the very last pages with Annie Wilkes haunting Paul's life from beyond the grave, you are captivated by this remarkable piece of work in which Stephen King delivers one of his best performances in his whole career. King describes so delicately what exactly is going on in Paul Sheldon's life during the time he is kept prisoner by his &quot;#1 fan&quot;, Annie Wilkes. You really understand the different emotions going through Paul's mind: Paranoia, fear, anger, depression, and of course, pain. The way Annie's part is written just amazes. It almost seems like King would have had to be around someone like Annie because of the way Annie Wilkes acts. She has several personalities. She has the #1 fan, the brutally-mean when agitated, and the normal (though not really) part. I really don't know what else to say besides what I have already said about this book. It's quite a remarkable book because it's just so amazing. You must read this and definitely see the movie which won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Kathy Bates who plays of course, Annie Wilkes."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Like a number of other Stephen King books that I have read, there is an abundance of descriptive writing that conjures up mental images that really make you believe that you are a fly on the wall of the story. The plot of this book is good and the images conjured up are at times gruesome and I could really feel Paul's desperation at not being able to escape or even know if anyone was looking for him. Despite this, however, this book just didn't do it for me. The Annie/Paul parts of the book were good, but the book within the book 'Misery's Return' was just boring - I skipped whole chunks of this to get back to the 'real' book. Overall I would recommend it to a friend if they asked me what I thought of it but I would not sing its praises. I am currently reading 'Rose Madder' and so far it is very good."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I just hate Stephen King's writing... I mean his stories are great and they make wonderful films, but I cannot stand reading his work. It's just... ugh... drives me crazy with its simplicity."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I was interested in reading this book after I saw the movie. The book is in my opinion, very disagreeable. I had a hard time understanding how the hero of the book gave that evil woman chances. One moment he's saying how you can't reason with crazy and the next moment he's sorry for her and not wanting to hurt her feelings. He had an opportunity to get away or die trying, and did not take it. I couldn't buy his reason for not leaving and then she came back and hurt him super bad. There are none of those brain teasing games in the movie; the woman is nuts and he tries everything to get away from her. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"If you are a really big Stephen King fan, you might be a little dissapointed with this book. I think it was alright, but it was really slow and dragged you through most of the book. By reading the back, it really sounds like a good read, but the only parts of this book that I really enjoyed were the exciting parts where Paul Sheldon was in danger, and the ending. I found this book boring and slow and I would not really recommend it. There are plenty more Stephen King books that are much more exciting than this particular book. I think it is a good piece of writing, but I don't think it is really that good of a book. I would suggest that you pick up a different Stephen King book before you read this one because most of his other books are a lot better than this one."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"this is one of my favorite steven king books.99.9% of the reason is hes not killing children the whole way through like in most of his other books/movies.and im not talking about teenagers who are out drinking and having sex,i mean little kids this guy always kills or does horrible things to in his books/movies.anyhow,this story is all about a writer who is injured and kidnapped by a psycho fan.the fan is a nurse who uses pain killer addiction and physical torture to get him to write another book to her favorite series.its very demented.and whats worse is theres really psycho people out there who would do something like that.like tim burton says......\\"ive always found real people far scarier than any monster \\"."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I didn't like the book Misery written by Stephen King because it draged on until the very end.

This book was completely wrecked for me by its unrelieved er ... misery. In all Kings best work (and I'm a big fan), happiness and unhappiness compliment each other nicely, balancing the tone of the novel.The other very simple fault King is prone to, an american disease almost, is too many 'happy' endings. In his best works, like pet sematary there is always doubt and ambiguity. Why are americans so addicted to happy endings in horror novels?"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. From cover to cover, nothing but predictability. Paul sheldons attempt to decieve Annie, and her naivety to fall for it every time got very old. By the time I was halfway through I wanted one of them to die. It didn't matter which one it was. If you are new to the Stephen King scene, pick a different book.

Rescued by a former nurse, Annie Wilkes, Paul soon realizes after he wakes up from the accident that Annie is not your run of the mill R.N. A truely horrifying novel which, and I will make this very clear, does not contain any ghosts, goblins, devils or any supernatural beings at all. However, could good ol' Annie be scarier than all of the above? I recommend all this book to any Genre lover. A masterpeice."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This was a very powerful and an edge of your seat kind of story.

How do we know they all ready hav'nt?"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The most impressive thing about this novel, is it's capabilitie to show how someone wishes to tell something to someone in words, and the agonizing process that it might be. This book is my therapy book, because it's not a pretty book, not a happy end book, but a lesson on hope beyond all dificulties and real sorrows of the soul. How critics can say this is a bad peace of writting, is beyond by understanding. because beeing good or bad, will become a controverseal discussion about what's subjectivity, but it is honest without raving despair as the consolidated way for mankind to accept all artistic and human manifestations. for me, it it a treaty of hope. of honesty and especially, a reasonable manifestation of anger against people who destroy in a half-an-hour critic, one, two or more years of work. Paul Sheldon is the demostration of that resistance. Annie Wilkes is a fear, and the exorcism, all in one package. Steven King wrote books which I didn't like. As all writters do, for all the diferent sensibilities and tastes. But this one is,for me, beyond the criticism regarding honesty, even if not the one considering personal taste. Reading is an act of freedom. As well as developing a taste."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Heehee I just finished this book today, and all I can really say is, READ IT! This book is a true treasure. When you read into the book you are going into Paul Sheldon's mind at times, Paul is the one who must suffer when Annie gets mad. I'm sure anyone reading my review has seen the movie, now, I will tell you and would like to warn you that this book will actually stun you at times. You will actually be paralized into pure terror! If you've seen the movie you have seen Annie Wilke's method of hobbleing, well.....heehee Annie's method in the book is somewhat different. The movie is terrific, now, I won't say it's bad, for it is one of the best films made, but, I will tell you the book is totally terrorizing! I was reading parts with my mouth wide open! Read it, you won't regret it, although I don't really recommend it for the weak stomached...... Also what differs from the movie. There isn't a sherrif in the book that is a big character as the movie had. Oh but believe me there is a state troop, that makes the bad mistake of pulling into Annie's yard......that's when the stabbing and the lawn mower starts up! Oh I must go now!

When I decided to read this, I thought, Hey, this better not be a disappointment! And, man, it was absolutely FAR from it!! This book is GREAT! It captures my attention and interest on the very first page, pulls me deeper and deeper into the actions, emotions, and suspense of the plot and characters, it's just amazing how a book can catch a reader and refuse to let go!!! This is the most irresistable adventure I've ever have the honor to experience since Ender's Game. Even now I've read some other King's book, such as Cujo, Carrie, Thinner, and The Langoliers, Misery is still the best. Even though it's kinda gross, sometimes.Read it, I assure you, it's GOOD! After all, it's STEPHEN KING!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The ending to Misery is absolutly hoffiying. It made me cringe. It, however, is the only good part about the book. The story doesn't even start rolling until Annie takes the ax to Paul.

He has a lot of great books, but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Being a sort-of writer myself, this book put the fear of God into me while summing up exactly how it feels. I think if anyone tells me they're my number one fan in the future, visions of blowtorches, cards of Novril capsules, axes and giant ice-cream sundaes will leap into my mind. MISERY is, as the cover copy says, a novel not only about terror but creativity. It is, in a way, but it is more about the stuff writers don't tell you - what it's like to have a block, how you feel when you just can't finish. One of the more interesting aspects of King's writing is the way he outlines unimportant memories from his characters and then mixes them in when you least expect them - for instance, Paul's persistent use of &quot;Africa&quot; and how he seems driven to write it into his lifesaver novel. Annie Wilkes is a strong and truly frightening character in her glib cheerfulness which can so easily lapse into sullen, homocidal tantrums. And if you think that sounds funny, you've not read MISERY. I guarantee you will be hooked."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I just love Stephen Kng's style - It has a way of pulling you into the story, making you feel as if you were inside it. Although most of this book takes place in one house, it NEVER gets boring. You just sit there, reading, all nervous about how it will turn out... The fact that such a story might really happen also adds to this effect. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!A brief summary: A successfull autor has a car accident and is rescued by his biggest fan... Who isnt's pleased at all by the fact that he has &quot;killed&quot; the main figure in his latest book. Even worse: She's crazy and makes him write a new episod, just for her. The story is about him doing that and trying to escape. I particulary liked the extracts of this &quot;book in a book&quot;.This may not sound very interesting, but it is phenomenal nevertheless!!

A novel about a writer who has an accident and is &quot;Rescued&quot; by his biggest fan. Guaranteed to scare the hell out of you and send shivers down your spine."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"If literature classes in high schools and colleges around America ever decide to actually study King, this is probably the book that they'll decide to use first. It seemed fairly obvious to me that this may have been the intention as I read this novel. In terms of simply storytelling, the book is interesting, if not as gripping as some of his other works, but on an allegorical level this book is just a little too easy to have been created through random chance. The story is about an author who is held captive by his audience and forced to write pulp fiction, which he considers beneath him, and after a certain amount of exposure, his hatred for his pulp creation blinds him to the point that he's no longer able to be objective about his own work (represented by his inebriation upon finishing Fast Cars), which leads him further into his symbolic captivity. I'll admit that at first I was turned off by the apparent thrust of this allegorical message--considered superficially, King appears to be lamenting the fact that he can't write just whatever he wants and have the public lap it up and thank him for the privelege. Upon deeper inspection of the novel I realized that that wasn't his statement, but some readers could be turned off by the superficially self-serving appearance. King has been accused of being more than a little obvious when trying to communicate a message in his stories (take The Tommyknockers and Insomnia for examples), and this book is no different, but in this piece his message is actually fairly insightful and it's delivered in a very interesting (if obvious) manner. Of course, if you're only looking for a good story, the novel has that as well, though it does bog down on occasion and the narrative occasionally gets ahead of itself, forcing King to relate certain events in &quot;flashback&quot; fashion rather than simply integrating them into the flow of the narrative. Ultimately, I would recommend this book for anybody simply because there's something here for everybody, and it's probably something good."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"One of King's BEST books, I have read many of his books, though I AM only 12, but I think that's the right time to start reading his works. The story is about Paul Sheldon, a writer of many famous books, called Misery, who is also the main character.Well, he is involved in an almost fatal car accident and gets picked up by Annie Wilkes, a crazy madwoman that is a retired nurse, and who killed most of her paitients. She gets him hooked on Novril, a kind of asprin. When she finds out her &quot;Misery&quot; was killed in the last novel, she goes into an outrage, and starts attempting to kill Paul. After choping off his foot with an axe, (Paul's in bed and can't get up) She saws off his thumb and puts it in a birthday cake. She kills many police officers, and finally ends up getting killed herself, which I will not reveal in case you've never read it. If you have not read it, and are a fan of King's this is a MUST! If you are a fast reader, read it twice, you will have missed things (believe me, I am). After you have read it, watch the movie!!!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This one is my favorite of King's, with the Long Walk and Running man in second and third. This book travels inward to inside Paul Sheldon's little world once he gets stuck in his &quot;#1 fan's&quot; house after an accident. Rich with irony, some easily apparent, some you have to dig to see, it is an intriguing book. King makes it seem as though Paul were a real-life author (helped by the fact that the book Misery appears to be actually &quot;written&quot; by him in lieu of the burned manuscript for the next misery novel Annie makes him write) and a normal man, who happens to fall into the hands of the dangerously touchy Annie Wilkes. Her fascinating character is enough to more than make up for the lack of real action (because it almost all takes place in the bedroom where Paul is stuck); she is-- ironically all at once-- romantic, passionate, CRAZY, scary, friendly, caring, wierd, hard to figure out and seemingly simple...and, trust me, READ IT TWICE.

This is such a clever novel. Within the book we see the intriguing process of trying to begin to write, and also of the authors struggle to stave off his pain and frustration at being imprisoned. King's creation of Annie is fantastic;we have a character who is both dangerous and 'kind'( in a nursey way!). In this, the reader is, at times, not sure whether to fear her or trust her at any one time. Annie's split personality lends the novel an aura of constant change. This is what makes the pain and suffering so real.I strongly recommend this book.

In it, Paul Sheldon, an author who writes romance novels, crashes in his car and is found and nursed back to health by Annie Wilks, who claims to be his number one fan (She fails to tell anyone that she has found him). Now, the back of the book says she goes fanatic after he kills off her favorite character. This is only part of the story. Annie Wilks is Psychotically and Paranoiacally (SP?) insane in a way that only King could bring her to life. She is pleasant on the skin, but underneath she is a time bomb. She can go from happy to insane with rage. She does some horrible things to Paul. I won't say what, as it would spoil the suspense. But the Scenario is terrifying. Noone knows that you are here.You are all alone with a psychotic madwoman who would torture you if she becomes angry. You are completely dehabilitated. If you are faint of heart, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!!!!I think the quote that best sums up is the quote by Frederick Niche at the beginning of the book:\\"When you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you.\\""},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book was awesome. It slowly draws you in to where you're attratcted to every word of this gripping novel. I personally would recomend it to anyone ever.

A man picked up by his crazy 'number-one-fan'; he suddenly realizes that this lady was not right.

Unlike a few of his other books, this gets straight to the point right away, and you don't have to read half of the book before you can't put it down.

I was skeptical to read it at first but now I am glad I did. King's use of imagery helped me to picture everything that was around Paul and Annie. Everytime Annie said or did something I got the chills through the novel's descirptiveness. I read it over a 3 week period but I never wanted to put it down because I wanted to know what this psycho woman was going to do next. Every time Paul got a hope of escape Annie snatched it from him and I was disappointed as well as Paul. Without ruining the ending, I do not think it could have been better or more unexpected. I like books where I cannot predict the ending and this really satisfied me in terms of surpirse. I have read several of Stephen King's novels but this one is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Award winning author, Stephen King, stuns his audience of readers with yet another magnificent display if imagination in his novel Misery. Stephen King had his book published in 1988 and it was, 2 years later, made into an Academy Award Winning movie. Stephen King's stunning and vivid descriptions of Paul Sheldon's \`misery' and his psychotic captor, Anne Wilkes, make this book one of his most popular.The novel begins as Paul Sheldon, a best selling novelist, is involved in a terrible car accident, which leaves him very badly injured. His smashed up car is discovered by a woman by the name of Annie Wilkes. As Sheldon awakes from his unconscious state, he finds himself in the small guest bedroom of Wilkes's house with his legs shattered and badly splinted. He quickly becomes aware that his new caretaker is more than just his \\"number one fan\\" but is also a mentally disturbed woman who seeks to keep him prisoner in her home.Stephen King wrote this novel to grip his audience and throw them into a life different from that of which they live and hand them the experience of being trapped with a person of an unstable mind. His dark and cruel humor leaps off the pages in his horrifying descriptions that can almost be felt. Through his vivid descriptions of Sheldon's mind and disquiet towards Annie, it seems almost as though he himself were experiencing them. Also, unlike many books that I have read, the setting is told descriptively so to create a detailed picture in your mind, but is also not so descriptive and boring as to \\"put you to sleep\\".King's style never ceases to amaze his readers, especially when he combines two stories into one. In the novel, Paul is made to write a new episode in his books, just for Annie, which brings back to life the main character of his series. As Paul begins his new novel, the reader is able to read along as Annie would. King intertwines Paul's novel chapter by chapter while maintaining the original story about Paul and his captor.Another of the novels major attributes is the tone. The tone is one of suspense and makes it very easy to keep reading. King also incorporates flashbacks and memories from Sheldon's childhood into his thoughts or ideas in the form of metaphors, such as the tide of the ocean covering a \\"rock piling\\". This signifies the medication that he is taking washing over and covering the pain that he suffers. This form keeps the book interesting and ties it together, bringing in ideas or thoughts that were originally brought up at the beginning.Although the ending seemed rather rushed, as though King was trying to finish the book quickly to reach a deadline, Misery is by far one of his best. His brilliant writing brings the characters to life before your eyes making reading the book an experience worth remembering."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery couldn't be better, if you know what I mean. This novel is a loosely based purging of Stephen King's thoughts about his fans, and he weaves a novel out of that that is inexplicably excellent. After releasing The Tommyknockers, Stephen King had this book published in 1988 to rave reviews and massive fanfare, and was even made into an Academy Award Winning movie 2 years later(Think about a tight schedule). Stephen King's vivid descriptions of Paul Sheldon's misery and his insane captor Anne Wilkes make this book stand as one of his strongest and happens to be one of his most popular books. Great for people trying to get into Stephen King.Story:Our story revolves around writer Paul Sheldon, who like The Shining's Jack Torrance is buried in the harsh Colorado winter. After a brutal Car wreck, Paul is Saved by his Number One Fan, The Former Nurse Anne Wilkes(There's a reason she's a former nurse), who nurses him back to health after he attains some ghastly injuries. As soon as Paul comes back to The Living, he learns that Anne Wilkes is a SERIOUS Fan of his Misery novels, romances of a sort. Paul is mortally afraid of Annie, as he has already figured she's insane, and he prepares for her to crack. And boy, does she ever. She begins by making him burn a novel(Fast Cars, She apparently didn't like it) that he has worked on for the past 2 years, giving him the Choice of either getting his pain to go away or burning his manuscript. Then, upon learning that Paul killed off Misery Chastain in his new novel, she MAKES him write a new one, and the choice is simple:If he writes it, he lives, and if he doesn't, he dies. This is how Stephen King haunts people, folks. But he begins to find solace in his writing and it is the one thing that keeps him from going insane.As Annie's bad mood progresses, she becomes more depressed and demanding, and will do anything to get Paul to obey her. Holding his pain medication and cutting off parts of his body are just 2 of her methods. As Paul uncovers her shocking path he is likewise set on a path to revenge that will end in either his death or Annie's .They're are many road bumps in store for Paul, and he must get over them so his story will be told. The story is impecable and majestic to be saying the least.Writing:Stephen Kings prose screams off the page with its dark and twisted humor and terrifying descriptions that make you need to get under a blanket, you're shivering so badly. It's almost as if King lived in the world of Paul Sheldon, because his desriptions of Paul's thoughts and his apprehension at Annie put you directly into his mind. I also like how King had a story within a story(Kind of like The Regulators the Movie screenplay in The Regulators), as we Constant Readers get to read chapters of Paul Sheldon's new special Annie Wilkes novel, Misery's Return. It's kind of cool to read 2 different stories at once, and learning how Sheldon's writing process works.I also love the metaphors this novel has, Like how writing Is Paul's Africa, a place where he can escape to. Also the metaphor of how Annie Wilkes is The Goddess, because of her impenatreble stronghold on Paul. The story never seems to lag or get haggled in boring chapters, as the story is just straight up action through 338 pages. The only thing that sticks out like a thorn to me is that the ending seems to be really rushed, like King was trying to reach a deadline(Like Paul) or he just wanted to get the novel over with. Overall, his writing is not at his peak (Like in The Shining or Needful Things), but its a close second. Great.Bottom Line, if you're a potential buyer who wants to read a great book or discover a new author, just buy this book and thank me later by saying this review was helpful to you.The Circle Closes"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"A Review by ColbyPaul Sheldon the main character had gotten into a car crash and both of his legs were shattered, and his pelvis was dislocated. Annie Wilkes picked him up and brought him to her house. He learns that she is his \\"number one fan\\" and that she has all of his books but she likes the Misery books the best. Annie reads the manuscript for a new book and doesn't like it. She gets him a wheelchair and an old typewriter and has him write a new Misery book just for his \\"number one fan\\".I like the book Misery because some of the things that Annie Wilkes does are just completely horrifying. For example, she found out that Paul had snuck out of his room so she performs an operation that she calls \\"hobbling\\", she cuts Paul's foot off with an axe and cauterizes what's left of his leg with a blowtorch. The book has many good conflicts in it. Most of the conflicts are Character VS. Character, most if not all are exciting and or very creepy. Another reason I like Misery is because the plot is something that could really happen, I think what happens in the story could really happen because there are a lot of crazy people in the world and I'm sure that some are really like Annie Wilkes.I would recommend the book Misery to people that like scary stories about people that get trapped and can't control what happens to them. The book is easy to read and exciting."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Once as a gift, my little brother was given a joker-like puppet on strings attached to a piece of wood with four sides. Depending on the angle you tilted the wood, the puppet would move corresponding with the attached strings. This bares stricking resemblence to the human puppetry displayed in this novel. This novel, to be frank, is a novel's novel. It was almost as if King stripped his writing knowledge down to what he had acquired in college. He was in a serious writing 'mode' when doing this one, and it shows a bit too much. The plot is nothing new to expect fom King: A writer gets trapped by his '#1 Fan' and is forced to write the storys she loves so. But, this muchacha is a bit loca. Muy loca. In any arguement about King and his villians, there is always someone who pipes up praises for Miss Wilkes, and, after reading about her, you see why. She exhibits a bit of 'Dr. Jeckyll-Mr. [or Ms.] Hyde' psychology, but saying this would ignore her crucial depression and anti-sociality, which are clear and evident in most places. Anyone who is anyone knows someone like Wilkes, in my case it's my mom, and so, as it is with most of King's characters, you can relate with them. [I don't think this is all very positive, as they are called 'works of fiction', and so you're going to have to use your imagination sometime. But if you've ever tied to write a story, you see how I could be contradicting.] King must have done some serious psychological study before and during writing this, because you can't get along three pages without getting a footnote on it. It discusses being trapped within your own self when there is nowhere else to hide your negative mentality, and Sheldon's addiction to pain-killers is a hearty example--or maybe King just wanted to share an experience from his own little trips he had in the mid-80's. But anywho, it shows that no one is safe from themselves and the feelings of others, no matter how closed your mind or front door is. In the simple perspective of Sheldon, one could feel under the rule of giant hand anytime and feeling like you are forced into something completely against your will and if you do not participate there are dire consequences--in my case it's in Math class. One could conclude that artists do not fully realize who and what they are to their fans and followers, and so their perspective on them drastically changes in a situation like this [although, when do you hear aout any situation similar to this? Never, that's the only reason this story is fictional]. 'Misery' is very enjoyable, entertaining, and, in some places, educating if you're a med student or just plain ignorant. The only reason I didn't give this one five stars in because you have to be a 'mode' when you read it. But maybe King meant for it to be that way, so......?"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I was thirteen when I started reading King. He usually writes a story abour a monster that will come from God knows where, rip your friends to pieces and then (if you're lucky) you get to kill it.That's what everyone told me.Misery is a very different kind of horror story. The monster is not twelve feet tall, it does not have two heads and it doesn't eat children. It is a monster we can read about everyday in the newspapers. The deranged fan of a superstar.She is a nurse who finds a man doomed to die unless she helps him. He is an acclaimed novelist, he is famous, he is rich. And she is his number one fan.The way King justifies the horrors that she puts him through (isn't it true than when we all watched the film we had our legs tucked safely beneath us or held our ankles to make sure they were still there), with her own eyes, but turns her into a pyscopath in the novelists eyes is pure genius. The horrors are not unbelieveable and not unreal. The horror of this story is that it can happen to anyone.If anyone has read The Collector, then this is a must.

This edition has the occasional and very annoying typo. But in all still a great read."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Remembered perversely as Stephen King's love letter to his \\"Constant Reader\\" fan base, 1987's \\"Misery\\" is a surprisingly direct and frill-free two-person suspense story that left me feeling incomplete, if not as much so as protagonist Paul Sheldon.Sheldon is a novelist who has just killed off his meal ticket Misery, the heroine of his very successful romance series. A terrible car accident in Colorado leaves him laid up and reliant upon the tender mercies of Annie Wilkes, an unhinged recluse who really loves Misery, as well as making misery for \\"Don't Be's\\" and \\"dirty birds\\" who defy her will. She decides Paul will resurrect Misery, or pay the consequences, though it's clear to Paul he's in deep soup whether he does or not.\\"Misery\\" would seem to have a lot of potential for mixing up humor and suspense. So it's disappointing to find it a straightforward suspense tale. The opportunity to play up psychological tension, say through the captive's \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" as he loses more and more of himself placating Annie, or the captor's tendency to flip on a dime, is established early and then abandoned in a scene involving a book Annie keeps and Paul finds which puts the whole story on a different, more conventional footing of good-vs.-evil where blood and swearing return as the main King catalysts. King was famously critical of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his \\"The Shining,\\" yet King goes for the same lack of nuance with his lead antagonist here.As far as page-turners go, \\"Misery\\" is hyper-intense, even as for most of it you are stuck in a room with a guy who can't move around much. Little things mean a lot here, whether it be the sound of a car passing in the distance, the crunch of snow outside, a mooing cow that suddenly goes silent, or a little gewgaw of a penguin sitting on a shelf. For a guy who goes for big effects in other books, King does a fine job getting across the smaller things here.Be warned: It's a grisly read, even for King fans, a trifle too much so for me. I don't think it's the ax as much as the blowtorch right after that left me cringing. Again, I wish the book had played the whole concept in a lighter way, say with the excerpts we get of Paul reviving Misery on paper for Annie's benefit which come off here as an attempt at poor horror fiction rather than a believable parody of the romance genre Annie loves. King can write funny, but he can't write comedy, or if he has I haven't found it yet.The best thing about \\"Misery\\" is experiencing it after reading King's \\"On Writing,\\" another so-so book but one that sheds light on the creative process that went into \\"Misery\\" as well as how \\"Misery\\" eerily foreshadowed King's own future. Reading about Paul's struggles to rebuild his writing talent and find the will to live can only echo for those of us who know the rest of the story from \\"On Writing,\\" and this brings much pleasure.But that's really not enough for the casual reader. Maybe it will suffice for the Constant Reader, most of whom are a lot easier to please, thank God, than Annie."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"How does he do it?Take TWO charters; one trapped in bed and drugged up for most of the story, one bat-sheep crazy old woman, add a couple hundred pages and have a novel that scares the living crap out of me??

King does a fantastic job of creating this sense of danger. He gives Annie (Paul's \\"nurse\\") a very odd personality - one minute she is talking calmly to Paul, the next minute she is cutting his ankle off. So how do we know that Annie is not right in the mind? Since Paul is a best selling novelist, he has done extensive research on the human mind and its behavior. From that, he deduced that Annie was very deeply disturbed. Annie happens to be Paul's number one fan (which he realized after seeing her carrying numerous books written by him), and is extremely angered by the fact that he killed off the main character in the final book of the series. Then, Annie forces him to write a new novel, bringing her back from the dead (she can be very persuasive, seeing that she keeps an axe and a needle in her house). The irony of the situation is that the person who saved Paul's life will eventually try and end it. Another clever part of this book is its title. Misery could refer to Paul's emotion, where he does not enjoy his predicament. Alternatively, it could be about the book he is writing. The book was not so much horrific as it was suspenseful - such as when Annie was going to amputate his limbs, or when the reader and Paul simultaneously realize that Annie found out about Misery's death. It is because of this book's carefully crafted and balanced suspense and writing, I recommend this book to others and have become an avid reader of novels by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I usually don't read Stephen king book till a friend told me how good they were.

Not to be misconstrued as any sort of dislike for the novel, on the contrary, King did such a good job of making me feel uncomfortable with his character's predicament that I experienced an actual physical feeling of relief to be done with it.Overall, Misery is a very well-written novel that is not a horror in the traditional sense (no supernatural creatures or spooky things to give you the creepy-crawlies or make you jump,) but remains one of the most horrific novels that King has written. The setting, situation and characters all meld together perfectly in a scenario that is hard to call unbelievable or impossible and that feeling just adds to the creepiness of the circumstances.I did have a few problems here and there with the novel, such as*****SPOILER*****Paul's lack of any attempt to wean himself off of the Novril, although he plans on doing it several times. Having never been hooked on an addictive drug myself, I guess I don't truly know how difficult this would be, but I thought that he could have at least tried. Also, I could have done with a little less of the novel that he was writing as when I was reading these sections, I just wanted to get back to the main storyline.*****END SPOILER*****Otherwise, this is a very solid offering by King that, while I wouldn't say that I totally \\"enjoyed\\", is a really good novel."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This was the first Stephen King novel I read, and it is one o the best I've read so far (15).

Usually when I read one of his novels, I'm disappointed with the levels of sex and swearwords that replace the horror associated with the name Steven King.In Misery, Paul Sheldon, the protagonist, had a passionate fear of Annie Wilkes, the antagonist, and aside from the physical damage she caused him, the psychological damage was far worse, and more captivating for the reader. The mood of seclusion was felt due to the fact that, for most of the story, there were only two characters. Out there in the wilderness, anyone could get away with murder, and no one would know. Although Paul feared for his life, he also burned with a greater passion; to resurrect his romance novel heroine, Misery. Sure, Annie cut off Paul's foot and thumb, but she also reanimated Paul's desire to write. In fact, the need to complete this novel was the only thing keeping him from making an actual attempt at escaping. These conflicts of interest, life and freedom versus once again having creative genius, make the book intriguing and hard to put down; as Paul would say, the gotta.I definitely recommend this novel because the constant fear of a psychopathic ex-nurse who likes to use an axe, an electric knife, and a riding mower to get her way demanded my full attention. I also like the hallucinated ending Paul makes up for himself. At that point, I did put the book down because it was a little too creepy then. I had become so involved in the lives of these fictional people that I could feel Annie in my room too. The book was a little more realistic for me because I live in Colorado and have lived in Boulder. The story takes place in the mountains right around that area and the factual parts of the book, like names and locations, were familiar to me, which made the book seem more real. Once again, Steven King's Misery is a (horroribly) good book that hooks the reader and never lets go until the end.(I would have given it 6 stars if I could have; it was just that good!)"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The story is simple, as is the idea: bestselling novelist gets rescued by his number one fun - a freak, mentally disturbed, can't live without her favorite author anymore, helds him prisoner, he can't flee because his legs are broken ... There is more. With intriguing psychology Stephen King tells the story of a man, captured in his worst nightmare. He has lost his freedom, but with the book going on, one finds out that there is much more to loose than that. There is dign&iacute;ty and self-respect for one thing. But there also is the manuscript of maybe the best book you've ever accomplished to write, or your foot. There sure is life, but after you lost the things mentioned before, lost them maybe forever, because there is no hope of rescue, that does not sound like a threat any more. But what about losing your mind - especially if it is not you who is loosing it, but the person you depend on, because you almost died in a near to fatal car accident, can't move, can't do nothing without somebody helping you - and this somebody's the one who loses her mind. Step for step. Day for day. No help in sight. You are bound to a bed, later to a wheelchair, because that person - your #1 fan - forces you to bring back to life a person you killed ... And what if that person who's literally nuts, is not only cruel and mean - not only CROSS - but a murderer and you depend on her, are locked up into one little house together with this person, secluded from all civilization, isolated from all possible help. It's winter, the snow's falling hard, the roads are closed, no chance there's somebody coming out there. With rare talent and writing skills Stephen King describes both the prisoner and his guard, taking the reader deep into the minds of both persons, which are so intense, especially the author's tormentor, that you get afraid of her. King lets express her character through her freakish words and her brutal but deranged actions and draws the picture of a very real and very threatening character which makes your flesh creep and your blood run cold. You even start to feel disgust and hatred for that character who is capable of unthinkable cruelty. Read during winter while at your hunting cabin in the woods, miles from other homes or possible help - read and you will start to loose ...A fantastic read."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephan King is one of the world's best, if not the best, writers. His characters seem real, and his plots are engaging.

But Annie hasn't finished Paul's latest book, and when she does and finds that he has killed her favorite character, she decideds to hold him prisoner until he brings Misery back to life. As you can see the title is ambiguous. She has many ways to keep Paul writting, but I won't go into that now.Anyone who says King isn't a good writer, just take a look at the metahor of the red bird. C'mon, loosen up, that's pretty good right there.Read this book as soon as you can, but if you have a weak stomach skip the axe part. You might make a cookadoodie mess trying not to vomit on the floor."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I am a rather indifferent fan of Stephen King. I have found that when he is writing good, there are few writers better, but his career, like a good roller coaster has it's ups &amp; downs...some books are truly great, while others are pure drivel...but that is NOT the case with 'Misery'. Easily one of King's most wildly entertaining novels (and one of the few that do not take place in Maine) this story takes you on the journey of just how far one twisted 'Fan' can go given the right circumstances.Paul Sheldon is an author...a very successful author of a series of novels featuring the character of Misery Chastaine. These books have launched Paul's career, but he is ready to branch out and enter another arena of writing...an area that has no room for Misery. On his way from a Hotel in Colorado after finishing his latest manuscript, Paul has an unfortunate accident on an icy road and crashes so far down an embankment that nobody can see him...except for the one person who acts as both his savior and his worst nightmare in one: Annie.On the surface, Annie seems the nicest person Paul could ever meet...oh, and she is also the WORLD'S #1 Misery Fan. She just cannot believe her luck when she (a nurse) witnesses an accident and when she goes to help, finds out that her all-time favorite author is in the drivers seat. She takes him home, and slowly begins to nurse him back to health. Annie shows a little of how odd she is to Paul, but how can he argue? He would have died if not for her saving his life. But as this riviting story continues, the next Misery novel is released and Annie rushes to the store to buy it on the first day of its release.Paul is making a slow recovery from his wounds, and Annie refuses to take him to the hospital, believing that he couldn't receive any better treatment than she could provide for him personally, and so without the ability to argue, Paul stays in bed while Annie reads the latest Misery installment...but as she nears the end she finds out that Paul has decided to end the series -- by killing off Misery. Now keep in mind that Annie has a connection to this fictinal character that goes way beyond the strange and weird. She takes out her anger on Paul, forcing him to start writing a NEW Misery novel which resurrects the character...B-U-U-T it must be written in a way that makes sense...at least to Annie, and her standards are pretty high indeed. This is where the novel really takes off like a drag race on steroids. Paul is faced with a horrible situation, not able to even get out of bed by himself, and literally forced to write a book against his will, and most difficult of all, he has Annie as his editor...an editor who rewards success with another day without the saw and torch being used to remove and cauterize certain body parts. This is definitely King writing at his all-time best, and in my opinion, is far and away his most incredibly entertaining novel to date. Now if you are looking to be frightened, I don't think this is the novel for you. But if you enjoy an amazingly original story told with a full dose of adrenaline, 'Misery' is definitely the book for you. The movie version was okay at best, but left out several explicit torture scenes that were detailed enough to take your breath away, so keep that in mind before you crack the pages of this fantastic thriller. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is an excellent book.I was kinda freaked out by Annie Wilkes overly obsesive tendanices, but that is what made the book so great. It keeps you on the edge of your seat because you wander what kind of torture Annie will evoke on Paul Sheldon next and you wander if the poor guy will ever escape from the clutches of this madwoman.It is one of the best books I ever read by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Once I began reading this book, I was glued to it. This fast-paced, exhilarating story of a man caught in the ultimate nightmare keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Paul Sheldon, a famous writer, is kidnapped in a tiny, isolated town. Physically unable to leave the kidnapper's house, Paul is trapped, and it is a race against time to escape the kidnapper's grasp. Stephen King does a terrific job giving tons of details on the characters. You will find out that Annie Wilkes, the kidnapper, is a monster. As I read this book, I got chills up my back when Annie was torturing Paul. The writing is so vivid that you get very detailed pictures in your mind. It is like you are watching a movie. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense. Once you start reading this story, you will not be able to put it down until you read the last sentence. I will not spoil the ending for you by telling you how the story ends, so you will just have to read it. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"If you are not married, stop everything and just read this book before you decide. 'MISERY' will give you the insight to human nature. You will be able to tell whether your girl-friend is carzy or not. You know, being crazy is not an extraordinary thing.

What an Annie my ex-girlfriend was!!!!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"In my opinion, and I am sure that many will agree with me, this book was actually much better than the movie. During the book, he (Paul Sheldon) is alot more outspoken about his feelings. There were scenes in the book that were not included in the movie, and probably for good reason too. Like the scene of downing the Novril with the rinse water.If you have seen the movie, read the book. If you have not seen the movie, read the book.

It is almost 400 pages, and the first time I saw this book, I didn't really interested in it because it is long. But after I read a couple of chapters, I started to like it, specially in the middle of the book when the main character tried to escape from the house before the phycho woman came back. If she caught him trying to escape, she would punished him. Her punishment is unlike parents punishing their kids. She would make him feel pain. She could even cut off his leg. This woman has her own reason for doing this, but I don't understand her reason, but who can understand a psychotic's motives? I don't think so unless you are phycho, too. Anyway, I recommend this book for those of you who are looking for new books to read. It is good. Try it!!!!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Undeniably in my opinion, another one of King's great triumphs in a long list.

The man can start with a single idea and create an intricate, absorbing novel practically out of thin air. This novel had special meaning for me because, as an aspiring writer (I'm a college student), I can easily identify--on a metaphorical level--with the suffering of the main character, Paul Sheldon. I agree whole-heartedly with the reader who said that this book is an allegory for the creative process--an allegory with a fantastic suspense-thriller woven brilliantly around it. I now sometimes ask myself &quot;Can you?&quot; when I'm blocked.

I love the book misery and i love the writer Stephen King. thank you Alair"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I absolutely loved the cat and mouse aspect of this novel, and the frights and gore, and the suspense. But getting through this book was an enormous chore due to the fact that the author insisted on including many, many excerpts of the romance novel that character Paul Sheldon is typing while confined in Annie's home.Unfortunately, Stephen King made a colossal mistake in this book which, had he not done so, would have probably made this novel one of the greatest horror books ever. He includes many portions of another story, one that Paul is being forced to write. And to add to the distraction, Paul's typewriter doesn't provide the letter n, or drops letters sometimes, and you, Dear Reader, are stuck with having to figure out certain words that are missing letters. This concept also distracts horribly from the world of Annie Wilkes because you must now give your attention to a romance novel in progress (in a different and annoying font than the rest of the book). King shifts back and forth endlessly between the gripping, dire horror story taking place, and the godawful typewritten romance. It all becomes incredibly tedious so quickly. You may find yourself skipping entire paragraphs or pages to avoid this nonsense and to get on with the story of Paul versus Annie.Even if King supposedly had some good reason for this trick, the technique is so jarring and annoying that it ruins the flow of the story, and the reading experience, entirely. You would think his publishers or wife or someone would have suggested to leave out the romance parts.I'd have loved \\"Misery\\" so much more without all that stuff strewn throughout it. And when I reread it again, I will be ignoring those typewritten segments."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book is amazing! From the first pages in which Paul's life in almost ended by a car accident, to the very last pages with Annie Wilkes haunting Paul's life from beyond the grave, you are captivated by this remarkable piece of work in which Stephen King delivers one of his best performances in his whole career. King describes so delicately what exactly is going on in Paul Sheldon's life during the time he is kept prisoner by his &quot;#1 fan&quot;, Annie Wilkes. You really understand the different emotions going through Paul's mind: Paranoia, fear, anger, depression, and of course, pain. The way Annie's part is written just amazes. It almost seems like King would have had to be around someone like Annie because of the way Annie Wilkes acts. She has several personalities. She has the #1 fan, the brutally-mean when agitated, and the normal (though not really) part. I really don't know what else to say besides what I have already said about this book. It's quite a remarkable book because it's just so amazing. You must read this and definitely see the movie which won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Kathy Bates who plays of course, Annie Wilkes."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"After watching this movie, I found the book to be much more detailed and gruesome. King is the master at freaking people out! The reader really feels what Paul is going through...poor guy just wanted to celebrate finishing his first non-Misery novel and what does he get? Several months in Annie Wilkes State Mental Ward. She has to be the craziest character I've ever met in a book. I love how King makes her go from completely normal to all-out loon in 5 seconds flat. What a temper! I had to put the book down a few times because I kept cringing at what she does to Paul...the blow torch sent me over the edge!! Although I knew what was going to happen, I found myself still anxiously awaiting for Annie to get what she deserved, and the book really made it vivid. I kept hoping Paul would have his moment, and King did not disappoint. Definitely worth the read if you're into suspense and horror. The only thing that I didn't care for were the excerpts from the Misery novel...you can skip them and it won't affect the actual story line."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is Stephen King's complaint book. It basically whines about the pains of being an author, which is quite apparent if you see through the horror story of Annie Wilkes, the maternal yet homocidal woman whose originalized and specific insanity makes the book unforgettably haunting.But I love it.It's one of his best and there's nothing like it. If you're an aspiring writer like I am, don't take the whining too seriously. But at least you'll get a bigger picture of the bad points about being an author.This is a fantastic read and I recommend it to everyone. Except, don't take it too seriously. It's not his most serious novel... it's short and he wrote it in a short time. Also, the plot is simple and its meaning is easily seen. Not that it's not disturbing; it is."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This was my first Stephen King book, and I'm not sure if this was one of his better ones or one of the worst.

I think in the future I'll read some more Stephen King books."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"It is a very good book. King is leaving his regular style of dealing with para-normal phenomenon, and start dealing with the most normal, and yet most para-normal thing: the Human soul. More than it is a horror book, it is a thriller, and a very good one. You feel the sweat dripping down your neck and your breathe getting faster when the hero is in tension and fear (and there are many moments like this.). This is a story about a situation that we wouldn't like to find ourselves in, and that's why I personally symphatyzed the hero, it is the story of the human soul in its struggle to survive and in the depthes of madness."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The movie was nothing compared to this!

He has killed off Misery in the final book &quot;Misery's child.&quot; While driving, he ends up in a car accident, but by coicidence, he is rescued by his #1 fan, Annie Wilkes, a former nurse. She takes him to her house, splints his mangled legs, and slowly nurses him back to health.However, when she finishes reading &quot;Misery's child&quot;, only to find out that he has killed Misery off, he discovers that he is trapped with a madwoman who is more dangerous than Jack the Ripper and Son of Sam combined.Soon, Annie comes up with an idea. Paul is going to write one last Misery book, just for her. Paul has no choice, because when he doesn't do what he is told, Annie's dangerous side comes out, and she does things that can make scream and beg for his life..."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Sheldon is forced to write during his stay with Annie and becomes convinced that he will be killed, not simply tortured, if he does not perform this action exactly to Annie's specifications. These specifications are symbolic of what Sheldon believes the majority of readers wish from his works, the main difference is that Annie is in complete control to enforce her will on Paul. This will forces the writing in a direction not completely agreeable to the author. This may be symbolic of how readers can enforce their will upon a popular writer as the author's novels depend upon this reception. The unpublished novel that Paul brings with him to Annie's house is Fast Cars, a story that he believes is of Pulitzer Prize quality. He also believes that while this work is of this quality, its popular reception will be lukewarm. This work is poorly received by its first reviewer, Annie, who responds by burning it. Instead Annie forces Paul to revive his Misery series to produce Misery's Return. The Misery series is essentially written for mass entertainment as King's works are and Annie is extremely appreciative of the return of Misery. This is an extreme but easily understood example of how an author who has gained the title of \\"popular\\" has difficulties in shedding this stigma. The value of an extremely loyal fan base is difficult to compromise. The reader gains an insight into why and how a writer of King's type is able to write his novels. Paul makes it quite clear that his writing gifts were in no way a result of his doings. He repeatedly points out that from a very young age he had a very \\"strong imagination.\\" As in King and Paul's case this gift may not have been matched with the best possible public figure. The creation of Annie's novel also illustrates how even with their gifts novelists struggle with the problems of satisfying the needs of logic and reality, even in a world where supernatural forces exist. Through these issues the public can gain an insight to the thoughts of King on writing. In Misery a writer is forced into an extreme relationship with one of his readers. While it is unlikely that any writer will ever have to experience an ordeal like Paul's, it is symbolic of how writers may become reliant on their readers, even if it is not a life or death matter, but instead a question of successfulness. Misery also gives explanations to why King is so immensely popular and a view of the man behind the books. Ultimately, Paul decides not to actually burn his book that Annie forced him to create. This demonstrates that writers like Paul and King must and do accept their popular writings despite their critical shortcomings. Being the king of contemporary writing is, after all, far from misery. It is a great position to obtain even if inescapable typecasting and expectations accompany it."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is another great book by King!THE PLOT: Paul Sheldon is a bestselling author who is famous for his \\"Misery\\" book series.One day, Paul has quite a car crash and falls into a coma.

Hats off to King for another great novel. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"\\"umber whunnnnyerrrnnn umber whunnnnfayunnnnThese sounds: even in the haze.\\"This is the mysterious first \\"chapter\\" of Stephen King's amazing bestseller, Misery. It tells the tale of a man named Paul Sheldon, creator of Misery, a four-book clich&eacute;d Harlequin series. He is a very successful writer who, ironically, hates his best-selling Misery series. So, he decides to kill off Misery Chastain, the main character of the Misery novels.After this, he decides to start writing other things. His most recent manuscript after Misery is called Fast Cars. But one night, right after finishing the first draft of Fast Cars, he breaks both his legs in an automobile accident. The next thing he knows, he is lying in a bed in a woman named Annie Wilkes's house. It comes into his knowledge that she is his \\"number one fan\\". This isn't anything out of the ordinary; a lot of people sign their letters to him as his \\"number one fan\\". But when Wilkes goes ballistic after she finds out that Misery has been killed off, he finds out that this is no ordinary woman.This is the story of Paul Sheldon, as told by Stephen King. In this tale dubbed by the Boston Globe as \\"full of twists and turns and mounting suspense\\", strange things occur in this little nowhere house in the Middle of Nowhere, Colorado. Annie Wilkes takes advantage of his crippled state, threatening him with all sorts of different awful implements of torture, that she will use on him if she doesn't write a new Misery novel, just for her. This novel is to be named \\"Misery's Return\\", and must bring Misery back to life, but in Wilkes's words, without cheating.This is definitely one of King's better works, which I was able to finish in essentially less than a day. I was completely hooked on this book, only being able to set it down for an hour at a time at most. Among the many unforgettable things in this book is the \\"Annie Wilkes Lexicon\\", which is what Sheldon dubs her often hilarious way of \\"swearing\\", such as calling \\"bad\\" people \\"dirty birdies\\", as well as calling objects \\"cockadoodie\\" and \\"oogy\\". Misery shows you exactly the strain and struggle Sheldon goes through to write the new Misery's Return, without invoking the wrath of Annie.Of course, sometimes this doesn't work too well. Annie has plenty of methods of bringing inspiration to him. First it's burning his one and only manuscript of Fast Cars, next, a hypodermic needle, and even a gruesome scene in which she attacks him with an axe. As much as I loved this book, it is definitely not for the people who cannot take King's... err...rather more colorful than average descriptions.Be forewarned that the plot involves a lot of emotional and physical trauma, as Sheldon recuperates from the car accident, plus the many beatings he must sustain from Annie Wilkes. It also involves a lot of swearing, although not as much as most King stories, and an Annie-inflicted dope addiction that drives Sheldon to sometimes-insane lengths. And the gruesome descriptions of the bloody tortures that Annie inflicts on anybody who makes her mad, because, as she puts it, she is not herself when she's angry.I may not like most stories with only one main character, a few examples of this kind of writing would be \\"Hatchet\\", by Gary Paulsen, or even the Horror Master himself's very own \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\", which I hated. This, somehow, was different. He was not being tormented by something unseen, although you could definitely say that. He was being tormented by something REAL. The whole thing was REAL. The book was REAL. That's what I liked about Misery. This book compared to even The Stand (although I have yet to read a novel that surpasses THAT, even Misery wasn't that good).This novel was critically acclaimed by such papers and newsgroups as the Boston Globe, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Seattle Times, the Houston Chronicle, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly, as one of the best King books ever to be written. I honestly couldn't put it down. The analogies in the book are excellent, as Sheldon starts thinking of himself as a modern-day Scheherazade, story-telling (excuse me, story-WRITING) for his life. Five stars (and if it was out of 10, I would give it a 10 out of 10). Highly, highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I will say this first; I am not an avid Stephen King reader. In fact this is the first Stephen King novel I have ever read. I've never found books to be scary and thus found myself turned off to the idea of horror fiction. I know that King has been lauded as the master of horror and so I guess I figured if I ever were to find myself frightened by a novel it would surely come from him, but since I'm not really interested in tales of the paranormal kind I've avoided his books up until now. Now I've loved the film \`Misery' for some time now and with the recent release of the special edition DVD I've been thinking a lot more of it so I decided to search out the novel and give it a go. What I found was far more disturbing and haunting then I had initially anticipated. The movie in all respects it horrific and brilliantly done, but this novel is leagues above it, even more terrifying and will surely bring chills to the very depths of your soul.There are scenes within this novel that will outright horrify you.Paul Sheldon is a famous writer who has been made famous by his character Misery, a young girl who has stolen the hearts of Sheldon's devoted readers. Misery has also stolen the life right out from Paul. He loathes her and longs to be free of her hold on him and so he kills her. This decision could not have come at a worse time.The novel opens with Paul in the care of his number one fan Annie Wilkes. She's eccentric, neurotic and quite frankly, insane. Paul had been in a car wreck while driving home from finishing his latest novel, a departure, drastic departure from his Misery series. Annie happened to find him trapped beneath his car on the side of the road and took it upon herself to rescue him. Upon realizing who he was, her all time favorite writer in the world, she took it upon herself to hold him hostage. When crazy Annie finds out what Paul has done to her beloved Misery she takes matters into her own hands to resurrect her from the dead. What follows is one of the most bone chilling accounts ever put to paper.Some have claimed that Annie Wilkes is King's most terrifying villain and while I have not read any of his other novels to compare I can honestly say that she scared me to death. While reading this novel (purposely at night while my wife and child slept in order to get the optimum scare capacity) I found myself checking the hallways, staring at my bedroom door as if to find someone standing there, shaking as I read and many other symptoms of fear that I'm not too used to.When you think about the concept surrounding \`Misery' and the situation that is presented it truly is one of the scariest situations one could find themselves. Your legs are shattered, your body is in excruciating pain, you're addicted to pain killers that only Annie can supply, you're bed ridden and completely dependant on a woman who locks you in your room and withholds medicine you need and resorts to removing you're limbs as punishment for making her angry. Quite honestly you know you have no hope of survival. She is going to kill you and there is really nothing you can do about it. She's crazy and she loves you and she'll never let you go.If you are a fan of the film (who isn't) then you must read this novel for it will push you further than the film had and take you somewhere (as demented as it is) every fan of this genre needs to go. I for one will definitely read more from this master of horror for his writing style is addictive and his descriptive manner so effective the reader will easily find the hole within the paper and fall right in.If you want to get scared then this is the novel for you."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Yes the movie was awesome.

I first read this book in 1989 and it was an absolute page-turner from the very beginning. As the story unfolded we found out about a writer in serious pain after crashing his car somewhere in Colorado, a nurse who took him in who seemed quite competent except for one thing-it soon became very obvious that she was absolutely crazy. So good was King's description of his wounded writer-held-prisoner that I as a reader almost began to feel what he was feeling. I had to keep putting the book down and reminding myself that this was &quot;just a story.&quot;This one is terror and suspense all the way and the many detours the story takes en-route to its dramatic conclusion only add to the already richly engossing tale it is.

The physical copy has a different font for the Misery Chastain chapters with the Ns, and eventually Es and Ts (I think) filled in by hand.Not only does the Kindle version not reflect this even with mini pictures (booooo!), it is a horrid amalgamation of typos. The handwritten N becomes \\"n.\\" or \\"r.\\". \\"Misery\\" for some reason becomes \\"Miser\\". Brings a whole different meaning to the book, don't it?

We join Paul Sheldon, a famous yet bull-headed author, who recently finished his newest novel, Fast Cars. He wakes up in an unfamiliar house, to faintly recall that he was in a disastrous car crash, and learn his legs have been utterly demolished. Luckily, a driver saw his camero overturned off the side of the road and took him to their home. It also just so happens that this chance driver is a retired nurse, and has a good idea of how to bring him back to health. This chance driver, however is Annie Wilkes, a hermit, a recluse, and a bit on the crazy side. Paul is rendered immobile in the snowy mountains of Colorado, miles away from home. This story captures the heart of the reader by connecting with Paul and tapping into his thoughts and feelings. King asserts himself into the top percentile of horror writers yet again. This novel will stand its ground when compared King's greats, such as The Shining, Cujio, and It. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book contains every element you could possibly desire.

In Misery, there's no need to try and suspend disbelief as the story seems so plausibly horrifying. The difference between the way Annie sees herself and the way the rest of us (and Paul Sheldon) see her is as wide as the Grand Canyon, and that's what makes this story so scary. Annie can (and does) do anything to Paul while he's held prisoner in her bedroom.Brilliantly written, truly scary. I only wish I would have written it!Poisoned Soil"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is one of my favorite works by Stephen King. It is nice to take a break from the science fiction books he writes so often. It is haunting and it keeps coming back to me in my head. It reminds me of a book by Cole Raptor, A Father's Instinct, that I just couldn't get out of my head either. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"In these days of films like Saw and Hostel, it's hard to imagine that a book which is decades old might elicit the same emotional, mental, and even physical response as these films -- and yet, this does it. But classifying Misery as simply some literary form of torture-porn is as dismissive as calling any work of art pornographic because one finds it offensive. This book is much, much more than that.Most of us know the story -- I even remember bits and pieces of the film from when I was younger (still, no spoilers here): Paul Sheldon is a successful author of a hokey romance series (centered around an eponymous female character) who aspires to be recognized for \\"real\\" literary contributions. After finishing a \\"real\\" novel, Paul suffers a car accident and is \\"rescued\\" by Annie, a former nurse and the #1 fan of Paul's Misery series. Fortuitous day! Except, that Annie is a frighteningly unstable psychotic with a brutal sadistic streak who \\"encourages\\" Paul to write a new Misery book, just for her. Paul, like the reader, realizes very early on in the story that his stay is less than voluntary, as we become like Paul: trapped in Annie's guest room and subject to her increasingly heinous whims.But what propels Misery beyond the realm of just torture-porn is more than King's writing. There is no denying it: King is a master storyteller, a complete craftsman, perhaps one of the best in American fiction. His ability to delve into the incredibly rich nooks and crannies of set and setting are consummate. But more than that are the extended metaphors at play here. Misery is a comment on the writing process itself, with Paul leaking out profound realizations as he finds himself a modern-day Scheherazade -- not just to Annie, but also to himself. Annie, as disturbingly unbelievable as it seems, is more than just Paul's captor: she is his muse.And that's the scariest part of the whole thing. Make no mistake, Misery is full of extremely graphic, disturbing scenes of violence and anguish. But the violence should be nothing new to readers of King, or citizens with access to media; the real horror here, like in most of King's novels, lies not in the violence or the supernatural, but the dark depths of the very real human psyche.Having said that, Misery is not, in my opinion, King's best work (The Shining). Nor his most disturbing (Pet Sematary). It is however, another painfully addictive example of why King deserves to be lauded as a modern master of horror fiction."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I'm suffering through this. It's torture. Throughout the book Paul is a victim. When he does something smart, she finds out and punishes him (like cutting off body parts). Too many atrocious acts. Too much helplessness. Paul learns that she killed many people and got away with it. She tells Paul of her plans to kill others and how she will get away with that. He believes her. This adds to Paul's feeling of helplessness. She is strong, cunning, and crazy.I prefer stories where the protagonist takes action to influence his future. I want entertainment or some kind of feel good. Technically there was a good ending for the good guy, but it did not feel good. I was depressed.It's told in third person, but only Paul's point of view, never Annie's.THE POSITIVES:I have a favorite part (believe it or not) due to the author's clever wording. Annie leaves Paul locked in a room for 51 hours with no food, water, or pain medication. Paul's thoughts: \\" Around 4 o'clock of the second day \\"Pretty Thirsty\\" made it's move\\" (a few thoughts later) \\"thinking unconsciousness would come and relieve him, but unconsciousness declined. Instead hour thirty came and hour forty. Now \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Pretty Thirsty\\" merged into one single horse. \\"I Got the Hungries\\" had been left in the dust long since, and he began to feel like nothing more than a slice of living tissue on a microscope slide or a worm on a hook, something anyway, twisting endlessly and waiting only to die.\\"Annie forces Paul to write a romance novel \\"Misery's Return\\" while he is captive. The main reason Annie keeps Paul alive is to see what will happen in the novel. The heroine Misery died in the previous published book. Annie forces Paul to come up with a believable way to have her alive in this book. I liked what he came up with. A handful of other scenes from \\"Misery's Return\\" are shown. They were not interesting to me and could have been shortened. But I liked seeing the author's thought process as he came up with ideas to put into the novel. He talked about \\"the guys in the sweatshop\\" (giving him ideas) and seeing a hole in the paper (to begin writing).The narrator Lindsay Crouse was good.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.

But the high marks from Amazon reviewers swayed me to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.Misery seemed to be an uneven title for the lady in the series of popular books that the character Paul Sheldon was writing, but an excellent title for the horror that that he endures when his car crashes and he ends up in the hands of ex-nurse psycho Annie Wilkes. I have to say this novel was very captivating. The drama built in expert intelligent fashion. Towards the end I found I was afraid to read it after the sun went down. I wish the book within the book, \\"Misery's Return\\" didn't bog down the book like it did for this reader, but the rest of the novel is top notch.

Annie Wilkes is a huge ex-nurse, handy with controlled substances and other instruments of torture, including and axe and a blowtorch and an electric knife. She thinks it's unfair that her favorite character in the world Misery Chastain has been killed by her creator Paul Sheldon. This is not good, Annie can get mad ...really mad.

While I was enduring a drought of reading, I picked up Misery, and I wasn't able to put it down until I found out what happened to Paul Sheldon.King's writing abilities are under-rated, and his adept ability to weave a story should not go unrecognized. Misery is no exception; the novel provides an interesting story and interesting characters that are real. Unlike many stories, novels, and books, the reader can relate to both protagonist and antagonist - a skill only a few have mastered.

Towards the end of the book, Anne says that one of the men she killed was a artist making drawings of the Overlook Hotel, which was burned down ten years before by it's caretaking.

So I decided to pick it up and read it again, to see if I would like it as well now that I am an adult.In short, I did. Claustrophobia and medical issues top my list of fears, so this novel of being trapped in a crazy ex-nurse's house with broken legs and codeine addiction grabbed me right away. Paul Sheldon is as dependent on Annie Wilkes as he is threatened by her, since as well as administering violent \\"punishments,\\" she is dispensing the magic capsules that keep his pain at bay. She is the one who pulled him out of his battered car and brought him back from the brink of death: to keep him in her home, her favorite writer, her pet writer. Without her dubious rescue he _would_ have died-- and later wishes he had. But it is when she reads Sheldon's latest (and what was supposed to be the last) _Misery_ novel that her insanity truly reveals itself. He had killed Misery, and she was going to make him bring her back to life in _Misery's Return_, a strange and tortuous novel-within-a-novel.Some of my favorite descriptions dealt with the writing process (of \\"finding the hole in the paper\\"), and also realistic portrayal of the excruciating pain Paul was going through. Upon re-reading, I thought about King's own somewhat-recent accident on a mountain road, when he was struck by a car and his legs were broken. Did he think about _Misery_ then?

Great Job Stephen King!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"There is one big problem with Stephen King: he interrupts my life. What I mean to say is that once I start reading one of his books, I can't stop. Nothing gets done around the house, I have less time with my wife and children, the dog doesn't get walked, and you can forget about the stack of papers I brought home from the office to review over the weekend.This is exactly what happened when, on a Friday night, I decided I needed something easy to read, a page-turner, a plain old story-in short, something by Stephen King, the modern American master of the ripping yarn, replete with its baggage of cultural references no one will be able to decode a hundred years from now and deficient only if you cannot abide horror or terror or the macabre. Once I started \\"Misery,\\" I didn't put it down until I was finished, and I loved every reading minute of it.\\"Misery\\" is not one of King's typical horror stories, that is, it does not require \\"the willing suspension of disbelief\\" that is needed when you read about telekinetic powers (\\"Carrie\\" or \\"Firestarter\\"), monsters from sewers (\\"It\\"), vampires (\\"Salem's Lot\\"), or any one of King's many other supernatural or unnatural characters (a very long list of King's books). \\"Misery\\" is, instead, one of King's stories that, while extreme and terrifying, is also realistically possible. It is one of his better books, written during a time when he wrote a string of similar, realistic horror stories that I consider among his best, including \\"Dolores Claiborne,\\" \\"Gerald's Game\\" and \\"Rose Madder.\\"The plot is straightforward. Paul Sheldon is a popular author known for his series of novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Sheldon finally kills off Misery, thereby ridding him, once and for all, of the pulpy best selling series and allowing him to move on, living off the royalties, to write more highbrow literary novels. Sheldon has, in fact, just finished writing such a novel and is driving home, manuscript in tow (the only copy, in fact), when he drives off a road in the wilds of Colorado during a blinding snowstorm. He is severely injured and, under less fortunate circumstances, his car probably would have been buried in snow and he would have died of exposure. Instead, he has the blessed fortune to be found by Annie Wilkes, one of his most devoted fans, an avid admirer of the Misery Chastain novels, and a reclusive-and deadly-psychopath.Annie, a nurse by training, takes the author to her home, where she holds him captive for several months while he resurrects Misery Chastain, writing a new novel in the series for Annie Wilkes's private enjoyment. The Babylonian Captivity pales in comparison to the mental and physical tortures that author Paul Sheldon endures, and King keeps the reader turning the pages, wondering what cruel or grisly event will follow one of Annie's many mood changes. It is vintage Stephen King, one of his better efforts, a book that I highly recommend if you're a King fan and, if your not, a good place to get some insight into King's imagination and skill as a story teller. It is also an interesting book for many other reasons, not the least of which are the way in which the plot of his novel is a kind of horror-writer's take on the relationship between author and editor, as well as between author and reader (Annie Wilkes, his mentally deranged, sadistic fan becoming not only his reader, but also his editor-in-captivity), the way in which an author who may have more serious literary aspirations can become captive to a reading public that becomes enthralled with his commercially-motivated work, and the way in which \\"Misery,\\" as well as several other works written around this same period, embody things going on in King's own life (see, in this regard, his autobiographical piece in his book, \\"On Writing\\").While \\"Misery\\" may not be a great work of literature by highbrow standards, it is a great piece of storytelling by an author who is, perhaps, America's foremost popular, contemporary storyteller. For that reason, if no other, it's worth putting everything aside for awhile and just reading."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I was looking so forward to reading Misery by Stephen King. Having heard that it was one of his better novels, I anticipated the novel to rank high on my list of all time great King books. Boy was I surprised. The novel doesn't really take off at any point, and kind of drags on and on and on. Paul Sheldon is nothing compared to the writer heriones King created in most of his novels. For example, Jack Torrance in The Shining and Mike Noonan in Bag of Bones, are great characters, while Paul just meanders aroun (not literally of course)and doesn't interest us at all. Therfore, when Annie begins to torture him, we could really care less. The end of the novel is very scary, I will give King that, I did indeed have goosebumps on my flesh with the final encounter, or the second final encounter I guess you could say. Overall though, Misery falls short, and when you're done reading it, you realize the only misery you've experienced, is your feelings about this book. Oh well, one bad book out of thirty, not to shabby."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Misery is a novel that has a writer as its protagonist. Thus, many of the insights provided in the novel are related to the profession of writing. Over the course of the novel the writer, a fictional character named Paul Sheldon, creates a novel under the most extreme circumstances. In Misery, the reader is able to witness the writing process in all its stages, the interplay between forces in the creation of the book and the processes that occur in the author's mind. This window into the writing process is particularly significant due to whom these insights are coming from, Stephen King. Many criticize King's works, yet this is partly a result of their immense popularity and the reasons behind this popularity. One indisputable fact looms over all considerations of King's works; he is the best-selling non-religious or non-governmental writer ever. King has done this by filling a very popular niche in popular tastes. He fills this niche is the production of a modest sized library of novels with a majority of them in the horror genre. A large number of these books follow a pattern of pitting a group of imperfect yet generally \\"good\\" people against an \\"evil\\" entity usually of the supernatural variety. While this succeeds in providing entertaining reading for King's immense fan base, it has led many critics to disregard his works as inconsequential as they do not deliver any recognizable insight or message on life, which have been accepted as a sign of high grade literature. Thus, as a book about a rabid, possessed dog that acquires a taste for human flesh may sell millions of copies; it receives absolutely no consideration for a Nobel Prize, as this has no discernable value beyond that of pure entertainment. This divergence of reaction to King's work is an issue that is dealt with in Misery, a book that is a bit removed from many of the other King novels. Misery provides a reader with an insight into King's approach to writing. For a person who is interested in this, this is a rare opportunity. While King's novels have entered popular culture to the point of Dickinsian dimensions, the person behind these novels has kept a relatively diminutive stature. This is partly the result of several health problems, including severe eyesight problems, a near fatal car accident and heavy substance abuse difficulties. Also, King sharply differentiates different spheres of celebrities. This is clearly seen in a statement taken from his official website, \\"He does not sign autographed photos-he is very uncomfortable with that concept and feels it is for movie stars, not writers.\\" The issue of the place of the writer in the popular gaze is another issue dealt with in Misery, along with the actual issues surrounding the production of his work. The writer in Misery is assumed to embody a large part of King's own writing styles and issues. As King usually infuses his works with elements from his life or surroundings, this assumption is basically tenable. Sheldon is forced to assume a relationship of extreme intimacy with one of his most religious fans, Annie Wilkes. This relationship is a perfected mechanism to demonstrate the relationship between author and reader, as it is fully independent of any interference whatsoever. It only intensifies this relationship that Sheldon is held prisoner at Wilkes's house due to his crippled post-car crash condition (eerie in light of King's similar condition more than a decade after the writing of Misery) which makes him rely on Annie as a nurse. Annie, who is an extreme psychotic and serial killer, is one of the worst people to rely on for anything, most of which a life."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Just finished and boy was I blown away!

About 100 pages into his doorstop du jour, The Dark Half, I concluded that his critics are right: life's too short and many King novels ('salami,' he called them) are much too long. Breaking up was hard to do because his short & almost flawless novel Misery had seduced me.Misery is Shaherazade with an eponymous hog and a butane torch. Misery is a number-one fanclub and the Annie Wilkes Travelers' Aide Society. Misery, above all, is Annie Wilkes with the butane torch and an axe.It was said, before Misery, that the most horrifying element of King's horror novels was the portrait of Stephen King on the dustjackets of the novels. Annie Wilkes changed that. Neither a killer Plymouth nor a Tommyknocking telekinetic prom queen, Nurse Wilkes is ultimate horror: she's someone like someone we might know. Although she wears a vampire cross in the ridiculous Kathy Bates movie, King's Annie Wilkes is human and utterly helpful, joined in mysterious union with someone like someone we might become, someone almost utterly helpless. Helplessness, not vampires or Micmac monsters or killer cars, is our deepest secret fear. Although he doesn't understand Colorado winters, Stephen King understands the horror of helplessness, a heart of darkness darker than death.Our divorce is final, but I still go back sometimes to the creative destruction of Mr. King's Blowtorch Annie or to the Apt Pupil, just to remember what might have been, two decades ago, before Salami was King."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This is Stephen King at full-tilt boogie!

This is Stephen King at one of his finest hours (for he's had more than one, unlike many, many authors who peaked and died quickly and quietly).Paul Sheldon is a sappy goth-romance novelist trying to turn over a new leaf by hitting the serious side of literature. His creation, Misery Chastain has made him famous and fairly well-off, but he had to knock her off in order to make a clean break back to the town of Self Respect. So he goes up into the mountains to finish the touches on his first real novel in a long, long while and low and behold, ends up at the bottom of a ravine when his car wrecks during a snowstorm.Enter Annie Wilkes, Paul sheldon's #1 Fan. She pulls him from the wreckage and brings him home to nurse him back to health. Only one slight problem. She's as crazy as a sh*thouse bug! And when she finds out what Paul Sheldon has done to Misery Chastain, boy is she gonna be pissed...If you have never read Stephen King, this is a great place to start.

You felt his physical pain after he had awaken from that concussion, broken legs dislocated pelvis etc. and you felt his fear and anguish being trapped in that woman's house while she was going crazy, forcing him to write another novel while in all that intense pain.You suffered his drug addiction as he was getting stoned on Novril. I will never forget that scene when he was in Annie's bathroom getting high on dope when he was not supposed to be out of his room when all of a sudden Annie drove back up.

One day Sheldon is driving through that section of rural Colorado in which The Shining was set, upbeat (and tipsy) after finishing his final Misery novel, when he is involved in an auto accident. Waking up in the home and clutches of his \\"Number One Fan!\\" a Valkyrie-bodied woman named Annie Wilkes, the injured Paul soon comes to find that the exuberant Annie is, among other things, insane in a highly idiosyncratic way. (Just the way she talks is creepy and nuts.)Misery, the actual King book, contorts through its three-hundred pages as Paul is \\"cared for\\" by Annie, while he pens a very special Misery (the character) novel just for her. Sometimes Paul wants to write, and other times Annie feels the need to motivate him to wrap up the book. Exactly how Annie undertakes these acts of inspiration---needles, blowtorches, axes---make for read-with-your-teeth-clenched moments. Realizing that his life depends on keeping Annie happy, Paul plods Scherazade-like through his manuscript, trying to buy time to make his recovery, and possibly be found by outsiders.As I said starting off, Misery is indeed a book with comedy in it, but overall Paul Sheldon's claustrophobic hell is no laughing matter, and this King page-turner from the \`80's still readily holds its own two decades later. And oh, yeah, the ending-that-isn't-an-ending actually got me for a second. A nice touch!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King did a fanastic job with this novel. I suppose I have read novels from cover to cover in one sitting before, but I don't remember doing so with a novel this large before. This novel is that good. I remember thinking, I will just see how this part plays out and then go to bed, I went to sleep four hours later. This novel has so many plot twists it scared me. I was sure Paul was managing fine, then she revealed everything she knew, and wham, Paul lost some appendages. Then I thought I had figured Annie out, and wham, she does the total opposite of what I anticipated. This novel did something only one other novel has ever done, it allowed me to feel Paul's terror, hope, and arrogance as my own terror, hope(lessness), and arrogance. I think I even trembled with fear during passages of the book. Aside from the Dark Tower Series, I feel this is the best King novel I have read.What happened. Paul broke both his legs in a car crash. Annie Wilkes rescues him. Maybe rescue is the wrong word, she prolonges his life. She nurses his recovery using her secret stash of drugs, iv's, and splints. However, she forgets to notify authorities of Paul's stay with her. Paul initially has the strength to resist her and fight for his freedom, over the next months, he loses that strength. The main problem is that Annie is mentally ill. She sees only what she wants and ignores other possibilities. This is bad for Paul. Paul's first punishment for angering her is a two day stretch without painkillers, water or food. When she thinks he lied to her, she amputates his foot. When he complains about the typewriter she makes him use, he loses a thumb. When he gets the attention of a possible rescuer, she runs over the policeman with a lawnmower.However, Annie is now fighting a lost battle, the police begin to investigate, and Paul plans his revenge.

Annie insists she is Paul's biggest fan. Paul is famous for his historical romance novels featuring a heroine named Misery Chastain.His legs are shattered in the car crash and Annie is nursing her favorite author back to health. Soon after his accident and in between a narcotic induced haze, Paul begins to realize that Annie has him hooked on the pain killers and that she is insane. He also realizes they are in the middle of nowhere and that nobody knows where he is.The house becomes a prison for Paul and he soon realizes that Annie is not planning on letting him leave until he writes a new Misery book just for her.I have plenty of unread King books sitting on my bookshelves since I have slight OCD when it comes to his books and I must collect them, even if it will take me a lifetime to read them all, especially the Dark Tower series. So what made me re-read a King book? I loved it so much the first time around. Plain and simple. I found that the second time around was better.I must also mention that the movie version of Misery is one of my favorite King book to film adaptations. I think Paul and Annie were cast perfectly. The film does differ a bit from the novel, but it was well done nonetheless.The novel really showcases Annie's lack of sanity as well as Paul's fear of her. She often 'zones out' while speaking, leaving Paul terrified and waiting for her to come back to reality.\\"Everything she said was a little strange, a little offbeat. Listening to Annie was like listening to a song played in the wrong key.\\" p.11, MiseryHere you have classic King at his best, this is a great scary story and I found myself unable to put this book down. Misery has been referred to as King's love letter to his fans.There's plenty of horror and nail biting suspense within these pages but there are also glimpses of hope for Paul. I cheered him on as he devised plans on freeing himself from Annie's clutches. The writing in the story is wonderfully descriptive and I felt like I was in the same room with Paul as I read. I wanted him to escape so badly, but I knew the odds were against him.Annie is a psychopath and you see that very early on in the book. King wastes no time beating around the bush here. I think she is one of his best villains. He does a great job at giving this wicked nurse a background story. She's also quirky, using bizarre old fashioned language, words like 'dirty birdie' and 'Mr. Man' when she's angry.There's plenty of OMG and cringe worthy moments in Misery and that is just what I have come to expect from a scary King novel.What made this book even scarier for me is that there's no supernatural forces at work here, no dark magic being used, this is plain and simply realistically terrifying. Technically speaking, in real life a crazy lunatic can hold a person hostage and torture them. I think that's what makes Annie so scary, it seems like someone could really do what she does to Paul.If you are in the mood for a scary suspenseful story that will get under your skin and have you jumping at the slightest sound, look no further than Misery. When I was done reading this book, I wanted to turn to the first page and read it all over again."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King's \\"Misery\\" is a psychological horror that had me grimacing and saying OMG one minute, then laughing out loud like a cockadoodie lunatic the next.

He crashed his car in a snowstorm, only to have Annie Wilkes, ex-nurse turned serial killer, pull him out. When she recognized him from the back of her Misery novels, she, being his number-one fan, takes him hostage, forcing him to write a new book for her.If you're reluctant to read this because you've already seen the movie, read it anyway!

I saw the movie, thinking that it might be better (but, of course, movies are never better than books). Boy, was I wrong! The book was bad, and the movie was worse. King does not develop characters well in general, and he does a particularly poor job in &quot;Misery&quot;. In any good book, I will find myself anticipating a knowledge of the characters' fate. Not so in &quot;Misery&quot;. Within 100 pages, I had no feelings for either of the main characters. I considered it *work* to finish this book. Believe me, if you can get through this, you can get through anything."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"The main problem with this book is that you just don't care about the fates of the characters. Sure, you've got all the wham-bam gruesome action, some well-described scenes of torture, but even during these sequences where your interest should be at it's high-point, the mind tends to drift, to imagine alternate scenerios, to develop a better telling of the story itself. Every dead-end page after every drudging leaf of cheap, sanitized paper it goes on and on and on and who the hell cares in the end? Stephen King has never been a great writer, just a man with a fertile imagination and enough ability to get by with a fully created world. But, when the story lacks depth or incident--like Misery--then all that scamming and lying to conning for prestige is gone and you're left with a hack churning out yet another volume of garbage."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"True misery is reading this novel. By the time he'd written this, King had succumbed to the &quot;my every word is golden&quot; delusion, so the thing is much larger than it needed to be. After reading this because I promised a friend I'd do it (oh, what we do for pretty women)I decided that even 180 pages would've been too long.

When Anne Wilkes, the crazy housekeeper enters the room, there is a tingly feel that went down my spine. Characters like this make the book great. Stephen king made the book have a television screen in my mind's eye.Stephen King has made this book not really horrifying, but deeply, and emotionally scary, like his other #1 best seller \\"It.\\" The book just draws you in.I found this book great because I can always talk about something new, and whoever I talk to who has read the book can always find some sort of fact that the other person had picked up, while reading the book.This book was my first Stephen king book, and now I read almost all of his pieces, and eventually plan to read them all."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"To those of you who haven't read this book but have seen the movie------Carl Reiner turned Annie into a girl scout!

More disturbing and graphic than the fine film version, the violent scenes here are more repellent, altho the riding lawn mower encounter had me laughing with over the top delight. Did King go too far here? probably, but you can't fault his imagination or his wicked ability to create real characters out of the most extreme circumstances. Despite his penchant for the cheesey pop culture reference, this is still a delicious little treat that will leave you a bit drained in the end. Where else can you go after a blow torch and an electric knife? How about a romance heroine covered by killer bees? (If these are possible spoilers, I apologize. if you've read the book already, you'll know what they mean)."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Like the title suggests, this is my favorite Stephen King book. I think that both Annie and Paul are both very well described in the book. The violent scenes are very well described too. My favorite part is when she breaks Paul's feet with the sledgehammer. Oh, and the lawnmower part is hilarious!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I have to say that Steven King's novel, Misery, was the best Steven King novel I have ever read. Usually when I read one of his novels, I'm disappointed with the levels of sex and swearwords that replace the horror associated with the name Steven King.In Misery, Paul Sheldon, the protagonist, had a passionate fear of Annie Wilkes, the antagonist, and aside from the physical damage she caused him, the psychological damage was far worse, and more captivating for the reader. The mood of seclusion was felt due to the fact that, for most of the story, there were only two characters. Out there in the wilderness, anyone could get away with murder, and no one would know. Although Paul feared for his life, he also burned with a greater passion; to resurrect his romance novel heroine, Misery. Sure, Annie cut off Paul's foot and thumb, but she also reanimated Paul's desire to write. In fact, the need to complete this novel was the only thing keeping him from making an actual attempt at escaping. These conflicts of interest, life and freedom versus once again having creative genius, make the book intriguing and hard to put down; as Paul would say, the gotta.I definitely recommend this novel because the constant fear of a psychopathic ex-nurse who likes to use an axe, an electric knife, and a riding mower to get her way demanded my full attention. I also like the hallucinated ending Paul makes up for himself. At that point, I did put the book down because it was a little too creepy then. I had become so involved in the lives of these fictional people that I could feel Annie in my room too. The book was a little more realistic for me because I live in Colorado and have lived in Boulder. The story takes place in the mountains right around that area and the factual parts of the book, like names and locations, were familiar to me, which made the book seem more real. Once again, Steven King's Misery is a (horroribly) good book that hooks the reader and never lets go until the end.(I would have given it 6 stars if I could have; it was just that good!)"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"This book is SK at his best. The characters in this book have such depth and dimension, they completely take you away from your reality and envelop you in theirs.This novel was perhaps the most suspenseful I've ever read, and the ending is fantastic. If you've seen the film (also great), buy the book, too, because there are enough differences to make the book better! Go get it!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King took me into a world of torture, pain, and exiety! Annie Wilkes is a horrifing chracter that gave me chills down my spine. She seemed so real. This book is about a writer who is kept as a prisoner in his number one fan's isolated house. Her name is Annie Wilkes. SHe is a psyco that wants him to write another sequel to &quot;Misery,&quot; Annie's favorite series. If little Paulie does something wrong... she has different ways to keep him going with his writing.. a sledge hammer and such. Read this book! You won't put it down! One of King's best ever! (not recomended to children, strong use of profanity!)"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King again delivers to his readers the truely terrifying material we expect. Admittedly I was a little frustrated by the length of the novel and the gaps between momentous occasions, but it is the attention to detail which really brings this novel to life.The fact that the tension and anticipation to read more arises from the actions of a formidable person as apposed to a supernatural force intensifies the terror we share with Paul Sheldon and his mentally disturbed number one fan, Annie Wilkes.This book was an excellent read from start to finish (even though some parts dragged a little).I would say to anyone who hasn't seen the absolutely appalling film adaptation, which doesn't portray the true terror of Annie - don't bother! You MUST read this instead!"},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I loved this book. It was much scarier than his other books in the fact that it can happen in real life. Most of his other books are about things that can't happen; the supernatural, ghosts, werewolves, etc. Misery started some of his more mature style of writing; writing about the inner demons that really do, sadly and scarily, live inside some people. Misery also started King's writng about things that can happen.

But no King villain scared me more than Annie Wilkes...This book proved insanity can be more dangerous than evil itself. Evil can be reasonable, but when combined with insanity, produces a lethal cocktail...By now you know what the story is about... Let me just say that this is one that will get your heart pounding. As Paul begins to become more daring, and Annie turns more and more psychotic, you can feel the tension rising from the pages of Misery. After the lengths that you see Annie go to, you begin to believe nothing is beyond her - and nothing is."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"I'm not sure if Kathy Bates listened to this before her oscar worthy performance but it sure seems like she gained alot of insight of Annie Wilkes through Lindsay Crouse's reading.

I plan on reading a recovery period novel later.Needless to say, I was not disappointed in my choice. In fact, I found myself drawn swept up in my need to read the book and find out how much of Paul Sheldon is left at the end.The story depicts a popular author, Paul Sheldon, who has a car accident and is rescued by his \\"number- one fan,\\" Annie Wilkes. She not only cares for his shattered legs, but upon discovering that he killed her favorite character in his recently released Misery's Child and has written a non-Misery novel called Fast Cars, she becomes his moral and creative compass, pointing him back into the world of Misery.The book is torturous. Not King's writing, but what happens to Sheldon, and the wondering of what was going to happen to him next. How could it get worse? It kept me hooked in.Another facet that kept me hooked in though was the description of Sheldon's creative process as a writer. The game of \\"Can you?\\" His imagination and notes. I could feel the excitement mount as Misery's Return, Sheldon's Wilkes-inspired creation, developed and took on a life of its own. Though developed under horrific circumstances, I enjoyed the fact that King gave us a view of this writer's creative process. I found it - educational.I would definitely recommend this took to both King fans and those looking to try King out for the first time. I would also recommend it to anyone interested in a glimpse into the writing process, with a warning that the novel is pretty horrific."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"It had been many years before I reaqainted myself with Mr. King.

Needlessly to say, I was shocked and completely mesmerized by Paul Sheldon's plight as he finds himself the unwilling \\"Patient\\" of a murderous ex-nurse who also happens to be his \\"number-one\\" fan. A warning to fans of the movie---you will be shocked. The movie leaves out many details. Grusome and horrifying details. The death of the young state trooper who is investigating Paul's disappearance is one of the most shocking and horrifying scenes I have ever read in a book. Shocking because even though you know Annie isn't playing with a full deck..you either don't believe she could kill someone with such blatant disregard for human life, or that you knew and just didn't want to fess up to the reality. Not to give anything away to those who haven't read it..Paul doesn't have his ankles broken..rather one is the victim of a impromtu \\"operation'. Still, this novel was compelling in its insights into the mind of the manic-depressive and completely insane. The excerpts of Paul's novel made me wonder if Mr. King wasn't skewering the Romance novel niche...anyone else note that these were obvious parodies of the popular novels?

He has the profound ability; that even Hemingway usually missed; to make a character, and make that character so real and facinating that a reader becomes the character. That may sound like a cliche', but it happens to be perfectly true. Stephen King is genius, and I think even his anti-fans support that hypothisis. Misery supports the theroy that his work is also brilliant. Annie Wilkes is probably the most realistic, and most evil in that way, villian to come out of literature. Far more than the over-rated Dr. Hannibal Lecter from Thomas Harris' Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. And I believe we all can relate to Annie, at least a bit. Paul Sheldon is an equally developed character, making it a fantastic Cat-and-Mouse type of book. The movie Misery is one of the best King adaptions, if I may say so. Kathy Bates well deserved her award. She performed the role not only with fines'e, but with style. She made Annie a creature of charm, along with being crazy. So kudos to you, Ms. Bates. And Mr. King, you are America's greatest living writer."},{"Title":"Penguin Readers Level 6: Misery (Penguin Longman Reader Level 6)","review":"Stephen King just may be the greatest American writer of the later half of the 20th century.

I actually thought that maybe he was back on track again because the writing is reminiscent of his earlier and more sophisticated writing style.

This is the best book I have ever read. Taking advantage of a 4 hour break between classes, I have managed to read 2 of his books in little under 2 weeks. I cannot read for the full 4 hours as i have to do homework, but the draw of King lures me away from my studies. Previous to reading Misery, I read Firestarter and thought that that book would never be beaten. In my mind that was the best book.

She was however just a &quot;'Lil KID&quot; to him. What makes this book different from others is Chase 5 years seperation from Gem, who awaits his return everyday, hoping they would get married someday.... but upon his return, Chase brought home a wife. Ugh, now that hurts! I didn't ruin this for others because this is actually what the back book description would tell you. I just thought I'd mention it here since there is no book synopsis here in Amazon. I tell you, this book will break your heart to pieces the first half of the book. It will also make you believe in the power of true love. At the same time, it will make you fear it. There are times I wanted Gem to forget Chase and simply move on with her life but then the more you read R.L.H's words, the more you'll see Gem's heart and feel it at the same time. I wanted her to have Chase as badly as she does. No matter how hard she tries, no matter how much she wants to remain honorable, it's her heart and she can't do anything about it. Their love story is truly heart warming!Heart breaking love story...relief...thrilling mystery suspense...relief....frustrating consequences...relief....then another conflict would come out of no where, surprising you out of your seat!

The man of the book was in the national news (Wolfgang Schug, the Lakeport, CA physician indicted for murder in the death of his 11-month old patient went on trial in 1998) and this is when the story opens. The author is first shocked to read the headline of the Los Angeles Times on January 7th, then pleased to think her ex-husband is in trouble. But she realizes judgment based on a news story and ten year-old memories isn't fair. She recounts her courtship with the young German doctor (met him on, of all things, a blind date), her marriage and move with him and her young daughter to Cheyenne, Wyoming from Southern California, where he begins a three-year residency. What happens to him--the way he slowly changes--and how that affects herself and her child makes for an &quot;I just gotta see what happens next&quot; experience for the reader. And the climactic chapter, &quot;Keys&quot; was a heartstopper. Just be sure you can read the rest of the book from the chapter before &quot;Keys&quot; to the end without interruption! But excitement aside, the author treated her account of that time, and of him, with dignity and sensitivity, and that is what made this story so memorable and touching. I saw myself in her many times. And I recognized men I have known and issues I have faced myself, as I absorbed every word. The author's writing style not only flows beautifully, it speaks from the heart and for the heart. I recommend this book for anyone (men, too) who want a glimpse into real life. Forget Hollywood--go for reality. It's in this book, and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The riddle of the dinosaur","review":"For the most part, the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs. Problem: no tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though, the book is good reading."},{"Title":"The riddle of the dinosaur","review":"I loved this book. It was a little slow to start but offers a fantastic overview of the major discoveries in the history of Paleontology.

He shows that he is willing to make sacrifices for his principles of right and wrong and dedicates himself to regaining his father's good reputation. He also illustrates his religious character and trust in God. The hero in Men of Iron by Howard Pyle proves that a willingness to sacrifice and stand up for what is right will result in happiness.Myles Falworth was willing to make great sacrifices for his personal principles of right and wrong. He was willing to fight Walter Blunt, the boy in charge of everyone, on behalf of all the other squires and esquires so they would not be made slaves anymore. He fought the Earl of Alban to redeem his father because he thought fighting him was the right thing to do. He sacrificed some of his money to buy his friend, Gascoyne, a knife.Myles dedicated himself, through great personal sacrifice, to regaining his father's good reputation. He did this by becoming a knight. As a knight, he redeemed his father by challenging the Earl of Alban, William Bushy Brookhurst, and by winning the fight. These sacrifices were necessary to regain the good reputation of his father, Lord Falworth.After Myles became a knight, he illustrated his religious character and trust in God. After he was knighted, he started to pray ore and he also attended daily chapel. He started to rely on God to help him win his battles. His reliance on God is what helped him through many of his hardships.Men of Iron, by Howard Pyle, illustrates the character development of young Myles Falworth in England's fifteenth-century culture. His character develops from his principles, his dedication, and his closeness to God. This is a good book about a boy who becomes a knight to avenge his father for the wrongs committed against him."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"Howard Pyle's Men of Iron is a lesser-known classic, originally published in 1891. The style is reflective of both the time it was written in and the time the story takes place in, and so takes a bit of getting used to, but it flows well and soon you're immersed well into both periods: the later age of chivalry of the 14th century as well as the late 1800's when books for boys centering on rags-to-riches tales and offering moral examples to live up to were popular. Basically, think Horatio Alger and Mallory blended together in a single novel.I liked the fact that Pyle gives shading to most of the characters in the book, making them believable in their motivations and not mere sterotypes cast in black and white. Myles Falworth, the young hero-to-be, has his noble side but is also quick-tempered and stubborn to a fault. The Earl of Mackworth, who takes him in and sees to his training, is something of a schemer and has his own agenda in which Myles is to play a part. And even the great wrong Myles' family suffered is cast in such a light that Myles can see that the King may have had good reason for acting as he did. Even the outright villain, the Earl of Alben, is shown as not being entirely without reason for his actions.The best thing though about the novel is the way it immerses the reader in the life and training of a knight in a noble household in the late medieval era. The language used by the characters, their attitudes and their roles in society are all true to the time, and Pyle works in an enormous amount of factual detail into the descriptions of how they lived, what they wore, the rules by which they lived, and so on. The details on the ceremony in which Myles is knighted, the first tournament joust he participates in, and the final trial by combat in which he vindicates his father are truly worth the read for anyone who wants to know what these were like and for anyone who cherishes historical accuracy. As an example, this description of the field where the trial by combat was to take place:\\"The lists were laid out in the usual form. The true or principal list in which the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yards wide; this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feet high, painted vermilion. Between the fence and the stan where the King and the spectators sat, and surrounding the central space, was the outer or false list, also surrounded by a fence. In the false list the Constable and the Marshal and their followers and attendants were to be stationed at the time of battle to preserve the general peace during the contest between the principals.\\"Even a hundred-plus years after its original publication, Men of Iron still has much to offer to readers who enjoy tales of knights and the age of chivalry, and to readers who want to know what it was like for a boy of the time whose coming of age was to become one of those knights. Recommended."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"This is a Boys classic to rank along side of Robin Hood . I first read this book in the ninth grade but is easily read by any good reader 5Th grade up.

I had it on my book list for our church's homeschool co-op history class. Full of suspense and action, this book is perfect for anyone looking for a good historical fiction read set in the Middle Ages. Whether you are a boy looking for chivalrous knighthood, or a girl in search of any good quality books that might still be out there like me, I definately recomend this book!! It is about Myles Falworth, a young man who plots revenge on the cruel knight that blinded his aging father. He goes to become a squire to an earl. From fighting the bossy bachelors to finding a secret tower with his best friend to falling into the earl's private garden, Myles' life as a squire gets more and more fantastic!

They love them!!"},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"Men of Iron is a coming-of-age story targeted towards adolescent boys. Originally targeting this demographic in the 1890's, it seems a stretch to believe the same target can be hit now. However, there is enough action to keep the attention of the 12-16 year old set. This is a good thing, since the book is excellent at conveying a code which should never fall out of fashion: honor, friendship, loyalty, honesty, respect towards women, and the singular pursuit of a worthwhile goal.The story itself concerns the rags-to-respectability transformation of Miles Falworth, a noble-minded young man who is tasked with repairing his family's unfairly tarnished reputation. The plot progression is three fights, all of which are distinguished from needless violence by being righteous endeavors which help Miles learn and accept the code of chivalry. The first fight is born out of stubbornness, and serves to end the tyranny of the upperclassmen while teaching Miles an important lesson about leadership and cooperation. The second fight is a joust born out of duty, and serves to give Miles an important sense of self-confidence while emphasizing the positive returns paid by loyalty to king, country, and code. The final fight is a duel born out of legality (trial by ordeal), and serves to restore Miles' family to its rightful place, establish him as a man of means, and provides him with permission to marry his one true love.While the boyhood fight scenes drag on and the split prose technique (narrative is common, dialogue is archaic) can be awkward, the joust and final duel are compelling reads. What the book lacks in minor character development (it is not clear that his mortal enemy is 100% evil), it makes up in plot clarity and a succinct narrative.This book is a pleasure to read. My only regret is that Howard Pyle did not write more books to chronicle the life and times of Myles Falworth."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"It's a story about a young man named Myles Falworth. His father is blind and outlawed for a reason Myles finds out later in the book. It's about his growing up (he hates to be ordered about by his superiors) and becoming a knight and restoring his fathers honor. It's an interesting read, but sort of hard to understand as the characters speak in old English. (for sooth, thee, thou, methinks, ect.)"},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"This book was a great read!

Nothing more, nothing less."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"This novel was the basis of the Hollywood movie, \\"The Black Shield of Falworth,\\" starring Tony Curtis, and Janet Leigh. It depicts the struggle of young Myles Falworth to learn the truth about his family's disgrace in mediaeval England during the reign of Henry IV - and his training, first as a squire and later as a knight, to prepare him to avenge his father's honor and restore the family name of Falworth on the roster of English chivalry.The movie version heightens the story's drama by adding a second love interest for Myles' best friend, and by increasing the stakes by making the villain an outright traitor with plans to overthrow King Henry. It also includes Prince Hal, in a role where his historical roistering debauchery is treated as a ruse to conceal his efforts to uncover the plot and while at the same time he advances the fortunes of young Myles.This book is very informative regarding the training, habits, and mores of that era in English history, and the frequent use of archaic English language and expressions doesn't detract from following the events of the story and the development of the various characters."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"This book has everything, likable characters, an interesting plot, just enough danger to cause tension, and a few interesting twists. The narrator is the perfect amalgam of kindly grandfather , and omniscient storyteller. Funny that this was written as a children's book, as few novels for adult readers are this well composed. No need for magic or dragons to keep this simple story going, or even any grit, really. The traction and momentum rests solely on the main character and the supporting cast. I look forward to rereading the other books from this author with adult eyes, as I read most of his other work when I was a teen. I wish modern fantasy and sci-fi authors would take a lesson from Pyle, a fantastic setting can give a story flavor, but characters are what drive it forward."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"Originally published well over 100 years ago, this novel by the author best known for his novel on Robin Hood holds up remarkably well. All the dialogue is written in what Pyle supposed was the English spoken by the gentry in 1400. This was a bold experiment and takes some getting used to since he uses archaic vocabulary and grammar -- a bit like reading Shakespeare. Wonderful descriptions of chivalraic rites and traditions and knightly contests. There's even a minimalist love story and some philosophizing about when killing is moral and immoral. Altogether, an interesting and entertaining glance back at young adult fiction of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"My mother gave me this book when I was a young boy; her brother had liked it when HE was a young boy. This story of a young squire from a dishonored noble family in 15th century England, who survives hard training to become a knight, then seeks to restore his family's good name and his blinded father's rights, effortlessly teaches lessons of honor, loyalty, friendship, courage and other virtues -- as well as the softening and gentling influence of love. It also teaches, by presenting what is to a certain extent a realistic and detailed picture of life in a great medieval castle, of knightly training, and of tournaments and single combat in those times. The climax is exciting and not sugar-coated. It's not particularly a book for a kid who is not already a good reader, because the language is old-fashioned, from a more literate time (book was first published around 1900, and the spoken dialogue is to a large degree authentic 15th century speech), but for an imaginative child who has some interest in knights in shining armor, it's a true classic. I don't know about girls, but many boys would probably identify with the young hero while reading the book -- I remember that I did!"},{"Title":"Men of Iron","review":"Book Report\\" Men of Iron\\" is a story of Myles Falworth who went on a quest of training for knighthood. Once a knight, he must win back his father life and honor.The book has no weakness, for it was very well written and told. Although some people might have think the dialogue a turn off. The dialogue was written in old English. It was difficult to understand at first, but after a while you tend to pick up the language. Nevertheless, the old English conversation is an essential part of the book, for the story took place in the fifteenth-century.The book has many strengths. One strength is that the author did a good job of creating the medieval age atmosphere through extremely descriptive details. Another strength is the story itself. The story is very interesting and exciting.Myle's first joust ever was exciting, but the last battle is the book most exciting chapter. The author did a good job of building the tension and the stake, that when the last battle was over, I was satisfied with the ending.I recommend this book to all young adult and teens, because it has great themes such as courage, loyalty, steadfastness, and generosity.

It is an inspiring tale, and few young readers would not be able to learn a thing or two about life from Myles.I have to dissent, however, from a previous reviewer who said that this was Pyle's best book. While this was a great book, I far preferred his Adventures of Robin Hood and His Merry Men, and also his Arthurian books. This book lacks much of the old english (or at least Pyle's rendition of it) which his other books have, and I greatly missed it.

The story is nicely illustrated and well written, and might produce a temporary change in a reader's behavior, but its lesson does not line up with a biblical view of virtue.The angel recommends that Marcella change her behavior by force of will: \\"When you are rude or stingy or messy or anything else that's nasty, stop, flip-flop, then act that way.\\" The admonition to \\"flip-flop\\" might encourage a reader to change their visible actions, but it fails to address the fallen heart where sin is rooted (Jeremiah 17:9). The Bible teaches that humans are naturally slaves to sin, needing God to free us from its power before true change can happen (Romans 6:17-18).Marcella's behavioral change rises to a pretty low standard in both motive and execution:People might like you, but better than that, you will like yourself.... Now, remember! Only every other day. Otherwise, you might become perfect. Perfect is dull and boring. Being too nice is almost as bad as being too nasty.Not only does she aspire to only occasional goodness, but the goal of improvement is self-esteem and popularity. This approach can lead to a self-conscious veneer of civility that covers up a hypocritical heart (Matthew 23:27-28). In contrast to this view, we want our children to aspire to a love for God that produces true virtue and a genuine love for others (Matthew 22:37-40).Marcella's self-focused motivation is also reflected in the people around her. When she becomes more pleasant to be around, not only does she does gain friends but her mother becomes more affectionate. This suggests that Mother's expressions of affection are actually conditional upon her daughter's good performance rather than originating out of a heart of love toward her.The underlying premise for this behavior modification is revealed at the story's conclusion when the angel reveals that her name is Marcella, implying that all the changes actually came from within herself. This reveals a humanist, rather than a transcendent, basis for goodness.This story supports self-powered moralism, which could feed the self-righteousness and people-pleasing tendency that lives in all sinful hearts. It advocates good behavior for all the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"Captain Cook","review":"Captain James Cook dicovered New Zealand and Australia and many other countries/islands in the 1700s for the Western world.

Hesse-Lichtenberger is a fantastic writer and enthusiastic fan of the sport (and not necessarily the way it is played by the Germans), who puts all his love and knowledge into this book. You will learn about the &quot;Schalker Kreisel&quot; which made one of Germany's club teams (FC Schalke 04) one of the best and most advanced teams in the world when German soccer didn't have a wimming reputation. You will learn about some of the scnadals of German soccer and about some of the forgotten stars. Hesse-Lichtenberger takes the subject seriously, but finds a light and humorous voice that makes this book entertaining and enjoyable.One of the best soccer books I have read, although readers should have some interest in learning about German soccer. Otherwise this book may be too specialized."},{"Title":"Tor:the Story of German Football","review":"Uli Heese-Lichtenberger's account of the history of German football is amazing.

Hesse's style is witty, at times dryly humorous, and never boring. The 2003 revised edition opens and closes with Fritz Walter: first, on the fateful day in Bern; last, with a poignant tribute from Miroslav Klose.Hesse doesn't gloss over either of the World Wars, nor does he sanitize the actions of the DFB at either time. Some of the clubs acted admirably; others less so.History has shown some of Hesse's predictions in the final chapter to be true. German national team fans are more than happy to field a team with \\"a bunch of funny-sounding names\\"--the 2010 team in South Africa had eleven players who could have played for another country, like Mesut &Ouml;zil, Sami Khedira, naturalized citizen Cacau, plus Klose, Lukas Podolski, and others.One prediction that was clearly forward-thinking in 2002/03 but looks naive now is that Turkey's accession to the EU was imminent (and would make the matter of citizenship of German Turks easier to deal with, since the EU has somewhat fluid citizenship rules).If you're a fan of the Bundesliga or the German NT, you need to read this book. It's worth the effort (and expense) of tracking down a copy, if you haven't a Kindle."},{"Title":"Tor:the Story of German Football","review":"If you have any interest in German soccer, you must buy this book. A great read which delves into the details of what happened and why, including how the sport first developed in the country and succeeded over time, sometimes against dramatic opposition. The author does a careful analysis of his own, as opposed to just repeating the thoughts of others, and captures all the high points of the history of the sport in Germany (at least in men's competitions).My only regret is that this book was not quite a bit longer, with more details especially about the pre-WW II era.

This forum is an annual meeting of experts, vendors, and participants in the business rules &quot;evolution&quot; and is used to share ideas and information among colleagues in the field. Barbara's book was introduced in many of the forum presentations, which prompted me to make the purchase. This action was perhaps the most significant step I have taken to fully understand the business rules methodology and has saved my current project from almost certain failure.I have now implemented many of the ideas and techniques from the book and placed my business rules project on a road to success. My project has endured many obstacles, not the least of which is understanding the differences that are imposed on the project team from traditional re-engineering efforts. If I hadn't come across Barbara's excellent documentation on project scoping, rules discovery, and designing for the business rules approach, I would have seriously doubted our ability to implement the project successfully. My project team was able to read and comprehend the most important concepts from the book and we have been able to modify our project plan to incorporate her ideas and techniques.I believe it is our responsibility as IT professionals to recognize the importance of the business rules movement and to follow a strict methodology when implementing any rules engine initiative. I must personally thank Barbara for sharing some of the most important concepts with this methodology. I honestly consider it my blueprint for success."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"The fact is that this book covers business rules from an implementation approach, and does so in great detail. If you are new to business rules you should first read Business Rules and Information Systems: Aligning IT with Business Goals by Tony Morgan, which is better for beginners. That book introduces business rules at a basic level.This book expands Morgan's work by drilling down into details and exposing the nuances that a seasoned practitioner will appreciate. However, the main value of this book is the way Ms. von Halle steps you through the complexities of implementing business rules as an organizational methodology. This is not an easy task, but she manages to provide a complete and comprehensive approach that will guarantee success if carefully followed. I think the work breakdown structure alone that is provided in the book makes it essential to anyone who is tasked with implementing business rules.In addition, the tables, checklists and documents and information from the book's web site add even more value. This is an important book about an important topic. It's not easy to read, but the diligent reader (assuming prior experience) will find everything he or she needs to know about business rules, the value proposition for using them, and how to implement them. It's the most authoritative book on the subject, and will probably remain so for years to come."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"The business rules approach offers a solid advancement in systems development and Barbara's book expounds concrete steps that you may take to implement the method in your organization.My principle criticism of the text is that the first half of the book has been poorly edited and is almost impossible to read. There are many sloppy sentences, grammar errors and redundant constructions. Because this topic is important to me I took several weeks slogging through the book to adsorb the materials I needed. This should have taken much less time.The book takes a very strong relational database approach to the mapping of terms constraints and facts. If fact, a substantial portion of the book is devoted to recycled relational data modeling and for some reason this part of the book is more flowing and eloquent. The text's arguments are weakest when the author presents a poor understanding of current object technology. For instance, there is no discussion of patterns and many of the declarations of the limitation of Object Technology are uninformed. I would suggest that those with OOSE orientation overlook this bias. There is some good material for OO practitioners.There are two competing views in the business rules camps. One view is that business rules presents and solid requirements gathering technique. The next view is that business rules are all about application generation. The first technique has spawned software product that 'listen' to the data in the database in a 'rules engine'. Barbara Van Halle describes these tools. Eloquent presents the second view.In summary, if you are seriously considering the addition of business rules methods to your project or organization then buy and read this book otherwise wait for a second edition."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"Dear Reader,Business Rules, like Data Warehousing, both have the potential to dramatically reverse the downward spiral in the credibility and coherence of many IT organizations. Both initiatives focus on giving the business what it wants; Data Warehousing from mainly a strategic decision-making perspective and Business Rules from mainly an operational-support and tactical-orientation perspective.To understand the importance of the role of Business Rules in business is to recognize a done deal, to actively go about leveraging Business Rules as the key component in process development, application development and application evolution is really the thing that will separate the smart people from the sceptics.One of the problems of Business Rules, like Data Warehousing as well, is that they are both seemingly intuitive - the sort of thing that one could do just by imagining oneself what needs to be done. Now, don't let me put you off, and I would say that there is an element of truth in the idea that, at a certain level of abstraction, both the Data Warehousing and Business Rules concepts are very straightforward. However, and this is the crux of the matter, there are a number of seemingly small and insignificant project decisions to be made where the right decisions (based on experience) are not always the most obvious or intuitive choices, especially when we base our decisions on knowledge of other IT project methods, and, which in turn could lead to decisions that result in the collapse of your BR or DW project and the failure of yet another IT project.So, if you think that Business Rules might be just the thing for your business then read this book. In it you will find a wealth of knowledge and experience. It leads the reader from a good description of real reasons for using the Business Rules approach, Business Rules concepts, through to the process of identifying, defining and capturing Business Rules, and describes, in great detail, an iterative project approach to the active and evolutionary management of Business Rules in business. The book is well structured, is easy to read - for such a detailed book - and, focuses on important issues, options and decisions involved in Business Rules.As a long term advocate of the Business Rules approach I could not rate this book more highly.Best regards,Martyn R JonesIniciativa Org, SL"},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"This is one of two books currently in print about business rules, and each book addresses the subject from a different perspective. The other book, Business Rules and Information Systems by Tony Morgan, is a better introduction because it assumes less technical knowledge. This book, however, has unique strengths that the other book doesn't, including:(1) A comprehensive approach to preparing for and implementing business rules as an enterprise-wide discipline. It accomplishes this by providing a life cycle approach to business rules development through ongoing management.(2) The implementation approach is provided as a work breakdown structure, which significantly reduces your planning for an enterprise-wide initiative (or a pilot initiative based on a single project).(3) There is an accompanying web site that provides additional papers, case studies and other materials that enhance the value of the book.The introduction to business rules and concepts is perhaps too verbose, but is thorough. What this part of the book lacks in sparkling prose it more than compensates in detail. I particularly liked the chapter devoted to business rules methodology, which takes the concepts and applies them in a structured way. Another strong point is that the book provides many examples to reinforce points under discussion, and summarizes key information in easy-to-read tables. The illustrations that are sprinkled throughout the book also add clarity.If you're new to business rules the best book, in my opinion, is Morgan's Business Rules and Information Systems. However, after reading that book you'll also want this one if you are serious about implementing business rules because of the way Ms. von Halle has structured the flow and content. Also, the author is one of the pioneers in the business rules community, which adds considerable authority and credibility to her approach."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"Here are my impresions after having read through 3/4 of this book:1. The author presents the Business Rules approach in a manner that is extremely flexible, considering the fact that many projects may or may not have the benefit of being developed within a structured enterprise achitecture. The author recommends some very useful techniques (such as generic versus specific database design) that one can use to help minimize the cost of making iterative changes to a system. The benefits of leveraging the rules of a business is clearly explained in detail throuhgout the book (at least in the parts that I've read so far).2. For those who are familiar with enterprise analysis, such as the Zachman Framework, it may be somewhat difficult at times to determine at what scope the author is speaking about when dealing with the various system development phases. I had to remind myself that the book deals with system development and not (necessarily) enterprise analysis. Within an enterprise architecture, such items as the conceptual and logical data model should already be flushed out relative to the business as a whole before any specific system is developed. Consequently, seeing these steps within the development of a project was somewhat confusing. Since most businesses I have dealt with don't even have an enterprise architecture (or even know what one is), it does make sense on one level to include these steps during system development. The author provides useful resources to look into for information on how the business rules approach fits into the Zachman Framework, but I was hoping for more details in this book before I purchased it.3. I was also hoping that the Process Analysis section would deal with analyzing business functions and processes in addition to the workflow of a particular system. An excellent example was provided by the author relating to the consequences of database design without an enterprise data model - a similar example of the consequenses of workflow design without a business process model would have been equally helpful.Now, if only management would \\"see the light\\" and stop practicing all of those system development techniques the author suggests to avoid (while seriously considering what is being said in this book and others like it), I could actually use this methodology in \\"real-life\\". :-)"},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"This is the book I was waiting for. Before this book I spent hundreds of hours researching business rules on the internet and still didn't get the detailed material that this book contains. I agree with other reviewers that you can use this book to base a business rules implementation on, and you can also use it to teach business rules to your team. I think it has a perfect balance of implementation, concept and practical information and recommend it to anyone who is interested in business rules. I skimmed through the Morgan book that others have recommended and like it too, but it is basic and will not help you in implementation. This (von Halle) book is the one to get and it's the most complete book on the subject available."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"I find the concepts introduced in the book such as categorisation of business rules, and the worked examples using a few products very useful.However, I wish the book can be less verbose, with less repetition of the same concepts (such as continuously expounding on the advantages of business rules approach) throughout the whole book. They are distracting and not necessary. The book could have been more concise.This is a topic worth exploring into and I hope some of UML/MDA efforts can incorporate the ideas here."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"I bought this book based on some of the enthusiastic reviews here but was very disappointed. I think people who see rules engines as the next big thing and are very excited about it may be enthusiatistic about this book because it pushes that line very hard. However, there is very little in this book that reflects hard practical experience or that is likely to surprise an experienced software designer with a basic understanding of rules engines. Good books on this subject are still waiting to be written.Instead of this book I would recommend reading \\"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software\\" by Eric Evans and the documentation for whatever rules systems you are considering."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"There are only a handful of classic books that define the data and information management industry.

Business Rules Applied is a must-read for all professionals that are serious about managing their business rules."},{"Title":"Business Rules Applied: Building Better Systems Using the Business Rules Approach","review":"This book is one of the classics on developing information systems with a business rules approach. Not only does the book give a good overview of the key concepts in business rules, it also lays out the core tasks and techniques for an actual methodology to develop rules-based systems. Barbara brings great experience in database design and other core application development techniques and she weaves the unique tasks and issues of a business rules approach right in. Anyone used to a \\"traditional\\" application development approach will find plenty of reference points so they don't get lost and yet all the keys they need to succeed with a need approach based on business rules.The references to business rules management systems are a little out of date as you would expect given the book is a few years old but the core advice remains as good today as it was then. Although Barb continues to develop her ideas and write on business rules, this book is an excellent reference for anyone planning business rules projects, conducting them or interested in how to start using them.

Sampling The Land of Laughs and Outside the Dog Museum again was pure pleasure--notable for their memorable lead characters, and for the nimble way Carroll depicts the intersection of the fantastic and the ordinary, both books demonstrate why Carroll is one of the most respected fantasists working today. Reading those books, however, did little to prepare me for the overall eloquence and bravado of Carroll's latest effort, Glass Soup.Building on characters and situations established in his previous novel, 2004's estimable White Apples, Glass Soup tells the continuing story of lovers Vincent Ettrich and Isabelle Nuekor, a couple whose relationship can only be described as extraordinary--their love is so strong that Isabelle actually succeeded in rescuing Vincent from death. Because all actions have consequences, and extraordinary actions have extraordinary consequences, Isabelle's rescue of Vincent causes Chaos to actually achieve consciousness, an awareness he/it will lose if things are allowed to progress the way they have since the beginning of time. Seeking to shift the cosmic balance in his favor, Chaos works through various emissaries to lure the now pregnant Isabelle back to the land of the dead; it seems that if her baby is born there, Chaos will remain sentient. Before the novel's touching conclusion, Isabelle's dilemma will touch the lives of all those around her in surprising and sometimes lethal ways.Along the way, Carroll waxes poetic about the nature of love, friendship, responsibility and the very fabric of reality. Even the pettiest of his characters manage to evoke sympathy, primarily because the villains of the piece are manipulating them in heinous ways. And those villains--Carroll knows heroes need formidable foes, which he provides in the malicious John Flannery and the smooth as silk Putnam. These two positively ooze evil as they try to force Vincent and Isabelle into increasingly untenable positions.Charming and absolutely enthralling, Glass Soup displays the creativity, intelligence and wit for which Carroll has become famous. As it says on the front flap of the book's dust jacket, \\"For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space of their own.\\" Glass Soup is perhaps the best example of that phenomenon to date."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"Once again Carrolls work causes bouts of discussion about exactly what the story is about and ' this doesn't work for me ..' and ' that is a bit ambiguous ..' or '...his finest piece of work since...' and '....I will never look at scrabble in the same way again ..' ...BUT ...people that is EXACTLY what a good book should do !!!!You should be stimulated into talking about it....it should make you angry, sad , happy, annoyed....heartbroken...awe-struck....you should laugh, you should cry !If you have read it and it has provoked a reaction, be that positive or negative, then the story has worked ! It has made you think !I have been reading Jonathan Carrolls' work from the first book published and no I didn't like every book he wrote, I am not a Carroll groupie, but I have READ every book he has wrote and each one causes a huge reaction within me and have loved him for it.If I have to pull a favourite from the past then Bones of the Moon it would be for its exploration of life within death which is certainly the topic of Glass Soup and its predecessor White Apples. I for one and am happy that the author has returned to his weird imagery of yore ' a la Bones of the Moon and Child Across the Sky ' but that is merely a personal whim as many readers were ehthralled by the very subtle weridness of the likes of The Wooden Sea and Kissing the Beehive. As with all of his books his characters are brilliantly alive and reactive to the scenes he sets, they are consumate in their life be they human, bear or otherwise ! ......and he is an absolute master in teasing the readers sensiblities and dangling carrots of wonder in front of your eyes causing you to read on and finish the book. I often wonder what it would be like to actually listen to Carroll read from his own words and would have no doubt that he would have made a fine travelling storyteller in medieval times.Is it fantasy ?....all fiction is fantasy so that question is not really one you should be asking...Is it frightening ?....Is it this ?..is it that ?...Why are you reading this review when you should be reading the book and finding out for yourself and eating his carrots !"},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"The important thing to remember when thinking about _White Apples_ and its follow up, _Glass Soup_, is that these are primarily love stories. The tensions between chaos and control, the willingness to love the current form of the universe while maintaining openness toward its eventual demise, are all analogs of romantic love: what preserves it, what kills it, what makes it grow. Carroll doesn't write genre fiction, but if he did, he is probably best understood as a magical -- or even supernatural -- realist. He maps our real lives, and our emotional lives, onto a fantastic landscape. His books are our hearts writ large. Only the imaginative can comprehend the insights provided by such imaginative work. If you're not used to this type of writing, try it...with an open mind."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"Speaking of cracked, this is another Jonathan Carroll book. What else could we expect? This time we are introduced to characters who are dead - except when they were but aren't. Or is it they were alive but they were also dead? Maybe none of that is true.What is true is that this is a very funny book. Carroll, for those of you who haven't read him (yet), knows how to put together a story. Sometimes they are put together better than at other times, but they are always interesting to read.Creative to the max, we get to tour both our world and the world of the dead - actually one person's world of the dead. I recommend this one highly. It is easily read over a weekend and will help your attitude as you head into Monday."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"This was my first time reading jonathan carroll and I really enjoyed it. Wasn't sure at first beacause I didn't know anything about him besides what I read in a review. I cannot wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"This will probably be a short review - which is odd given how much I love Jonathan Carroll's books. I read them out of order, so I am always a bit lost in his world(s). The same characters appear in several books, but I can't keep track of what they've done and how they are all connected...but I am perfectly fine with that. In fact, I love it.I was lucky enough to attend one of his readings of \\"White Apples\\" - and was sucked into his universe. Life, death, love, bull terriers, life sized bags of caramels...his \\"magical realism\\" (per his website) is a delight.For instance, I can be reading along - interested enough in the first character in \\"Glass Soup\\", Simon Haden, when suddenly, the following paragraph yanks my eyebrows up into my hairline.\\"If someone had told Simon Haden that he was a colossal prick and why, he would not have understood. He would not have denied it, he would not have understood. Because pretty people think the world should forgive whatever their sins are simply because they exist.\\"\\"He finished in the bathroom and went to the bedroom. The envelope containing the day's instructions lay on the dresser. In his underpants and sheer black socks, he picked it up and tore it open.\\"\\"A little man the size of a candy bar stepped out of the envelope and into his hand. \`Haden, how you doin'?'\\"HELLO! My attention has been kicked into overdrive and I remember why I like these books so much. I love being caught off guard.The story progresses as Simon gets onto his tour bus, \\"There were a few people, a few animals, two cartoon characters, and an almost six foot tall bag of caramels.\\"I don't mean to suggest that Carroll's writing or characters or plot are goofy or silly...everything has its reason for existing in his world. Everything is a symbol, a link to another book or another character's life.I am a lazy Carroll reader, I must admit. I KNOW there is so much more to be gleaned from his books, but I mostly just settle back and enjoy the ride.\\"God's office was nothing special. By the way it was furnished it could just as easily have belonged to a North Dakota dentist or some comb-over in middle management. The secretary/receptionist was a forty-something nondescript who told Haden in a neutral voice to take a seat. \\"He'll be with you in a minute.\\" Then she went back to typing - on a typewriter. God's secretary used a manual typewriter.\\"But still? Sometimes I put down this box of literary bon-bons and savor an idea like this one:\\"Another time they might have had a rewarding relationship. But there are people we meet in life that miss being important to us by inches, days or heartbeats. Another place or time or emotional frame of mind and we would willingly fall into their arms; gladly take up their challenge or invitation.

This is the first book of his that I have read, and I certainly intend to read many more of them.

The whole book is surreal, and there is a shock and surprise on every page.I certainly don't want to spoil anyone's enjoyment who hasn't read the book, so I refuse to discuss the plot, except to say that it kept me quite interested from beginning to end.

This makes recommending this book very straightforward: if you've read White Apples and enjoyed it, Glass Soup is a must read book. If you haven't read White Apples, start there.That said, I think this is quite a worthy sequel to White Apples. The story is quite as odd and profound as it was before. Carroll weaves the events beautifully, as the main characters travel around Vienna and cross the borders between life and death. There's odd humour, curious characters, and fairly deep thinking. The opening of the book is delightfully surreal."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"This book is a sequel to \\"White Apples,\\" but you'll be able to understand it just fine without reading the first book. It's a surrealistic tale of the struggle between good and chaos, and the main characters slip back and forth between modern-day Vienna and a dream world. It's frequently very funny and I find the characters likable despite their flaws.I didn't like this book as much as its predecessor, however. For one thing, it goes over some of the same explanatory ground. I suppose this is good if you've never read the first book or if you've forgotten it, but otherwise it's a bit tiresome. Second, the plot is just a bit too unpredictable. Not that I want to be able to predict everything, of course. But the danger of a plot involving God, chaos, and dream worlds is that you can make just about anything happen any time you want to, and the helpless reader can't really complain that it's unbelievable. I mean, if you're willing to swallow octopus bus drivers and people made of butter, anything goes, right? But this can make it just a bit too easy for the heroes to and villians to accomplish their goals. The entire plot is sort of one big deus ex machina. Finally, I found the ending a bit unsatisfying, not too mention that it leaves several loose ends.All these criticisms aside, however, it really is an enjoyable book and I do recommend it. I just wish it was as good as some of the author's other works."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"This novel is a pretty good attempt at transcendence and deep ruminations on life and death, but a lack of focus keeps the story a few steps away from genius. In fact, those very same transcendent thoughts come across as abrupt statements, rather than ideas that arise organically, while the sly humor is also occasionally effective but usually seems forced. The vaguely surreal plotline is complex and intricately constructed, but many aspects are equally under-developed and poorly explained, especially the functioning of chaos and most of the characters' motivations. And speaking of inconsistent characters, most of them here display a social snobbery and emotional promiscuousness that is very difficult to love. Jonathan Carroll also has the habit of breaking the momentum of his story with dreadfully boring and sappy dissertations on the complex emotions of shifting relationships, which may seem deep at first but take on the characteristics of the worst of over-written but under-conceived romance novels. Carroll is a strong writer with some potentially groundbreaking ideas, but he needs to decide what kinds of themes and characterizations he's really trying to explore, before those explorations can really go anywhere interesting.

I stumbled across Jonathan Carroll through a Listmania list, and I'm glad I did. For a completely unique point of view, and a great story, read this book."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I bought this book for a friend,she loved it! She said that it is her favorite book and that everybody should read it.! :)"},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I found this book during a random trip to Goodwill. Most of the times I've gone there I'll come out with a couple books that end up being nice additions to my collection. Most times, though, I usually don't find books that are just spot-on for my taste using this method. Living in the Bible Belt, there aren't just a whole lot of second hand books with metaphysical and surreal themes. Jonathan Carroll is known for his magical realism, and I love some magic (read: any fantastic stories, not just witch/troll/fairies etc). However, I really don't like when authors go overboard with saccharine characters and perfectly predictable plots which end up with everything exactly as it should and all are happy and woodland critters help you clean your room and sing Disney songs to you... If you feel me.In this book the afterlife is created out of the dreams and subconscious thoughts a person had while they were alive. Danger is following a living woman named Isabelle and her unborn child, whose birth will effect all of existence and the balance of power between Chaos and Order. The only person who can help her is a dead man who may not even know he is dead yet.I made the mistake of reading this book without knowing it is actually a sequel to another book by Carroll, called White Apples. I had no idea it was a sequel until after I was done but it really didn't matter. This book is fine as an independent and worked well as a stand-alone, and I think that says something. (Although I will now be finding White Apples and reading it asap if its half as good as this one - but I hear its even better!)"},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"Jonathan Carroll is sui generis. If you don't like other books of his, then you won't like this. Personally, I have read almost all of his output and I wish I could enjoy this book more. There's a lot to like, in the goofy surrealism that has God appear as a polar bear named Bob, e.g., but it is too similar to WHITE APPLES for my taste. In particular, it grates on me when the action stops for several pages to walk Simon and/or Leni through the same cosmology (God as an evolving mosaic of everything that has occurred through the history of the universe, which is repeatedly destroyed and reborn, and a person's death being a microcosm of the same process) that he explored in previous books. Another thing that bothers me is that while there are plot changes, the characters don't seem to evolve. For example, Flora dislikes Vincent at the start, e.g., and while we find out why (which is explained, rather than shown) there is no indication that this attitude has changed by the end. It would be a richer book, if there is some change in the relationships between the characters."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I've anxiously awaited every Jonathan Carroll since I got hooked reading From The Teeth of Angels back in 91. But his later works have started to dim that anticipation. From Marriage of Sticks until this book, my enjoyment seems to be on a steadily downward path.What drew me to Carroll was his fantastic ability to create a scene from the \\"normal\\" world, and then show us what really lies underneath. The fantastic and metaphysical that turns the first view on its head.With this book he seems to jump into a swirling pool of the metaphysical and it doesn't seem to bear any relation to the \\"normal\\" world. If others enjoy that type of book, good. But for me it is unsettling enough that I'll read reviews before I automatically pick up the next Carroll book (unless its a reprint of an earlier great work that I've not been able to acquire yet)."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I am biased. Jonathan Caroll is one of my favorite writers. It doesn't matter if I'm reading one of his best or least novels. His exploration of the metaphysical within a physical world that is easily recognizable consistently captivates me. In the interface we inhabit, between fundamental spiritual visions suited to a global village, Carroll's bit of adult magic is welcome. I've read all his novels, even Child Across The Sky, which I had to order from England. I cannot find a reasonably priced used copy of his short story collection Painted Hand, or his novella, Black Cocktail, or an odd piece called The Heidelberg Cylinder. Nonetheless, I toast what I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I absolutely loved the first 3/4 of this book and was so excited to find another brilliant writer. Carroll's characters are fun . . . they arepeople you would know . . . except that they all carry on numerous lust affairs, however this is vital to the plot. Still, his characters are capable of true emotions, love, fear, sacrifice. His \\"dream\\" characters, Bob, and Broximon, especially, are exceptionally imaginative. The plot was interesting enough . . . basically keeping the dead on the dead side and the alive on the alive side, with Chaos trying to swing the battle in its favor. This theme was well executed throughout the first three quarters of the story . . . and in a way reminded me of \\"His Dark Materials\\" series by Phil Pullman. There were some truly great lines that made me think, or think, wow, thats totally right. However, I am only giving this book 3 stars because I was so horribly dissappointed by the end (or anti-end.) Is this to be continued? There were too many loose ends for me. What happens to Simon?Flora?Leni? Isabelle 1 and 2? And the baby . . . didn't seem like it was fighting Chaos in the last scene. The end of the book was just too anti-climatic to do justice to the first part of the book. In my opinion, Carroll was just steps away from genius, but stopped short of reaching it."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"Anyone who's read my reviews before knows that I relish an author being able to...well...effectively play God. Of course, anyone who writes a novel 'plays God', but many do it without conviction, or alacrity, or effectiveness. So when a writer tells a story with panache, I'm like a giddy child.That's the state I was anticipating being in when I began reading 'Glass Soup'. But over the course of its 300+ pages, this faded. As did my hope of a great experience.There's a ton missing in this book.And it seems to have been off-kilter by about seventeen and a half degrees.And...and...And Mr. Carroll doesn't deliver what to these eyes, to this expectant reader, should have been delivered.In many respects, 'Glass Soup' turns out to be a 'shaggy dog tale'. Which, considering its potential, and Mr. Carroll's abilities as a writer and a storyteller, is especially frustrating.There is no 'payoff'. There is no great philosophical insight. And really, once you've gotten to the final page, there's not much of anything. Except disappointment.And, as I don't feel the novel deserves any more energies lavished on it, lambasting or no, I'll say this: 'Glass Soup' reads like a bad translation. I'd be very curious to know if it turned out as he'd hoped...or was it as disappointing a result to write as it was to read.(Personal rating: 6/10)"},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"Carroll is an amazing author, one I have read religiously since I discovered The Wooden Sea (After Silence is by far my favorite of Carroll's). His writing flows easily and his narrative is real and understandable.This is perhaps one of the reasons that I didn't particularly care for Glass Soup. His dialogue seemed forced, like he felt that he had to explain everything to the reader in order for us to understand. This is where I am confused, because he never used to write that way. He always used to write intelligently, assuming the readers understand, and the story was that much better. This was why I loved reading Carroll, because he didn't fall into the typical trap of writing too much when we already understand.This aside, I have only one other issue with Glass Soup. He always writes about death. He seems to always write about death as a man, or an idea, that is trying to defeat you. And obviously that would mean that love and friendship and caring and so on would need to be present to battle against death and Chaos, but that still doesn't detract from the oh so common theme that Carroll tends to always write upon. This in itself is a great concept to write upon, but I would love to see him mix things up a little and show us his talent as a writer.Glass Soup in itself is a decent novel and flows easily. It is a little forced at times, and the ending is abrupt and a little forced as well, but I would still recommend Carroll as an author. Read his other works first, at the least read White Apples at the same time you read Glass Soup, that way his writing seems more like a complete and fluid story rather than using the same concept twice."},{"Title":"Glass Soup","review":"I didn't really care for White Apples (for which this is a sequel...of sorts) but it was light years ahead of this self-indulgent romp. The characters are flatter, the writing life-less, the narrative tension gone on vacation in some parallel universe yet to be manufactured by Carroll's fertile imagination (and it is quite good...as genre imagination goes).I would recommend a new reader to start with \\"The Wooden Sea\\". It is really the only one of his books that maintains a balance between the mundane and the fantastic that is almost worthy of the name magical realism. This latest exercise is more along the lines of fanatasist navel gazing. I don't hate the book...rather, it left me unmoved. Which, in itself, is more damning than saying I had some emotional response to the journey...if only a negative one.All-in-all it was, for this reader, a waste of time. Which is a shame because I am a fan of some of his other books...namely \\"The Wooden Sea\\".I wanted to give it 2 or 3 stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Apologies to those that enjoyed the book and believe Carroll can do no wrong."},{"Title":"The Masculinities Reader","review":"This book is an excellent compilation of articles written by the foremost researchers in masculinity studies today. The introduction situates the rest of the articles in historical context--in relation to feminist theory, for instance--and the articles make salient and thoughtful arguments. The articles show the breadth of content in the field of masculinity studies, although the compilation is by no means an exhaustive list of topics within the field. Ultimately, the articles de-construct masculinity (or I should say, masculinities), and they create room for men to reimagine gender for themselves.As a side note, it's unfortunate that the only other reviewer of this book swears by Sam Keen's Fire in the Belly. That book is more closely aligned with feminist backlash literature, and as such takes a provincial point of view."},{"Title":"The Masculinities Reader","review":"In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century. He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, \\"sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege,\\" p-3. I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language. For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use \\"men\\" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text. The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory. Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want. In conclusion the authors says that \\"this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example. The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites. Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity? Do the authors review men and masculist literature? Not so you would notice. In addition, the feminist concept of \\"the patriarchy\\" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda. A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.Use of the concept of \\"the patriarchy\\" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus. As Sam Keen says in \\"Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man,\\" P-196, \\"Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of \\"patriarchy.\\" \\"Patriarchy\\" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall.\\" In The Masculine Reader, \\"the patriarchy\\" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed. Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark. You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism. A better book real understanding of men is a serious need."},{"Title":"Life in Darwin's universe : evolution and the cosmos","review":"Bylinsky aptly chronicles evolution and gives believable and understandable options and alternatives to man's beginning and ongoing evolutionary process.

This is a truly moving story full of hardship and courage. Even through all of the trials and tribulations of life in the camp of death, the author shows us the beauty of companionship and hope. I wondered at this book. How one individual could servive those around her dying and still have the desire to live. It is through the hope and courage that she can live and it is through this book that the problems of my life seem so insignificant."},{"Title":"Hope is the Last to Die: A Coming of Age Under Nazi Terror","review":"I have read many books and seen many movies about the Holocaust; have visited Auswchwitz and Dachau, but I have never felt the horror of the camps as I did while reading this book. The reader is there with Ms. Birenbaum, feeling the cold, the hunger, the constant terror and rage. It is unimaginable that this woman survived 6 years of inhuman treatment--but she did.Because Ms. Birenbaum describes her own experiences as a Polish Jew coming of age during the Third Reich, she has much to teach us. The author expresses her emotions so simply and beautifully that the reader feels joy at her triumphs and while crying at her losses, emotional pain and humiliation. This remarkable woman, who was a child (between 9 and 15 years of age during the war), was wise, strong, resourceful and brave beyond all expectations. She watched almost all those she loved disappear. While standing in line at a \\"selection\\" at the Majdanek Camp, she turned around to talk to her beloved mother who had for years emotionally sheltered her young daughter from the inevitable (a la \\"Life is Beautiful\\"), and found her gone. She never saw her again, never said good-bye. In the camps she created new families for herself, only to loose these people, as well. Most touching was Ms. Birenbaum's first experience of falling in love and the loss of that man. And through all this, she was never able to mourn. Emotions had to be pushed deep inside because the focus had to be on survival.On several occasions, the author expressed her need for dignity and self-respect by standing up to her captors and, unbelieveably, was not shot for her defiance. She describes her indifference to the pain of others as a way of coping with the near certainty that she would loose them, while also expressing her longing to be touched and held and by someone.After reading this book, I think about all the little annoyances of daily living, and how meaningless they are. I wonder how many of us, in our pre-teens, could have dealt with the protracted horror of the ghetto and camps as Ms. Birenbaum did. How many of us would have had the will and fortitude to live through the experiences described in this book?

That's what Helina Birenbaum describes in her autobiography about surviving the holocaust, Hope is the Last to Die.The book and its author are remarkable, as Joan Martorelli, notes in her review on Amazon.com (June 15, 2003). Going over the descriptive passion Halina writes with, Ms. Martorelli introduces ideas about how an everyday person could cope with the Holocaust and also looks back on times she visited concentration camps.One point that Ms. Martorelli makes in this review is that her descriptions of the trauma, the joy, and the anger are so vivid and expressive that they simply draw you in and make you feel as though you are almost there with her as she goes through the manic changes of emotion. I completely agree with this. I also think (though the writer of this review doesn't contradict this) that it would be impossible to fully experience any pain Halina went through just by reading a book about the troubles, But acknowledging that brings us one step closer to comprehending.Halina did not get a chance to grieve about a lot of the loss faced. She was not able to sit down and cry even for a minute because it would jeopardize her chances of survival. In the loss of both her dear mother and of her first love, she isn't able to say goodbye. They are both taken so suddenly and forcefully. She had to tune out her urges to mourn. If she had not done that, I believe she would have died along side the millions of other persecuted.A book so filled with love, character, hope, and that's so easy to follow and get caught up in should not be kept of your bookshelf. Hope is the Last to Die fits that description perfectly, and I recommend this book to everyone.Grand Rapids, MI"},{"Title":"Hope is the Last to Die: A Coming of Age Under Nazi Terror","review":"I also bought this book in Auschwitz.

I dont believe London wrote Might is Right because after doing the math he would have had to have been a teenager when he wrote it however I do think its possible that he read it and the rants in it may have influenced him and his creation of Wolf Larsen.

True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm._Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him._There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave._Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London.

I like the book because of the vivid descriptions and it keeps you interested because of the story being out at sea."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"London details Jack Larson in such a way he allows the reader to really get to know this 'wolf'. London has a gift for development of characters like no other author I have read.Great story!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Dick Hill does a brilliant cockney English, a satisfactory Van Weyden and the narration is acceptable. As for who Wolf Larsen is, Hill doesn't have a clue. His reading of Larsen is flat, stuck in a monotone. From Larsen's first word to the last, with one exception that left me wanting, Hill is expressing Larsen's moments of anger, elation, sadness, passion, force, pessimism, reflection, (rare) mirth, depression, and in general every word of normal conversation- in variations of barking, snapping, shouting, bullying, threatening and spitting.In depicting Larsen as nothing but a brute, Hill is depriving him of his extraordinary intellect, his magnetism, his social skills, the intelligence guiding his power and his beauty.The five stars are for London's masterpiece since they apply to rating the book and not the CD. This recording is worthless to me."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London is a very interesting and unique book. The story starts with a gentleman, a Mr. Humphrey Van Weyden taking a nice cruise on San Francisco Bay. All of but a moment, a simple twist of fate changes his life forever. The large ferry-boat he was on, the Martinez was suddenly struck by a steamboat in the dense and sometimes deadly San Francisco fog. As he was floating through the water he is picked up by the schooner Ghost whose captain is known infamously for his cruelty, Wolf Larsen. Soon he is thrust into a world of hard labor and death waiting around the corner always.The book is a coming of age story, although it is unique because the one coming of age is already 35 years old. His whole life Humphrey Van Weyden never had to work for anything. He was a scholar; his job was a literature critic because his father had made all of his money for him. Once employed on the Ghost he must learn to fend for himself or be killed. But he finds that his incredibly muscled brute of a captain with no regard for human life or suffering actually has an incredible intellect. They end up discussing the philosophy of life multiple times. Soon, a pretty scholaress from the east of which Humphrey enjoyed reading very much appears on the Ghost setting a gap between Humphrey and Wolf Larsen. From then on the story takes an interesting turn and keeps you on the edge of the railing if not your seat.If you like swashbuckling adventure, great philosophical arguments and outlooks on life unique to the brain of Jack London, even a love story here and there, then I would recommend this book against all others. I have never read anything like it at all."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a gripping, thrilling and stunning peice of work. Van Weyden and Larsen come to grips with eachother and with themselves in this book. The confrontation scenes between the two are amazingly written and the stark realism of the boat, it's crew and the violence that is almost an everyday occurence combine to make this a book that can not be put down.The introduction of the female slows the book considerably but in my honest opinion, the ending is fine. Larsen's final fate is surprising and heart rending. The repeated phrase &quot;Bosh&quot; leads to one of the books best moments. While I wish London hadn't included the female, the book is well worth the read. At least before the female comes in, the book is darkly violent and challenging. The social implications of the debates between Van Weyden and Larsen are extremely sobering. All in all, this book is one of the best I have ever read. Brilliant is the best word I can come up with."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; or &quot;White Fang&quot;, then you'll probably like this book as well. The plot is basically the same...a weak creature is torn from it's sheltered life and forced to endure hardship. (Whatever doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.) A must read for fans of Jack London and adventure on the high seas!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is the first recreational book I have read in years and I couldn't put it down. There is so much in this book about life and the meaning of life, if there is any, that it will definitely force you to think about what it all means to you.This book rocks! The romance part was critical for Hump so just ignore the other comments! 8-)"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is a really good book. Jack London was one of the greatest writers in history. The story if you don't know is about a refined man who is on a ship and it goes down only for him to be \\"rescued\\" by another one. I put rescue in quotes because the ship he gets on (the Ghost) is ruled over by the legendary Sea Wolf Wolf Larsen. Larsen does not believe in any sort of moral code and also thinks that might makes right. As such, he commands his ship with a system of fear and intimidation and refuses to take Humphrey(the rescued man) back ashore. Instead, Hump, as he is referred to by the other sailors, is forced to stay aboard and goes from being a meek rich-boy whose never worked to a hardened man of the seas. The story is basically a brutal and savage one with London showing all of the ways Larsen can punish his crew and how Hump responds. Larsen is no mere man. He is extremely intelligent and well-read and that's why he keeps Hump on. The other men are not intellectual in the slightest but brutes. The only way Larsen is able to keep control is because he is also strong, nearly inhumanly so. In fact, in one scene, the mean attempt to throw him overboard after knocking him out. He climbs back on the ship and then goes down into the sleeping quarters where he is heavily outnumbered. There the men enact their plan to take over the ship. He fights off like a dozen men and survives, torturing his crew afterwords. Along the way, they meet up with his brother Death Larsen, but he isn't ever more than a faceless phantom. It is here that the book loses steam. They take on a woman who is a writer. Hump naturally develops feelings for her. They escape eventually to an island and, without giving away the ending, have a few problems there also. All in all, this is a really good, kept from true greatness perhaps by the inclusion of the woman at the end and the island. Except for that it's practically perfect. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I wish I had read this book in high school. I didn't get to it until much later in life. London knows his subject and in this case it's the conflict of man versus man, philosophy versus philosophy wrapped in a case of a diabolical captain against a gentleman. The discourses between these two never bog down and the action on the sea and land alike are edge of the seat brilliant. Take one side or the other, but you will be left searching your soul after reading this intense classic by a master of the writing craft."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I was quite surprised by Jack London's novel, The Sea Wolf. In fact, I rather enjoyed reading this book about a man at sea, Humphrey Van Weyden, aboard the ship, The Ghost, appropriately titled and a good metaphor. Aboard the ship, Van Weyden narrates his life at sea and the battles aboard the ship amongst the other sailors and the Captain Wolf Larsen who is also known as the Sea Wolf. The arrival of Maud Brewster adds romance to lonely Humphrey's sailing career. They have quite a story to tell as they leave the ship for Endeavor Island where they learn to survive in the Alaskan landscape in the early 1900s with barely the clothes on their back and their limited knowledge. It's like survivor without television cameras and there is only two people, a man and a woman on a desert island. Remember that question about who you would like to be stuck with on a desert island? Well, this book must have inspired such a philosophical question or wish. Maud and Humphrey get their wish to be alone but it's a struggle against nature. Jack London's writing style comes across with such flair that I believe he is the one of the most under-rated of American writers. Granted, we read his books in middle or high school but the older reader would gradually benefit and understand the depth of the narrator's voice with this book. Jack London should be regarded as one of America's foremost authors even with his focus on nature that his books are still selling and classic story-telling."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Loaded with imagery. The wickedness of Captain Wolf Larsen and the affection between Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster seems exaggerated but the author is using these things for higher purposes.Also, it's hard to believe that there could be another Wolf Larsen-type character in existence (the other being Wolf's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the ship Macedonia) but Jack London wants us to realize that animalism and death exist, are related, and ever present. Only love (the kind Hump and Maud develop) and work offer respite from this gloomy reality.London adds emphasis through his choice of name for the ship -- The Ghost (the boat piloted by Wolf Larsen, signifying how body and animalism dominate the soul during earthly life). Traveling through the soul (or \\"ghost\\"/spirit) is the best way to combat life's travails that spring up like sudden storms upon the sea.\\"The Sea Wolf\\" succeeds in a way that most great works of literature do -- a popular story that can be enjoyed by the masses but also containing deep parables for elevated hearts and minds. London's story falls into the great convoy of ocean adventures that include the biblical book of Jonah (check out the Vilna Gaon's superb commentary on Jonah -- Aderes Eliyahu) and Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" that teach timeless lessons.Wolf Larsen proves the truth of F.A. Hayek's theory that the strict rationalist tends to become a barbarian. I found my pro-life convictions challenged by Wolf's superficially appealing utilitarian explanation of why people guard their lives. It's true but not the whole story. I dove deeper into pro-life principles to refute Larsen's materialism uber alles. To wit, why would life (human adults) fight to preserve other life (unborn children) that, in most cases, it doesn't even know. Wouldn't adult life be afraid of what incoming life could potentially take away? The answer there is yes and that helps sustain the pro-abortion impulse. But the fact that there are adults willing, at cost to themselves, to seek protection for lives of coming generations that they have no acquaintance with suggests to the reasonable mind that the soul exists and is at work in such rescuers.This phenomenon doesn't exist in the animal world (animals only fight for their own kind). It shows that the soul makes humans qualitatively different from the rest of existence."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weyden, a pampered son of wealth, has lived a comfortable life of bookishness and learning in 1890's San Francisco. But everything changes when an accident on a ferry-trip across the bay leaves him floating helpless in a foggy sea. He is picked up by a schooner heading out to hunt seals, captained by the vicious Wolf Larsen. He is immediately pressed into service as cabin-boy aboard the Ghost, and learns a different kind of life than he has been raised to know. Wolf Larsen is not only brutal and overbearing to everyone he encounters, but he is also highly intelligent, having taught himself reading and mathematics. \\"Hump,\\" as Humphrey is called by the Captain, gains some measure of favor with the Captain as he is able to discuss philosophy and such things of which the rest of the crew is wholly ignorant.The characters and plot are intensely compelling, especially throughout the first half of the book where the drama is intense as he struggles to survive aboard the Ghost. His observations of the other crew members are interesting, as he discovers how different their lives are from his, and he feels pity for the things they lacked and which he took for granted. Also, the character of Captain Larsen is incredible; completely horrible yet you feel a sort of sympathy even for him.My biggest complaint with the story is at about its midpoint where a woman character enters the story. The struggle for life suddenly takes on a different meaning for Humphrey, as he now has someone other than himself to worry about, but this changes the whole mood of the story. The struggle is no longer filled with the painful drama, but practically turns into a romance, and a fairly sappy one, at that. It's also here that the book slows down with quite a few long passages about the mechanics and technical details of ships and sailing. But overall a very interesting tale of struggle - it's just unfortunate that the ending wasn't as strong."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.A complete masterpiece.You can't help but love the Wolf and his way of life. I think this explores the human soul and if truth were told I think many more people would behave this way if they were not burdened with consequences Whether they would admit it or not. This book would've even been much better if it could be written now.I would love to see the character's view points on women, sex, etc."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I find that this book is the best one London ever wrote. It questions many aspects of our lives. In addition to this he depict his characters so well, that you feel you know them. I have read all of Londons books and no one as well-written and alive as The Sea Wolf. He is truly a magician with words. This is art!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is very possibly the best book I have ever read. London describes his wonderful world at sea in a way that makes one feel as though he/she is actually there, and has known the characters since childhood. I strongly recommend, to all, this book. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books. London combines high-seas adventure with life's lessons as I believe no one else has done before or since. We all have a little &quot;Hump&quot; (good) and &quot;Wolf&quot; (evil) in all of us, and the struggles between these two seem to reflect those we all face inside ourselves. Hoist yer topsails, mate, and get ready for an adventure!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Normally when I read a book for class I only go as far as appreciating the quality of the book's prose or complexities, but I never thought of them as fun reads. The Sea Wolf was a fun read because of the thrilling adventure, which made it different from other literary books in which not a lot actually happens."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Are there really superman who are outside the bounds of society? Are there those who supersede the expectations and requirements of living within a community? Do some men and women rise above the herd and rule with impunity, out of their own inherent power?Wolf Larsen fancies himself one of these men. The captain of the seal hunting vessel &quot;The Ghost&quot; believes he is above all the norms of socitey. He is one who is not handicapped by social graces or education. He is one who does not buy into the hope of religion or eternal life. Is he an existentialist... a materialist... a nihilist? Maybe he is all of these...?Wolf Larsen uses people and possessions in a way that suits him best. He gains his advantage by doing whatever he feels will advance his postion in the moment. Wolf Larsen is a self educated and self possesed person, wrapped up in himself and the power he seems to wield.Humphrey Van Weydon is swept up into the surging storm of all that Wolf Larsen is. Van Weydon is a pampered socialite who has spent his life in the comfy confines of wealth and academia. He is well read and has a good understanding of philosophy. But doesn't really have a great handle of the practical aspects of life. Where the rubber meets the road, in philosophical ideals, he is lacking.One day, as he is riding as a passenger on a steamer across San Fransisco bay, his life is changed in a heartbeat.The steamer collides with another ship and Humphrey is swept overboard. His next moment of conciousness is on the deck of the seal hunting ship, &quot;The Ghost&quot;. This ship is captained by the infamous superman Wolf Larsen. From this point on two very different... but similar worlds collide.Van Weydon and Larsen spend many days discussing life and how we are supposed to live it. More and more through discussion and observation Van Weydon, the refined socialite, discovers he is just like Larsen, the grizzled violent sea captain. It is interesting to watch Van Weydon's desensitization to violence and the law of &quot;might makes right&quot;. When Van Weydon begins his voyage he fancies himself above all the fighting and violence of the sailors. But as he progresses in this trip he realizes he is one of them. Humphrey finds he cannot help but be swept up into the violence, and see that it is just as much a part of the world he came from as it is aboard the ship.I enjoyed the book, but it does drag a little in places. The ending leaves a little to be desired. But if you like action and philosophical musings you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a real classic.

This book is my favorite of all of Jack London's work I have read. I just finished it and I have the urge to read it all over again. It's a slightly wordy book but strangely it's an easy read, and after the first chapter you won't be able to put it down-trust me. The descriptive language of this novel just engrosses you in Jack London's sea worthy story. I was so involved in this book I got sea sick several times-you'll love this book. P.S. I told you so. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London, is a classic story of a gentleman from San Francisco who is rescued by a ruthless captain of a seal hunting schooner, the Ghost, bound for Japan. Humphrey Van Weyden comes aboard the Ghost not ever completing an honest day of work. He had no legs of his own, always relying on some other person than himself. Wolf Larsen, the rugged captain, was a cold-hearted old man whose life was completely based on fishing. Work, to him, was the only way to survive. Although well educated, he had no common decency and beat his crew.Through the entire story, Wolf Larsen teaches Mr. Van Weyden about truly living and not having someone live for you. By the end of the novel, Mr. Van Weyden had learned to live his life to the fullest. He realized how fortunate he had been. Wolf Larsen was dreaded by his entire crew and did not have a single companion. He was a lonely man who didn't know how to communicate, and therefore resorted to violence. At the end of the story, he finds himself alone and extremely depressed. This is a novel of love, loss and growth which I would suggest reading. After reading this novel you realize the importance of living life to the fullest."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"An excallent novel filled with great adventure.

Captain Wolf Larsen really had a reader going by his evil actions."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London, is one of the best books I've ever read! Come to think of it, it's the only book I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Not London's most famous story, and with reason, the Sea Wolf combines adventure narrative and commentary on life similar to some of London's other stories. Wolf Larson is a man with an indominatble will who would become a despot if given the chance. However, since the oppurtunity never arose, he must be content to rule over only his ship. While the people under his rule may be few, his power over them is complete. He is harsh, an atheist who views the human race as fermenting yeast. He is one of the strongest characters I have met in literature, and more dynamic than the others anyway. [I mean, Moby Dick's Ahab is strong-willed and rules his crew, but his character is one dimensional]. However, some of the key points in the story are difficult to believe, making the novel more surreal than London's other novels. So, while interesting and worth reading, I think Call of the Wild and White Fang are better written. I read this book when I was in eighth grade."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"As a psychological adventure novel, The Sea Wolf is the story of a writer, Humphrey Van Weyden shipwrecked in the ocean and rescued by the monstrous, brutal captain Wolf Larsen. Van Wedyen is soft, bookish character, and is astonished by the ugly strength and egoism of Larsen. Larsen forces Van Weyden to accompany the ship in its voyage across the ocean to hunt seals, and along the way he learns the toughness of nautical life, measured by the novel's repeated metaphors of callouses and scars on what were his soft, gentleman's hands, and what Larsen calls \\"standing on his own legs.\\"There is a weak romantic element tacked onto the story, when the crew rescues a from another shipwreck the poet Maud Brewster, a delicate aesthete and again a foil against Larsen's brutality. Brewster and Van Weyden fall in love in the course of their adventures but the book represses this until a last page kiss. Truly feeble.But the central failing is that this novel would have been better with a more interesting or believable antagonist. Although reviewers gush about the intensity of the character portrayal of Wolf Larsen -- really, he is not that interesting. Overly talky and one-dimensional despite that, Larsen spouts philosophical cliches (as does Van Weyden) as if he's in a late-night drunken argument in a freshman dorm room. Predictable, and his routine of menacing and bullying doesn't really shock as much as the author thinks it does.The novel's greatest strength is in the telling of the nautical adventure itself, the sailing of the schooner is wonderfully detailed and the descriptions of the techniques of seal-hunting quite interesting."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Having a Kindle helps one to discover books which otherwise would certainly have been missed. This is one of them.It's the tale of a rather bookish \\"gentleman\\" who is virtually press-ganged to work on a sailing ship. Through vicious hardship he is faced with the choice of survival (and in the process compromising his morality) or almost certain death. The main villain, if you will, is the Captain of the ship, who's physical strength and presence is overwhelming.Some of the language is a little archaic, but the Kindle dictionary didn't let me down.It's well worth the read. Get past the first ten pages, and you may find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"It has been many years since I've read any Jack London and it was good to get back in the adventure story groove. He does paint a good visual in one's mind of the settings even with the 19th century language. The story moves along pretty well although some of the flowery romantic speech seem to drag for me. The conclusion was sufficiently satisfying and it is suitable reading for young readers."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"When I first dipped into THE SEA WOLF, I was struck by its similarity to CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Humphrey van Weydon's ferry-steamer, The Martinez, is rammed by another ship in San Francisco Bay in a heavy fog. Van Weydon is rescued by Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal-hunter, The Ghost. Larsen refuses to take Van Weydon ashore, laughing at his offer of money. Once again, I am reminded of another famous book, MOBY DICK, and Larsen is Captain Ahab. Ruthless and single-minded, Larsen decides to make Van Weydon his cabin boy on this four month trip to provide seal pelts for fashionable American women. Van Weydon resists until Larsen catches hold of his arm and squeezes. A man of letters who freely admits never working a day in his life, Van Weydon does everything he's told from that point on, including aiding and abetting the Captain as he mistreats his crew.Early on we learn some of Larsen's motivation when he and Van Weydon have a literary discussion. We discover that Larsen is a literary bully. He's never spent a day in school, but he reads Shakespeare, Robert Browning and John Milton. London's theme becomes clear and Larsen and van Weydon argue about immortality, van Weydon declaring that man has a soul; Larsen retorting with a Scrooge-like \\"Bah!\\" And suddenly we have the first gleanings of an existentialist novel. If there were no God, how should man behave? Larsen, seeing evil everywhere he looks, decides he will do whatever is best for him personally.The conflict is not precisely good versus evil. Van Weydon is a weakling, a pampered rich man, a coward. There is also much to admire about Wolf Larsen. He outduels seven men during a mutiny. He's constantly reading, constantly trying to understand. When Van Weydon's story arc begins to ascend--he learns seamanship, rebuilds the ship when its masts are destroyed--we can't help but give Larsen a bit of credit. Larsen never took no for an answer, no task was too difficult.Another interesting element in the book is London's fledgling steps toward women's liberation. Van Weydon falls in love with another castaway, Maud Brewster, and together they overcome storms, isolation on a small seal rookery, and sabotage.I guess I knew London was a better writer than the man who wrote CALL OF THE WILD (His short story \\"To Build a Fire\\" is one of my favorites), but I wasn't expecting a philosophical discourse wrapped around a sea adventure."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Great book! I had never read Jack London before but after visiting his burnt down estate in Northern California I became interested in his writing. This book is excellent, entertaining and fast paced. The kindle edition seems not to be missing any pages. Great Free Download."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Caution: The Sea Wolf is full of examples of man's inhumanity to man. If you are easily upset by callous disregard of the health and safety of others, you will not enjoy this book. Further, the book describes many of the worst abuses of the ways that seals were hunted for their fur.On the surface, The Sea Wolf is a story about seal hunting expeditions to the Bering Sea. Beneath the surface, this book is an allegory about the nature of a human's life.The Sea Wolf is one of those novels that explores philosophy as its primary purpose. The idea is to take abstract philosophical ideas, and make the philosophies come to life by putting them into interesting circumstances. So while there's an adventure tale on the surface of The Sea Wolf, that story is there merely to provide examples of the philosophical points. So don't be surprised if the adventure falters from time to time in favor of developing the philosophical examples. In the Sea Wolf, action is included primarily for character development rather than the reader's visceral entertainment.In this book, Jack London was obviously fascinated by the new theories of Social Darwinism that grew out of Darwin's Origin of Species, indicating that the most capable people survived and prospered while the least capable fell by the wayside. Another influence was Nietzsche's concept of the amoral superman. A third influence was Milton's poem, Paradise Lost, and the role that Lucifer played in that story. To explore these points, Mr. London developed Captain Wolf Larsen, owner of the seal hunting schooner, Ghost. Captain Larsen is as amoral and strong in body and mind as you can imagine. Think of him as 100 percent traditional masculinity.For a counterpoint, Mr. London looked to the traditional concepts of the Christian gentleman. Such a man is concerned with matters of the soul, helping others, ideas, and pursuing perfection. Taken to its extreme, such a man becomes almost like a woman. To develop this contrast, Mr. London uses the character of Humphrey van Weydon (known as \\"sissy\\" van Weydon to his friends while growing up) who is a literary critic.The story evolves through putting Humphrey van Weydon into Larsen's world. The book's key theme is that a true man combines the virtues of a Christian gentleman with the masculine strength and independence of his sex's superior qualities over many women (like a successful jousting knight), but this true man can only be completed by the company and spiritual connection to a good woman (much like the medieval knight had to have his lady as a source of platonic love). As you can imagine, this theme will not inspire those looking for a nonstop, heart-pounding adventure tale.The power of the story comes in the book's first half, when you will not know what to expect next from Wolf Larsen. If you are like me, you will feel a little involuntary discomfort every time Larsen comes near van Weydon . . . or anyone else, for that matter. The book's second half will be less appealing to most male readers, but will be the more appealing part for many female readers.Many readers will find the coincidences that bring the characters together when they do to be more than a stretch, and draw away from the story. I suggest that you look upon these circumstances as being intended to portray the hand of Providence, in Mr. London's way of thinking.The book's strength is the way that the van Weydon character develops. You will come to appreciate his trials and the ways he handles them. If you find that you don't like that character after 75 pages, I suggest that you read no further unless you are otherwise enjoying the book.May all your endeavors be worthy of your highest ideals and potential!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London's stated intention in writing this book was to place a man and a woman, both intellectual, well-to-do, yet socially soft (physically and psychologically). into the very challenging world of a seal hunting boat and watch them strive for survival. In this context, he has created one of the most fascinating characters of all literature, Wolf Larson, the inhuman captain of the &quot;Ghost.&quot; Larson takes great delight in the suffering he brings to Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster, but they steadily grow to meet the challenge. This book can be read and enjoyed on two levels: As a rousing sea adventure, or as a discourse on society and sociology. Jack London is my favorite author -- I am in the process of collecting first editions of all fifty of his books -- and yet I find Sea Wolf ranks head and shoulders above all his other works. It could explain why this story has been turned into a film seven times, more than any of his his other stories, including The Call of the Wild. Two of cinema's great Wolf Larsons have been Edward G. Robinson and Charles Bronson."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"It's a real shame that Jack London coupled one of his most fascinating and full-blooded characters with a stinker of a love story which carries no conviction.Maud Brewster, like many of London's female characters (from Skeet, Curly and Mercedes in The Call of the Wild to Beth, Alice and Collie in White Fang), is underdeveloped, a mite hysterical, and completely dependent on the male characters. Without much in terms of psychological complexity, Maud provides a poor, poor reason for Humphrey Van Weyden to rebel against Wolf Larsen.The first half of this book and its final few chapters are superb because London's male characters and their struggles are vividly portrayed. The knife-whetting contest between Mugridge and Hump; the homoerotic segment where Hump tends to a naked and wounded Larsen; Johnson and Leach's struggle against Larsen's iron fist -- London obviously loves these characters and gives them the light of day. Maud is another story.In any event, the first half of this book is the top-notch tale of a Miltonic hero's slow slide from power, and the ending a moving fulfillment of this character's destiny (life, in the end, *is* yeast...but a savagely active and beautiful yeast, at that). Another one of London's terrible worlds unfolding its brutal majesty before us -- and, of course, another book inexplicably relegated to the children's section of many a book store."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weydon is an affluent gentleman living in San Francisco during the early 1900's. Because of his inherited father's wealth, he hasn't had to work a day in his life, has gotten a first class education, and spends most of his time reading and discussing the latest novels. One foggy day as he travels across the bay to visit a friend there is a collision, and he is cast into the sea. After being rescued, he discovers that he is aboard a seal-hunting ship bound for Japan with a cold-hearted captain. This captain, known as the Sea Wolf, has no respect for Humphrey's money and decides to keep him aboard to be used for work in the galley. The Sea Wolf also has no respect for life, viewing it as fermenting yeast with the most brutal aspects of natural selection in play. He is a self-educated man and talks with Humphrey about life, philosophy, literature, et cetera. London describes their situation as \\"relations...between king and jester.\\" A gripping tale set on the high seas, this book will keep your eyes locked on Humphrey's changing life, and the Sea Wolf's deadly ways.I recommend this book because many things are taken for granted in today's rich American society, not least of which being the ability to stand on your own two legs. Most of the modern population depends on others for survival, and this dependence has made us weak. When Humphrey Van Weydon begins to stand on his own he goes through a considerable change, as most people do when faced with a crisis. This change can make or break someone, but like the old adage goes, \\"whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\\" While this story is filled with suspense and amazement, the intriguing philosophical concepts arouse your mind and keep the gears turning. The Sea Wolf is an excellent novel, a classic in every sense of the word, and one that teaches much about the human struggle for survival and self-improvement."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Many consider The Sea-Wolf by Jack London to be among the best sea stories ever written. I found it a moving and epic tale. Not only did it achieve great popular and literary success, but it also was effectively realized in several cinematic versions (most recently as a TV mini-series). The story ranks in the great tradition of one of London's literary influences, Herman Melville, while I saw similarities to another story of a life changed by sea voyage, captured by Rudyard Kipling in Captains Courageous.Drawing upon his experiences seal hunting in the North Pacific, London created a story with a lot of realism. He put himself and his contradictory nature into the two opposing characters, the captain Wolf Larsen, a ruthless and rugged individualist, the superman, and Humphrey van Weyden, a weak, but highly cultivated and virtuous gentleman. It is in the clash of these two forces that London gives vent to his innermost struggles: idealism versus materialism, conscience versus instinct, desire versus soul."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is a kind of character study of extremes. The viewpoint of the story is the nice guy's, Humphrey, a literary critic who is propelled into a strange new world dominated by an extremely unnice guy, Wolf Larsen, captain of the sailing ship Ghost near the end of the sailing days. Via a shipwreck, 'Hump' becomes the cabin boy on the Ghost.The Wolf is an archtype of pure amoral power, but 'tainted' with the intellect to observe and describe his own situation. From that perspective Wolf finds it amusing to command and torment the crew of his vessel, and to play intellectual games with the &quot;Hump&quot;. Wolf uses and kills his crew members quickly enough, and promotes the cabin boy to mate after a failed mutiny. In the end the good guys prevail...Actually, there's lots of interesting detail in the story, and London is skilled enough at his writing craft, but I felt that overall it sort of fails. As a morality play, the favorable outcome is basically an accident. Actually, the most interesting character is only mentioned in passing--Wolf Larsen's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the steamship that attacks the Ghost. He's only vaguely portrayed as much nastier than Wolf, but apparently more successful, but we never get to meet him. Made me feel London was something of a tease, to make such efforts to portray an evil character while only hinting of one that was even more evil.(This review is actually of an older paperback edition from 1965.)"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Having lived at sea for months at a time, I could relate to this book. You take a civilized man of letters and throw him in with a crew that is about as civilized as the inmates of your local maximum-security prison, and the result is a great story.

This is one of London's best stories. -Roger Weston, author of ..."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"What a satisfying read. This is one of those books I remember reading back in high school and actually enjoying, so I thought I would pick it up again. It is every bit as good as I remembered. And so much more nuanced that I remember. There is a reason why this book is a classic. The main character, Wolf Larsen, is a fierce and fearsome character who holds so tightly to a Darwinian viewpoint on life. The strong survive only as long as they stay strong and it is their right to manipulate and observe what happens to the weak. And he holds unwaveringly to that viewpoint. That viewpoint leads him to deny anything after this life, almost anything useful in this life, and almost certainly anything useful in another person's life. Humphrey Van Weyden, his unwilling companion, holds the opposite viewpoint, that life, even the life of others no matter how weak they are, is worthwhile. No one should be manipulated. And, just like Larsen, he holds to this view so strongly that even when Larsen is in his power near the end of the novel he will not harm him.The two characters do not at all grow fond of each other, and that is as it should be for two characters of such differing viewpoints on life would not likely be friends. But they do fascinate each other. The debates they have with each other throughout the book are fascinating and absolutely spot-on. These are exactly what people with these various viewpoints would say, and what makes it even more interesting is that these two viewpoints are the two most often expressed in our American culture today. To see these two go at it is to see the two sides of American thinking war with each other. And both sides have valid points that cannot really be argued. Which are you going to side with? It becomes even more fascinating with the introduction of a woman into the story that both characters are attracted to. We all know that the woman is going to end up with the nice guy at the end, but just her presence leads the two men into a whole new line of arguments that is great to follow.Up to this point, Jack London's story is perfect. But then, in the last 20% of the book Van Weyden makes his escape and from then on the book is comparatively boring. Oh, but that first 80% of the book makes it all worth it. This commentary on culture is still relevant today over a century after it was written. It still seems fresh. It still seems to fit in perfect to the way we live our lives. Absolutely recommended!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London is pretty famous for his adventure stories \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild,\\" but \\"The Sea Wolf\\" is less-well-known.

Interesting story, quality writing, and deep character development. For me, this is one of those books [another is Old Man And the Sea, perhaps The Great Gatsby] I will read again and again over the decades. There are precious few books I would re-read, but re-reading this one and others is like listening to an old friend re-tell a story of his or her while we share a particularly pleasing libation and pick at some warmed cashews. Tangentially, as I read this, I could see Gregory Peck in the role of Wolf Larsen."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf contains familiar themes of other Jack London books. Man (or animal) from a comfortable background thrown into in a life and death struggle with the forces of nature due to a bad twist of fate.Also the Wolf Larsen characters philosophizing in this book led many to believe that the book Might is Right (which Anton Lavey later plaigarized and renamed The Satanic Bible) was ghostwritten by Jack London. I dont believe London wrote Might is Right because after doing the math he would have had to have been a teenager when he wrote it however I do think its possible that he read it and the rants in it may have influenced him and his creation of Wolf Larsen. I saw a documentary on Lavey where he talked about what a profound influence the Wolf Larsen character in the Sea Wolf was on his own personal outlook.Overall this is one of my favorite books. Anybody that appreciates Jack Londons other work should read this."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I have read white fang, call of the wild and a few other of jack london's short stories and have enjoyed them all.

It is a very harsh book, horrible actions occur and heartbreaking happen in the story.

I found the first few pages rather cheesy, but very soon London's character of Wolf Larsen, a brutal and all-powerful sea captain, changed all that. I found him one of the most disturbing and forceful characters in all of literature--a sort of Hitleresque beast, yet created almost thirty years before anyone ever heard of Hitler.Contrasted with Wolf Larsen is the main character, appropriately named Humphrey, a wimp extraordinaire--who falls prey to the power and control of Larsen, and slowly learns to find himself and his strength in Larsen's midst. However, for maybe the first thirty or forty pages of their interaction, the book seemed a bit over-philosophical, almost teenage in its grand discussion of \\"life\\" and \\"morality\\" and \\"humanity\\" and \\"death.\\" But then, somehow, Jack London gripped me anyway, and his created world of ultra-violence and distorted masculinity, where physical strength and personal force are everything, became all-too-real, all-too-believable, and all-too-powerful. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Jack London!Unfortunately, though, the book peters out in the last few chapters. I don't want to give away the ending, but suffice to say that I felt London just couldn't sustain the story. Yes, intellectually the ending works, but emotionally it doesn't. It turned wooden--and false. I found myself bored at the end, and I hoped that London would somehow redeem it. Alas, he didn't.But in spite of the cheesy ending the book is still unique--and a worthwhile read. I have trouble imagining anyone writing such a book today."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The book was boring and did not hold my interest"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"\\"The Sea Wolf\\" is probably the most homoerotic novel written by an allegedly straight auhtor. I stress the word ALLEGEDLY. Jack London was a notorious womanizer. He was married twice and cheated on both wives. Yet his female characters are very bland and deprived of any kind of sexual appeal. Yes, London had mated with many women. But he did not understand women. He suffered from the infamous Madonna-Whore complex. There were those \\"disposable\\" women in bars and seaports, whose names he never bothered to remember. And then there were women like his second wife Charmian Kitteridge, whom he deified. Charmian served as the prototype for his Maud Brewster. Jack London uses very reserved, proper diction to describe the physical attributes of Maud Brewster. She comes across as a well-preserved old maid, a cold Dresden doll. London concentrates on her pale face, frail figure and soft hair. There is no mention of her hips or breasts. You don't see any skin below the neck. And then you go back and reread the passage in which Vay Weyden takes care of Larsen after the mutiny incident. The intense erotic language that the author uses while describing naked male body leaves no room for doubt - men were of more interest to him than women."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The book is stupid.Don't read it.The plot basically involves a character named Hump (suggestive of London's sexual frustration?) who is verbose and stupid. Eventually he meets a girl and becomes monosyballic and even more stupid.The book is rife with technical detail about sailing, both boring and factually wrong. The author has the people doing things that one would not do (for example, in a heavy storm, the people tighten the sheets, resulting in a firm sail, which would in real life result in the boat capsizing ~ what they should have done is released one of the sails or rigged it half-mast). The boat is tedious for all of its verbosity and technical detail, which, ironically enough, adds nothing to the story and is factually wrong.London is an idiot. If I was not sure of it before reading this book, I am now. Fortunately, he realizes he is an idiot, and so roughly two thirds of this book consists of quotations from more successful, better writers.London repeatedly has the main character talk about how he loves the body of the capitan, and how he wants a relationship...seriously throwing the masculinity of the protaganist into question.Overall, this book offended me. It was so poorly written that my eyes hurt. I feel like my IQ dropped 40 points as a direct result of reading this drivel. Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is probably one of the best examples of character devolopment that I have ever read. London paints a pictures of Humphrey, Wolf Larson, and the rest so that the act as real people. It is also topped off with a great story of adventure and romance. However, the most important point of the book is the good versus evil, or the one who believes in God versus the one who does not. The reader struggles with the same questions placed on Humphrey until the good finally triumphs in the end."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This book is a classic, and with good reason. Wolf Larsen is perhaps the best-developed character I have ever encountered in a novel. The story never lets up, and you will not be able to put the book down. Overall, it's a very exciting tale of the sea. Toward the end, however, the story becomes more of a romance. I didn't like this change of pace right at the end of such an exciting novel, and that's why I only give it 4 stars. But read it anyway, because it really is great!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I can't say anything bad at all about this fine novel which exhibits great storytelling and wonderful characters. &quot;Hump,&quot; also known as Humphrey Van Weyden, a wealthy and sophisticated gentlemen, is forced to endure the hard life of a sailor after being thrown from his own ship.

He is a man that believes there is no good in man. Just an insatiable hunger for more. This book really made me think &quot;Hey Jack London isn't that far off the mark.

I would suggest this book to anyone that can read."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I couldn't put it down. I do believe it is one of London's best.

He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.' For him, might is right and weakness wrong.The master's vision on the world and mankind\`Why should I be parsimonious with (human) life which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than there are ships for them. On the land, you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remains more poor people dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which is life destroyed). Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?'The challengeThe master's \`materialism' is challenged \`by the indomitability and moral grandeur of the soul' (conscience): \`Where was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls?'The master's \`unmorality' (\`the culmination of all savagery') comes out of the dark through the eyes of a prefect anti-Nietzschean hero: a woman. At first, she is also fascinated by the barbarous force. But this fascination turns into terror. His \`unmorality' veils only destruction and auto-destruction.Evaluation and relevancyThe reign of the Nietzschean hero is forcefully and masterfully evocated, with now and then some outbursts of sensationalism (e.g. the shark incident). But, from the moment a girl makes her apparition, the quality of the novel sinks rapidly to the level of a \`better' three-penny love story. Superlatives are not enough; they have to be repeated: \`the finest product of the finest civilization'.The mentality of the barbarous hero continues to flourish in our \`civilized' world, where the powerful few show benign neglect for individual lives and kill wantonly via their long arms (army, intelligence services) all those who threaten their omnipotence and interests.Jack London wrote an integer, realistic, but not a perfect (sometimes too sentimental) masterpiece.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"A young attorney finds the life he has always known dissappears as the coast of California disappears in the fog.

Jack London had been my favorite author in my youth mostly because I like animals so much, and thus enjoyed his more creature focused books and shorts. The Sea Wolf introduces us to Wolf Larsen, possibly one of the five greatest characters I have encountered in all of my reading. I can't say that London paints Wolf Larsen as a realistic man because he is superhuman. He is a God, a Ghost, a Guru, an absolute master of his universe.Then the female comes in.The book simply goes to pot. What was building as a tense study of refinement versus the laws of survival simply disappears. The book goes out horribly.The book builds a vast resevoir of intensity and drama, but the dam never bursts. The water just flows back into the ocean. The incredible power of the first two-thirds of the book is forgotten.So in summary, read this book for the character of Wolf Larsen, and for the narrator, who London does a more than admirable job with.

The novel is a great adventure similar to all of the others of its kind (Moby Dick, Kidnapped, Treasure Island)but has a dark, sparkling gleam all of its own. I found this book to be a fascinating excursion into darkness. Even though it did evoke a lot of the feelings those books brought I found that it reminded me a lot of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as well as Kipling's Captains Courageous. The character of Wolf Larsen has to go down as one of the greatest literary villains ever. Just when you thought he might be redeemable he goes one step further with his wickedness and even laughs about it! The book was full of Jack London's typical adventure prose and I often felt as if I were on the Ghost (Larsen's ship) and I could feel the cold of the ocean and wind as well as the pains the crew suffered aboard it. The book kept me at a nervous concern for the main protagonists. I knew everything would be fine but at times...Jack London's prose often surprised me as I read The Sea Wolf. Of course most of it was just like his other work (The Call of the Wild for instance or To Build A Fire) but there were occasionally brief extracts which made me feel that the story was written by someone more modern. I have to admit that Wolf Larsen's continuing drive into darkness made me think a lot of Conrad's evil madman and while Heart of Darkness may have won out on the actually darkness of the soul, The Sea Wolf wins for greatest brutality and cruelty. This is a novel you will enjoy if you like adventure on the high seas. Jack London will transport you onto the Ghost and you will feel the drama (and trauma) brought about by one of the vilest creations in all of literature. Do yourself a favor and read The Sea Wolf. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I've read The Sea Wolf a few times in my life. Each time I do, I enjoy it more and more. It's a really well written story.

It was interesting that the captain was so brutal yet so intelligent. The very cogent arguments that he makes for his violent, non-caring life style really causes the thoughtful reader to sit and think about one's own beliefs.

The narration angle was awesome, the characters very exciting, the event and scenery projected into my mind as I went from page to page was riveting. With all that, the most amazing thing about this book is that Mr. London could write an entire book about life at sea with a deranged captain and dinghy crew, actually draw you into that small vessel as if you were living, working, eating and sailing with those men, and yet not a single profane word.

The book is superbly written, but for a book to be included in a list such as the Easton Press collection of &quot;The 100 greatest books ever written&quot;, it should be able to hold its own not only for style, but also for the tale itself, the &quot;myth&quot; behind it. The Sea Wolf does a fantastic job of building such a myth for about two-thirds of the novel. Then Ms Brewster appears, and suddenly the plot peters out. What begins as a gripping, sobering account of life at sea under a ruthless captain and a brutal crew, ends as a bland, unconvincing account of childish romance and &quot;survival&quot;.

Were Wolf Larsen's headaches, psychological state, numbness, tingling and weakness symptoms of lead poisoning from the solder that sealed the Ghost's tinned food supply? Was Jack London trying to show Victorians how to survive in life-and-death situations instead of making the same mistakes as Franklin's well-read, materialistic crew who refused to give up their silver plates and crystal decanters after they were shipwrecked? Was London trying to show that even physical weakness, inexperience and lack of skill can all be overcome by cool-headed decision making, and an ability to adapt to novel and challenging situations?Wikipedia was used as a source contributing to the ideas expressed in this review."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The plot centers around a young aristocratic man Humphrey Van Weyden, who is shipwrecked and picked up by a passing boat heading to Japan to hunt seal. The boat is led by Captain Wolf Larsen, a cynical man free of any moral beliefs. The atrocities committed on this boat, the Ghost, shape Van Weyden into a new man, tougher and more in tune with reality. He is no longer \`Sissy' Van Weyden, he is a true man.The prevailing theme in this novel is the concept of life. Is it valuable, something to be guarded at all costs? Or is it valuable only to the one it belongs to? \\"'Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon itself?'\\" Larsen asks. Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen have many conversations about morals and the point (or pointlessness) of life. Wolf Larsen is free of any of the bonds and conceptions of society. He realizes that life is fleeting, any achievement you make in the long run matters not. He uses the analogy of yeast to describe his views on life. \\"\`I believe that life is a mess...It is like a yeast, a ferment, a thing that moves and may move for a minute, an hour, a year, or a hundred years, but that in the end will cease to move. The big eat the little that they may continue to move, the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength. The lucky eat the most and move the strongest, that is all.'\\". Van Weyden, on the other hand, has a hard time loosing his hold on the moral codes of society, and fights vainly for the concept of right and wrong. When asked what the value of life was, Van Weyden is speechless: \\"Value of life? How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic. That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned. But when he challenged the truism I was speechless.\\" In the end, Wolf Larsen is eaten up by his own self, and in this way, Van Weyden's concept of life comes out on top.This story was told in the first person, from Van Weyden's point of view. London makes the story and characters very believable. His first-hand knowledge of sailing, the wealthy, and the working man provide an authentic feel. He draws you into the story with the right amount of detail and dialog. London describes Wolf Larsen's eyes as being \\"...that baffling protean gray which is never twice the same; which runs through many shades and colorings like intershot silk in sunshine; which is gray, dark and light, and greenish gray, and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea. They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises...\\". The end of the book also had a very nice twist to it, when the most powerful man in the novel is reduced to depending on others to take of him."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"London's great sea adventure depicts an epic struggle between brute force and pampered entitlement. Its narrator, Humphrey Van Weyden, is a professional critic and the \\"Dean of American Letters the Second\\" (a sly reference to William Dean Howells). When the ferry across the Golden Gate span capsizes, Van Weyden is rescued from the ocean, and then kidnapped as an unwilling deckhand, by a schooner en route to the seal-hunting islands of Japan. The captain of the schooner, Wolf Larsen, is a despotic beast who scorns civility and whose idea of law is to serve his own power as dictator--his self-proclaimed \\"piggishness.\\"Like all of London's fiction, this novel is an allegory, and \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is as much a philosophical treatise as it is a sea adventure. Against Humphrey's aristocratic pretensions and effete scholarship, London pits Wolf's vulgar blend of social Darwinism and primeval strength. \\"You would like to go back to the land,\\" Wolf argues, \\"which is a special place for your kind of piggishness. It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes.\\"There is much of this type of banter and didacticism (in a literary form abused to perfection later in the century by the likes of Ayn Rand and Robert Heinlein). Throughout these often one-sided debates, Wolf overwhelms the arguments of his captive opponent--and this in spite of the fact that London meant to portray the captain-tyrant as an example of the dangers of \\"the superman philosophy\\" as posited by Nietzsche. The tension that results as Wolf even gets the better of his author makes the captain the more interesting of the pair--and one of the most memorable characters invented for fiction.A shift occurs midway through the story, however, when the crew of the schooner rescues another castaway, the poet Maud Brewster, who is likewise held captive. It's easy to see why many readers and critics feel that the introduction of this \\"romantic interest\\" detracts from the tale; as a love story, it fails miserably (never more so than when they are shipwrecked again, on a desert island).On an allegorical level, however, it's a subversive and somewhat brilliant intervention. If Wolf exemplifies brute strength and Humphrey typifies unearned decadence, then Maud bowls over both worldviews as the representative of art and civilization: \\"Books and brains, and bravery,\\" as Wolf leeringly acknowledges in spite of himself; \\"a bluestocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief.\\" Humphrey hardens under the labor of his duties, Wolf softens under the influence of his newly captured muse, and neither extreme suffices in the face of moderation. From this point, it doesn't take much to figure out who will win this three-way battle of wills."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"So imagine taking the real world brutality that London's wolves or dogs face in his Youkon novels. Now add that survival of the fittest and the most banal might make right themes from nature and apply them to a seafaring novel. That combination makes this novel.The main protagonist is the victim of a ferry shipwreck near San Fransico and is swept out to sea where he is picked up by Captain Wolf Larson's sealing vessel. Larson refuses to returm him or to let him board another nearby vessel heading into San Fransico and so he is forced to serve on the vessel. He is in every way the antithesis of the sealers: weak, educated, literary, and not accostomed to manual labor. Half the story is the growth of the protagonist into more of a \\"man\\" through his experiences.The genius of this novel however is in the character Wolf Larson, the ship's captain. He is stronger, meaner, and smarter than any other man he has met. By his own might he rules the ship. He is also well read and self educated, and his literary knowledge bonds the two main characters together. Larson takes the essence of nature, where the strongest rule and dominate, and applies it to man. Man is a part of nature and therefor not subject to any higher laws. Larson intimidates, beats up, murders, and takes any other measures of strength necessary to rule his vessel. In the end, even when he is dying and needs the protagonist to have any hope of escape, he still tries to commit murder to his would-be saviours. Why? Just to prove he still can. Its a brilliant study of humanity and a dichotomy of beliefs in the very nature of humanity versus nature.A must read for any fan of London, American literature, or just a very good read (like me)."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London tells the story of Humphrey Van Weyden, a literary critic, who is lost overboard and picked up by a seal hunting ship. Instead of returning the shivering man to 'civilization' Wolf Larson, the captain of the ship, forces Van Weyden to work aboard the ship cleaning pots and pans. Although this book has a lot of action and moves fairly quickly, the best parts were the dialouges between the self-educated captain and Humphrey. The captain, as Jack London puts it, is not moral or immoral but is just unmoral, or doesn't have set morals. He doesn't believe in a soul and believes in fulfilling desires. He says that if a man does good it is simply because his desire to do good outweighs the desire to do bad. Van Weyden does believe in the soul and the two man continually philosophize. Overall one of the themes is about the working class being subject to the 'higher' society. My only complaint is that the captain's personality seems to change from the first half of the book to the second half. Also, I happened to appreciate the captain's viewpoint when he was supposed to be the antagonist and wicked man. I don't think that was the author's intention so I hold that against him. All ina all, the themes are so much more interesting and the first half of the book is written better than the second half."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I was pleasently surprised with how quick I received the book and the price I paid.I will be loking for additinal Jack London books in the near futureLarry"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Great Jack London work. A nice departure from the Yukon. Very well written characters and progression through the tale."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"- nothing in the mind that did not pass through one of the five senses. This is the typical attitude of the 19th century scientific materialist. Wolf Larsen, the cruel captain of the ship on which the innocent gentleman, Humphrey van Weyden, is brought by a whim of destiny, is an amazingly strong and savage example of this attitude. An attitude that is still incredibly vivid in the 21st century. People who can't believe in or perceive anything that is non-substantial, out of reach of their sensual capabilities, find their strongest and most concentrated example in Wolf Larsen. From this viewpoint the world is nothing but a more or less differentiated chaos of 'the strong eats the weak' underpinned with some so-called fortifying philosophy and a (maybe misunderstood) Darwin.A bit disappointed i was that the author offered no guideline how to change the attitude of this kind of people, how not only to defend oneself against this dismal philosophy but maybe open a small crevice to the other-world for all the Wolf Larsen's out there. Probably everyone has to find out by oneself, everyone has to go through such a confrontation with this mental (and sometimes physical) crudeness and, if he doesn't perish in such an encounter, he might arise from it more strongly as Humphrey van Weyden, the sissyish gentleman-hero in this story, does.At any rate Jack London once again shows his talent to desribe the chemistry between people who seem to share nothing at all, the transformations of souls in a merciless environment, depicting souls which don't believe even in the existence of souls.chapter 3, p.24: A laugh went up at my appearance - ...a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities from natures that knew neither courtesy not gentleness. / ...The eyes [of Wolf Larsen] ...They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises... eyes that could brood with the hopeless somberness of leaden skies, that could snap and crackle points of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword, that could grow chill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften and be all adance with lovelights, intense and masculine...chapter 5, p.44: \\"...By the way, do you believe in the immortal soul ?\\" - His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul. But it was an illusion. Far as it might have seemed, no man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul, or seen it at all; of this I am convinced. It was a very lonely soul, I was to learn, that never unmasked, though at rare moments it played at doing so.chapter 7, p.62: [Wolf Larsen:] \\"...Of course life is valueless, except to itself. And i can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now - to myself. ...what is this condition in which i find myself ? This joy of living ? This exultation of life ? This inspiration, I may well call it ? It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one's digestion, when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge, and all goes well. It is the bribe for living, the champagne of the blood, the effervescence of the ferment, that makes some men think holy thoughts and other men to see God...\\"chapter 8, p.63f: ...I am convinced that he [Wolf Larsen] is the perfect type of the primitive man born a thousand years or generations too late and an anchronism in this culminating century of civilization. He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type. ...There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship. His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart. They are more like children to him ...Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made.chapter 10, p.79: ...Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. The white-skinned, fairhaired savages who created that terrible pantheon were of the same fiber as he. The frivolity of the laughter-loving Latins is no part of him. When he laughs it is from a humor that is nothing else than ferocious. But he laughs rarely; he is too often sad. / p.81: ..He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.chapter 16, p.121: [Wolf Larsen:]\\"... He is living more royally than any man for'ard, though he does not know it. For he has what they have not - purpose, something to do and be done, an all-absorbing end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope that he may kill me. Really, Hump, he is living deep and high. I doubt that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly envy him sometimes when I see him raging at the summit of passion and sensibility\\""},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London relates a probing analysis of the captain of the sealing ship Ghost, Wolf Larsen, through the eyes of shipmate Humphrey Van Weyden. Van Weyden had been plucked from the freezing waters of San Francisco bay by Larsen after the ferry boat he was a passenger on, capsized after a collision in the fog. Larsen, ever the opportunist, forces Van Weyden to work on the ship. Van Weyden a book critic and \\"gentleman\\" has never done a days work in his life.Through the insights of Van Weyden we see the cruel, combative, physically imposing and yet highly intelligent Larsen act as if a god over his domain, the Ghost. He holds the fate of his crew in his hands and murders those who he deems unfit. Under the tutelage of Larsen, Van Weyden becomes a capable sailor. After 5 more castaways are rescued at sea including a woman, Maud Brewster, Van Weyden and the woman make their escape by stealing a sealing boat. Van Weyden and Brewster are to fall in love and are stranded on a deserted island. Through a quirk of fate they are again confronted by Larsen, who is marooned and shipwrecked on the same island. There they observe his ultimate and deserved demise.The book was tied up into too neat a little package for my taste. London spends an awful lot of time, and boringly so, on his philosophies of life.

This book has a lot of description, character and plot. Don't look for intriguing plot or simplistic description. This book has quite a bit of underlying theme.

He is saved from drowning by a passing sailing vessel, the Ghost, captained by Wolf Larsen, on its way to the seal hunting grounds in the far Pacific. To his dismay, &quot;Hump's&quot; request to be put ashore are ignored. Instead he is held captive, put to hard labor, and made to suffer greatly under the brutal leadership of the fearsome Wolf.Wolf Larson is one of literature's most unique characters, and the mystery of what motivates him and what atrocities he'll commit next compel the reader on. He is not the stereotypical pirate ogre, but rather a well-read, deep-thinking intellectual whose best thoughts justify--in his mind--his callous behavior. He is a firm believer in natural selection and survival of the fittest. On the Ghost, he is at the top of the food chain.As the months pass, Hump is changed by the sea and physical exertion, earning 1st mate status. After plenty of excitement and drama, the plot twists when Maud Brewster, a beautiful young writer, is rescued from a lifeboat adrift a following a storm. Hump is smitten, but so is Wolf. The story plays out well to climax, with classy prose and the best description of sailing I've ever read. A good choice for all adventurers and anyone who loves the sea. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed this story out of a Jack London collection that I recently picked up. Not being familiar with this novel before, having only readTHE CALL OF THE WILDandWHITE FANGpreviously, I didn't really know what to expect with this one. An adventure story was what I was looking for, but I got much more than that. Rather than providing the simple pleasure of following one of London's wonderfully imagined characters through a life-threatening and horizon-expanding adventure, this book provided an intensely thought inspiring look into the human psyche that I won't soon forgot.Published at a time when 'social Darwinism' was just beginning to be thoughtfully and rationally spelled out as far as how it affects and guides our lives and those around us, THE SEA WOLF uses its characters to explore the ramifications of that school of thought. Humphrey van Weydon is the protagonist of this book and presents a less-than-appealing hero in his weakness, dependency, and fear. The antagonist, Wolf Larson, is the unyielding, strong, rational, and brutal sea captain whose brutality simply cannot have a place in a civilized world. As these two drastically different characters clash over everything from human rights to self appreciation to the existence of an afterlife, the reader is treated to a wonderful exposition of what it means to live and what our social positions/obligations should be. Most likely, you'll find yourself sometimes agreeing with both characters' viewpoints from time to time, making this book fun to read for more than just an adventure tale.While it is undeniable that Wolf Larson represents much of what is abhorrent and violent about primal man, most readers will find themselves very attracted to him throughout this book. Something about the self-reliant, individualist, materialist, survival-of-the-fittest attitude and way of life is pleasing to the 'self-made' man. While we cringe at the thought of needless cruelty to others, much of the Wolf's philosophical rantings ring true. Whether London wished to show that the unsympathetic pure materialist has no place in modern civilization or that bringing good ideas (like Individualism) to their extremes can be disastrously evil, he succeeded in creating one of the most intriguing and memorable characters I've ever come across.On the other extreme is the narrator of the story, Humphrey. Here we have a weakling intellectual that has 'stood on his father's legs' his whole life and apparently couldn't look out for himself if his life depended on it. To both his surprise and the reader's, it turns out that when it really comes down to it, he can. Brutally encouraged by Wolf to 'man-up', 'Hump' finds a strength (and eventually a self respect) that he never knew he had. Here we have the civilized and progressive literary critic (ouch!) being cast into an extremely uncivilized environment and learning that what he understood about the human condition doesn't exactly hold true. More familiar, and thus less intriguing, his character eventually comes to represent the triumph of civilization and moral superiority over dog-eat-dog barbarism.Anyway, in my mind, this work actually surpasses THE CALL OF THE WILD and WHITE FANG as far as intellectual stimulation, and I am surprised that it is not more popular. Very highly recommended for all readers!!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I first read THE SEA WOLF at age 12, 40 years ago, and thought it was terrific, for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews: the exciting sea story, the juxtaposition of the values of western civilization with those of the refined thug Wolf Larson, the growth of Hump Van Weyden into a strong and self-reliant man who can hold his own with both Larson and brute nature.When I reread it recently, I still found the basic situation on the Ghost compelling and primal. However, my reservations became stronger and stronger from the time Maud Brewster appeared until the end of the book. Jack London, the great recorder of basic conflicts between man and man, and man and nature, writes VERY unconvincingly about the relationships between men and women. Maud seems a completely artificial character constructed more as a literary symbol of refinement and whimsicality than as a human being.Some of it is ludicrous. In their escape from the Ghost, for instance, Maud and Van Weyden spend several weeks in an open boat, fighting for survival and never once performing an excretory function. They're too delicate for that. When they finally make it to a North Pacific desert island, Hump builds Maud a stone hut as shelter then, exhausted and facing the possibility of dying of exposure, sleeps outside himself. In sum, Jack London, one of the all-time greatest naturalistic writers, perpetrates a great deal of Victorian self-censorship.The symbolic scheme plays out when Larson shows up too, wrecked on the very same island somewhere in the wide, wide, wide reaches of the world's largest ocean, so Maud and Hump can witness his physical disintegration at first hand.I'm a great fan of London's shorter works, the stories of both the far north and the south seas. He is a terrific storyteller, and it's borne out in the first half or two-thirds of THE SEA WOLF. But the concluding portion of this book is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London was one of the greatest authors America has ever known. It's ironic that because of his dog-centric books that he is often written off as a children's author. I once made the mistake of taking a collection of his short stories on a vacation. Great stories, but among the most depressing, violent, cruel concepts ever put to paper. A poor fit with frozen drinks and palm trees.The Sea Wolf is one of my favorite books largely on the basis of the villian, Wolf Larsen. He stands unique among villians in that he is huge, powerful, intelligent, ambitious, aggressive, with no muzzle of a conscience. He is omnipotent. Absolute power corupting absolutely. He is not a dumb brute that our intellectual hero outwits or outworks. Were it not for the peripheral factors of his even more destructive brother, or his failing health, he would have remained the master of his domain. I would expect that this Alpha male nature of Larsen that led London to name him Wolf.One of the biggest casting crimes ever committed by Hollywood was the casting of E.G. Robinson as Wolf and then remaking it with Bronson many years later (apparently based on having watched the original movie without really understanding the book)."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Parts of the book reminded me of Conrad and others, Milton. London creates an ugly force and sets it on a fishing boat as Captain. This Captain a sailing, fishing, toruring and ing, while defying the odds to live on and torment even after his targets thought they were in safe harbor. The captain is too smart for his own good and his men are very stupid for his own good. Within this sea of &quot;evility&quot; stumbles a neutral force that evolves as &quot;good&quot; as it fights the &quot;evil&quot; captain using brains rather than braun. He saves a damsel in distress along the way filling the romance narative (which seems a tad clumsy in parts). Well developed characters facing their nightmares on a ship with a Tin Angel at the helm. No, this isn't just another sea adventure like &quot;ThePerfect Storm&quot; with more deveolped ships than characters.

Larson, the captain, is presented as a monster with no regard for human life. Larson is intrigued with Hump and engages him in philosophical discussions, but absorbs none of Hump's basic goodness. As Hump develops into a man, Larson degenerates into a blinded, diseased, pitiful creature. Hump overcomes his adverse conditions and even finds love, while Larson self-destructs.

His experience is our tutorial. We learn the harrowing lifestyle of the sealing industry circa 1900 (the author having personal experience, reportedly).The claustophobic details of the ship contrast the vastness of the sea. The more cerebral \\"Hump\\" (as he's called) is alone amongst the id-like crew. Furthering my Psych 101 analogy, Larsen appears to espouse the benefit of the primal, yet does so with an eloquence that betrays any sort of simple association. The fact that he is well-read and speaks thoughtfully (if heartlessly) suggests the reason he is the \\"leader\\" of said crew, and a successful seaman, may lie in the understanding and control of instinct, impulse, nature.Anyways, that is probably a lot of folderol. What you have is a struggling protagonist, an evil slavedriving captain, plenty of duplicitous henchmen, and halfway through, a pretty maiden.There are a half-dozen or so amazing seagoing escapades (and I didn't understand one lick of all that \\"jib\\", \\"topmast\\", \\"poopdeck\\" stuff...nor did it matter...) and finally an extended Crusoe-like sequence on an island to tidy things up.Seriously, this deserves every accolade thrust upon it.

You'll kick yourself for waiting so long to have read it.I did."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"THE SEA WOLF is a fast-moving tale of adventure on the high seas and should entertain anyone who enjoys non-stop action. Of course, the novel offers something more, too, for it paints a very unusual portrait of Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal hunting schooner Ghost. At first blush, one may be tempted to categorize Larsen as the \\"bad guy,\\" the antagonist in the story, and Humphrey van Weyden as the protagonist hero, but let's not be too hasty in our characterizations.Larsen, for all of his cruelty, is the absolute realist in this book. His philosophy is that of utter pragmatism. He is the one who can bring the ship through the worst of storms. He is the one whose physical strength is that which is customarily associated in a reader's mind with a heroic figure. If he has a flaw, perhaps it is his absolutism, for there is no room in his mind for the relativism of what we call ethics and morality, yet his logic in rejecting such concepts is unarguable when seen from a perfectly objective viewpoint. And let us not forget that it is he who causes van Weyden to grow into a survivor.As for Humphrey van Weyden, while it is he around whom the entire story revolves, he is not a traditional hero figure by any means. When we first meet him, he is very nearly as absolute as is Larsen but in the opposite direction, for he knows nothing whatever about the world and its realities, and has, as Larsen puts it, \\"stood on his father's legs\\" rather than his own. He is immersed in the world of bookish philosophy, has no need to work for a living, has other people to handle his financial affairs, and writes literary criticisms. He is as unrealistic as Larsen is pragmatic.Both of the main characters, then, represent extremes. Van Weyden, however, does learn to adapt, to grow, to become more decisive, and to survive. Larsen does not and is eventually destroyed by the universe that he has always viewed as amoral and uncaring (thus proving himself entirely correct in his assessment of it). The universe, of course, works through some mysterious malady of Larsen's that is foreshadowed and hinted at throughout the story by his debilitating headaches. But is it not ironic that Larsen's malevolent absolutism is the catalyst for van Weyden's maturation? In brief, I cannot brand Larsen with a label of pure antagonist or anti-hero, for his rationality is frequently refreshing and he does engender a positive outcome in van Weyden. Similarly, I cannot view van Weyden as a pure hero because. for too much of the story, he is thoroughly unrealistic in his views and expectations. Both characters are complex in their respective ways.Modern readers may well be put off by London's portrayal of women, who are perceived as weak and in need of protection, although Maud Brewster does prove to be stronger and more resolute than the reader initially suspects. Perhaps more off-putting is van Weyden's paralysis--his total inability to act against Larsen when he repeatedly has the opportunity--because his sense of morality precludes such actions. The reader fairly wishes to scream at the man as he misses successive opportunities to remove Larsen as a threat to himself as well as to Maud. This, of course, is part of van Weyden's own moral absolutism and is totally in character for him even while it frustrates the reader.London's characters, while complex, are not as symbolic of broader concepts as are those of Joseph Conrad, a fine author of sea-based tales. I find London to be a somewhat shallower author and to place more emphasis on superficial action to develop his stories than does Conrad. Neither man is equal to Melville as an allegorist, yet both are superior to someone like Patrick O'Brian (adopted name of Richard Russ, English author of the Aubrey-Maturin series of seafaring novels who drowns the reader in nautical jargon and sometimes little else). If one likes fast action with an enticing leavening of unusual character development in an always-interesting and far-from-normal setting, he could do far worse than reading Jack London's works, and THE SEA WOLF is a gripping book with which to pass some hours of fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Absolutely loved this book!Humphrey Van Weyden is a 35 year old bookish man who has never had to stand on his own two feet.

It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and its life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.\\"Make no mistake that Wolf stays true to this philosophy.Meanwhile, Hump learns to stand on his own two feet in two significant ways - one seemingly unintentional. He unexpectedly becomes an intellectual playmate of Wolf's, which sort of buys him time from Wolf's brutality. Also, he overcomes extreme physical obstacles while on the Ghost and while trying to escape.During my elation while reading this book I became curious as to why it hadn't made it to the Novel 100 list by Daniel S. Burt or other similar lists. I was thinking 5 STARS! 5 STARs! The dialogue was wonderful and plentiful (in a good way). Wolf's character was amazing in a brutal and sordid way. I think most of us can relate to the fantasy of our primitive selves. Why not one of THE classics?Well it seems that some of the works referred to in The Sea Wolf are anachronistic and the story itself is considered \\"patchy\\". Patchy as in melodramatic (But this was funny and interestingggg....), philosophic debate (INTERESTING!), travelogue (Soooo?), and love story (Yeah...the love story was a bit cheesy. A famous female author just happens to be the one who washes up for the bookish Hump????)So, 4 stars because of the out of place references and all too convenient terms of the love story, but still, a thrilling read!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"What Jack London sought to depict in many of his short stories and novels was the realistic, unforgiving brutality associated with man and nature, and, in this regard, The Sea Wolf does not disappoint. The first conflict comes when Humphrey Van Weyden is rescued by a boat after an accident, but little does the protagonist know what he is truly in for, as he will experience a figurative Hell for a good deal of time on board the Ghost. Juxtaposed by Wolf Larson, a character inspired by Milton's Lucifer in Paradise Lost, Van Weyden, a simple \\"bookish\\" literary man of thirty-five, must transform in order to sustain a barbaric and eye-opening ride.Perhaps what separates Wolf Larson from your prototypical villain is that there are moments where Van Weyden can see the philosophical, profound, well-read side of the captain. While the two are as far apart as any two characters can be in their beliefs, backgrounds, or physical appearance, they seem to be on a parallel plane when it comes to their talks about Man's existence, despite the fact that they \\"agree to disagree\\" on these various subjects.The book's most prevalent theme is survival--physically and psychologically. Van Weyden transforms himself somewhat in order to exist, yet he is not consumed by the savagery he witnesses aboard the Ghost. While he has a hard time acting on instincts, there is one point where there is a revolt from Larson in his conscience, which separates any notion that he will give in: \\"Wolf Larson it was, always Wolf Larson, enslaver and tormentor of men, a male Circe and these his swine, suffering brutes that groveled before him and revolted only in drunkenness and secrecy. And was I, too, one of his swine? ...No!...I would work my will through it all, in spite of Wolf Larson...All would be well.\\" Yet, ironically, much of what Van Weyden learns from what he witnesses from Larson and the other men is critical in his survival later on.Another impressive element is London's command of description and detail. He has a way of illustrating a moment of peril, or foreshadowing, or profiling a character. One example is Van Weyden's commentary while looking out to see, while thinking about the Ghost's fate: \\"I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly into the sea, with the certainty that sooner or later I should be sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.\\" The protagonist seems to know that something is amiss with the Ghost, and, like Melville's Pequod in Moby Dick, there is an ominous feeling on doom on board.One criticism is the later part of the novel, where it gets a little too romanticized and lovey-dovey with Maud and Humphrey. It just seemed a little too forced. Some of the parts seemed to lag a little also towards the end, and the descriptions got a little too detailed about how to prepare a vessel for voyage off of Endeavor Island.Still, over all, it was an impressive read. If you're looking for a book about courage and survival, then this is a great book to check out!"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it.

He was swept overboard a ferry and was rescued by a ship called The Ghost and for months dealt with the hardships of a violently abusive captain and untrusting seal hunters.

I found this book a pretty good read because of the story line and how this one character survived being on the ship with such a raw and violent captain. The only thing that I found hard to comprehend was the advanced vocabulary when the main character would describe something or someone, just because I didn&#8217;t know many of the words and it made me lose my spot in some parts.

The story started off very exciting but then slowed down to a near crawl for most of the middle. There never was really any climax what so ever; I was looking for it the entire book but never found it. The plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what would happen the entire time which really ruined it for me. The ending was very cheesy and predictable. The protagonist is basically a wuss, and his extremely feminine viewpoint and talking style quickly became irritating. The book is LITTERED with nautical and sailing terms and half the time I didn't know what the narrator was talking about. The book isn't the best read I've experienced.

Suffice it to say it was a good story about a man finding himself under harsh conditions."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"The book that I read was The Sea Wolf by Jack London. The story is about sailors that are out trying to carry cargo to a nearby port and then a lot of different things begin to happen. The book kind of starts out slow and then begins to pick up and gets better by the middle of the book. There are a lot of places in the book that it is going strong and then it cuts out and ends up getting weaker. Even though there are some weak spots if you keep with it, it will be worth the long wait. It is also a good book because it deals with real life crises that would really happen aboard a boat in the 1950's.The book would be great for someone who loves adventure books. This book takes place on the open water the whole story. It involves hunters, cooks,The strengths in this book are that there are a lot of details. Some of the detail that Jack London puts into the story gives you pictures in your head and you also kind of feel like you are leaving your seat and are actually in the story. Also that there is a great deal of understanding and you never feel that you are lost in the book you always know where you are. The detail is very specific sometimes you can feel like you are touching the exact same that that some of the other characters.Then some of the weaknesses that were in the story were that some of the words that he chose had really nothing to do with what he was explaining or trying to say. Even when it would be a really strong statement that he is making it would be strong then all of a sudden it would be weak and you would kind of forget what he is talking about. Also if you felt like you were in the story then you would leave your imagination and go back to reading it because it would be so boring.In conclusion the book should be for people who like adventures and suspense. The book overall was very good has a lot of detail and would have been even better if their were not so many weak spots. People would enjoy this book no mater what age group you are. Over all you should at least try it out and then make a decision"},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"i think that this book isn't what i thought it would be. being a 13 year old, i had to read this book for school. i bought this book thinking that it was great after reading the back of the book and the reviews here at amazon.com. when i read the book, my classmates and i talked about how boring the book was and that it had no climaxing plot or any interesting points. then again this is just a point of vie of a some teenagers. to me, i wouldn't suggest this book to any teenager i know."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I have to read this book for summer vacation.

The book quality itself is as with any new book, perfect. As for the story line, like I said, it was assigned reading.

(except for the fact that we won't let them put it down until they are done with the assignment) My son is in 6th grade, but I believe this book is most likely for 8th grade or higher when given as assigned reading for school, since he goes to a gifted school. They typically read books 2 - 3 grade years ahead in his classes.

I do not recomend this book."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Let me say that again: ughh.A good book, all told, but exceedingly dull and almost impossible to get through. Apparently, Jack London's writing style does not suit me."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I will give my personal opinions and insights I gained from this book. You can read detailed plot summaries elsewhere.The most exciting aspect of London's writing here is his narration of Humphrey Van Weyden's thoughts, his psychological reactions to Captain \\"Wolf\\" Larson and the conditions he finds himself in aboard the Ghost. Larson is first introduced as an ubermensch-like caricature, a feared tyrant with superhuman strength. In the early parts of the book Larson is idolized for his ideals of toughness and self-reliance which are in stark contrast to Humphrey's pampered upbringing. He is feared and admired for his great strength, even while he is simultaneously hated for his extreme cruelty and pettiness. As the book progresses, Larson's complexity is slowly revealed through his interaction with Humphrey. It turns out that Larson, despite his brutality, is a brilliant self-educated man. Humphrey is the only person with enough education to have an intellectual dialog with the Larson, but Larson's newfound favoritism for Humphrey creates tension between Humphrey and the other crew members.Later on the more vulnerable side of Larson emerges. He is afflicted with severe headaches and bouts of depression. At the same time the social Darwinist microcosm he created on board the Ghost begins to backfire on him. Needless violent conflicts, uprisings, and acts of mutiny are common. The only thing that unites the crew is their shared fear and hatred for Larson.Later Humphrey finds companionship with an educated writer, Maud, who happens aboard the ship. They fall in love and together decide to escape to an island. Humphrey's relationship with Maud and their struggle to survive causes Humphrey to re-evaluate his stance on individualism somewhat. It's shown that love and empathy can also be a source of strength that enhances the will to survive.Towards the end of the book the Ghost washes up on the island. Larson's crew has abandoned him and he is seen going mad. He is afflicted with a brain tumor and dies in front of Humphrey. Though not explicitly stated, I got the impression that the brain tumor could be an explanation for Larson's sociopath tendencies. Larson's lack of empathy is a weakness, not strength as originally assumed.Anyways, these are my insights. I can't give 5 stars because though there are a few places where the story gets slightly bogged down. The portion of the book about Humphrey's love affair with Maud on the island could have been better. Also, some might not have patience for all the nautical detail. It's easy to skim past the slow parts though."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London I only discovered over the past five years, which by all relative standards is very strange, since I studied creative writing in college, and was an avid reader of the classics as a youth. I despised the classics as a youth, :), but now appreciate most of them during my formative years of understanding literature and the novel.'Call of the Wild' certainly ingnited my senses to the prose power of London, and it was by an odd encounter and chance that a distant friend handed it to me in passing, that I discovered the magic talent of London and his epic sea story of 'The Sea Wolf.'Arguably, \\"Wolf Larsen\\" is one of the greatest characters in literature. He is vibrant, total, fitting for the role in which he is written; belivable, enigmatic and actually quite charming in that raw sense of hostility.However even though Wolf slowly descends into the abyss of madness, he has the mental capacity to be childlike and endearing. In this passage in particular...{\\"Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he called me in, and obeyed my commands like a sick child...at my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking; though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me.\\"}...we see an almost patent adolescence in Wolf, and London paints the potrait of the ironclad rascle, as human, with emotions and tenderness that even in the rank hollowness of declamation and ruthlessness, we can see a yearning for sympathy.That is magical.This is one to give to grandkids, your own kids, or to share with others. It holds a special place in my heart this book, and on my shelf next to \\"Master and Commander.\\"Thank you."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Although the time frame of this book is set in the 1700's, the language used makes the book so masterful. It should not be read by people with a low reading skill, as it can be hard to understand in some parts, which is what makes it such a interesting book. After reading a page or two so much can be analyzed. For instance, in the end of the book it can be similar to the movie Cast Away. The same scene takes place and two of the main characters are fighting for their lives. The novel is full of adventure and action takes place constantly. It may be epic fighting scenes or terrific storms, but know matter what this novel will keep you reading on edge."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This very powerful story about a brutal sea captain and the effect that his depravity and evil have on anyone that he is in contact with is a true adventure story as well. Jack London knew how to tell a story, and this book is a page-turner. Not only that, it has some of the best descriptions of sailing one of the old \\"tall ships\\" I've ever read. There is a chapter in the book that is a superb description of sailing one of these ships in a bad storm. Mr. London's descriptions of this and other catastrophic events at sea is so realistic that the reader sees it all as he or she reads it. London's political ideology does show through in spots. London was a firm believer in Socialism, and he does put forth these ideas at times in the book. His villain - Wolf Larsen, is the most evil man you'll ever encounter between the covers of a novel. The development of Humphrey from an ineffectual, bookish type of man, to a man that can subsist on his own wits and by the actual use of his own hands is the common thread that runs through the book. Even though he is in close proximity to the evil Larsen, Humphrey does not let Larsen's depravity change his own morals and his own essential goodness."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This book differs somewhat from London's other novels. One thing that is great for a younger reader is that the book is written through the main character's perspective, which makes understanding him easier for the reader. The events that occur in the first 100 pages come fast one after the other leaving the reader wondering what could possibly come next, and then to me as well as some other reviewers the novel begins to slow down especially with the entrance of the female. Overall the story is great and the characters are easy to understand, and London's writing style makes it simple to enjoy."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"I thought there was wonderful character development. London made me feel as if I actually knew the people as well as he did. He used fantastic visual imagery and if I closed my eyes I could see the action take place. He used many sailing terms I was unfamiliar with and to more thoroughly enjoy the book I would suggest any reader brush up on sailing vocabulary and parts of a sailing vessel."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Humphrey van Weyden is a gentleman. He has never had to work for his living, or do a single task for himself. All that changes when the ferry-steamer Martinez, running across the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, is wrecked after a collision with another boat in the fog. Van Weyden is tossed into the sea, and eventually picked up by another boat. But this is no ordinary boat. It is the Ghost, a seal-hunting schooner captained by Wolf Larsen, who is far from being an ordinary man. He snickers at Van Weyden's offers of money in exchange for taking him to shore, and instead conscripts the unfortunate man to replace a recently-deceased member of the Ghost's crew. Van Weyden's trials encompass far more than merely learning how to work on a ship. He must also find his place in the strange web of heirarchy among the men. More precarious yet is his relationship with the captain.We soon find out that Wolf Larsen is a monster of a man, possessing superhuman strength and a complete lack of deference to any idea of morals. He is certainly one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in my reading. You fear him, you hate him, and yet there is still something to admire about him. He commands respect. He can kill a man with the strength of his hands alone, but he is also something of a self-educated philosopher. He has clearly studied Darwin, and continually likens life to a ferment of yeast, in which the natural way of things is for the stronger to consume the weaker. And yet, despite Larsen's superhuman image, London manages to keep him plausible for the reader by giving him his own Achilles's heel, which becomes more and more apparent as the story progresses. \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is worth reading for a character study of this man alone. Unfortunately, however, the second half of the book shifts its focus, losing sight of the Van Weyden-Larsen relationship and simultaneously losing much of the driving force behind the story.Almost as soon as Maud Brewster entered the story, I began to lose interest. Shipwrecked and adrift in a small boat, she is picked up by the Ghost much as Van Weyden was. She, too, is refused passage to land. And inevitably, a romance develops between Brewster and Van Weyden. The story makes an abrupt change in course from one of survival and complex relationships between the ship's men, to that of a love story. But what a silly and unconvincing love story it is! London just doesn't write women well, nor does he make the relationship between Van Weyden and Brewster in any way believable. Maud is a flat character, and just doesn't seem real. She is also full of ridiculous contradictions. She is alternately described as a frail lily and a cavewoman. She bestows the name of Lucifer on Wolf Larsen, but turns all to pity and mush the moment he is struck by one of his headaches. The story would have been much better with romance left out and the focus kept on Van Weyden's personal struggle with Larsen.The strength of this book definitely lies in its first half. London's writing is strong and vivid, and he does a superb job of capturing the nuances of each relationship between crew members. I only wish he had stuck to that. Every writer has his niche, and London's is not in the romance genre. The second part of the book is contrived, predictable, and does little to hold one's interest. The ending is dissatisfying. It is, however, worth finishing in order to discover what end comes to the aforementioned Wolf Larsen. This is the only element of the latter part of the book that really intrigued me. So read \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" for its adventure component, found in the first half, and read it for the wonderfully crafted character of Captain Larsen. But don't expect too much out of the latter half and its conclusion."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world, his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"Jack London had in fact sailed on ships like the Ghost. This is one reason that the portraits of the sailors are so accurate. Also, it's why the storm episode rings so true. The book is worth reading for those reasons alone. London's own struggles with philosophy and ideas seem to be voiced by Wolf Larsen."},{"Title":"Sea-Wolf","review":"&quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; by Jack London is about a young man who is forced to work on a sealing schooner after he is rescued from a ferry accident. The title comes from the captain of the schooner whose name is Wolf Larson. Larson is a cruel and brutal man who, while on his ship, lives by his own rules. His morals are very shallow and he places little, if any, value on others' lives. The story continues in portraying the life of Humphrey, the young man, and how he copes with the brutality of sea life and how he adapts to their way of life. Later on in the story a new angle comes in when the sealing schooner picks up a lost boat and brings abourd a female. The men don't often encounter females seeing that their work is hard and they are out on their hunting trips most of the year. So this brought a whole new perspective and the men didn't know how to act. Larson, on the other hand, didn't change much. Humphrey got to know the woman and became attracted to her for she was much like him interest wise. So one night, when everyone was asleep, Humphrey and the woman, Maud Brewster, secretly got into one of the hunting boats and escaped the ship in the fog. After they were on the tiny boat for a long time they began to doubt themselves and their survival. But then they spotted an island and landed there. They made their own shelter and killed seals, like the hunters did, for food. Then one morning they awoke to find the dreaded Ghost docked at their beach. They were terrified, but soon learned that the ship's crew had abandoned ship and only Larson was left. Larson had been inflicted with a horrible disease and he went blind and his body slowly began to deteriorate. After he died Humphrey and Maud repaired the Ghost and sailed back to the mainland. I personally liked this story very much because it was interesting and it kept my attention. It made me want to keep reading the story to find out what obstacle that Humphrey had to overcome next. It had a great plot and I'd recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Software Safety and Reliability: Techniques, Approaches, and Standards of Key Industrial Sectors (Practitioners)","review":"Software Safety and Reliability is an excellent resource for those who want to learn more about software safety.

Campbell skillfully dismantles the many, many false assumptions and mis-interpretations that Bucaille uses as a platform to build his laughable theories about Christianity and the Bible on. So, reacting to this, those with the 'poison' in their minds are reeling from the purgative effects this adept rebuttal has upon those who have been drinking from the well dug by Bucaille. Dr.Campbell, who spent a good number of years in research before writing this book in response, also knows Arabic; and has also personally studied the Quran and the Bible. He also has referred advice from experts in several fields ie.Astronomy, Geology and human Embryology, in order to maintain factual accuracy. And even though he himself knows the arabic language personally, he has asked other men for whom Arabic is their native language, to assess and critique his word studies in that language. Such consistent thoroughness and detail study has resulted in a volume that critically examines and looks at the problems the Quran has with scientific anatomy, embryology and genetics as well as historical problems with fables, allegories and languages. This itself is just the tip of the ice-berg. Dr.Campbell strove to be faithful to factual accuracy in all other areas addressed in this book besides the above. This can only be due to the Doctor's disciplined eye for detail and the scholar's concern for truthful representation of the facts. Those,like the previous reviewer who have nothing left to say factually to Dr.Campbell's systematic response; resort to cowardly insinuations on his character like his alleged 'jealousy..' and so forth. Such character assasination have nothing to do with the truth and the facts of the case presented in this volume but is instead a desperate effort to divert the readers' attention away from the facts;to a fictional and baseless flaw alleged upon the writer's personality. Unfortunately desperate people have to clutch at whatever straws they can find to keep them from drowning! Because in the end the joke is squarely on Bucaille's books. That is what the detractors want so badly to prevent you from finding out..!!"},{"Title":"The Quran & the Bible in the Light of History & Science","review":"I give this Book FIVE golden stars! It is so good that I could not put it down from start to finish. Bravo Dr.Campbell. Keep up the good work of opening up the blinded eyes!

The author gives an excellent overview of the development of the Quran and shows that the Quran even supports the books of Moses, the Psalms, and the Gospels. It's an excellent treatise. In summary, it is a brilliant apologetic of the Christian faith, proved from a historical, linguistic, and scientific approach."},{"Title":"The Quran & the Bible in the Light of History & Science","review":"I have read this book and bucailles book, i am neither muslim nor christian as such but have to say that Bucailless book is considerably more convincing.

Dr.Campbell clearly and deftly exposes the serious defects in Bucaille's materials which gravely and effectively sounds the death-knell for all of his stuff.By examining all of the wild claims wishfully made up in Bucaille's stuff with a fine tooth-comb, and under the light of objective &amp; scientific research, Dr.Campbell establishes for us decisively those facts which make all the muslim theories and claims break down,fall apart and lose their so-called &quot;authenticity&quot; once and for all.These are facts elucidated from historical, scientific, linguistic, socio-cultural and manuscript evidence from years of research and comparative study.Kudos to Dr.Bill Campbell for exposing how shallow and hollow polemics and propoganda can be tasty 'tid-bits' and junk food for the blind and ultimately malnourished masses of readers, who having fed on this diet for an extended time consider it as real food and become incapable to distinguish between whats real and whats false; whats truth and whats propoganda.

I highly recommend it.Just one comment to those who claimed that Naik defeated Campbell. It is true that Campbell did a vey poor job, but that is because his skill is in writing not debating. Far from refuting Campbell, Naik managed to tap dance his way around many of the arguments and give the misleading impression that he actually addressed the issues..."},{"Title":"The Quran & the Bible in the Light of History & Science","review":"There is no question that there are already problem when a book is in response to another book, that of Maurice Bucaille. Nonetheless, this is a well-thought response to Bucaille's attack on Christianity, for that is indeed what it is.As a result, however, this really means that Dr. Campbell, well meaning as he is, also can appear to be attacking Islam. My reading of the book does not say so, but i can see where Muslims can think this.The problem is actually highlighted in Dr. Campbell's book - both sides have a different perspective, so their approach comes with certain base assumptions. My many dealings with Muslims have shown that they simnply will not allow the same amount of textual criticism that they feel they can heap upon the Bible. Moreover, Muslim critics use highly outdated, enlightenment approaches to the Bible - methods that few reputable biblical scholars see as valid.This book, unfortunately uses the same techniques to sling mud right back as Muslims. It is good forChristians to learn some things about the Qu'ran, but its method is simply no better than Bucaille's, even though I may agree with Dr. Campbell's conclusions."},{"Title":"The Quran & the Bible in the Light of History & Science","review":"Dr. Zaiker Niak had a debate with Dr. William Campell and pretty much destroied this book.

Unfortunetly, I don't know any other place that sells the video tapes. But if you ever visit chicago be sure to go to devon street and go into Iqra bookstore and buy the video tapes. A must have for any muslim!One Example I'd like to share is Dr. William Campbell's meeting with Keith Moore. There is documentation to prove Keith Moore knows the Qur'an is 100% scientifically accurate regrading embryology. So are we going to believe Dr. William Campbell's personal dealings with Keith Moore, or books (documented proof) Keith Moore certified himself?Another Example is Campbell's misuse of arabic.

But that a christian author had the stuffing to take on one of the primary &quot;evangelical&quot; books used by muslims is commendable.

It is an insult against the scientific inquiry and methodology. His arguments and responses are filled with errors and bias jealousies he has towards muslims and The Qur'an. With each chapter he becomes more and more confused, frustrated, insecure and incompetent. He tries to be objective (or at least gives the illusion) but simply can not. I think the author wishes he was born in an Islamic society (that way he would not have any conflicts within himself) but unfortunately or fortunately he has to be (or chooses to be) content with his Christian roots.

The CD is quite good, containing a PowerPoint presentation outline for each chapter. It also has a section of excellent examples, but it only goes through the first three chapters, which is unfortunate.Each chapter begins with a \\"Chapter Case Study\\", which I found to be worthless. The text and examples in each section & chapter are pretty good, about what would be expected from a textbook. What is different is the \\"Technology Instructions\\" inserted throughout, for doing stats with Minitab, Excel XP, and the TI-83 Plus calculator (which my school requires). It's needed, because the TI-83 manual is not very good.Where the book could be better, for my class, is in describing how a student can verify his/her own work. Too many times students make a small mistake early in a problem, which leads to a non-sensical answer -- if the student stops to evaluate the meaning of it (for example, a probability greater than 1). Particularly in hypothesis testing, students frequently build the null and alternative hypotheses backwards, and then end up with a conclusion statement that clearly contradicts the data. While this book is very clear about a five-step approach to *doing* the test, it should have included a sixth step -- verifying that your answer makes sense!Also, some of the problems and examples have errors, as well as vaguely worded questions. This seems to be (unfortunately) typical of all textbooks -- or maybe I'm just jaded.Overall, it's a pretty decent book for a lower-level college statistics course. I would have given it 3.5 stars on its own. The CD is worth the extra half-star. If the CD examples went beyond chapter 3 through the whole book it would get five."},{"Title":"Elementary Statistics (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","review":"Explanations of concepts are constantly interrupted mid-paragraph by various secondary explanations, questions and diagrams that do not tie in well with the central concept that was being explained. I find it very difficult to follow when each page is scattered with little side projects for the student to try with the cd-rom or with a calculator. Just glancing at any page it is hard to find the heart of the material.

We were lucky to catch one of her museum exhibitions in which she showed several of her hand-made books, which blur the line between the functional and the figurative. ISLAND DOG is a most imaginative foray into the mass market; the book retains the feel of a unique work of art while still being sturdy, accessible, and inviting to all ages. It is a story in pictures- rich, full-flavored, juicy pictures. My partner likes it for the way it uses color and motion, but to be honest, this book is most special for the way it encourages readers to imagine their own island home. Sit with your child and create a new book over and over each time you read it together. For dog lovers, parents, art collectors, and bibliophiles, this is the perfect gift. It's a book-lover's book with a vibrant, gentle, constantly shifting story. I heartily recommend it for fans of Goodale's work or people who want to be introduced to this exciting book artist."},{"Title":"Island Dog","review":"For anyone who loves dogs, the sun-washed Maine coast, and bright joyful images that gladden the spirit, this is the book for you!

Oftentimes neuroscience textbook overwhelm with details, and it is sometimes hard to see the forest from the trees. This book provides a good bird's eye perspective on the field, and its many references and recommended books make it a valuable reference. Very importantly, the book is up to date in some of the more recent discoveries, including some current controversies like grandma neuron, the idea that the brain has a neuron devoted just for recognizing each family member.A good, well written and well organized book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Brain: A Very Short Introduction","review":"O'Shea's book provides a very broad overview of the structure and function of the most complex object known to Man. The biochemical and physical interactions of neurons, the formation of memory, brain-machine interaction, and a range of other topics, are all touched upon in a readable and informative manner, pitched at the level of an intelligent beginner, and requiring just an elementary grasp of physics and chemistry. The book has one significant shortcoming: Most of the illustrations are copied from other publications, and are a poor match with the text. For example, on page 45 there is a diagram illustrating avoidance behavior in unicellular animals, a simple concept not requiring a diagram, let alone one that occupies almost an entire page and contains labels that are not referenced in the text. Yet when we come to the discussion of the large-scale structure of the human brain, in Chapter 4, which cries out for a detailed diagram, there is none. I was reduced to finding one online, to refer to as I read the text.

It is also remarkably up to dated and reads smooth and accessibly. The book is organized along 8 chapters presenting, a logic sequence, the main aspects of the brain.The first important fact to take into account about this book is that it is about the brain, not the mind or even the relationship brain and mind. So, it focuses on descriptions of the brain structure and sensory aspects, not on mind-related issues such as behavior, consciousness, and personality. The book starts by describing what is happening as one reads the lines of a text, and introduces them main aspects of brain research in the process. The second chapter provides a very interesting historical review, with emphasis on the Golgi/Cajal findings (i.e. reticular against network models). Chapter 3 is dedicated to brain signalling, covering in an engaging, comprehensive and yet accessible way the basic theory of neuronal transmission. Evolution and development are covered in Chapter 4, and sensation, perception and action in Chapter 5. The grandmother/sparse coding of information in the brain is treated with great clarity and insight. Chapter 6 covers the all important aspect of memory, identifying and characterizing the several types of memories and how and where they take place. The explanation of Kandel's seminal findings is very accessible and illustrates the impressive didactic abilities of the author. Chapter 7, which covers how the brain can be enhanced and repaired, proved to be remarkably up to dated and interestingly written. Chapter 8 concludes the book.All in all, I found a pleasure reading this book because of its clarity, objectivity, and engaging style. The author manages to provide a surprisingly up to dated and comprehensive account of the state of the art in brain research despite its 144 pages. The sequence of the presentation is logical, the writing is effective and never boring, and the case-examples are very well-chosen. Suggestions for further reading are also to be found as an appendix.

In fact the only thing missing from this \\"Complete\\" collection of his writings may be some of his private letters, etc., which have been in fact published elsewhere, as in, for example,The Complete Letters of Oscar Wildewhich is edited by his grandson Merlin.Wilde's own son Vyvyan wrote the scholarly biography and academic analysis of his own father's landmark and unequalled work. Anyone already familiar with the life of Oscar Wilde knows how deeply touching this in itself must be. Wilde deeply loved his two sons, and especially his wife, and suffered greatly their loss due to his unjust and cruel and unusual imprisonment on false charges, as witnessed here in his writings Reading Gaol and most explicitly in De Profundis, which might also be read inThe Soul of Man & Prison Writings. De Profundis in this present collection was first published here by Collins completely and most authoritatively.The nearly cold scholarliness with which this son of Wilde presents the clear facts of his father's life astounds one, and even pains one who knows the fullness of the story, or reads it here for the first time. Please see as well the excellent account inSon of Oscar Wildefor a more complete understanding of this deeply slandered and actually unknown creator of modern literary style and forms, which we have so lost in this post-modern world. We do well here to study carefully his art in the fullness of its publication, and to read the beauty of his own son's biography. A highly recommendable collection and excellent, well balanced introductory biography, with an equally excellent adjunct chronology and bibliography for further readings and resources.Read once more Dorian Gray, the novel, and the associated short stories. Themoral tales and fairy tales are here presented, as well as the plays. The Importance of Being Earnest humorously reveals the closet lifestyle of the aristocracy, and the superficiality, unfortunately and necessarily here unannotated. Lady Windemere's Fan with lesser lightness reveals the fatal hypocrisy and fatality of upper crust British society. An Ideal Husband with some degree of humor and intrigue reveals the same, with the a revelation of the stock swindles which were then and which in Halliburton remain the basis for many a great fame and fortune. These three are fairly well represented by the BBC inThe Oscar Wilde Collection (The Importance of Being Earnest / The Picture of Dorian Gray / An Ideal Husband / Lady Windermere's Fan).This selection of plays continues of course with all of them, including a Woman of No Importance and the standard (and very poor) English translation of Wilde's prophetic play written in French for Sarah Bernhardt Salome, which again reveals the corruption and vice of the ruling classes and their destruction of true religion.His Poems in Prose are included and various essays and letters including the important De Profundis mentioned above (which he proposed entitling in Latin for his prison and chains), as well as the earlier serio-comic The decay of Lying, A Few Maxims for the INstruction of the Over-Educated, and Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young. One wonders the seriousness of his intent in writing The Portrait of Mr. W.H. as the object of Shakespeare's sonnets, and we read with interwst his Soul of Man under Socialism and his The Critic as Artist, etc.HIs poetry is well and completely represented, including this touching dedication of a book of his poems to his dearly and well beloved wife:To My WifeI can write no stately proemAs a prelude to my lay;from a poet to a poemI would dare to say.For if of these fallen petalsOne of you seem fairLove will waft it till it settlesOn your hair.And when the wind and winter hardenAll the loveles land,It will whisper of the gardenYou will understand.Wilde though dying young due to his imprisonment and exile and loss of family, survived his wife who suffered as cruelly English unmerciful justice, and this loving couple passed untold and untellable pain, here only hinted at by his son, and by his writing which hopefully will aid us to glimpse the deep and famously paradoxical truth of Mr. Oscar Wilde.Read the book."},{"Title":"The Works of Oscar Wilde","review":"Kindle Edition: I love Oscar Wilde, and when I love an author I try to read everything they've ever written.

Thanks"},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"This is a book about losers. By losers, I mean the men who came in second best in the political arena where winner takes all; specifically in the race to become President of the United States.The book, published in 1945, consists of twenty biographical sketches of losers of presidential races from Henry Clay in 1824 to Thomas E. Dewey in 1944. THEY ALSO RAN, as well as giving biographical data on each of its subjects, includes a history of the times in which each of them lived, ran, and lost; and social, economic, and political backgrounds of each era. Using these twenty men as focal points, Stone gives us a fairly comprehensive picture of the political history of the United States from 1824 to 1944.Now, I am going to do something that I think is rare, if not unique, in these book reviews. I'm going to devote most of the rest of this review to the dust jacket. Across the dust jacket there is a graph consisting of 21 lines ranging from minus ten (-10) to plus ten (+10). In case you're wondering, the twenty-first line is the zero (0) line in the middle. Stone refers to this zero line as &quot;the danger line,&quot; i.e. a candidate in the negative zone may well do more harm than good if he wins the presidency. The graph rates the winners and losers of twelve elections according to Stone's estimation of each man's &quot;ability and worth to the nation at the time of the election.&quot; The candidates are represented by silhouettes having their heads at one of the lines. For clarity and consistency, the winners are in white and the losers in outline form. It is interesting to note that the lower ranked in some years are sometimes ranked higher than either the winner or loser in other years.Some interesting evaluations:Highest ranked winner in any year: Abraham Lincoln (+10) in 1860. His opponent, Stephen A. Douglas had a (+1) ranking.Lowest ranked winner in any year was Warren Harding (-9) in 1920. His opponent who lost the election was James M. Cox who was rated at (+3).Most evenly rated election: 1928 when winner, Herbert Hoover and loser, Alfred E. Smith were both rated (+5).In three elections the winner fell into Stone's &quot;danger zone.&quot; These were: 1856, James Buchanan (-1); 1872, Ulysses S. Grant (-5); and 1920, Warren Harding (-9).Of the twelve elections on the graph, according to Stone's ratings, the man more valuable to the country at the time the election was held won six times and lost five times. In the twelfth election the candidates were considered evenly qualified.It is my opinion that Stone's research was good, and that he was as politically unbiased as was humanly possible. I would find it interesting if someone with Stone's credentials and even-handedness were to write a sequel covering the elections from 1948 through the court decided election of year 2000. Any takers?"},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"This is quite possibly one of the most important books on American politics ever written. The reason for that is that the book analyzes the gist of American election politics, and in an impossibly slim volume, by dispassionately analyzing the fates of losers in presidential elections, gives an exhaustive breakdown of how the American system of government has worked and how it has failed. This is a must-read for anyone who ever plans to participate in an election, and is high on my list of books that should be read by EVERYONE who aspires to be a citizen in a democratic country."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"At one point in this book, Irving Stone humorously notes that Winfield Scott, father of the American army and Whig presidential candidate in 1852, dreamed of having his life story gloriously chronicled by a future Plutarch. One gets the sense that Stone wished to oblige him; \\"They Also Ran\\", which tells the story of twenty defeated presidential candidates (from 1824 to 1948), is Stone's own effort to create an American counterpart for the great Roman biographer/judge. While the end result is certainly entertaining, it falls far short of reaching its goal.For one thing, Plutarch's historiographical and biographical style was firmly entrenched in the Roman tradition of his contemporaries, men like Suetonius and Tacitus who transcribed events not for the purpose of educating or even entertaining their readers, but rather instructing them as to the proper way of judging powerful people from the past. What's more, Plutarch organized his book on the basis of abstract themes (eloquence, honor, etc.) rather than according to any empirical historical criteria. The end result is highly entertaining and, due to Plutarch's great gifts as a historian, surprisingly detailed and informative. Such a balancing act is hard to pull off, and one must applaud Plutarch for succeeding so brilliantly.Yet Stone is no Plutarch, and his effort to replicate Plutarch's feat is often just as unsettling as it is enlightening. Men like Henry Clay and William Jennings Bryan are condemned with a passion almost frightening in its intensity, while other characters like Lewis Cass and Alton Parker are praised with equal fervor. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Stone's opinions is in many ways besides the point, however; far too often his biases actually impair his abilities as a historian, such as in his refusal to acknowledge the fact that points-of-view exist which differ from his own (most historians, for example, do not share his harsh verdict on Clay), and the often glaring omissions and errors he makes in order to buttress his claims (such as ignoring Bryan's pacifist motivations for resigning as Secretary of State in 1915, and instead lamely claiming that this was primarily due to incompetence as a way of further condemning his character). Equally unsuccessful are Stone's attempts to link thematically link together candidates from different periods of history, as he often goes to great lengths to draw connections between two or three very different men on the most tenuous of grounds (such as Greeley and Cox both being newspaper editors) while failing to successfully dig deeper into the ideological, personal, and other transcendental qualities that truly might have linked men from disparate periods of history.To be fair, these problems aren't entirely Stone's fault. The standards for historiography and biography have changed drastically since Plutarch picked up a pen two millenia ago, which wouldn't work in the favor of anyone who attempted to impersonate such a style. And despite this setback, some of his biographies actually work - his chapters on Alfred E. Smith and Wendell Willkie, for example, are superb. And I could not in all justice claim that Stone's book isn't entertaining - the man holds an able pen, and his book is a gripping page-turner in ways that one wouldn't expect for such a text. If only Stone had been just a tad more objective, this would be a perfect primer for someone who wishes to learn more about American presidential history. As it stands, his work can be viewed as a great way to enjoyable pass the time, so long as his readers take what he writes with several shakers of salt."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"Irving Stone was one heck of a writer and it's a shame that his books are so hard to find now. They Also Ran tells the stories of the men who ran for president and lost. It talks about who these men were, what shaped them and what they did once the campaign was done. It really makes you wonder (or shiver) at what might have been."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"Someone gave this book to Bob Dole after '96; I hope Al Gore gets a chance to read it, too. What I took from the book is that on many occasions, America dodged a bullet by not being governed by a clearly unqualified loser. In other cases, we should consider ourselves unfortunate that the loser wasn't the winner.Originally written in the 1940's by the late Irving Stone, the book is woefully in need of an update by a prominent historian who can add Dewey, Stevenson, Goldwater, Humphrey, McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, Dole and Gore. And I agree with the previous reviewer: the inside of the dust jacket is fascinating--if you can find one of these rare hard cover copies."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book, but it's still one of the best books I've ever read. Stone is a great writer, and he offers rich, incisive portraits of the many failed presidential aspirants. It is always possible to disagree with the conclusions of such a subjective study. But Stone writes so well that many of his descpriptions are still etched in my memory. Especially for someone who loves presidential politics, as I do, this book is a masterpiece. It is a shame that he isn't around to update his study. We need more political writers like Stone."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"Stone's collection of short essays about men that ran unsuccessfully for U.S. President is more readable than a \\"thriller\\" but thoroughly researched. He takes a strong moral stance on his subjects. He ruthlessly condemns folk heroes such as Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser (Stone portrays him as a selfish, vainglorious meglomaniac) and William Jennings Bryant (Stone portrays Bryant as having a weak grasp of the concepts he bruited about in order to gain public attention). He has a gift for wonderful details about his subjects, all of whom seem very colorful -- including the highly moral, eccentric Horace Greeley; Cox the intrepid newspaper man; lesser-knowns also-rans such as Fremont the brave explorer (beloved of Indians and whites alike) that took to the wilderness in a canoe laden with books that he read as he navigated, who -- several years after running for president as a rugged explorer and national hero -- died alone and destitute in a hotel room for paupers. This review barely scratches the surface of Ston'e collection of historical gems."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"I ran across this book on my grandfather's bookshelf as a teenager in the early '70's and have returned to it many times since.

I'm trying to convince my son to read it to fulfill his non-fiction summer reading assignment and checked here to see whether it was still in print. Sorry to see it is not."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"\\"The story of the men who were defeated for the Presidency.\\"A very interesting book about those that were defeated in their bid for the White House. The author brings these men to life by answering the questions, who were they, why did they run, why did they lose, and also speculating on the job they would have done had they won.A great read for any history buff."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole, Al Gore, John Kerry, John McCain. I can remember a time when each of these men was front-page, top-of-the-hour news, when each of these names was all over the place on bumper stickers and lawn signs. I voted for two of them. And except for Al Gore, they've all pretty much faded completely out of our collective national mind. Since the advent of modern popular elections, over two dozen American men have found themselves only a breath away from the highest office in the land, only to find their hopes shattered when the final votes were tallied. Those of us with a solid background in American history have heard of George B. McClellan and Winfield Scott, Henry Clay and Horace Greeley, Stephen Douglas and William Jennings Bryan - but if things had been a little different, any one of them might have had his portrait hung in the National Portrait Gallery's Hall of Presidents. As for Horatio Seymour, Alton B. Parker, Charles Evans Hughes, and John W. Davis - how many of us have even heard their names? Each one was chosen as his party's candidate for President of the United States. Each lost, leaving as his legacy a footnote in the history books rather than a footprint in the sands of time.If you've ever wondered about these men - if you've ever wondered just what sort of world we'd be living in now if Dewey really HAD defeated Truman - Irving Stone's \\"They Also Ran\\" is the book for you. Stone set himself the challenge of researching the lives of those candidates who were defeated for the office of President, and ultimately making an educated attempt to answer some hard questions: \\"How frequently were [the voters] fooled, and how frequently did they go unerringly to the better man? How often did they elect the apparently superior candidate, only to find that the presidency was the one job in the nation that he could not handle? How often did they choose the man who was more capable of solving the existing problems, only to have a radical change in the course of history render his particular qualities useless . . . ? Are the voters getting smarter all the time . . . or are they repeating the identical errors they made a hundred years ago? . . . What were the inherent traits in the characters of such disparate individuals . . . which led them all to the same [outcome, i.e., defeat in the presidential race]? . . . How might the defeated ones have changed the course of our history?\\" Stone never promises all the answers, but the lucid biographical sketches and cogent analysis he offers in these pages deliver plenty of food for thought, as well as a fresh and unusual perspective on American history.The 1945 edition of this book contains twenty chapters, each one offering a concise summary of the life and career of one of the defeated candidates. Instead of arranging the candidates in chronological order, Stone groups them into a number of categories based on their backgrounds (e.g., generals, governors, career politicians, judges, lawyers, journalists), and tells their stories chronologically within each category. It's a novel arrangement which allows some interesting opportunities for comparison and contrast, but, since the arrangement of the categories (two of which contain only one man) is somewhat arbitrary, not entirely ideal. Readers who prefer to take their history \\"straight\\" will find it easy enough to adopt a chronological approach to this book; one has simply to turn to the \\"Cast of Characters\\" presented alongside the table of contents and work down through it from top to bottom. Start on page 50 with the chapter on Henry Clay, then turn to page 278 to read about Lewis Cass, then back to 138 for Winfield Scott, and so forth.Readers who find political history rather tedious need not hesitate to pick up \\"They Also Ran.\\" This is Irving Stone, after all, the grand master of the biographical novel, whose fictional treatments of Presidents John Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, and \\"Also-Ran\\" John C. Fr&eacute;mont, are titled, respectively, \\"Those Who Love,\\" \\"The President's Lady,\\" \\"Love Is Eternal,\\" and \\"Immortal Wife.\\" For Stone, history is nothing but a tapestry woven of human stories, and the political arena, like the arts or sciences or any other field of human endeavor, is above all a place in which great and ambitious and dangerous men and women play out the passions that drive them. That's not to say that there's anything overly dramatic or romantic in this book; Stone never forgets that he's writing nonfiction here. However, accounts of speeches and nominating conventions and discussions of policy are interspersed with delightful anecdotes that make the candidates immediate, relatable, real, and, above all, entirely human. Firm adherence to the facts no more excludes flavor and color than it does warmth and human connection; the book is full of wit and pitch-perfect turns of phrase. I don't think I've ever laughed out loud before while reading a book on history or politics (\\"Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway\\" doesn't count), but when Stone described Bryan as a \\"doughnut dunker in the coffee of other men's ideas,\\" I couldn't hold back a bit of a chortle.Readers of all political persuasions will be able to enjoy this book. I figured out pretty early on that Stone considered himself a liberal, but on the political spectrum of today, his views would probably fall under the category of \\"moderate\\" (capitalism is a good system but prone to certain abuses which must be reined in by law; government should be on the smallish side but does have the power to be a positive force for the benefit of the governed). This is almost beside the point, however; Stone's goal in this book is to educate, to provoke thought, even to entertain, not to take a stand for any particular political platform. Stone doesn't hold back his opinions on the candidates or their qualifications, but his approach is generally quite fair; not even the men he most admires are exempt from criticism, while he openly acknowledges the virtues of those whose ascent to the presidency he maintains would have been an all-out disaster. Candidates he believes would have been at least as capable at the men who defeated them include both Democrats and Republicans (and one Whig); candidates he states the American public did well to reject also include both Democrats and Republicans (and one Whig). Expect to read history here, not heavy-handed ideology. While Stone's apparent admiration for \\"empire-builders\\" and those who extended the dubious benefits of civilization to the American Indians may well make the modern reader cringe a bit, such concerns are touched upon very little or not at all in most chapters.With Stone's amply-documented facts I have little complaint; serious historians may find his system of references unsatisfactory, particularly in regards to quoted material, but the casual reader who doesn't want the page cluttered with footnotes is unlikely to object. My only real quibbles were with an otherwise very helpful table of who ran when, for what party. Only the Federalist, Democratic, Whig, and Republican parties are listed, whereas some of the candidates included in the chart actually ran as something else; Henry Clay's three runs for the presidency are listed in the \\"Whig\\" column, although the chapter on Henry Clay makes it clear that he actually ran in 1824 as a Democrat, in 1832 as a member of the short-lived National Republican Party, and only in 1844 as a Whig. Also, Stone implies, not only in this chart but a couple of times in the book itself, that the present-day Democratic party has existed since the 1790s. In fact, the party to which Thomas Jefferson belonged was known at the time as the Republican Party, although modern political scientists refer to it as the Democratic-Republican party (because it's so much less confusing that way). This party split during the 1820s; one remnant did emerge as today's Democratic Party.In a short addendum in the 1966 edition, Stone discusses the three men who had joined the ranks of the Also-Rans since this book was originally published. Although he states his intention to write full chapters on each of these men (one of whom, Richard Nixon, was subsequently elected to office and thereby lifted beyond the scope of this book anyway), he never did. I can't help wishing he had continued to expand and improve this book until his death in 1989. This is history as it should be written: vital, exciting, at once fresh and familiar. We've all heard it said that the history books are written by the winners; in \\"They Also Ran,\\" Stone turns his attention to the losers, and in so doing allows us to look at American history from a new angle. In the light of disasters averted and possibilities unrealized, history is no longer the dusty \\"fait accompli\\" it so often seems, but a tense and dramatic present that just happens to be past. Reading about these candidates, how their stories intertwine with each other and with the more familiar stories we all know, leaves the reader with a deeper understanding of the American political and ideological heritage. I recommend reading this book during a presidential election year; you'll come to the last page intrigued, invigorated, eager to participate in the democratic process, and profoundly aware just how much is at stake in November when you walk into that voting booth."},{"Title":"They Also Ran: The Story of the Men Who Were Defeated for the Presidency","review":"Irving Stone's They Also Ran, a survey of men who ran for the presidency and lost is a tidy, well written and superbly organized book, written for the general reader. Mr. Stone's research is solid, his opinions interesting if, after a while, somewhat predictable, he had a modrate to liberal bias which doesn't detract from the overall quality of his work. He in other words plays fair.The writing is at times quaint by today's standards, withal professional. It's an easy to read book, great fun for history buffs. I for the most part found myself agreeing with most of Mr. Stone's assessments, though some of his psychological insights strike me as curious, as he makes what at times read like diagnoses of characters, classes some as unstable or \\"psychopathic\\" whom I, from what I know of them, would prefer words such as mercurial or moody.There's much to like about this book, and even as I found myself questioning the author's judgments I never questioned his intellectual integrity. His prejudices, and he does have them, are out in the open; nor do they detract from the book's overall excellence. Now, some seventy years after it was first published, it holds up very well, and for the young newbie to American history it provides a first rate introduction to the political process, the temper of the times, whether antebellum, Gilded Age or the Great Depression. A solid piece of work, it's well worth seeking out, and what's more, one can read it more than once and find things one forget to take note of the first time around. It's a classic of its kind."},{"Title":"The Nasdaq Trader's Toolkit","review":"It was OK as far as it goes, but I was disappointed in that it was very outdated. Trading has so far advanced in speed and execution times by now. Maybe some of the different execution methods used to matter a few years back, but I am not sure now. Of course it depends on how \\"large\\" a trader you are, and how often.I was actually looking for more descriptions on how to discern what is happening on Level 2, and the author touched on it too briefly, in my opinion. The hand-eye coordination needed to see what he describes is extremely limited in application on fast moving high volume stocks. His static descriptions (definitions, market makers, ECNs, etc) were pretty good. So much of that is available through other means, nowadays. As I said, it was the \\"interpretation\\" that was lacking, I felt.The graphic examples in the book were mediocre, and don't match the screens I am using presently.I neither short, nor buy on margin, and now I know better why not.The most insightful discussion was about the so-called \\"hidden\\" orders which I suspected were there, and he firmed that up for me. Basically, what you see on Level II can't really be trusted, and using it for more than anything but entertainment is risky.Many of the things in the book are limited by what one's online broker will do for you. No way could I trade a dozen times a day on the same stock as described."},{"Title":"The Nasdaq Trader's Toolkit","review":"Here&#65533;s a solid read for the Nasdaq Level II curious.

If you have no idea what Level II is, that&#65533;s covered as well. Slugging it out in the trenches with scalping strategies is nothing that comes easy for the untrained eye. Labier brings some clarity to the madness with the one goal of making a profitable trader.Having the intricacies of the Level II screen ingrained in the mindset is a must for a Level II trader. This book is appropriately called a &#65533;toolkit&#65533; for the trader who uses all the information to his or her advantage. &#65533;Buy low and sell high&#65533; is a start, but to really be good at this game, you need everything you can get your hands on to gain an advantage.I found the strategies uncovered by Labier as to how market makers use deception to mislead a key feature in this book. It's not hard to see how a rookie trader gets eaten up by the big guys when maneuvering through Level II&#65533;s electronic battlefield. Labier will save you from a few wounds with an in-depth look into the tricks players use to outwit the competition.Of other interest is a thorough description of how orders are processed. The Nasdaq is a complicated structure of computer networking that needs to be understood when it comes to choosing a platform from which you wish to trade. Another issue is the up-and-coming Level III that Labier gives the low down on.I recommend this book for someone interested in getting into Level II.

Although the book covers SuperSOES, SuperMontage, decimalization and other recent changes, these changes had not been rolled out at the time of writing.

I was skeptical, but I bought the book anyway for two reasons. I am fairly new to direct access trading, and I saw the author at an Expo last year. I was very impressed by his information packed seminar - usually these things are filled with sales pitches, hype and hyperbole - but his seminar was conspicuously lacking fluff. It was full of real, solid information. In fact, too much information for such a short venue, so I decided to buy his book. I should first of all explain that I spent years trading in the pits, but for the past decade or so, I have been trading stocks, most recently with a discount online broker. It took me a long time to make the move to direct access, and at this point, I would never go back.I want to tell any beginning traders out there that if you are considering making the move to direct access trading, you MUST read this book. This is just my personal opinion, but the book has made such a considerable difference to my trading profits that it would be unfair not to share my praise. The author has done a fantastic job of explaining Level ll and the order execution routes in every day language. Unlike the typical books which give cursory treatment to the realities of direct access trading, this book covers all the actual mechanics of it - from how to interpret level ll, to which routes work best *when*, to the special margin situation which applies to &quot;pattern day traders.&quot;I am so glad that I bought the book. Because, when I made the move to direct access, I was really lost! And that was my worst fear. I worried that when I started trading direct that I wouldn't be able to execute well, and would be confused by level ll (information overload). My worst fears were realized quickly when I started trading direct. This book stopped the madness. I highly recommend it to anyone who trades direct, or is considering trading direct.I am convinced this book will become an industry standard. There simply are no other books that even come close to explaining the nuts-and-bolts of utilizing the direct access tools. The writing is even humorous and comprehensive at the same time, so it is not the deadly boring tome that I was expecting. It is an enjoyable read jam-packed with tools you can use right away. Somebody once told me &quot;the best trading plan in the world is useless if you can't execute it.&quot; This book will show you the Hows like no other.This review is my way of saying thank you to the author, who has done a truly amazing job. This book has paid for itself so many times that it would be hard to explain. This book may well become your best friend - especially if you already know how to trade, but are new to the tools of direct access trading. (Rogan, if you read this you'll remember me from my \\"secant plan\\" story - keep up the good work!)"},{"Title":"The Nasdaq Trader's Toolkit","review":"I'd like to reccommend the following book to anyone who is using a level ll entry system. The book assumes you have a trading plan (quite an assumption, huh?) and focuses on what order routing options are most appropriate in given market conditions. Anyone who's ever pounded on his or her desk yelling &quot;fill, damnit, fill!&quot; will benefit from this book. Quite simply the best guide to level ll interpretation and order routing I've ever seen. It provides some terrific details on ALL of the ECN's, SelectNet, InstiNet, (etc) and the micro-mechanics of dealing with them. Far from the simple &quot;routing grids&quot; provided by DAB's, this book shows which routes work BEST, and when. It is filled with many excellent insights about the workings of the quotes montage (which is no longer a mystery to me)."},{"Title":"The Nasdaq Trader's Toolkit","review":"I bought the book recently. It has so much great information that I decided to see the author speak at the &quot;Online Trading Expo&quot; in NYC this past weekend. He really knows his stuff; the tutorial was the best and most informative of all tutorials I attended - and I am not alone in that opinion. All I can say is: if you are new to trading direct access, you may find this book to be the single best investment you make. True, there are some typos, and the author's style is a little irreverent - but that's GOOD news to me - so many of these books are either hype or dead boring. This is niether; it is funny and comprehensive. It covers every execution route available to today's trader. Much of the information is covered nowhere else - most BROKERS don't even know this stuff. My broker in particular. But he did have the good sense to reccomend this book to me, and for that I am very greatful. This book will benefit your trading immediately.

But - information is comprehensive and in depth like no other book on Level 2.

Complete, unique, and accurate descriptions of all execution systems, in lay terms. When to use which routes, and why. Including Supersoes, how it works, when it works, and how to use it (and when not to use it). If you want to learn the specifics of how to get the best fills, this book will help like no other I've seen. Straight and to the point, with no b.s. promoting any brokers, services, etc. Just great info.Only complaint is that graphics are in fractions, and that is annoying. But all of the ideas and strategies are current and comprehensive. Like I said earlier, it has a complete description of how to use Supersoes. Overall, best coverage of execution and level 2 interpretation I have seen. I learned a number of things, and I've been trading &quot;direct&quot; for two years. I am a swing trader, and most of the books dealing with level 2 cover the subject in such a way that it simply doesn't apply to what I do. This book does; the approach to execution is accurate accross all time frames, not just scalping.

After seeing some of the reviews criticizing it as anti-Semitic I felt compelled to offer a few remarks. Firstoff, I believe that while the book presents a critical, controversial history of Jewish fundamentlism it can hardly be characterized as anti-Semitic. Those who feel this way are the same people who blantantly refuse to acknowledge the illegality of Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and policy of settlement expansion in these territories.Secondly, I want to say that while Professor Mezvinsky is perhaps not a widely reknowned scholar he does possess an outstanding knowledge of the topic and again it is ridiculous to label him as anti-Semitic. It is true that he strongly disagrees with the pro-Jewish policies of the state of Israel, but this simply means that he is more of a human rights advocate than his critics would like one to believe."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"The title of this book doesn't do justice to its content, and I will focus on matters not generally emphasized by other reviewers.There clearly is another side to the oft-discussed historic Christian antagonism towards Jews. Citing Israeli scholars such as Bartal and Rosen, the authors comment: \\"Rosen included in his long article many well-documented cases of massacres of Christians and mock repetitions of the crucifixion of Jesus on Purim, most of which occurred either in the late ancient period or in the Middle Ages.\\" (p. 116)Many vices tacitly blamed on Christianity turn out to have been common in the pre-modern world, including in Judaism. This includes such things as the humiliation of offenders in stocks (p. 129) and intolerance towards religious dissenters, which culminated in the killings of heretics. (p. 131). So was general violence: \\"Until 1881 in Russia, the number of riots by Jews against other Jews probably exceeded the number of pogroms by non-Jews against Jews.\\" (p. 132)WWII Poles are bashed because some of them believed in God's collective punishment of Jews. And, whenever some modern Christian, no matter how obscure, suggests this, the press has a feeding frenzy. Not so for Jewish religious leaders: \\"Many Haredi rabbis, for example, assert that the Holocaust, including most particularly the deaths of one-and-a-half million Jewish children, was a well-deserved divine punishment, not only for all the sins of modernity and faith renunciation by many Jews, but also for the decline of Talmudic study in Europe...The Haredim believe that God punishes each Jew for his or her sins and sometimes punishes the entire Jewish community, including many who are innocent, because of the sins committed by other Jews.\\" (p. 31)On another topic, divergent attitudes towards Germany became a major factor antagonizing Poles and Jews. Poles usually saw Germans as their mortal enemies; Jews virtually never did, until well into the Holocaust (and then only for its duration). At the time of the Partitions, Polish Jews living in German-conquered regions of Poland became enamored by the Enlightenment tendencies of Frederic II the Great, and by the enlightened Jews centered on Berlin (p. 145). Jewish philo-Germanism continued to grow: \\"This situation, which endured until the rise of Nazism, made the Jews of eastern Europe strong German sympathizers and contributed to the rise of modern Polish anti-Semitism. Contrary to what Goldhagen has propagated, Jews of eastern Europe, even during World War I, regarded the Germans and the German occupying army as philo-Semitic. They had good reasons for holding this view.\\" (p. 167). (As for the Prussian-ruled Polish Jews, they had become totally Germanized long before WWI, and had come to include some of the most vociferous opponents of the resurrection of the Polish state)."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"This book was very informative and honest in its writing.

Shahak and Mezvinsky have written a \\"forbidden\\" book and for that they deserve praise. It is ironic that as soon as any criticism is directed at Jews, the author is called an anti-semitist. Needless to say, this is an extremely calculated strategy employed to escape and avoid constructive criticism. Shahak and Mezvinsky claim that Jewish fundamentalists believe that they are the chosen people, that they have the right to settle wherever they want and that they are superior to other people. Furthermore, according to Shahak and Mezvinsky, these Jewish extremists aim to create a state comprising of Jews only. All other religions are considered fallible and inferior. Judaism, on the other hand, is considered flawless and superior to all. How can anyone believe that they are the \\"chosen\\" people, that they are superior and omnipotent? This is extremely discriminatory! Another important point made by the authors is that there has never been any mention of Jewish fundamentalism in the American media. This is extremely unfair. Needless to say, the american media is more than ready to criticize Moslems. Any reasonable human being considers this unjust and discriminatory. The authors further assert that powerful Jewish lobbyists prevent this view of the Jews to be presented in the american media. After all, mainstream media is largely controlled by these Jewish elites. This is an important book that should be read by every American. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"I couldn't resist reading this book. My three favorite American intellectuals Noam Chomsky, Edward W. Said and Gore Vidal have in one way or another recommended it. This in itself is high praise.I find Israel Shahak's book a spring of fresh water in an arid intellectual environment of disinformation, propaganda and outright intellectual intimidation. For me Shahak is in the same mold as Jewish Prophets of old, warning Israel against a new catastrophe.I do not pretend to the intellectual heights of Shahak. I can only judge the accuracy of the book by comparing it to areas where I do have expertise, namely the history, as it pertains to the Lithuanian, Polish, Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires. The only portion of the book I found lacking was Shahak's knowledge of Petlura's government of Ukraine during the First World War.When I sent Shahak a short article about Petlura from a Symposium \\"Ukrainian & Jews\\" he responded in a letter to me dated June 1, 1999, quote...\\"I am sorry for my mistake about the regime of Petlura. Your evidence, especially the translated documents, is very persuasive and I accept it. If possible I will change the next editions\\" Jewish History, Jewish religion\\" accordingly.\\"...unquote.I found Shahak's book made me understand portions of the Bible which I had difficulty understanding. It provided the cultural context for an intellectual conundrum that I had in regard to the Old Testament.The two conundrums are the ethnic cleansing condoned by God of the Canaanites in Deuteronomy and the other was the dialogue between Jesus and the Canaanite women in Mathew 15:21-28, where he replies , quote...\\"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\\"...unquote.It is only after reading Shahak that I finally understood the unchristian behavior of Jesus. He after all was not a Christian but a Jewish Rabbi, well versed in the Talmud with all of the cultural taboos associated with it in those times. He came to save the Jews and the World. It was Paul (Saul), another well trained Rabbi who brought Jesus' reformed Judaism to the Pagan Mediterranean world and created Christianity.This book is replete with insights that only and intellect of rigorous and highly developed moral understanding of History could deliver."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"The authors bring everything together with enviable clarity and with an unusally sharp eye for research.

I checked the social science citation index and found that, unlike serious scholars on the Middle East like Ilan Pappe and Benny Morris, almost no one cites his work.For his next book, Shahak should choose another, better coauthor."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"A lack of historical perspective underlies most American's understanding of Middle Eastern politics. The classic view of most Americans is that \\"democracy\\" is something that can be exported, like plastic hair curlers and cans of corn, or inherent, a la \\"Full Metal Jacket\\": inside every Arab/Israeli is an American trying to get out. Professors Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky point out that the Jewish perspective is mostly if not always lacking in American media analysis. Understanding the Jewish angle may lead to better appreciation and hopefully better polices in the region. Professor Shahak's and Mexvinsky's book cites numerous Hebrew press articles and books that were intended specifically for a Jewish audience.\\"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel\\" points out that the key consideration that drives Israeli policy against its neighbors is \\"Jew versus everybody else\\". This line of thinking persists whether one is religious or an ardent secularist. In fact, gradations of the Israeli political spectrum depend on how much one is willing to preserve the Jewish nature of Israel. Preservation of the genetic heritage lies in the hands of the religious parties, which both the so-called liberals (The Israeli Labor Party) as well as conservatives (Likud) court in building a government. The religious parties, in turn, do not quarrel on whether or not Judaism should dictate social and political policies but rather on degree. Indeed, some Israeli religious parties are not at all supportive of the establishment of Israel, a Jewish nation established before the arrival of the Messiah - but nevertheless actively participate in the legislature and cabinet. The messianic view pervades many religious Israelis, that is, Jews must make conditions right for His arrival, including cleansing the promised land of all non-Jews and their idolatry. Interestingly, similar fundamentalist pronouncements are shared by the majority of the American leadership and their key supporters.Ultimately, a rational foreign policy will depend on making decisions based on facts, which are sorely lacking in today's political discussions. Policy cannot be based on faulty preconceived notions. \\"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel\\" is a very enlightening book that illustrates the actual political situation on the ground in Israel to a non-Hebrew speaking audience."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"Thought provoking, if true it has interesting implications."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"Thought provoking, if true it has interesting implications."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"I felt it wasn't balanced enough. There are religious fanatics whereever you find organised religion, I don't think the majority of Israeli's feel the same way as the Haredim. In a sense, they are as much threatened by their religious extremism as Palestinians are because they would also be excluded from power in such a theocracy. However, the book is necessary because a lot of Jews are brought up to believe that Jews are incapable of inflicting the same sort of horrors that we faced in Europe and that Israel's blatant land grab is justified by our history.

If someone is not, however, then even the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" and \\"Mein Kampf\\" won't change their mind.There's also a large pool inbetween, by which I mean people who don't feel the need to go out of their way to express themselves as either anti- or pro-Semitic. I'm not a Jew; Judaism is not part of my idenity. Neither is Hinduism or Sikhism, for that matter. Therefore, I don't go out of my way to show that I have an opinion on the matter. Instead, I tried to learn as much as I can with an open mind.If you truly believe anti-Semitism is wrong as its core, not because you happen to be the target of its vileness, but because it is demonstratably WRONG, then my approach shouldn't trouble you. Nor should this book.I give it four stars because it is well written and very interesting. It is 100% correct? I have no idea. I intend to read more, as much as I possibly can in this life. It will contribute to my understanding of the issues, whether I find more evidence to support it or disprove it.An anti-Semite doesn't need this book, but it will fuel his misguided views the same any other book would.

Neither project is do-able. What is do-able is composing polemics and even fabrications to suit an argument, the premise of which is dubious and borders on the reprehensible. If the failure to achieve political compromise in Palestine in 1947, or a peace agreement afterwards, and the consequences of those failures, are deemed worse than or equal to the fate that befell Jews during WWII, then what we are really dealing with here becomes clear. A big lie. I feel pity for the Israeli chemist who survived the Warsaw Ghetto, was obviously brilliant, but whose writings reflect deep rooted problems. I do not believe that there is courage or anything laudable about hateful and falsehood-riddled polemics against anyone, especially one's \\"own\\" people for defending themselves against enemies who wish for their destruction.

Such a book would, of course, be grossly unfair, but it would be no more unfair than &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel&quot; by Norton Mezvinsky and Israel Shakak.Mezvinsky is professor of history at Central Connecticut State College. He teaches the lone course offered by Central Connecticut in Jewish history, as well as two courses on contemporary Middle Eastern politics. Shahak is deceased.Mezvinsky claims that his focuses in this book on Jewish fundamentalists, is because they threaten to take power in Israel as Islamic Fundamentalists did in Iran. This should concern Americans, he says, because Israel is &quot;a powerful state... that wields great influence in the United States.&quot; The threat that fundamentalists pose to Israeli democracy is similar in Mezvinsky's view, to our domestic situation in which &quot;Christian fundamentalism (is) a real threat to democracy in the United States.&quot;It escapes Mezvinsky that Jewish and Christian fundamentalists, unlike Islamists, are peaceful groups and are but tiny fractions of the populations they live in while Islamists in many places are a large and growing segments of theirs. The truth is that in the United States as well as Israel, fundamentalists who espouse replacing democracy with theocracy constitute only a tiny voiceless fringe and bear no resemblance to the looming menace portrayed in &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel.&quot;In Mezvinsky's view, the threat posed by observant Jews goes beyond their impending destruction of democracy, because he holds that Judaism is an evil faith. Judaism, a religion of racism &quot;comparable to the worst form of anti-Semitism&quot; has produced adherents so immoral that they believe &quot;the blood of non-Jews has no intrinsic value.&quot; he says blithely. Furthermore, &quot;Jews killing non-Jews does not constitute murder according to the Jewish religion and the killing of innocent Arabs for reasons of revenge is a Jewish virtue.&quot; This is the stuff that makes this book dangerous and is comparable to much of the anti-semitic stuff coming out of the Middle East media today.If his portrayal of Judaism does not sound like the Jewish religion that you know, Mezvinsky has an explanation. Rabbis and scholars have been keeping the truth from us. They are &quot;supreme hypocrites&quot; who have hidden from other Jews &quot;The actual fact that the cabbalistic texts, as opposed to talmudic literature, emphasize salvation only for Jews.&quot;Mezvinsky, of course, misses two important points. The first is that the Kabbalah, like the Talmud, is not a single book but a veritable ocean of scholarship and commentary. In such an ocean, it is possible to find a quotation to prove almost any point, although even Mezvinsky has to admit that the evil he sought is not in the Talmud, but only in the Kabbalah.The second point is that the Kabbalah, that vast sea of mystical lore and wisdom, is not normative Judaism. Kabbalah is for Jews an option and an acquired taste, like Sephardi music or Ashkenazi cooking. It is also, of course, a complex if chaotic body of thought that by no fair interpretation deserves Mezvinsky's epithet of &quot;Jewish Nazism.&quot;Beyond the malicious absurdity of its premise, Mezvinsky's work is riddled with undocumented slurs and falsehoods presented as fact.* &quot;No Orthodox rabbi&quot; has criticized the posthumous glorification of Baruch Goldstein.* &quot;The Israeli government induced Jewish immigration from Iraq by bribing the government of Iraq to strip most Iraqi Jews of their citizenship and to confiscate their property.&quot;* &quot;Before the advent of the modern state, Jewish communities were mostly ruled by rabbis who employed arbitrary and cruel methods as bad as those employed by totalitarian regimes.&quot;In Norton Mezvinsky, the state of Connecticut is paying the salary of a professor of Jewish history who has a limited understanding of that history and substitutes his bias for knowledge. Moreover, Mezvinsky is a professor of history who is unacquainted with &quot;the arbitrary and cruel methods&quot; employed by totalitarian regimes around the world, but that doesn't stop him from ascribing them to the subject he knows so little about.Diana Muir is the winner of the 2001 Massachusetts Book Award, and a professional book reviewer for the Boston Globe and the Christian Science Monitor.This review was published in the Connecticut Jewish Ledger in 2002."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"I know little of Judaism and therefore must rely on the expertise of the writers to evaluate the book's worth. On that basis, the quality of the book must be uneven.Mezvinsky was trained as a historian but his publication list is poor indeed. Most of his writing seems to be for popular magazines like the \\"Washington Report on Middle East Affairs.\\" He has very few publications of a truly scholarly nature and many of those were collections of other people's work that he had edited. I have read a fair number of books written by scholars of the Middle East and can't remember a single one ever citing Mezvinsky's work.There is nothing in Mezvinsky's list of publications that even remotely suggests that he has any expertise on Judaism as a religion.Incidentally, years ago, Moshe Menuhin wrote a book entitled Jewish Critics of Zionism.

It wholly ignores the fundamental position of Judaism which is that all of mankind is created in the image of God, and that every human being's task in life is to walk in the way of God in doing justice and mercy. It ignores the fact that of all the great religious faiths Judaism has been the most moderate, reasonable and least persecuting of others. Consider for instance the tolerance and religious freedom within the state of Israel today and compare it to the situation in any of the neighboring Islamic- dominated lands.When there are occasional wrongful acts by Jews or Israelis against a non-Jewish population they are condemned by the wider Jewish public. It is well- known that the Israeli Army has more than once taken special care to protect the lives of civilians who terrorists were hiding behind- and lost soldiers in the process.What is most objectionable in this work is its total misrepresentation of the attitude of the Jewish people as a whole- and also of the state of Israel towards any kind of illegal, immoral, violence towards others. Such action is strongly condemned within the Jewish tradition.I would like to conclude this review by a citation of another reviewer Diana Muir.

Shahak (himself a Jew) takes pains to separate fundamentalists from secular and traditional Jews. He further differentiates between groups under the fundamentalist influence. This book gives the reader a rare look of what happens in rabbinical circles and what is printed in Hebrew press that the rest of the world doesn't get to see. I wish MEMRI would be more altruistic and translate some of the Hebrew press. The major threat is that these groups pose a threat to Israel's democracy, and are major deterents to peace in the region. Without a doubt, Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists are equally to blame, however this book focuses (as the title indicates) solely on Jewish fundamentalism. A very eye-opening book and a bit frightening for lovers of peace and democracy. The complexity of Jewish society and culture is absolutely incredible. This book was clearly written for academics, NOT anti-Semites looking for \\"ammunition\\" with which to spew their hatred. I only wish there was a book written by Muslims that was as open and honest in their criticism of Islamic fundamentalists as this book is of Jewish fundamentalists. One certainly learns that broad generalizations of culture groups is wrong and non-representive. Shahak details the history and development of events leading up to Rabin's assasination, the massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, and more. The book also details the rise of the Haredim in Israel and how political influence is won and lost in the Knesset. When an orthodox Jewish friend of mine told me how cruel Jews can be to other Jews, I had no idea how serious he was until I read this book. It is saddening to read. An excellent book recommended to those who are reading to learn of another perspective, not for those looking to increase their anti-Semitic hate. The information in this book could easily be taken out of context; the beauty of this book is that it provides everything IN context so that the reader understands the severity of the problem of fundamentalism without drawing the incorrect conclusion that Jews are somehow racist. Truly an incredible read."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"Fascinating insights into the groups which are generally over-simplified into the &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; (itself a serious misnomer, since &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; isn't the issue at all). The authors explain the differences between the various fundamentalist factions and sub-factions (Haredim, Shas, NRP, Kookists, Gush Emunim, etc., etc... and the black vs. knit skullcaps), who often put more energy into battling each other and other Jews than they do against the Palestinians. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is that it draws almost entirely on Israeli sources in Hebrew, rather than the self-censoring and often apologetic English-language press which attempts to put as good a light on things as possible, largely for the benefit of the diaspora. I was unaware, for example, of the extent of open rejoicing among fundamentalists (and many other Israelis) over the Patriarch's Cave massacre and the murder of Rabin; and the role of &quot;magic amulets&quot; in election campaigns. Alas, the book does not make one optimistic about the prospects for reaching peace through rational discussion."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book. There is a tremendous amount of detail on the different Jewish fundamentalist political groups, the major one being Shas. Certain areas of the book interested me more than others. I felt the points on religiosity and fundamentalism were interesting. Another major point of my interest was the work on Baruch Goldstein. Shahak and Mezvinsky did an excellent job in substantiating that Baruch Goldstein was part of a larger Jewish fundamentalist movement that is accepted by Israel rather than a single crazy man."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"Shahak explains in vivid detail various strains of Jewish fundamentalism and their political ambitions.

Such items can be hot to handle. Opening at random my copy of &quot;JFII&quot;, I find a reference to an execution in the Spanish city of Alicena nearly a millennium ago &quot;dictated by the need to explain to all Jews that the duty of killing a Jewish informer is more important than other religious considerations...Maimonides said that the obligation to kill both informers and heretics is a tradition that is applied in all cities of the west.&quot; [p.140] As Gore Vidal has rightly suggested, IS qualifies through his three recent titles as a sage roughly on par with the prophet Isaiah. Since the clique which IS so learnedly describes has managed to achieve a decisive degree of influence over the Gore-Clinton regime, the American reader will find the remarks herein striking home to quite an intimate degree. IMHO the single most important sentence in JFII = &quot;since the inception of Israel the secret slogan of Israeli politicians was 'we shall conquer first the security apparatus and then the Knesset and government.&quot; [p.93] The phrase &quot;security apparatus&quot; can be better translated into plain, old-fashioned English as &quot;the secret police&quot;. Students of recent politics will want to review the Oklahoma City bombing, that moment of salvation for Mr.Clinton &amp; the C.I.A, in the light of JFII. I would describe the author as the insider's insider who, to the great benefit of the species at large, has opened the door at the top of his tower in order to get an essential breath of the fresh air of truth, that vitally inflamatory oxygen of the human spirit. So how long will the Sulzbergers' New York TIMES take to get around to reviewing Shahak?"},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"Jewish fundamentalism is only rarely considered in the Western press--try looking up references to Gush Emunim, the settler's movement, in the NY Times index, to find how well its tenets have been explained to the American public. Try looking up &quot;Jewish fundamentalism&quot; and contrasting the number of results with &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; to get some idea of the magnitude of the bias in the media on this topic, so crucial to understanding the wars of our time.Shahak and Mezvinsky have done us a great service by providing a coherent and well researched explanation of the ideologies of the fundamentalists in Israel, and how they influence the policies of the state. The authors have, they explain, decided to use as their primary sources documents that are explicitly not written in English, and are therefore not only less accessible, but more honest than the sanitized works written for the gentiles.Their contribution provides a powerful introduction to those who wish to gain some understanding of the real basis for the mess in the Middle East, which has finally dragged the US into a full scale war and occupation of Iraq.The root cause of the conflict is that the fundamentalists, who are comprised of several different groups, mostly agree on their predestined occupation and settlement of the West Bank. They have managed to bring along the political world of the secularists, embodied in the Likud and Labor parties, who have provided the wherewithal to generate and support the settlements consistently over the years, whatever the stage of the &quot;peace process&quot; currently in vogue.The book is clearly written, well organized, incredibly informative, and a must read for all Americans."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"The truth hurts. This is the truth. I have traveled in the described areas at length and have spoken to all political factions. It has always bothered me that it is politically incorrect to talk about the atrocities that the jews commit in the Middle East. This Book Is Long Overdue."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"No religious community is monolithic. Many people who consider themselves devout dissent from certain aspects of their religions. One cannot assume that because some sage wrote something thousands of years ago that modern adherents necessarily act on those passages.The failure to make the above point clear, especially in light of two thousand years of anti-Semitic persecution, is a serious flaw in an otherwise good book. The reader unfamiliar with Judaism might erroneously conclude that all observant Jews agree with the more extreme passages cited by Shahak and Mezvinsky but, in fact, many do not.The authors have done an excellent job dissecting one part of the spectrum that is Judaism. Yes, ther are observant Jews who are racist, discriminatory, and advocate violence. I was reminded of that when talking to a formerly secular friend who has become observant. He returned home from a West Bank Yeshiva and openly laughed about settlers who shot Arabs guilty only of quarrying stone for their houses.Still, these fanatics do not represent all of Judaism.On a personal note, I have met both Shahak and Mezvinsky. The world has never seen a finer human being than the late Israel Shahak. His years of suffering in the Warsaw Ghetto and Bergen Belsen left him with a deep sensitivity for the oppressed. He was a secular saint.Mezvinsky is another person altogether, but I really can't comment.Jessica Ramer"},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"_Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel_ by Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky is a problematic book which nonetheless provides some important insights into the political situations of ultra-religious Jews in Israel. For one thing there is the abuse of the term \\"fundamentalism\\". Fundamentalism properly understood refers to a group of Protestant Christians who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible which must be interpreted literally. Jews and Muslims do not refer to themselves as fundamentalists. Secondly, the book is rather poorly written and contains quite a bit of left wing goofiness, which distracts from an otherwise interesting subject matter. The issue of intolerance among religious Jews in Israel is particularly disturbing. This book details much of that level of intolerance, particularly for the Palestinian population living in the land of Israel, but also for Gentiles in general and fellow Jews deemed heretics. Perhaps the most famous case of persecution of heresy among religious Jews is that of the philosopher Baruch (Benedict, Latinized) Spinoza who was excommunicated for going against the rabbinate. The authors try to make the claim that similar occurrences have happened throughout history (see _Jewish History, Jewish Religion_ by Israel Shahak) and continue to happen in Israel dominated by religious forces. The authors spend a great deal of time discussing various political parties including the Haredim and Gush Emunim. The conflict between secular Jews and the orthodox and ultra-orthodox sects becomes apparent in such issues as the conscription of Israeli youth to the military, where those studying for the rabbinate do not have to participate and are supported by the state. An even more radical viewpoint is expressed by the followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who moved to Israel from New York. Kahane advocated a radical form of Jewish supremacism and racism, basing his chauvinistic views on the arrogant myth of \\"the chosen\\". One follower of Kahane took his views seriously and gunned down a group of Arabs praying in a mosque at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, Baruch Goldstein. The authors show how the Jewish response to the Goldstein rampage was less than honest, many outright supporting what Goldstein had done. The authors also discuss the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was perceived as a moderate willing to concede lands to the Arabs by the Israeli \\"far right\\". Another disturbing issue involves religious idolatry of the Temple Mount, on which sits a mosque which many claim must be destroyed to bring about the Messiah. (An interesting discussion of this issue in full and how it relates to Christian evangelicals may be found in the book _The End of Days_ by Gershom Gorenberg.) In sum, this book brings up some disturbing issues about the political parties in the land of Israel and should not be dismissed as mere \\"anti-Semitism\\"."},{"Title":"Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel (Pluto Middle Eastern Series)","review":"This book is divided into four parts after the preface and introduction: it discusses the ultra-orthodox Haredim, Gush Emunim and the Israeli National Religious Party (NRP), Baruch Goldstein, and Yigal Amir and the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin.First of all, the record is set straight on how the Haredi Jews regard the texts of the Scriptures/Bible. Except for the Pentateuch, they are not studied or even known except within the context of the Talmudic passages and the Cabala. Judaism is not based on the Bible but rather on its skewed interpretations by past Rabbis.The authors expose the phenomenon of Jewish fundamentalism, especially its messianic beliefs and thought. The horrors of Christian and Islamic fundamentalism are well documented in the mass media, but Jewish fundamentalism is ignored, as Shahak and Mezvinsky detail. The goal of these movements is the restoration of the past, ideal Jewish society, comparable to Eastern European Jewry in the 16th-19th centuries. Their basic doctrine is that Jews are superior to non-Jews, derived from the teachings of the Cabala as developed by Issac Luria. The foremost teacher of this doctrine in modern times is the spritual founder of Gush Emunim, Rabbi Kook, the Elder. The belief is that the messiah will come and establish Jewish rule over non-Jews through military force, followed by another messiah who will perform miracles and wonders. The authors point out that the Bible teaches that there will be only one messiah, while the Cabala says there will be the two messiahs, who are supposed to be specific individuals.Rabbi Kook went further and taught his followers that the Gush Emunim party ('Block of the Faithful') is both of the messiahs and that the messianic passages refer to a collective group of people rather than individuals. They believe they are infallible; destined to make the State of Israel the Kingdom of Israel with a king and ruling Sanhedrin, and that Israel will become \\"heaven on earth,\\" and \\"God's throne.\\" Jewish fundamentalists look to the day when all of the churches are destroyed in Israel and all the Arab Palestinians uprooted form \\"Jewish land.\\" Furthermore, they quote Biblical passages in order to justify a Jewish Middle Eastern empire that would dominate the Sinai, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The Hebron massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein and assassin Yigal Amir based their actions on precepts taken from Jewish fundamentalist teaching, from such revered figures as Moses ben Maimon. The last chapter of the book is about how some of Judaism's more controversial teachings are intentionally ommited from English language sources because they cast an unfavorable light upon Israel, Jews, and Judaism that many Jews in political positions and influence would wish to avoid. This is the reason why Shahak and Mezvinsky devoted a whole chapter at the end on why they refused to provide a bibliography of English language sources on Judaism and the topics they brough to light. Magic, amulets and spells are very popular in Israel and books in these subjects often make it into the best-seller lists. There are a great number of fascinating topics described in this book that should shock readers of any backround, if they can get over their prejudices regarding this type of subject matter."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"This book is written by a fellow who had a lot of influence on my personal philosophy. The author was a devotee of the \\"If it's not nice, don't say it\\" school of writers. He managed to present his tales without a protagonist. If you can find a copy, the story is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"Shute's A Town Like Alice is one of my all time favourite books so I was a bit worried that The Far Country wouldn't live up to my expectations. It did. It's a great book to curl up in bed with. It is very sweet and romantic. It tells the story of a young English woman's holiday in the Australian outback just after World War Two. She travels from a grim, rainy, poor country to the land of plenty. She soon grows to love the wild countyside of Australia and meets an older doctor who came there as a displaced person from Europe. Through their friendship they learn a lot about themselves and their adopted home."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"Jennifer Morton moves to London, temporarily, to take care of her ailing grandmother, who, before her death, speaks of times, now gone, when life was so much better in England, as though she recognizes the dissolving of a great culture, which her granddaughter will never know.In her last day of life, she passes on the Jennifer a timely gift of money, received from her distant niece in Australia, and with it expresses her wish for Jennifer to go soon, to seek a better and new life in the opportunities offered in \\"The Far Country.\\" Living up to her grandmother's words, she follows her adventuresome spirit and sails to the other side of the world for this new discovery.Warmly received by her niece at the sheep station, she experiences the abundance of life in Queensland, where she feels at home - immediately - and can now clearly compare the differences between the continents. The new country brings refreshing contrast compared to the dreariness of her post-war nation, so plagued by needless government regulations and restrictions on all of life's commodities, even food.Freedom is what she experiences for the first time in her life and, with it, can fully understand her grandmother's wish for her to seek it. While there, she also notices hardships, endured by others who seek alternative ways to reach this very same freedom. They are the lumberjacks - the refugees from around the globe - who have accepted two-year forestry commitments to buy into the opportunities ahead. Australia attracts them and, in return for their two years of hardship, they can gain their new beginning in their new land.So it is with Carl Zlintner, a Chechoslovakian doctor, a World War II refugee, who has nine months to go before his own two years are finalized. He has no money and is ready to pursue life as a lumberjack in his future. However, hidden in the forest, he stumbles across the grave of a man, now dead for many years... a man with a recognizable name.How Jennifer Morton and pursuit to learn more about this dead man bring new life to the doctor, is a moving and powerful story of willingness to endure, readiness to sacrifice and determination to reach the goals ahead.It's a story about life and about love, wonderful and inspiring, so totally Nevil Shute!"},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"What a storyteller! Shute didn't live too long. I'm so glad he found time to write these human adventures along with all the other things he did. I did not realize until I read this book how bad things were in Great Britain after WWII. Makes me want to go to Australia (in the early 1950's). One of Shute's strengths is character description and development. I'm so glad I found my own copy of this book at Amazon! It was getting difficult to locate copies at the library. Why was this great story never filmed? This has to be as good as the author's A Town Like Alice and No Highway."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"I found this book on the shelf at my local libary. By the cover, it had nothing to recommend it--beat up, dull blue, writing on the binding flaking off. The only reason I checked it out was because it was by Nevil Shute, one of my favorite authors. It sat on my pile of \\"to read\\" for six weeks before I picked it up in a moment of boredom & started reading. My boredom was gone immediately and I spent the rest of the day in post WWII Australia with the two main characters--Jennifer, a young woman who is visiting Australia compliments of a small legacy left to her by her grandmother, and Carl Zlinter, a Czechoslovakian emmigrant planning to make a life in Australia after he has completed his required labor contract. Wow, what a great book! The plot twists kept me off balance, the characters were interesting & the type of people you'd like to have living next door to you, there was enough action to keep you interested but not detract from the story, there was a bit of a mystery and the end was what you'd hoped for the entire time without expecting it to happen because of another exciting plot twist.

Loved them but never bothered to look for more of his work. What a pity! I happened upon this old hardback copy recently in a thrift store, and what a find! From the first few pages I was captured by his descriptions and by his characters. He sometimes got a bit repetitious, but I soon became so enamored by his story that I really didn't care. I also liked the down to earth writing; the kind that is readable without being simple, the kind that doesn't distract from the plot but rather carries it along. Its an old fashion love story, about connecting with people and a land. Wonderfully done."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"I am currently reading my way through Nevil Shute's works and \\"A Far Country\\" was a really great read. After first becoming hooked on Shute after reading \\"Requiem for a Wren\\" my love of his work continued with \\"On the Beach\\" and \\"No Highway\\". Now \\"A Far Country\\" has also not let me down. I think these days many people are not interested in books from the 1950's and 1960's. The pace of the story is sometimes slow and the choice of words are usually not fancy or pretensious. However what they lack in sophistication is made up for by the the overall tale, the characters and the world in which they live. I was quite spell bound by Jenny Morton and Carl Zlinter. There is no sex or indeed a lot of overt romance but the story of their simple love comes through and makes you wanting things to work out well for them and for them both to be happy. Even the somewhat improbable discovery of the gold which enables Carl to undertake his medical training and go after Jenny when she returns to the UK, is delightful and totally believable in the context of the story. What I like about Shute is his ability to paint a true picture of Australia during this time. Although a child of the 70's rather than the 50's, there were still many elements of country Australia Shute describes in his novels that were alive in the late 60's early 70's that I still remember from my own childhood. What I really liked about this book was the description of the new Australians from Europe after the war and their interaction with Australian society. Although largely forgotten now, these immigrants played a huge role in modernising Australia after WWII, not just in terms of the construction of infrastructure but in opening Australia up to new cultures and ways of thinking which led us away from seeing England as home to become the multi-cultural nation we are today."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"This is my fifth Nevil Shute book, and one of my favorites, right up there with Trustee from the Tool Room. I love the way the author develops his characters, and describes the setting without boring the reader. As another reviewer has said of Shute, his characters are good people. In our modern day of reality t.v. and false heroes, it's so enjoyable to read Shute's books with people who seem decent and real in their time. There are no villains or \\"bad guys\\", only people trying to make the best of their lot, and this story is no exception. The story is set post WWII, and vividly describes, through the unfolding story, the differences between post WWII England and Australia. How interesting.Such an enjoyable read. My only complaint is that the story had to end."},{"Title":"The Far Country","review":"This was a great movie, easy watching, great scenery, marvellously set in the outback Australian bush.

This in-depth look at the thought process and strategy behind the courtroom drama that flooded millions of our TV screens in the 60s &amp; 70s, reads better than some of the best selling John Grisham fiction Novels of today. Bailey's brave &amp; cutting edge style of Legal defense unfolds in this book, and I found myself reading on &amp; on with anticipation &amp; excitement even though I already knew the outcome of most of the cases. Hats off to Mr. Bailey &amp; may something be learned from him by everyone."},{"Title":"The Defense Never Rests","review":"This book, written in 1971 by F. Lee Bailey, is an account of several of his early cases. Although some of the subject matter (especially his insights on the death penalty in Massachusetts - a state that no longer has a death penalty) is somewhat outdated, I recommend this book to anyone out there who &quot;thinks&quot; that they know how the adjucdication process works. The book has great educational value for any and all students of Crime, Law and Criminal Justice.Bailey was the first person to smash (in writing) the &quot;Perry Mason-myths&quot; that many people seem to share about the role of the defense attorney in the courtroom. He makes clear that in the American court system, the thing that is of *least* concern is whether or not a person is innocent. Details taken from his case files seem to confirm that the almighty spectre of politics is at the forefront of any courtroom processes. Police and DA's are concerned with pleasing the public and giving the appearance that they have cleared certain crimes. Bailey is about as subtle as a punch in the nose.I also recommend this book for anyone interested in the workings and history of polygraph tests. Bailey explains the so-called &quot;lie detector&quot; process very well."},{"Title":"The Defense Never Rests","review":"The Defense Never Rests is an interesting view into the career of one of the most famous lawyers in the United States. From O.J. Simpson to Sam Sheppard (sp?), F. Lee Bailey has been at the forefront of many famous and infamous trials.Unfortunately what would have been a nice snapshot and insight into a legal career, the book is marred by Bailey's ego. In the cases that he won, he says it was a triumph of justice. Those he lost were when the legal system failed. Hmm...You often get the impression when reading through the cases in the book that he writes what he wishes he would have said in those situations. I find it hard to believe that someone can make every comment or quotation perfect as he says throughout the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a particular interest in law, but only someone with a strong stomach. Some of Bailey's cases are genuinely interesting, but many are just self-inflated ego trips."},{"Title":"The Defense Never Rests","review":"I first heard of F. Lee Bailey in 1964 when he got Dr. Sam Shepard freed from a crime he didn't commit. Shepard was railroaded by a sensational and irresponsible newspaper; his life was ruined to sell advertising. Were things different 40 years later? This book tells of some of his cases, and his observations on the law.Part I \\"The Torso Murder\\" tells of finding body parts, and the trial of the husband. There was no direct evidence against the husband; only the claim of a hobbyist polygrapher that the husband failed the \\"lie detector\\". Bailey's examination and comments are printed. A former business associate of the wife saw her weeks after she disappeared. The book tells of the tricks to discredit the witness: the police officer testified his story was false! But they contacted the priest who had accompanied this witness, and who verified the story. The defendant was acquitted. The next chapter tells of a defendant arrested on eyewitness identification years after the crime. The defendant did not match the description given by the victims. Eyewitness identifications are the greatest single cause of wrongful convictions. They were reliable in olden times when an eyewitness generally knew well the accused.Part II reports \\"The Exoneration of Sam Shepard\\". This is so well known that nothing more needs to be said. Dr. Shepard's career was ruined and his life was crippled through false charges, poor investigation, and newspaper propaganda. Part III reports the Great Plymouth Mail Robbery: a million and a half in small bills were stolen from an ordinary mail truck. This crime was never solved, the money never recovered. Two of the suspects disappeared and were never found; possibly kidnapped and tortured to death by criminals. These chapters tell of the actions of the Postal Inspectors; these are facts, not fiction.Part IV deals with the Boston Strangler and the solution to this case. It is a well known case where books have been written about it. Part V deals with the trials of Dr. Carl Coppolino. Tried in NJ for murdering a neighbor (not guilty), but convicted in FL for poisoning his wife. Bailey points out the weaknesses in the expert opinion against his client.Part VI deals with corruption in Paterson NJ. A newspaper publisher who reported on links between underworld elements and the Passaic County Prosecutor was arrested for murder based on suborned perjury! This fact did not prevent two trials and acquittal in both cases. Bailey's appeal to the NJ Governor and others was used to censure him in MA and suspend him in NJ. Does NJ have the worst reputation in the eastern US? Read this chapter and you will understand why.Part VII deals with \\"The State of the Law\\". It tells of the harm done by police lineups (if the victim is shown a mug shot before), the unreliability of eyewitness testimony (someone seen for a few seconds), etc. Innocence is irrelevant for any defendant! Anyone acquitted will forever be suspected as guilty. Bailey tells of the faults of the grand jury system: they are a rubber stamp for the prosecutor. This chapter gives an insider's view to things that are unknown to the public. This last chapter could be a summary of the book."},{"Title":"The Defense Never Rests","review":"My copy is dog eared from so many readings.

Highlighting the unplanned yet crucial circumstances that enabled new norms for \\"femininity\\" to be established, Evolution Toward Equality offers keen insight into the conditions that, if replicated, can breed assertive, independent, freethinking women.As the mother of a 12 year old girl, I care about my daughter having historical images of female independence and assertiveness to counter the unrealistically glamorous, fantasy images that are so prevalent in today's media. Neal's colorful accounts of such women as Annie (\\"Oakley\\") Moses, Ellis Shipp (a prominent physician), Catherine Beecher and Susan Mills (educators) and Jeanette Rankin and Nellie Tayloe Ross (congresswoman and governor) are just that. They illustrate how western women forged a new life for ALL American women. They begin teaching us what it takes to build a strong foundation for true equality across gender, race and ethnicity."},{"Title":"Some Necessary Angels","review":"The essays in Jay Parini's book, Some Necessary Angels, traverse the line between memoir, literary essay, and political essay. Ultimately, Parini proves that the distinctions between these are meaningless; good writing is good writing--if it is memorable, it will not fit within any set of boundaries. Those familiar with Parini's fiction will know that he often works to blur boundaries; what is historically pinpointed becomes less important than the weight and drama of each of his books' moments.These essays are wonderful to read, to spend time with, in the morning or at night. They provide a certain quietude, and this quality, so precious in today's general loudness, makes them truly remarkable."},{"Title":"Some Necessary Angels","review":"These essays brim over with authorial skill...

Ric has just returned home from being medically discharged from the Army after being hurt from a land mind. So his friend is shocked to see him barely walking on cruches.Bobby wants to apologize to Ric for betraying him years earlier when he left town, it seems he had married his girlfriend, who was pregnant with Ric's child, and let everyone, including Ric believe the little girl was his.

So she, Ric and Tate Raleigh who is part owner of the bar and part time deputy try to unravel this mystery.This is a good book and keeps you interested all the through. I would recommend it, and am looking forward to next months book about Tate."},{"Title":"To Protect Their Child (Harlequin Intrigue 608)","review":"The Track Shack Bar and Grill.

The cast for this new series is introduced, and you get to peek inside some very unpleasant business dealings.Elaine Greene's world is shattered when her husband, Bobby, is murdered. Her father's body is found nearby, the victim of a massive heart attack. Faced with the arduous task of picking up the pieces, Elaine needs to move on for her daughter's sake. Especially now that her true love, Ric has returned. She guards a secret that she is not ready to reveal.Ric Buchanan left McClintock in search of a better life. He returns from the military having endured career ending injuries that almost left him crippled. Upon his return, Ric is reunited with his best friend, Bobby Greene, and a secret is revealed that shatters his world. After Bobby is murdered and the sheriff calls it an accident, Ric is determined to help Elaine discover the truth about her husband and father.Introductions to the different townspeople overshadow the relationship between Ric and Elaine for the first few chapters. Once you have the characters and their relationship to the hero and heroine figured out (there is a Cast Of Characters page that was extremely helpful), the story picks up in intensity and the focus turns to just Ric, Elaine and her daughter. Chemistry between them heats up quickly and held my interest to the very end.The mystery is tough to figure out! Enough suspects come into play to keep you guessing. While Ric and Elaine struggle to find and decipher the clues, the attraction to each other sizzles!

I've loaned it out a number of times to friends expecting babies, and the reviews have always been great. I found it so inspiring in fact, that I became slightly obsessed with tracking down the carved Indian beds on page 71, and am now the proud owner of an identical custom-carved pair!I have to seriously dispute the claims that this book features shots found on design blogs... First of all, this book is the source of only the 2 or 3 shots that have made it onto design blogs. Most of these rooms haven't made it onto the blogs and magazines, and still remain fresh today (and I know; I check out all the main blogs and magazines on a regular basis).The designs in this book are stylish and quirky, showing examples of how to incorporate a child's passions into their space without creating a stilted obviously over-designed space respecting primarily adult tastes. What is particularly charming about the styling in this book is that it has a very natural, realistic feel; for the most part, the rooms seem to have been put together organically, as the result of serendipity, but when you examine them more carefully, you realize that they are the result of wise and very canny planning. I always get ideas about how to store and display things in my childrens' rooms -- even now, after 7 years.As for those who complain there are no baby rooms, there are a few, but Debi Treloar has also put out the book called \\"Babies' Rooms From Zero to Three\\" which may be more what they were hoping to find in this volume.I love this book, and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Children's Spaces: From Zero to Ten","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. There were very few pages dealing with baby's rooms, regardless of the title. This author (a photography stylist...NOT an interior designer) has an apparent fear of color and visual interest. If your tastes run to the highly modern and institutional, you may find some inspiration, but if your interested in anything other than cold, white, spartan surroundings for your child, I'd steer clear of this book. Granted, the photography of these sterile rooms is lovely...but I was not interested in how to stylishly photograph unadorned spaces...I was looking for inspiration to create an imaginative, innovative nursery for my son. I also purchased her other book focused more exclusively on babies...and was even more surprised at her take on the ideal surroundings for babies.

My only bone of contention is that the authors did not use the standardized Francis-Smith orthography for the Mi'kmaw words, but any one who has a familiarity with Mi'kmawi'simk (the Mi'kmaw language) should still be able to understand the words.To the authors I say, &quot;Wela'lioq,&quot; (Thank you)."},{"Title":"On the Trail of Elder Brother: Glous'Gap Stories of the Micmac Indians","review":"On The Trail Of Elder Brother presents a collection of 16 stories retold by two Micmac authors.

One of the good things about this book is that it contains a LOT of examples about every topic concerning government that is discussed in the book. One of the bad things that I've found however, is that these examples make the book very tedious - if you are just trying to get straight information (ie: to learn from), and you want to do it quickly, I would not recommend this book; however, if you are seeking to learn, and you learn best by seeing real-life examples, then this is the book for you, for it has plenty of those!

I used this book for a 3 week summer government course and the long chapters nearly killed me. I found that I could skip the introduction to each chapter which saved me a whole page of reading. Also, I could sometimes read the first and last paragraph of a section and get the point of the section without having to read all the examples of an issue.

It is a fascinating account of an elderly man's walk (with only a knapsack) from Le Havre to Rome. That fact alone I found awesome!! He records his days with keen perception and charming drawings, and the writing--what I could read of it--is quite interesting. His drawings are charming and quite wonderful. My main complaint is that it is rather difficult to read what he wrote, and his journey was so interesting, I felt cheated when I couldn't make it out....hence the three stars. But it is unique among the flurry of little books like this which have been published in the last five years. An evening with a book like this, with its quirky little handwritten comments and completely individual drawings, is an enjoyable antidote to the rigid world of computers, instant copies, and fax machines."},{"Title":"Taking a Line for a Walk: 1100 Miles on Foot, Le Havre to Rome","review":"This delightful little hardback book gave me ideas to enhance my travel sketching techniques.

I carried this wee book on a recent sketching holiday to Turkey for inspiration, and even sought out a fine brown pen in the back streets of Istanbul to trial the effect which pleased me - especially when drawing old buildings or ruins.It is worth taking the time to decipher Chris' squiggles, as you walk with him through the sights, sounds and smells of the streets and countryside, experiencing what he feels.

The reason for this? The book has a revolutionary approach to learning tarot. Instead of handing you a bunch of pre-recorded meanings that you try to memorize and then regurgitate when doing a reading, this book asks YOU questions about what you are thinking, feeling, seeing and getting from each card, MAKING YOU WORK FOR YOUR OWN MEANING OF THE CARD. I cannot stress enough how important this is when you are trying to wean yourself off the tarot books and learn to do readings without falling back on the standard meanings. It takes years to get to this point if you skip this process. Garen gives you a straightforward guide to opening yourself up to trusting your intuition and listening to your inner guide while reading the cards. If you want to learn to read the tarot, I mean REALLY read it, this book will be invaluable to you. This book is NOT meant for people who just collect decks, but is a real working textbook for learning.

I think it elicits a number of interpretive possibilities despite its short length, and is worth a read to those people who don't tire of conventional openings and a somewhat-tidy wrap-up. (Although I did read somewhere that Rebecca Harding Davis was forced by the AM publishers to alter some parts of her original text to make it more suitable for the audience.)You will not, perhaps unfortunately, actually learn much about iron mills. This story is rather a type of conversion narrative that focuses on two characters' struggles in that particular \\"life.\\" Those looking for a technical or otherwise informational book regarding mills/industry--or even working-class lifestyles--should look outside this one.

I know this is an unusual statement since the story reflects a historical tragedy for the French armies, but it reflects the character and spirit of Roland as an individual: devoted to his lord Charlemagne and to the cause of fighting for France. This chivalrous concept has been incorporated in many similar works. The setting is over 1300 years ago (as are much of its human values!).

It provides a fascinating view into the spirit of warriors of that time and their motivation. The Song of Roland gives an idealized picture, of course, and if we can believe the historians, the medieval knights never lived up to their chivalric ideal.The Song of Roland is not commonly included in the canon of must-read classics. Except in France, maybe. I assume the reason is that people in our time do not trace back their roots to the feudalism of the Middle Ages, and that they consider the chapter of chivalry closed after Cervantes's satirical portrait of knighthood in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In one respect, however, this gory tale of slaughter, martyrdom and revenge is very contemporary. It illustrates the mindset of crusaders who see the world in terms of Good and Evil, and the language they use to incite contempt of the other party.Apart from its historical value, the Song of Roland is also worth reading as literature - as an outstanding example for the heroic epic and as a piece of art whose &quot;simple yet elevated style and tone of high moral purpose&quot; (R. Harrison) is reminiscent of the Old Testament.The three most easily available translations of the Song of Roland in the market are:W.S. Merwin's 1963 prose translation with introduction, re-published in paperback by Random House's &quot;Modern Library&quot; in 2001 (ISBN 0375757112). His nine-page introduction is a succinct but sufficient overview of the historical events of AD 778 that became the basis of the Song of Roland. The translation stands out for its readability, and Merwin's choice of modern English makes the descriptions of violence even more direct and graphic: &quot;And Oliver rides through the battle, with his spear shattered to a stump, charges against Malun, a pagan, breaks his gilded shield with the flowers painted on it, knocks the eyes out of his head and brings his brains tumbling down to his feet.&quot; (page 43).Robert Harrison's 1970 translation for Penguin Book's budget line &quot;Mentor Books&quot; (ISBN 0451528573) captures the throbbing, urgent rhythm of the verse form best: &quot;Olivier now gallops through the fray - / his lance has snapped, he only has a stump - / and goes to strike a pagan, Malsaron. / He breaks his gilt, fleuron-emblazoned shield, / bursting both his eyeball from his head - / his brain comes tumbling downward to his feet - &quot; (page 93). &quot;Fleuron-emblazoned&quot; is quite enigmatic compared to Merwin's clear &quot;with the flowers painted on it&quot;, but Harrison redeems himself by choosing &quot;bursting&quot; to emphasize the violence of the attack. The big plus of Harrison's book is his 42-page introduction. He explains the logic of medieval chivalry, why cruelty coexisted with sensitivity, and butchery with prayer. One interesting concept is the medieval &quot;ethos of success,&quot; or in other words the idea that the outcome justifies the means: When a knight killed another knight it was the will of God that this had happened, no matter by what means. Make the opponent trip and chop off his head - see, God is on your side. Harrison goes to quite some length to introduce the instruments of war, the armor and weapons, which is very helpful since the main body of the Song of Roland is about the glory and slaughter of battle.Glyn Burgess's 1990 translation for Penguin Classics (ISBN 0140445323) is the most recent translation of the three. He stays closest to the form of the original, which gives his translation a certain wooden inflexibility but also a not entirely unbecoming pathos. His translation of Olivier's attack on Malun is quite telling: &quot;Oliver rides through the thick of the fray; / His lance shaft is broken, only a stump remains. / He goes to strike a pagan, Malun; / He breaks his shield, wrought with gold and flowers, / and smites both his eyes out of his head. / His brains come spilling out over his feet;&quot; (page 72) While the use of &quot;wrought&quot; and &quot;smite&quot; sounds a bit old-fashioned, &quot;spilling&quot; is an excellent choice. Burgess added a 19-page introduction to his translation. It focuses mostly on the literary qualities of the Song of Roland; for the first-time reader of the Song of Roland, Harrison's introduction is more helpful. The additional value of the Penguin Classics edition lies in an Appendix with about one third of the original version of the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; - the key passages of the work in Old French.While all three translations have their pros and cons, I tend to recommend Harrison's book over the two others. It strikes a good balance between the clarity of Merwin's prose translation and the wooden feel of Burgess's more literal verse translation. In addition, it impresses with its useful introduction and its unbeatable value for money."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The time: 778 A.D.The place: Roncesvalles, SpainCharlemagne's rearguard, commanded by his nephew, the Count Roland, is attacked from all sides by a pagan horde without number. A single note from Oliphant, Roland's horn, will bring Charlemagne's army to the rearguard's rescue. But Roland is a true knight, and will not suffer himself to be rescued. He puts Oliphant away and draws forth the gleaming blade Durendal, and with his own sword-arm leads his soldiers into mortal combat against a foe he cannot hope to conquer. So begins the greatest battle royal in literary history. Roland and his comrades-at-arms fight bravely, enduring blows that would dispatch lesser men while giving their heathen enemies even greater wounds. Swords flail, lances strike, armor splinters, and good and evil play our their eternal game of life &amp; death in strokes of blood and steel. Perhaps politically incorrect by today's standards, &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; nontheless remains immune to criticism, in part because of the crystal clarity with which its author perceived the powers of darkness and light. A poem of unsurpassed heroic grandeur, featuring the most powerful battle scenes ever put to paper, &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; is an immortal monument to chivalry. In the end, Roland dies as only a hero can; his sword-arm fails and Durendal slays its last pagan. Yet Roland lives on in the poet's dream, and heroism will not fade away."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"Song of Roland is an epic masterpiece that details the crusading spirit of the 11th and 12th century. Based on the massacre of Charlemagne's rearguard in 778 by Christian Basques in Northern Spain, this Old French poems turns that bloody defeat into a bloody battle of Christianity agains Islam. Although this is propaganda of the highest sort, it is still a piece of art, as Roland embodies the spirit of the Crusades, striking out against impossible odds with his sword Durendal. This is an excellent translation from the Old French, as one will be on the battlefield with Roland and the other paladins of Charlemagne."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Song of Roland is an epic \\"song of deeds\\" from Medieval France. As epic poems go, this is a quick, easy read. It's also lively and pretty fun. The battle scenes are terrific, with lots of shining armor, clashing of steel, spouting blood, cleaved heads, and strewn corpses. On the other hand, it is historically inaccurate and it is nowhere near the towering quality of Homer, Virgil, or Ovid.The poem comes from a long oral tradition, and it seems that the author tried to capture all of the different variations on the same verse. While reading, this is kind of weird. It's a lot like hearing variations on a popular joke told back-to-back (the same punch line, but slightly different setups). As a result, many verses are highly repetitive. But overall, the poem has some great lines and some very memorable scenes.As epics go, this is a lesser work. So don't expect a life-changing read. But you can expect to be entertained. So if you enjoy epic poems, I recommend it.I read the Glyn Burgess translation, which is smooth and very readable. His introduction is informative, too. For an excellent comparison of the different translations that are available, be sure to read the customer review by Boris Bangemann."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Song Of Roland is interesting to me because of what it teaches us about the French people in the eleventh century. Even though the event that is told took place in the eighth century, the story was written in the eleventh century, for the people of the eleventh century. The Song Of Roland may have been used as a motivational story to get people to fight in the Crusades. It goes into a lot of detail describing glorious fight scenes, with powerful warriors battling for Christianity. The book gives us a sense of adventure and would quite possibly be able convince anyone in France that going to the holy land to fight for Christianity would be an amazing thing to do. At the same time the story can be pretty entertaining. With all the hype it gives the characters in battle, it's like a modern day super bowl-world series-world cup all being played at the same time. Because The Song Of Roland is able to inspire and entertain at the same time, it teaches us how central war and religion presumably were to eleventh century France."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"Charlemagne is fighting the Saracens being led by Marsile in Spain. Charlemagne's beloved nephew Roland has constantly fought valiantly by his side, but when Roland's stepfather Ganelon commits an act of treason, Roland's life is in danger. Marsile has offered a false peace pact in order to by the Saracens some time as Charlemagne's troops return to France. Knowing Marsile has already killed two of Charlemagne's messengers, Roland suggests his stepfather for the job to oversee this peace treaty. Ganelon has no choice to accept, but begins a plot to enact revenge on his stepson. Both Ganelon and Marsile wish to see the brave warrior dead for their own reasons and create a plan to cut off Roland's troops in a mountain pass. It is taken out and Roland shortly finds himself in a heated battle with his best friend Oliver and a Bishop Turpin. Even though Roland is dealing blows with his sword Durendal that cut people in half, the French forces are still greatly outnumbered and losing. Roland's pride will not let him call for help on Oliver's request until it is too late.The Song of Roland is an originally oral text that eventually made its way down into an English transition. The first time I read this was in French class senior year of high school while also re-enacting it. (Guess who was Roland!) Let me tell you, reading it in English is much better. The narration can get pretty repetitive, but the characters are all fantastic. The most interesting character has a very short scene. Aude, Roland's betrothed and Oliver's sister, when hearing of Roland's death, falls dead on the spot. The interesting part about this piece has to do with when it was written down around 1090. At the time there was still a debate going on about valor and justice, etc. For example, you get the debate between Roland and Oliver, whether it is wiser and braver to fight to the death or to act wisely and call for help. Also, at Ganelon's trial for treason some interesting questions about justice arise concerning what counts as treason and what legal punishment might only be revenge on Charlemagne's part to Ganelon.It's definitely not going to be on the most recommended pieces of literature, but it is definitely a part of the canon for oral epics. The Song of Roland became an inspiration for Stephen King's The Dark Tower series. It can't be all that bad. If you end up picking up a copy and struggling with it (even though I don't think you will), just be glad you are reading it in English and not in French like I had to.\\"A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.\\"- Robertson Davies"},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The item arrived on time. I bought it for a history class. It has the English and French version in it. Enjoyed reading the story."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The \\"Song of Roland\\" is an epic about a battle between Christian Franks and Muslim Saracens. The song describes in detail what led up to and caused this battle. Christianity seems to be the main motivation behind Charlemagne's Frankish army to fight with Marsile's Saracen army, but in reality what caused the actual battle was Ganelon wanting revenge on his step-son Roland, for suggesting him to go on the dangerous mission of meeting with Marsile.This is a story of revenge, chivalry, pride, loyalty, betrayal, and the love and respect for one's king and country. It has everything one would expect in an epic. Charlemagne's historian, Einhard, explains the battle quite differently than how it is in the book. It seems that the truth was twisted to have a good story to tell, perhaps to encourage knights going to battle, or to put them in good spirit, or perhaps just to entertain the elite. Learning of this, my view of the book was changed quite a bit. I believed it to be non-fiction (maybe a mistake, with the events of the song taking place in the 8th century) and now I am not sure which parts are historical. However, the story was quite entertaining, with all the many conflicts and graphic battle scenes giving one the sense of being there. There are also lessons that can be learned from the \\"Song of Roland\\", such as standing up for what you believe in, even when the going get's tough, and the power of pride. These are lessons that I think everyone can use and incorporate in their own way."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Song of Roland is an epic tale of a conflict between the Franks and Saracans, written sometime in the Middle Ages. While historically inaccurate, it offers an entertaining story about the Crusades and the ill-effects pride can have on the lives of many. For example, consider the situation when the French start to exit Spain. Ganelon nominates his step-son Roland to lead the rear guard- a move inspired by Ganelon's motivation to get revenge on Roland for nominating him to bring a message back to Marsille. Roland accepts his role, and stays behind to await (unknowingly) an ambush by the Saracan army. When he finally realizes that he and his men are finally going to be attacked, his close friend Oliver (who is admired for his wisdom) advises him to signal the French army to come back. Roland refuses, even though he can clearly see that his men are outnumbered- he rationalizes that it is better for his men to die with honor than to live with the shame of needing to have called for help. The Saracans eventually attack Roland's men, and although they fight well towards the beginning of the battle, they are eventually overwhelmed. Roland sees his best friend dying, and then realizes the urge to call for help, which he does. Unfortunately for Roland and his men, his call for help was too late, and they all died.Although this story was written hundreds of years ago, I think many of us today can agree that we've let pride interfere with out judgment. Roland refused to ask for help even though he obviously was going to need it, just to save face. The lesson to take out of this is that when you don't swallow your pride, you will eventually lose the opportunity to get any assistance when you realize you were wrong- Roland eventually figured out he needed to call for help, but when he did, it was far too late for the French army to do anything. Applying the principles from this song to our lives might not be such a bad idea- no matter how old the song is."},{"Title":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)","review":"I need this book for a college course.

The book gets into a lot of areas outside of mainstream medicine. However, I felt most of what she had to say was medically sound. If you are looking for a book that gives only AMA-approved advice, this is NOT the book for you.I think this book is actually quite valuable. Who would benefit from it most are people who want BOTH AMA-approved advice, AND who want to consider things like herbal remedies, acupuncture, and other natural treatments. These discussions are particularly valuable for anyone who cannot take traditional hormone treatments for various reasons--such as if you have deep vein thrombosis (which I do). She covers alternative therapies very well, in depth, and from the perspective of a physician who has had many years experience in trying these natural therapies with patients, and with herself. So, here you can get a POSITIVE physician's viewpoint on alternative therapies. Yes, it's true she discusses her personal life, and I personally enjoyed those parts. It's also true that she sometimes gets readings from Tarot cards, but if something comes out of them, she always checks into those areas which have come up in the readings with traditional medical tests and treatments. If you're not into &quot;nurturing your fibroid,&quot; or tarot cards, just ignore those parts of the book. Ignoring these parts was not a problem for me. The important thing is, this book is NOT trying to convert people to new-age treatments. It is seriously discussing a number of alternative therapies, from a medical standpoint, that MANY people have already been using on their own for many years--but these people can't find any doctor who will seriously discuss the merits and demerits of any of these treatments. Furthermore, she DOESN'T concentrate ONLY on these alternative therapies--she discusses all the traditional therapies very well.Should you buy this book? If you are the type of person who is only comfortable with traditional medical advice, you will NOT like this book. Buy another one. If you are someone who is looking for a SERIOUS discussion of alternative therapies, you will think this book is wonderful. I fall primarily in the former camp, but am also open to the latter camp for consideration. I found the book very useful, and felt it was well worth the money I spent on it. The main reason being that it discussed SO MANY MORE aspects of menopause than I ever would have dreamed of thinking about!! It is not a book you can sit down and read cover-to-cover. It has to be read slowly, and digested. After reading this book and another one, I went to see my doctor with a list of pre-prepared questions, and he said I was the best-informed patient he had ever had (here in Morocco). I suggest that you DO buy this book, but you might want one or two other books which cover different aspects of the menopause transition. The other book I chose was a paperback called &quot;The Silent Passage,&quot; and between the two books, I feel very satisfied."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book is highly readable and packed with information about menopause, and perimenopause.

Most of the information contained in this book can be found in the other sources mentioned. Especially if you want more info natural progresterone -- read Dr Lee's books.Northrup takes a stronger &quot;new-agey&quot; tone in this book than in her previous one.

She said that &quot;its part of menopause&quot; and refered this book. She was so right. From the moment I started reading it, I started identifying with a lot of the things that she was saying.In reading many of the other reviews, I feel that most the one star people never got beyond the first few chapters. They never saw the indepth discussions on building bones, the discussions on why you start gaining weight even though you haven't changed your diet or excercise, or the discussion of heart health. They were turned off by her discussions of her personal life and experience...everyone of which mentioned the tarot card references which were such a small part and only mentioned in the beginning! I thought it made her more human. Nor did I feel she was telling us to ditch everyone in our lives. What I picked up and what I really do feel is important is that we need to constantly reevaluate our live, keep what IS working and change (not neccessarily discard)what isn't and unfortunately, most of us don't do that till our lives go haywire. Menopause is a major haywire occurances.One of the things that drew me to the book and her attitude is that she approaches everything from an 'understand what is happaning, understand your options, decide what is best for you' point of view. In particular, in this 'here take a pill for that' world we live in, her change your lifestyle first and if that doesn't work, then let's look at the medication and surgical answers was very refreshing.Menopause is so much more than hot flashes and night sweats and to have one book that goes into all the health issues (physical, mental, and emotional) that we face in this stage of our lives was extremely helpful to me.

If that's not possible, and you're dealing with perimenopause or full-blown menopause, then skip the first few chapters. Otherwise, you'll be ready to divorce your spouse, thinking that's the answer to your mulititude of problems. Bloated? Get a divorce. Night sweats? Get a divorce. No sexual drive? Get a divorce.

Her carefully considered discussions about hormone replacement--bioidentical or synthetic, foods &amp; supplements, libido issues, osteoporosis, breast and heart health, as well as the &quot;Resources&quot; section brimming with detailed information on each major topic, help arm women with the understanding and tools needed to intelligently consult with their physicians about this perfectly natural process. The pharmaceutical industry tends to encourage the misguided view that menopause is a &quot;disease&quot; best treated with standarized doses of synthetic hormones; ones that bolster company profits--naturally! Yet, as Doctor Northrup makes clear, transition is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; experience. Women's bodies and life experiences differ tremendously; hence the logic of individualized, holistic transition programs. Thanks to caring doctors like Christiane Northrup, gone are the days of blind deference to physicians who think that a pat on the head and a prescription for synthetic hormones will get you out of their hair!

Then I began to read the book from the beginning. I could feel the empathy of Dr. Northrup as I read page after page and said to myself, more times than I can count, \\"YES, THAT'S ME, THAT'S ME!\\" I found that the symptoms I was having and the feelings of anger, frustration, resentment and pending doom were NORMAL, and were an inner sign that I needed to make some changes.

I have begun keeping a journal, and am much more at peace as I read more and more of this fascinating book and discover that this truly is the beginning of a new and wonderful second half of my life. Thank you, Dr. Northrup, for saving my life."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I feel this book is head and shoulders above most of the other menopause guides on the market, for two reasons: (1) Northrup is a practicing physician as well as an author and teacher, and she has years of experience working with women going through menopause. So her recommendations about what works, what doesn't, and where conventional wisdom may be wrong are based on considerable experience with REAL, LIVE women. Her ample use of stories drawn from her practice, and those sent in by readers of her newsletter, helps to give weight to her opinions. (2) She makes the vitally important point that every woman's menopause is different -- your menopause is YOURS, not your mother's, or your sister's, or your best friend's. The medical profession, in general, has tended to apply &quot;one size fits all&quot; remedies, e.g., prescribing Premarin to every woman whose hormones seemed to need tweaking. Northrup, by contrast, points out that hormones are a delicately balanced system that may take several years to stabilize after &quot;the change,&quot; so it's best to determine as precisely as possible WHICH hormone(s) need tweaking, and do the minimum to prevent problems and increase comfort.I found her discussion of other menopause-related conditions (e.g., osteoporosis) thorough and helpful too. My doctor has been pressuring me to take a synthetic hormone to prevent bone loss; my instinct has been to say no and address my (slight) problem by other means, and Northrup gave me some very useful information that supports my decision. I questioned some of her suggestions -- e.g., while soy helps many women, it's more problematic if one is hypothyroid. And I think she goes overboard where dietary supplements are concerned. Still, she doesn't present herself as the all-knowing physician but as a woman who's addressing many of these same issues herself (and who sometimes makes mistakes), and I felt that that gave her much more credibility.I didn't have a problem with the occasional &quot;new age&quot; references: she talks about using the Tarot (for example) as a means of self-knowledge, and it's as good a tool as any for stimulating reflection. I felt, too, that her frankness about her assumptions and beliefs was a courtesy to the reader: I've had highly infuriating experiences with doctors who were NOT aware of, or honest about, how their beliefs affected the way they treated their patients (e.g., &quot;once a woman is past childbearing, she's useless&quot;)! In general, I felt Northrup had her feet firmly on the ground, and she's compiled a wealth of information into an easy-to-read and comprehensible volume."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I do understand why some people have rated this book only one star. The book gets into a lot of areas outside of mainstream medicine. However, I felt most of what she had to say was medically sound. If you are looking for a book that gives only AMA-approved advice, this is NOT the book for you.I think this book is actually quite valuable. Who would benefit from it most are people who want BOTH AMA-approved advice, AND who want to consider things like herbal remedies, acupuncture, and other natural treatments. These discussions are particularly valuable for anyone who cannot take traditional hormone treatments for various reasons--such as if you have deep vein thrombosis (which I do). She covers alternative therapies very well, in depth, and from the perspective of a physician who has had many years experience in trying these natural therapies with patients, and with herself. So, here you can get a POSITIVE physician's viewpoint on alternative therapies. Yes, it's true she discusses her personal life, and I personally enjoyed those parts. It's also true that she sometimes gets readings from Tarot cards, but if something comes out of them, she always checks into those areas which have come up in the readings with traditional medical tests and treatments. If you're not into &quot;nurturing your fibroid,&quot; or tarot cards, just ignore those parts of the book. Ignoring these parts was not a problem for me. The important thing is, this book is NOT trying to convert people to new-age treatments. It is seriously discussing a number of alternative therapies, from a medical standpoint, that MANY people have already been using on their own for many years--but these people can't find any doctor who will seriously discuss the merits and demerits of any of these treatments. Furthermore, she DOESN'T concentrate ONLY on these alternative therapies--she discusses all the traditional therapies very well.Should you buy this book? If you are the type of person who is only comfortable with traditional medical advice, you will NOT like this book. Buy another one. If you are someone who is looking for a SERIOUS discussion of alternative therapies, you will think this book is wonderful. I fall primarily in the former camp, but am also open to the latter camp for consideration. I found the book very useful, and felt it was well worth the money I spent on it. The main reason being that it discussed SO MANY MORE aspects of menopause than I ever would have dreamed of thinking about!! It is not a book you can sit down and read cover-to-cover. It has to be read slowly, and digested. After reading this book and another one, I went to see my doctor with a list of pre-prepared questions, and he said I was the best-informed patient he had ever had (here in Morocco). I suggest that you DO buy this book, but you might want one or two other books which cover different aspects of the menopause transition. The other book I chose was a paperback called &quot;The Silent Passage,&quot; and between the two books, I feel very satisfied."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book has a HUGE amount of good information and covers many different facets of perimenopause and menopause. I do wonder how much of this information may have changed since it was published a while ago, but its a great foundation to start with. It definitely has made me understand what might be going on with me - especially some of the more frigthening things.I do think the book is way too long and rambling. And most annoying is the author's assumption that her audience is married with kids and unhappy with their husbands (just like her!) If you don't fit into that category you can skip the first chapter or so and just read the parts that don't focus about her particular experience."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I haven't finished reading this book, but have already learned some things. There are particular chapters on diet, mood swings and perimenopausal symptoms described that were like light bulbs exploding. It brought better understanding of the things I'm experiencing, and being able to say, &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Good reference material."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This is the first time I have read something so enlightening concerning menopause. Dr. Northrup has a way with words. I love the way she writes. I thought i knew all there was to know about menopause, and some how she makes me feel more normal."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Christiane Northrup takes you down the long road of aging with some very strong facts and a lot of interesting side trips. The author touches all aspects of this time of change, including hormones, breast issues, hot flashes, dieting, exercising, emotional issues, empty nesting etc... However, she does not go into enough detail on the emotional roller coaster ride that women in this age group face. Because of this, much of the book reads like a medical journal, and can be quite boring. Christiane alludes a lot to some mystical aspects, but never explains them enough for the reader to enjoy her view. There is some mention of balancing chakras and some other spiritual mentions, but not enough. And unfortunately, some of her ideas are just plain whacko. Still, when absorbed cover to cover, much of it is helpful, written in plain English and not medical jargon, and supportive of women's issues. It's an average book that seems like it once had a point, but perhaps the author forgot the original point and wandered off into many different ones."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I found this book to be a treatise on Dr. Northrup's personal life. I'm sorry she was unfulfilled till she got her divorce. As I read along, trying as hard as I could to approach it with an open mind, I kept looking for advice for women like me who ARE in partnership, equal, happy marriages, doing what they want with their lives, but yet showing signs of perimenopause.Dr. Northrup found emotional cause for her fibroids, which I have a hard time buying into. I need a book with less hocus-pocus and more hard scientific information, undiluted with the new age approach."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"The first few chapters of this book seem to be used to justify/rationalize the author's divorce and to push the practice of mysticism. However, the remainder of the book is full of excellent, practical advice regarding menopause. Dr. Northrup combines traditional medicine with other &quot;medicines&quot; in a nice balance."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book has so many stupid ideas, that I can not mention them all.For example.... she suggests that because you might have lived in an unhappy marriage (or situation) you swallowed your words and that is why you have a thyroid problem!!! Ridiculous.She recommends chucking your marriage if you get in menopause and your goals change...I would NOT recommend this book. There were a few parts that seemed to be realistic to me, but it was outweighed by the 'new age' junk.Skip this one!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Some of the medical information is very helpful. My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home. Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed. Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age. Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children? Of course not. That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well. Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them. Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the \\"hormonal storm.\\" How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage. Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods. I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them. That's just my own opinion. I tried to look beyond that.I just think this is another book written for people older than I am. That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"If she accepts and advocates any and all new age mumbo-jumbo that sounds good, how can I put confidence in her ability to critically filter through all of the research about hormonal therapy, etc.? Just because she cites medical references doesn't mean that they are high-quality studies published in respected medical journals, or that they are studies that are applicable to a wide range of women. And given her level of accepting completely ridiculous things such as &quot;tarot&quot;, etc., it is my guess that the scientific advice she gives is just her take on whatever random studies fit with her theories, and probably does not reflect a good grasp of current research. Truly knowledgeable clinicians know how to filter the good from the bad. What could have been a promising book touching on an important topic was undermined by her kooky beliefs."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This is a single, relatively short cassette. It is NOT a reading from the book. It was taped while being delivered to a live audience.The doctor's goals to teach and inform were compromised by her needs to 'entertain' and establish rapport with the audience. There are multiple outbursts/interruptions as she elicited responses from the audience. They waste time. The producer did not modulate the volume, and the audience outbursts are often shockingly loud compared to the volume of the vocal presentation. I raised and lowered the volume throughout the tape trying to compensate.Dr. Northrup makes several references to information being presented to the audience via visual aids. That info is lost to those who are listening to the tape. If you have seen Dr. Northrup's presentations on talk shows or PBS you won't gain much if any additional information from this tape. Put your money into the book if you want to learn more. Sandy"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I do so regret having paid good money for this bunch of claptrap! The alarm bells went off for me even as I read the first few pages and sensed that this book was a turkey. The author did what so many others in recent years have done; she jumped on the \\"mind, spirit, body\\" bandwagon for an easy buck. She borrowed a little bit of this, and a little bit of that from herbal remedies to Feng Shui to conveniently throw together a pretentious pile of pap. It insults the intelligence of the reader. Also, I found it depressing to be dragged through the final days of her failed marriage, and the implication that we wives should dump our husbands, \\"clean house\\" as it were, in preparation for this new phase of our lives to be disturbing, indeed. I suppose I should credit the book though because in flatly rejecting it, my confidence that I have the wisdom to manage menopause on my own was greatly strengthened. Notwithstanding, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This books is a load of hype. Northrup is a new-agey. unorthodox practitioner in my humble opinion.I bought it innocently, thinking she would have tons of information regarding menopause and its symptoms and treatments, only to find to my dismay that there is just to much &quot;questionable advice&quot; and unsubstantiated dictates. For example, taking CoEnzyme Q10, which she highly recommends, may be fine after it is proven to be effective for menopausal women in clinical trials, but where is the backup? Where is the proof?I am sorry I spent the money for this book. It is going in the trash, where it belongs."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book is very nicely written and extremely informative while easy to read--its' all you need to know about menopause--highly recommended!Also very highly recommended:&quot;Decoding Darkness&quot; (about Alzheimer's) by Tanzi and Parson"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.

At age 27 I successfully &quot;changed my diet&quot;. At age 35 I discovered how my miserable &quot;attitude&quot; was affecting how rotten i felt. I divorced at age 36. I'm 42 &amp; I started menopause at age 40. Clearly what happened to Dr. N during menopause is only what SHE experienced during that time. So it took her till menopause to look at herself? So what. For some it happens at age 23 or maybe 33 and for some never. This was HER path that happened to coincide with menopause.

Please."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This title floored me. Absolutely floored me. I received this book from my father, a shrimp-boater by trade, who bestowed upon me this gift in recognition of the completion of my training. I sat down upon the deck of our shrimp boat, the Woijieioudjeioc, and proceeded to read it cover to cover. I was absolutely amazed at the level of humor in this book. I could not put it down, people. It has fighting and killing, folks. It was hard for me to fully understand because I have never undergone menopause (you see, I was born a shrimp-boaters son in the hills of Mudeka), but I could feel the essence emanating from its pages. It was simply glorious. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Generally, this is a good informative book, better for those of us who are at odds with our current lives. It provides medical validation for the confusion felt at reaching this point in life. However, after reading the first few chapters of this book, I have decided to pick through the pieces of this book that contain relevance for me, a good reference piece. While the information is very applicable, it is so often repetative that I lose interest. The chapters on hormone replacement therapy and physical changes are very good, being that I am a natural therapy sort. The advice on meditation, exercise, and general holistic practices is right on target. I draw the line, however, at the use of tarot cards and similar tools."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has \\"stuffed your feelings\\" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"How very disappointing that Dr. Northrup is all caught up in &quot;New Age&quot; Spiritualism. She calls it &quot;Wisdom&quot;; I'd call it Superstition. I had hoped for a good scientific reference work. Instead, it was very hard to read: difficult to get past her absurd analyses of the &quot;causes&quot; of various health problems. She continually &quot;blames the victim&quot;--i.e. If a woman has a hormone related health problem, she needs to look within and change her life (Therefore, it must be her fault?!) Spend your money on a better book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"The fact that this poorly written jumble of medical fact, witchcraft, and embarrassingly personal autobiography could ever make it to the bestseller list demonstrates the desperate need that exists for a well written but easy to understand book explaining menopause. Tarot cards for stress...drapes over mirrors for insomnia...unspoken words cause hypothyroidism???? The good doctor could use a refresher course in medicine and some good counselling for her unresolved emotional problems. With all the loot this rambling tome brings in, these will be affordable."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"There are a lot of books out there dealing with this subject but this book puts a lot of things in perspective. It not only guides you through the different stages of Menopause but it gives you the author's own hands on experience with the subject and that's honest writing in its purest form. I am sure there are alot of us who don't know what is happening as we probaly didn't have this explained to us by our moms. But you can bet that if your memory is going, you sweat at night profusedly, you cry over nothing, and somedays you hate your life,husband,pets, house,kids, your furniture, hair,face, body and everything else in sight than you need this book.The part on nutrition is excellent and most beneficial if you are going to attack this problem with a healthy approach. And sorry guys if it was no help to you, prehaps you should go the doctors with your wife and the doc can explain better the concerns you have. This book is for us woman and it is a guide through the longest pause of our life. And please be kind to those you know are smack dab in the middle of it as their day to day life can change in a minute and they don't even have a clue. This is a serious time in a women's life and not just one book will have all the answers but it sure makes for a good start and it is very informative. Good Luck and I am still not sure why it is considered a \\"Pause\\" as there seems to be anything but pausing going on. Good Luck and keep your cool, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I recently purchased and read this book and feel that while it contains some valuable information, many important facts were left out. Dr. Northrup is so high on progesterone that she is unable to communicate the fact that this hormone can also cause some troubling side effects. Think about how you feel during the last half of your cycle when progesterone is dominant....mood swings, weight gain, headaches, anxiety etc.. Now, tell me that you want to feel that way all of the time?? I think not. I recommend a fantastic book titled &quot;screaming To Be Heard&quot; (sorry, unable to underline) by Elizabeth Lee Vliet. Dr. Vliet gives you BOTH sides of the progesterone story.... please educate yourself before making such important life choices!!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book reveals layer after layer of information on menopause and the manner in which women perceive themselves, their lives, their needs and hopes for their future. It plainly lays out every conceivable treatment and the pros and cons of each. Treatments include much more than herbs and drugs. Women will look inward and examine the direction the rest of their lives will take. I agree that Dr. Northrup may be guilty of radical thinking in the sense of getting rid of everyone and everything in your life that doesn't make you completely happy, but it is aconcept that makes one think about what does and doesn't make you happy and hey...you must take every work like this with a grain of salt.

A little too bizarre for me."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I bought this book after seeing Dr. Northrup on [a television] show. I was very disappointed in the book as a whole. I find it difficult to lend credence to someone who relies on tarot cards to answer difficult life questions. I also do not adhere to the concept that hormone imbalances, hypothroidism, etc. are all due to unresolved issues in one's life (specifically involving family, and partner). The idea that thyroid dysfunction develops as, \\"the result of a lifetime of 'swallowing' words\\" a woman \\"is aching to say,\\" is laughable at best. I believe many could potentially find this book more harmful than helpful.

According to Christiane Northrup, M.D., menopause often marks the beginning of a woman's most sexually passionate, creatively inspired, and professionally productive phase of life. While this may sound like wishful thinking, Northrup backs up her good news with solid medical expertise. As an obstetrician and gynecologist, Northrup has specialized in using a mind-body approach to women's health for decades, which means she doesn't just write about hormones, but also examines how a woman's lifestyle, emotions, and beliefs are affected by menopause. I also highly recommend \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom\\" by Taro Gold."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I thought I'd never read another book about this subject, but I gave this book a try after reading a few sample pages.

I could not figure out what had happened and of course I thought I was having some kind psychological break down....Going to my OB-GYN did not help me any, (no pun intended), male doctors and the male population in general think we are crazy and in need of medication....They prescribe things for us that I feel they would not take themselves....The more I began to read and the more I began to dig deeper inside of me and look at the whole package...Spiritually and emotionally and where I had landed in life, I began to understand more about what changes were occuring. I did not give up on the medical profession, because I knew there was someone out there who could explain those changes on a more deeper level....We as a society want spiritual awakenings, but sometimes we don't stop to look at where that begins and it is within you...The you who looks back at you everyday when you look in the mirror....Well take it for what it is worth.....I feel much better and had drawn the same conclusions, that everything I knew of my life, is now beginning to change....Life is never going to be what you imagined it, but it is nice when you have a firm foothold on what it is....I appreciate Dr. Northrups poignent observations about how she felt with those associated in her life, co-workers and family alike.

I learned that hormonal, emotional and spiritual shifts related to menopause begin as much as a decade before menstration ends. Though the book strives to include everyone, I think mothers will benefit the most from her advice. It was enlightening to learn how the changing needs of my family change me -- and that hormonal shifts can make these transitions even more painful. With one child heading off to college and the youngest just entering first grade I have been feeling very off-balance and overwrought. After reading this book I made some changes in my personal life and my diet that improved my outlook and made us all happier. Northrup empowered me with information -- I now feel capable of honoring this new phase in my life with grace and dignity."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book is FILLED with pearls of wisdom and I'm SO glad I got it! Feeling overwhelmed by the emotional and physical changes I've been experiencing lately, I chose to read this book cover-to-cover, which is probably not what the author intended, as there IS a bit of repetition in her Rx for menopausal complaints. However, it was STILL a very helpful way for me to access Dr. Northrup's sound advice - and there's plenty to be had within!It's heartening to learn that you're not alone when apparently &quot;little&quot; things like your tastes in entertainment change: for example, I used to enjoy the ROCKY movies, but for a while now I've noticed that I recoil from any violence I see portrayed on the screen (fortunately, I don't have to contend with much in-person violence in my life!) To have this psycho-emotional change explained as a &quot;rewiring of the brain&quot; is encouraging and supportive, and Dr. Northrup is hopeful in her advice and helpful in all the additional resources she lists at the end of the book. I understand a LOT more now what's going on in my body and mind and I've a growing appreciation for the changes yet to come. What's more, I'm inspired to be a LOT more pro-active in taking care of myself through better nutrition and exercise.When you consider how LITTLE most women learn about menopause from their mothers and other women in the lives, it becomes evident how essential this book is! My own mother (who's 72) to this day claims that she &quot;sailed right through&quot; menopause with nary a flash or problem. This has NOT been MY experience, however, and I really needed the information in this book to reassure me I'm not going nuts! Dr. Northrup has provided a tremendous service to women of the Baby Boom and THE WISDOM OF MENOPAUSE is a GIFT to our health and sanity!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"As I hit my late 30's I began to notice changes in my life, my mood, my sex drive and even my spending habits. By themselves I didn't think it was a big deal but then I saw Dr. Northrup and Nancy Lloyd on television talking about menopause and finances, respectively. What each said really hit home.Like a lot of women my age I was coasting through what I considered a normal life. It's not that I was unhappy but I knew that I could have felt more satisfied. This book by Dr. Northrup and &quot;SIMPLE MONEY SOLUTIONS&quot; by Nancy Lloyd have shown me how to take charge of my life, resolve unfinished family business and start to realize some life-long dreams.I have started taking some estrogen replacement per Dr. Northrup and have finally dealt with my finances per Nancy Lloyd.The difference in my life and relationships is astounding. I feel like a different person. With the fear of menopause and credit card debt no longer hanging over my head I'm told I even look younger.&quot;THE WISDOM OF MENOPAUSE&quot; and &quot;SIMPLE MONEY SOLUTIONS&quot; are life changing books. I can't recommend them too highly!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"so that's as far as I've gotten.At 41, with 2 young children at home, I needed something calming, reassuring, upbeat and informative. Being hit so fast and so hard with a message that sounded a lot like &quot;Your husband is probably a jerk who won't support your inner self or personal needs, so you might as well get a divorce right now because that's the only way you'll survive menopause&quot; really stressed me out and upset me badly. It seems very extreme and negative. My husband has encouraged my individuality and my need to be myself, rather than just a &quot;Wife and Mom&quot;, since I became a Mom!I'm sure the book has plenty to offer, it just didn't start out on a good note for me.I also need more information and insight regarding how to handle this crazy, stressful, scary time while I DO still have 2 young kids to raise while working full-time! The &quot;empty nest&quot; issue is important, but what about the rest of us?I may return to this book later (I borrowed it from a friend) but right now I'm finding books like &quot;A Woman's Midlife Companion&quot; to be a gentler, lighter, less intense approach which I'm hoping will give me the bits of information and insight that I need without the fear-inducing negativity and intensity. And I really DON'T want a &quot;medical journal&quot; type of book. There is more being impacted here than my body chemistry and I would like to approach it from as holistic an approach as possible."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Alright, your 50th birthday is just around the corner, your children are leaving the nest, you finally have time to do all the things you planned, and now you feel as if your mind and body are on overload and about to short-circuit! Your mother may have told you what to expect as you entered your teens, but how many mothers told you what to expect when you were fifty? Hot flashes, cold sweats, peculiar aches and pains you never had before - don't worry, you aren't going insane...it's the rest of the world that is going crazy!Throughout the pages of this book, you will find great comfort in knowing you are experiencing a perfect normal reaction (however, &quot;unnatural&quot; it may seem at the time)to a perfectly normal life process. A positive attitude can make a world of difference and this excellent book answers all the questions that your mother probably never told you. It is a great book and one every woman approaching menopause should read. A positive attitude and a healthy and active lifestyle can make all the difference in the world."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"When I read the jacket, I was impressed that this book was being heartily endorsed by some heavy hitters, so I bought it. I should have read a little more closely -- most of the impressive endorsements are for the author's FIRST book, and it's easy to see why. She has some good information, but when she casually mentions that she let her fibroid grow to the size of a SOCCER BALL before doing something real about it (shrinking it through visualization hadn't quite done the trick), I could no longer hang in there for her incessant rants about her ex-husband, or her praise for a woman who could diagnose a patient without ever having seen or spoken to her. Northrup seems to vascillate between intelligent and irresponsible."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Clearly this is a pop culture read..and it is a bore! As a peri- menopausal woman I was hoping for a bit more scientific approach to this middle age malady. However, the reader gets a dose of new age tripe. Furthermore, you can tell the author is from the ME generation..Her favorite subject, as she rambles on about her crumbling relationship with her husband. Who cares???We want sound medical advice, not voo-doo!! Maybe she should uncover that mirror and look at herself."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I had seen the author on [a show] one day when I was home suffering with the flu. The show made me want to read this book because I thought it would answer many of my questions about perimenopause. Instead I found the book to be depressing and full of the author's own issues...issues that frankly have less to do with mid-life hormonal changes than her personal marital crisis. We all have our issues, but I was looking for fact based information, not self-justification. Yes, there was some information in the book I found interesting, but not enough."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"It takes a lot of denial to rationalize away the very real hormonal and physical changes of menopause. But rationalize I did I did, until I read this book and realized that not only was I in denial about my hot flashes, mood swings and energy fluctuations but I was making life far more difficult than it had to be, not only for myself but for my family.After reading this book, I made some changes in my diet and exercise plan and found some natural supplements which helped a great deal. Most importantly, this author provided detailed information I hadn't found in other books and made me realize that being informed can make menopause a natural stage in a woman's life - not necessarily a completely smooth one, but certainly manageable and understanable."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"As the husband of 26 years of a woman who has started menopause I thought this (book) would be the ideal means to better understand what my life partner was going thru and, most confusing to me, unexplainedly putting me thru. Was I wrong!I have a hard time putting credence to the words of an individual that uses tarot cards to guide her life (is this a \\" two thousand's\\" thing or something?) and who more or less blames her biology and gender for what went wrong in her life and why. For being a doctor I was amazed at the lack of educated insight or reasoned deduction in this woman's life. While she clearly describes what she is going thru and what changes it has made to her thinking I found it difficult to see how she saw 2+2 but swore it equalled 5 (and tries to make you the reader believe it too)! True there are many, many unjustices in the world today that still hold women back or regulate them to suffer undeserved indignities to say that it is because your brain was hard wired one way during the childbearing years and that was why you accepted such but, now that you have experienced menopause you should rewire, foresake all that you now feel hold you back or stiffle you, and go on the attack smacks of what women have complained of for years when their husband goes off the deep end having midlife crisis and buys a sports car and has a fling with his secretary (barmaid, trainer...whatever: younger woman). Hormonal changes change our drives and who we are but Dr. Northrup has to have the worst case of unrecognized hormone imbalance I have ever heard of. When she should have been listening to family, husband, and friends (and talking to her doctor) she instead sells the business, tells her husband to sleep in another room, and decides all that is wrong in her life was caused by society; with her being a pawn rather than a player. I know what her husband feels like as I have been accused of moving my wife's things (memory loss) to the point of being told I am a liar... to threatened with divorce as she thinks she \\"needs some space.\\" For a man to have a loving partner one day and mere months later a woman he hardly knows because her hormones, or lack of, are now coursing thru her differently is a mind numbing confusing experience. For Dr. Northrup to say \\"do whatever you feel....it's natural' is to say that the husband has no say in what was a partnership in life and accept the chips as his wife sees fit to have them fall because she now has the \\"insight to truth\\". Rather Dr. Northrup should be telling men to get with their wife's doctor and ask her/him how to tactfully and lovingly handle the changes BEFORE menopause occurs so that he is aware and educated in what will be, in some cases, extreme changes in their wife's behavior.As an example: how do you tell your wife she is always angry without out making her angry? And do you have the right to ask the doctor if he/she is seeing the same.I was deeply disappointed in this book and wouldn't recommend it to any man hoping to gain insight into what his wife is going through."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dr. Northrup's exciting book about menopause. It is full of reliable, up-to-date, accurate information on menopause and how women may pass through this phase of life to become happier, healthier, and full of wisdom. I find myself picking it up time and again as I have new questions about HRT, osteoporosis prevention, nutrition, and especially about alternative herbal supplements for this stage of a woman's life. I find her comprehensive and enjoy her ability to look at many sides of an issue. Her personal experiences strengthen the advice and information she gives to every woman. I first heard Dr. Northrup on a special program on our PBS station on &quot;Women's Wisdom, Women's Health&quot;. I have been a fan ever since. Give the book a try. You deserve to be well informed about this important stage of your life...for all women and those who love them. Enjoy! Keep an open mind and you will be amazed at what you will learn from this book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"A very well written explanation of a normal change in a woman's life. Menopause is not a disease that needs to be treated, it is a natural part of a woman's life that Dr. Northrup clearly explains from a loving, whole person perspective. I have given this book to sisters and friends and would recommend it to any woman approaching menopause and those that love her."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I admit, I haven't finished this book. A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia. I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels. Granted, I am not a firm believer in just \\"the hard facts\\" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I have been a fan of Dr. Northrup's for years, since Womens Bodies, Womens Wisdom. She has struggled with the &quot;established&quot; ways of treating women's unique health problems for years, putting her medical practice and her reputation on the line repeatedly. She pulls it all together in this book, both the mainstream and alternative treatments that have worked for her patients. No, I'm not into the tarot cards, chakras, and some of the woo-woo stuff either (like other reviewers) but I'm happy to at least know about it. Some readers object to the recounting of her divorce -- &quot;Does that mean I have to get rid of my husband to start my new life?&quot; Oh please, this is her story and you have yours, we can all acknowledge that, can't we?

It is concise, factual and one of the most in depth guides to women's health not only at menopause but during your entire life that I have ever read. It gives you choices as far as medical approaches to your health and well being as well as holistic and spiritual guidance. It is something every woman should read. Once you finish this book, believe me, you will understand yourself and others much better. Read it today."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"This book should be required reading for any woman over the age of 40 and any man who is truly interested in knowing about what women go through at this time of their lives. Dr. Northrup clearly covers every aspect of menopause. Please don't stop at the first couple of chapters, read it from cover to cover, even if there are sections that don't apply. There is a wealth of knowledge contained therein! Three cheers for a woman trained by the male dominated medical field as she broke the mold and combined the wisdom of a multitude of healing professions! Never does Dr. Northrup give you just one path to follow, she gives you options and allows you to choose what feels right to you. Kudos!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"The book starts out with her poor marriage to a &quot;cold&quot; husband and &quot;cold&quot; mother which I thought was a little strange for a book written by a doctor. Then she starts talking about fibroids being caused by stress, which made me wonder so I started skipping through the book and quit reading after her claim that thyroid problems are caused by &quot;swallowing one's words&quot;, i.e. anger. Then I wondered where was she a doctor- some small town in Maine."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"Although I found this book informative and helpful when it came to the facts concerning menopause, I was quite concerned regarding Dr. Northrup's methods of gaining her wisdom regarding her personal opinions about life, and she mentions her personal opinions many times. She states on page 25 to using mysticism, astrology and angels, as well as tarot cards. She again mentions using tarot cards on page 27. Then when discussing something valid like prayer on page 31, she &quot;sends it(her prayers) down the river to its source&quot;. I always thought God was in Heaven? Then on page 32, she mentions using animal medicine cards for guidance. What kind of craziness is this? She also continually mentions throughout the book for us to examine the relationships in our lives, especially our bad marriages, as the root cause of many menopausal systems. She then goes on many times to encourage us to end any bad relationships, including your marriage. The sheer number of times this is mentioned made me dislike this book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"The medical advice on diet, exercise, natural hormones, alternative medicine, food supplements is very helpful. Less helpful is Dr. Northrup's reference to chakras, medical intuitives, tarot cards as well as her personal beliefs and life experiences. It makes her sound like some over-the-top new age guru. Stick to the medicine doc, if I want spiritual advice it won't be from you."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I ordered the audio tape, thinking I would be listening to Dr. Northrup reading the book, as Dr. Phil read his book, \\"Self Matters\\"., and then I could keep the hard copy of the book on my shelf for reference. With only one tape, there is no way that Dr. Northrup covered what's in her book. The tape should be sub-titled as a lecture to a group of women, which is exactly what it is, not the unabridged version of the book. ..."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"As Boomers, many of my friends and I are in varying stages of peri or actual menopause. I've read Dr. Northrup's book and thought she had a great attitude toward the whole process. However, she doesn't seem to realize that most women will not accept their menopause as an opportunity to tell everyone to kiss off and go their own way as she seems to have done. She says she took a fake hormone pill due to fibroids and it \\"kick started\\" her brain and told her she needed to become someone else, someone who would use menopause as an opportunity to be selfish and aggressive. Well, honey, if you aren't that way to begin with, stopping the monthlies ain't the magic that's gonna make you that way! If you've never watched your diet, exercised, told your husband exactly what you thought, and/or struck out on your own and did exactly as you pleased, you're not going to suddenly do it now. I can't imagine anything more stressful at that time of a woman's life than doing what Dr. Northrup asks us to do and becoming a completely different person!!!

Thank you Dr. Northrup, you are an angel."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I purchased this book because the reviews I had read made it sound as if it were full of sage advice from a medical professional. I was sadly mistaken. Ms. Northrup has used the stage of menopause to cover her needs to assert her self as a valuble human being. It was disapointing to me to hear someone who should command respect expound the use of things like Tarot cards ro decide her future. The most bizarre part of this book was her comparison of her fibroid tumor to an embryo... But instead of getting the appropriate help she 'nursed' her tumor and used it as a way to explain her need to release her inner self... She consistantly makes blanket statements concerning medication and herbs... Please don't use this book as an excuse to become self centered and please don't believe all you read!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I must admit the astrology and tarot card stuff was quite odd.

I need straight forward informational help, not modern day witch craft. I'm not kidding! She casually refers to her reliance on psychics, tarot cards, etc., and expects the reader to continue to take her seriously. What I found even more objectional, however, was her premise that as women, from puberty to menopause we have a &quot;hormonal veil&quot; over our eyes, that causes us to nurture those around us, and subjugate our own desires and needs. As we reach peri-menopause, and our hormones are raging and spewing (yea- those of you who have experienced it know exactly what I mean!) these irrationally angry feelings, not our nurturing, kind and protective feelings reflect reality, and those other gentler, kinder notions were all a farce. Go ahead- act on the very worst urges within you. Don't you know? Its all about YOU- and how it feels to feel the way you feel. Forget how your choices may affect or even devastate those around you.

I was disappointed that there was no indication on the book jacket, or anywhere else for that matter, that Dr. Northrup chooses to use tarot cards and other such media to determine paths for her life's journey. I think that would be a significant topic to address in a review of such a book, especially by a medical professional. THe medical information is quite good, and I will use it for such.

For example, there is research accumulating that black cohosh and flaxseeds are safe and effective measures for hotflashes and other menopause changes.As host of the menopause web site for bellaonline.com, I get a lot of questions from women about these approaches. I wish Dr. Northrup had examined the better researched ones instead of discussing Tarot cards. Also, her discussion of her own divorce took away from the focus of the book.In many health care situations, it is often the nurse or nurse practitioner who answers women's menopause questions and I'm looking forward to a book that presents menopause from this point of view.Carolyn Chambers Clark, RN, ARNP, EdDBoard-Certified Holistic Practitionerhttp://Menopause.bellaonline.com"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I love Christiane Northrup's holistic view of our bodies, minds and spirits.

Instead, Dr. Northrup cites examples from her own passage, turning the text into a mind-body-spirit analysis of how menopause is literally the \\"change of life.\\"The most fascinating aspect of the book is the author's description of how women's actual brain wiring changes during menopause -- from the selfless nurturing of the childbearing years to a more autonomous focus during the second half of life.The best aspect is the book's focus on empowerment, and how women who understand the process of menopause can use the changes they're going through to reassess their lives.A must-read for every woman, no matter how old they are."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change","review":"I have been educating myself about menopause since I hit 40.

Of course, I'm exaggerating, but case study after case study cites women who leave their mates if they don't understand them. And these aren't abusive relationships--just difficult ones. I was also put off by what she called the spiritual dimension of her life--Tarot cards and astrology. Come on!

I personally felt that it took away from the book.I think we have to be very careful of going from one extreme to another--the one extreme of being/feeling subservient to men to the other extreme of being completely separated from men. In my opinion, either extreme is very unhealthy. While it would also be unhealthy for people to stay in relationships that are debilitating for either partner, it would also be unhealthy to cut people out of our lives because of our hormones. (Although if I've understood Dr. Northup correctly, it's not just the hormones, but also the baggage we carry that's part of the problem.)Perhaps when we as women feel comfortable in our own feminity, we won't feel threatened by men. This being the case, perhaps the book should have a different title, as the original one seems misleading, in my opinion. I thought I was going to read about how to deal, accept and/or handle menopause, and instead I felt I got hit with what I call \\"ranting\\" here and there.

Patterns in Java Volume 1 is an excellent design patterns catalog. It contains patterns from the book Design Patterns by Gamma et al as well as patterns from other sources including the author. The fact that this catalog covers patterns that can be found in other catalogs may seem repetitious, but not in this case. Design patterns are a way of conveying expert solutions to software problems. But they are not cookbook solutions. There are issues and variations on each theme even for a pattern as apparently simple as Singleton. (If you need to be convinced of this, take a look at the book Pattern Hatching by John Vlissides.) Patterns in Java looks at each pattern from a fresh slant giving the reader who has read other catalogs a bit more insight on each pattern.The format used to describe the patterns is similar to that found in the GOF book or some of the patterns found in Pattern Languages of Program Design (volumes 1, 2 or 3): A synopsis of the problem to be solved is given and there are sections on the problem context, forces, the solution, consequences of using the pattern and implementation issues as well as example code and a list of related patterns.The book's diagrams are expressed in UML and one of the best short introductions to UML that I have seen is included as the second chapter. In addition to class diagrams, object diagrams, collaboration diagrams and state chart diagrams are used to document the patterns presented.Of course Java programmers will find this catalog particularly useful because the examples are all in Java. However, those that use other OO languages will find the example code and the explanatory text, clear and easy enough to follow.There are a number of typographical and other errors of the kind you'd expect in the first edition of a technical book. None of these errors are serious. The author includes his WEB page URL and states that updates will be posted there.I have found the book useful more than once in designing classes for a prototype my team is constructing. In short, I highly recommend this book as one of the design pattern catalogs that any programmer doing object oriented development should own."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"This is the sort of book that you keep at arm's reach. I found it amusing that there is a graphical depiction of a dog-eared page on the cover, since in my case it will soon become a real one. The book contains a succinct overview of UML, a nice overview of the software development process, and a catalog of 40-some design patterns.The patterns are beautifully explained, most often using real-life situations (i.e., the ones that we often implement imperfectly). There are code examples for each pattern in Java. I am more an experienced programmer than a &quot;pattern freak&quot;; that is, I do not spend hours discussing the intricate subtlties of patterns and I do not see them as a miracle cure. I consider them a valuable tool for guidance, inspiration and communication. This book seems to have much the same view, and so you'll find mention of drawbacks and practicalities.All of the original &quot;Gang of Four&quot; patterns are (I'm pretty sure) covered. Mr. Grand also includes some of his own patterns, which to some would constitute hubris, were they not so well thought through. The book also brings together some patterns published by other authors in scattered places.Another very cool thing is the mention of Java API specific examples of the patterns, when they exist. Many beginning Java programmers are unaware of how much patterns influenced the Java API's design, and are thus puzzled by things like the Observable/Observer pair, and the empty Serializable interface. This book brings the richness of the Java API to light, and points the reader to another good source of design pattern examples (the API source code).The examples are all diagrammed in UML. I'm not incredibly familiar with UML (yet), so I found it extremely useful to be able to flip back to the beginning of the book to find out, for example, what the little asterisk over the arrow means. The book's CD contains several UML modeling applications.Buy this book.

This was the one I found to be the most useful. Some caveats: First of all, if you're not at least an intermediate java programmer, you probably will have a hard time reading this book. Buy Volume 2 first (kind of strange but it's actually not as advanced) which is less about design patterns and more about fundamental design principles. Second, even if you are an intermediate to advanced Java programmer, it can be difficult to understand. But then, the subject matter is by nature abstract. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything more useful, including GoF. It's written for C++/Smalltalk and sometimes the multiple inheritance allowed by those languages makes it difficult to translate the pattern to Java.

It makes a great reference."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"The patterns in here are brief, which should not be a problem.

I am a reader not their proofreader!!!)For example, the text refers to a name 'DoorController' but the diagram (Fig 7.28) only has 'DoorControllerIF', 'DoorControllerWrapperA', and 'DoorControllerWrapperB'. What the hell does it refer to?In Fig 7.30, the interface has 2 methods - 'Operation1()' and 'Operation2()', but all subclasses of it use the names 'Operation()' and 'Operation2()', instead. Does it mean 'Operator1()' and 'Operation()' are 2 different methods?The source code in P280 uses the type name 'SurveillanceMonitorIF' but there is no such a type ever found in the text - the closest match is 'surveillanceIF' only!!!!!This *could* be a great book provided that the author/publisher pay SERIOUS attention to the importance of consistent naming."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"The code examples are sketchy and incomplete, and often utilize techniques that may be good practice but that obfuscate the concept the reader is trying to learn.For example his coverage of the Delegation pattern (which I have yet to see documented in any other book, I'm still looking :) is verbosely explained but the accompanying example code is so vague and has so many ...'s as to be almost unusable."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"If you are a hands on Java programmer and want the design patterns explained as you can understand them in code, this book is worth it.

I often browse through it looking for ideas."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"The new two book series tries to have more patterns and tie them all to Java. One advantage to this approach is that some patterns make sense in Java that do not make sense in other OO language. Apparently from reading Volume 2, it appears that a Volume 3 is planned.An odd thing about this series is that the first three chapters are the same in both books. I wish they were in Volume 1 only to save me some money, shelf space and to save trees.It is true that the books gives you a large library of patterns. However, it has been discussed between myself and others that some of the patterns are not really patterns at all. For example, the so-called &quot;Testing Patterns&quot; have been around forever and are methodologies not Patterns. Also, they are not related to Java in any way.The explanations in this book in no way compare to the explanations found in GoF. The descriptions of patterns in GoF were pretty consistent in understandability. &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; was a real mixed bag. Some patterns had wonderful explanations. Others did not make sense to me even after repeated readings. Most were just okay though.Many of the code examples seem overly complex to me. Instead of just showing the patterns in isolation, the examples tend try to do something else which masks the patterns itself. Also, I saw some bugs in some of the code and others have told me the same. For example, the singleton code examples claims &quot;If you play all audio clips through the AudioClipManager object, there will never be more than one audio clip playing at the same time.&quot; However, from looking at the code, I see a race condition that is not handled.In summary, if the book was executed properly, it would be incredibly useful to all Java programmers. However, the implementation is very flawed. It is still marginally useful in that it documents a lot of patterns that GoF does not. A second edition, which focused on improving explanations and code examples, is needed to make these books really good."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Because I'm a Java programmer and think UML is cool, I chose this book over GoF, and I was disappointed.

Java presents opportunities and challenges that were not present in C++.In this two-volume series, Mark Grand converts well-established design patterns into Java. Unfortunately, he fails to demonstrate even a rudimentary understanding of his material. These books in this series read like hopelessly flawed research papers, not the fruit of experience. I finished them wondering whether the author had ever actually implemented any of these patterns in a real-world design.He misinterprets some key points while missing others altogether. Some of the GoF patterns use inheritance for mixins. That's fine in C++, but Java provides only single inheritance. Wasting inheritance as he does, the author's implementations make it impossible to use inheritance for normal (more important) purposes. Interfaces solve many of the problems that the author creates. In some cases, the implementations totally defeat their patterns. They contain hard code that flatly contradicts the intended generality of the patterns.Volume 2 demonstrates that the author does not know the difference between a coding technique and a design patterns. Some of his so-called \\"design patterns\\" (under his own name, of course) are mere coding techniques that have been around for years. Assertions are a typical example.This book may fool less experienced readers. Too bad they will eventually have to unlearn the garbage they pick up here.This book gets one star only because it is the lowest rating I can give. Mr. Grand, please stop writing! You're only embarrassing yourself. Please do not release your intended third volume while your first two are in such desperate need of rewrites by knowledgeable professionals."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Ok, I can get past the numerous typos and little mistakes, however the entire intent of utilizing patterns seems to be lost in the implementation examples presented here. For instance, client code is shown for the author's &quot;version&quot; of an abstract factory that actually calls a getFactory method with a constant standing for the concrete factory to use. The entire intent of creation patterns was to NOT to do this. If the class used to create an object is to be known to the client through hardcoding, why use a factory method in the first place?The implementation of many of the patterns is just plain wrong, or doesn't resemple the GoF version in intent. Consider the example implementation of the Factory Method given. What is that? The examples in this book seem to teach that flexibility in OO can best be achieved through code modification of existing classes.Do yourself a favor, read Go4 Design Patterns, understand it, and translate the C++ examples to Java yourself if you like. My biggest problem with this book is that it will help make bad OO programmers. There's already enough of those out there, thank you. I have to go return my book now ..."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"If you are a Java programmer without years of experience, the GoF book may be quite difficult. This book is not as thorough but is a lot easier and has the sample code in Java. This book does adequate job in introducing the pattern concept and the most important patterns to the not-so-experienced coder. If you feel intimidated by the GoF book, buy this first. If not, then you might want to pass this one."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"The help this offers is for students who haven't learned a lot of languages yet. For them, the effort of picking Java sense out of C++ or Smalltalk may defeat the rest of the pattern discussion. For them, Java code samples and references to familiar Java library elements can make all the difference.For the rest of us, this book has decidedly mixed value. The real problem is that Grand seems to equate the terms &quot;desgin pattern&quot; and &quot;good idea&quot;. Design patterns are good ideas, at least in the right context, but not all good ideas are design patterns.For example, delegation of responsibility is a good idea. It's the basis of any system decomposition. I have trouble justifying that as a design pattern - you may as well say that passing function parameters is a design pattern. It's just too broad. At the other end of the spectrum, Grand points to &quot;marker&quot; interfaces, Java interfaces with identities but not content, as a design pattern. Again, this is a useful but language-dependent hack. Ada or C# would have done the same things with attributes, and C++ could have done the same using marker fields or values in the class. Language tricks aren't patterns.Still, many of Grand's patterns are good ideas. The &quot;Object Pool&quot;, for example, is a common and useful pattern. It's closely related to two GoF patterns. It's like a Singleton, except there's more than one of them. It's like a Flyweight, except the units aren't distinguishable or shareable.One real annoyance is the tendency of this Volume I to refer to necessary information in Volume II. If the author is going to create independently saleable units of book, they should be independently readable. I do not appreciate the implicit plug for the author's other work.I use this book, but mostly for its bad examples.

Patterns, Java and UML: what's more than this? After various reading, I and other five software developers of my company are still reading and translating in Java the C++ examples of Go4 Design Pattern. Unfortunately (for us) your book rest in peace on the bookshelf....:-(( We tried various times implementing patterns throughout this book but we was confused by your explanations: It's impossible understand the essence and needings of those patterns and their use. We tried looking at the code examples shipped with the book but results was worst than before... Did you notice that your example of STATE pattern uses more switch and variables than the Procedural examples ? Why I need an ABSTRACT FACTORY if I use a constant for my factory method ? I was very disappointed to find simply: not -working code examples. How do you think I can use a code without running it, I mean your examples doesn't have a main() method !!! In all the patterns examples source code there is no trace about a possible simple client or user class of them. We spent one hour trying to run Your STATE pattern. Where is a stupid Dialog box that use the DirtyState class ? I mean stupid, simple and little class, but with the correct call sequence of methods. Have you never thought that someone that take your CD and goes on the source code examples , does that because he didn't understood the book explanation and he want run a ready to go dummy example. All the examples lacks of &quot;HowTo&quot; concept that is the final target of a book so called catalog.... A more generally mysterious thing to me, is the race toward the last release of every product. Do you used JDK1.2, marvelous inner classes and other stuff because are you concerned about the &quot;obsolescence&quot; of your book ? Go4 Design Pattern is still valid after five years. Now I'm here in USA for some months working in a very large Java project. They uses a JVM JDK 1.1.4 compliant and only AWT not Swing ! I use borland JBuilder for developing process and the latest release of it uses JDK1.1.6 and Swing 1.0.1 Our applications most of the times are installed on RISC machines like IBM AX or DEC Alpha and they support &quot;only&quot; JDK 1.1.7. We have applications installed on 400 PC designed two years ago with only JDK 1.1 and AWT interface: they are still working and they need to be maintained. This is the Industrial standard reality for who works in real projects,not the latest release after one week it come up !!! I don't think we are using Java (only) for colorful applets on our web pages. Instead we are using it for the promise: &quot;Write once run everywhere&quot;. I think that customers for a pattern catalog book will be programmers involved in medium large industrial strength applications that are trying to improve their code or solve designing problems.... I don't think using the latest Java features add any values to a &quot;Design Pattern&quot; book. Instead make it less &quot;understandable&quot; from that peoples that (unfortunately, like me) spends much of their time working on real and money consuming projects. I was very upset finding how this book claimed to go so near the target and at the same time missed it in a so badly way, and it's really a shame for everybody."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Oh my, that this book misses the mark so badly is laughable (you have to laugh or you'll cry!). The author doesn't truly understand the subject matter at all with numerous bad implementations of the GoF patterns. This shows a lack of true understanding of the GoF patterns in the first place as well as a lack of true understanding of Java (interfaces leaps out as an example here).I agree with another reviewer. The only book worse than this is Volume 2."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"I was very excited about this book when I first got it and quickly scanned through it. When I sat down to try and implement some of the patterns, I found flaws in the code that comes with the book, shoddy written examples and poor explanations. This book could have been much more, but has turned out to be a half-assed, rushed implementation."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Bought this book for my nephew. His comment was \\"there are a lot of good parts, but you have to search for them.\\""},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"As well as it's intended purpose to describe patterns in java terms I've found some very useful coding snippets extra over the pattern descriptions. I've learnt more about the jdk packages from the books frequent referal to pattern usage in the java api. Only 4 stars though; the book has many typographical errors and the layout could be better - especially the page headings, chapter number and chapter name; it would be much more useful to have chapter name, pattern name instead; I hope the author can manage this in his follow up volume which I will certainly buy."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Just a quick one I'm afraid. Having bought this book yesterday I'm pleased to see that it covers not only new patterns but also GoF ones from a Java perspective. Whilst patterns can often be language neutral, having someone ground them in your current implementation language makes understanding them much easier. I was pleased with Larman's book earlier this year but it's focus was more towards the software lifecycle. &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; covers the UML language enough so that you can understand the diagrams in the following sections. It also briefly covers the lifecycle, but the main focus is definiately on usable, realistic patterns to help you solve specific problems. This book is a pre-requistite to designing any vaguely complex Java application. If you were holding off by the Gang of Four book until it was updated for Java, don't wait anymore. Buy this instead."},{"Title":"Patterns in Java: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML","review":"Have been looking for a java centred patterns book for some time and this fits the bill. Very useful examples and I particularly liked the way that examlples of a pattern's use in the jdk are highlighted."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},C={key:1};function R(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",P,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(L,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-3b4e31b4"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/50.md","filePath":"quotes/50.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/50.md"},j=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{B as __pageData,j as default};
