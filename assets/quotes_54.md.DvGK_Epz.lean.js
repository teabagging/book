It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought. This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness. However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text. The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed. This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other? You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James \\"Varieties of the Religious Experience\\" has more insight than the rest of the book.

In 1974, Flesch revised it by writing postscripts to each chapter. Basically he denounced much of what he had written 25 years earlier. If you're interested in learning about Flesch's readablility formula, I suggest you buy his book How to Write, Speak, and Think More Effectively, which, incidentally, is still in print and provides a good introduction to Flesch's work. My advice is to buy (used) the following books by Flesch, none of which are in print: 1) How to Make Sense (1954), 2) The Art of Clear Thinking (1951), 3) The Art of Plain Talk (1946), 4) How to be Brief (1962), and 5) Say What You Mean (1972). If you're still set on buying The Art of Readable Writing, I recommend that you buy the 25th Anniversary Edition (1974) with Flesch's improvements and corrections. I think you'll find that his postscripts are far more interesting than the original text."},{"Title":"The art of readable writing","review":"Contrary to the previous review's misinformation, this is not a book on penmanship, but a guide to improving your writing in the sense of composition.

I would say the only negative of this atlas is that it is almost too detailed, and might be a bit overwhelming for a beginner. For example, it labels subareas of structures that might be labeled as single structures in other atlases (e.g., claustrum, amygdala etc.). I don't mean to present this as a criticism--the atlas fills the role of a comprehensive atlas for intermediate to advanced users, but beginners might want to use this in combination with another atlas (I recommendThe Brain Atlas: A Visual Guide to the Human Central Nervous Systemin the paperback). This latter book is nice for the illustrated pathways as well. I was a big fan of the last edition of the Mai et al book, and I think the current edition is even better. For example, there is a supplemental website containing a large amount of great information: [...]. Used in combination with another book, this atlas will give any medical or neuroscience student a solid foundation in anatomy."},{"Title":"Atlas of the Human Brain","review":"For many readers, this might be a rather exotic book. However, for those who want a sense of the structure of the human brain, this is a fine resource. The title refers to this as an \\"atlas\\" of the human brain. And that it is! As the authors note: \\"The present book consists of a series of maps, each featuring. . .brain morphology and topography.\\"MRI technology allows for a better view of the human brain and makes this volume more helpful still. The Introduction (Chapter 1) emphasizes some realities--such as the fact that there is a fair amount of variability in individuals' brain structure; localization of brain function is another issue discussed here. Methodological issues are joined, too, in the Introduction. Chapter 2 focuses in more detail on materials and methods in the study of brain structure. Chapters 3 and 4 represent the heart of the book, an atlas of different parts of the brain.Interested in the structure of the human brain? This is a handy resource if you wish to visualize the brain."},{"Title":"The Last Dog Soldier (Gunsmoke, No. 2)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As the first book, I read this book in one day. My heart starts beating faster when I first opened the book. As the first book, Mr.West still refers to Matt Dillon as City Marshal and I guess he has his reasons. I love the romance between Matt and Kitty and Mr. West makes it clear that they are in love and everyone see's it. We can fully embrace their relationship. And for me, it's a welcome site. I know their relationship on the show was strong and they were devoted to eachother and we've seen that as far back as the first season in 1955.Though it became more obvious in the early 60's. And the writers left it all up to the viewers thoughts and I'm sure we all came up with the same result. But actually reading it and seeing it in print was heartwarming. And for me it confirmed the love they had for eachother. So if you like western action with some romance then you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Last Dog Soldier (Gunsmoke, No. 2)","review":"I am a huge \\"Gunsmoke \\" fan also. While Mr. West has inaccuracies such as Matt being a City Marshal, Festus reading, and a Mayor of Dodge City; overall it is a good read. Yes, Mr. West took Matt & Kitty to a different level; however, in later years of the show, the relationship may have been implied, but I don't believe it is ambiguous as it was in the earlier years. The show definitely changed with the times. Remember, Newly did start to teach Festus to read--although it was with images and not words. I would like to see more of Doc as he was an integral part of the TV show. But hey, if Mr. Arness thinks highly of the books, shouldn't we?"},{"Title":"The Last Dog Soldier (Gunsmoke, No. 2)","review":"If there was a saving grace to the violence of the American frontier, it was probably that most of it lacked the faceless anonymity of today's urban scene: if you shot at somebody (or he at you), one of you probably had a good personal reason for doing so. To Marshal Matt Dillon, *why* people shot at each other usually didn't matter so much as whether they \\"fought fair\\"--but in this second original novel by Joseph A. West, that's not quite the case. Dillon has had his doubts about Abbey and Abe McKenna ever since they appeared in Kansas with a herd made up of cattle carrying half a dozen or more different brands, but when he finds the body of the previous owner of the ranch they claim to have purchased, he realizes there may be more to the situation than he figured on. Then Kitty Russell's head bartender, Sam Noonan, falls for Abbey McKenna with a crash audible all the way to St. Louis, and now Matt has a personal reason for discovering the truth about the McKennas, as more and more he comes to suspect that Abbey may be a black widow, prone to marrying men and then disposing of them for their money. Can he find proof enough to convince Sam of the truth in time, or must he stand aside and watch a friend walk unknowing to his death? Meanwhile, a former Cheyenne Dog Soldier has vowed revenge on Abbey's brother Abe for publicly humiliating him in the Alhambra Saloon and shaming his father into suicide.Like its predecessor,Gunsmoke (#1): Blood, Bullets, And Buckskin, this is a tightly and expertly plotted story full of action and sharp left turns, but whether it's exactly the \\"Gunsmoke\\" we remember from TV remains an open question: West still gets stuck on little discrepancies that no GS fan writer would ever put in her stories, and he also seems to be a bit confused as to his time--he mentions gunsmith-deputy Newly O'Brien (played for many years by now-Western artist Buck Taylor), but not Newly's predecessor in the \\"ingenue deputy\\" role, Clayton Thaddeus Greenwood (who was for two seasons portrayed by Roger Ewing), and places Newly contemporaneous with Quint Asper (the two never met canonically). On the other hand, he does a better job of adapting GS to print than Gary McCarthy did, and for that he can perhaps be forgiven his lapses."},{"Title":"The Last Dog Soldier (Gunsmoke, No. 2)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It moved fast and kept me interested the entire time. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Gunsmoke or just likes stories about the Old West.

Pereira provides a cohesive discussion of Lilith from her beginnings through Jewish Midrashic and Qabalistic interpretations to modern times.It is a joy to read a book about Lilith that does not treat her as a deviant force that should be exorcised, suppressed, or merely an archetype. It is apparent from reading the book that the author has had personal interaction with Lilith and that she respects the Sumerian goddess. It is hands down the best book I've read so far about Lilith."},{"Title":"Lilith: The Edge of Forever (Woman in History, V. 18)","review":"Overall, the research in this book is very good and accurately covers the controversies and issues associated with Lilith and her history. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that it depends in places a bit too much on theories popular with the &quot;Goddess movement&quot; that wouldn't stand up to the scholarly scrutiny that is used in the rest of the book. Also, like most other books on Lilith, the author states that Lilith was once a goddess in ancient times without giving proof of this claim. Overall, however, this is a good introduction to Lilith, albeit a rather scholarly one for the general public."},{"Title":"Lilith: The Edge of Forever (Woman in History, V. 18)","review":"There is a lot of in-print material on Lilith out there, as well as much web (mis)information.

He began writing primarily western stories for the pulps in the 1930s. His work appeared in such magazines as 10 Story Western, Ace High, Argosy, Big Book Western, Dime Western Magazine, and Ranch Romances, Black Mask, Detective Tales, Speed Detective, Super Detective, Doctor Death, Ellery Queen's and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazines, and Man from U.N.C.L.E. He graduated to writing for the slicks and glossies and sold stories in the high-end market to the Saturday Evening Post, Atlantic Monthly, Colliers, and Playboy. He was a leading freelance contributor to the Saturday Evening Post for 18 years (1944 - 1962). Reese was \\"a nut about the English language\\", \\"delighted in good prose and was a fine stylist himself.\\" Sheehan's Mill was described as \\"a first novel with unexpected approach and fresh personal style. It recaptures America by gaslight, expanding and growing. The gusty 1890's., Reese's first children's book, was about a sheep dog in the badlands of North Dakota. It won the 1952 New York Herald Tribune award for best children's book. He continued to write children's books through the 1960s, but thereafter concentrated on his Westerns. The Jesus on Horseback trilogy is considered his best work.[Among his many pseudonyms are: Eddie Abbott, John Jo Carpenter, Camford Cheavly, Camford Sheaveley, Camford Sheavely, and Cody Kennedy, Jr. The John H. Reese manuscript collection is located at the American Heritage Center (formerly the Western History Research Center) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Several of his Western stories were made into films, including Charley Varrick (1973) from the novel The Looters, Good Day for a Hanging (1959) from the story Frontier Frenzy, and The Young Land (1959) based upon a short story by Reese.His stories were the basis for many radio and television broadcasts, including NBC's Theatre Newstand Radio Broadcast, ABC's Five Star Matinee Radio Broadcast, and the DuPont Show of the Week.\\""},{"Title":"Restless","review":"I should have paid more attention when I picked up this book.

Frank's brother, Herbie is about to begin his senior year and he has decided to go out for two sports--football and cross-country. He is now the same age as his brother was when he died.The premise of the book is that there are some things that must be done while yet alive. It is a book that really gets you thinking about your own life and what you are doing with it.While there are no objectionable words, I would recommend this for readers over age 12 due to subject matter. Definately one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"Restless","review":"Author Wallace is a natural at writing exciting, realistic sports action. However, RESTLESS is about so much more than sports. It's a surprising mystery filled with real teens. The dialog is amazing! It's how real people talk.

Even when he thinks about all of this afterwards, he knows he will not be able to stay away from the graveyard and the spirit that beckons to him.Frank: Eight years older than his brother, Frank died of cancer at seventeen. He was not ready to leave and fought hard to hang onto his body, but it finally just gave out. He misses Herbie, his parents and all the passions that he could never have. Frank needs to let Herbie know that things are finally going to be all right and that he can move on. But something else is happening in the graveyard, and even Frank can't understand who the spirit is that is reaching for him.Eamon: Killed in a tragic accident in the late 1800s, Eamon has not found his peace. He is looking for a way out but does not know where he really is. He has found a great energy in the running boy and a possible channel to another world.RESTLESS is one of the most original YA books to come along in recent years. While there are themes of spirituality and time travel, what lies underneath the ongoing story are the themes of love and endurance. Author Rich Wallace has done some detailed research into theories about the afterlife and expresses this information beautifully through his characters and the story line. His characters are chained together in their common theme of grief and loneliness. Frank (who has been dead for eight years) narrates most of the story, which gives it an entirely fresh perspective.This book grabs you from the first page and won't let you go until its exciting and rewarding climax.

Her languages is concise and engages the reader with its revealing, truthful voice. The poetry shows a serious effort in their crafting, a sincerity of expression, based on real struggle. I appreciate her reflection of the I Ching, showing its simple, direct insight into human experience without the esoteric smoke and mirrors overlaid by overzealous commentators. The Book of Changes blends streams of exertion, ecstacy, anger, exhiliration, persimmons and enlightenment, drafting a mixture balanced in its rhythm, correct within lifes cycle"},{"Title":"Book of Changes","review":"My first contact with Karen Holden was through seeing her visual art. Upon first seeing those paintings, I was struck by the intensity of feeling that she could express with brush and canvas. Wanting to live with some of her artwork, I arranged to meet with her. My first few meetings with her were as artist and client. Over time we became friends, and through that friendship, I came to realize how much Karen put her soul into her art.In her BOOK OF CHANGES, I can see that same deep personal interaction between Karen and her poetry as I saw between Karen and her art. Poetry, in all its forms, is, arguably, the most personal way of expression possible. When a poet shares his or her poetry with us, he or she is sharing something of the self. This is certainly true here.In Karen's introduction she quotes Lao Tzu as follows: &quot;A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever he wants.&quot; She goes on to state: This is my goal -- to be led into this work and be enriched by it.&quot; I think that she has not only enriched herself, she has enriched all of us.Each verse of Karen's poetry is paired with one of the sixty-four hexagrams of the &quot;I Ching.&quot; The &quot;I Ching&quot; can be read as a philosophical text, or one can consult it much as the ancient Greeks consulted the Oracle. Karen's poems have sprung from her years of interaction with the &quot;I Ching&quot; and, in their own way, have added another dimension. I think that we can see this from the following short poem from the book:I CHING #55: FENG: &quot;Abundance&quot; -- &quot;If Clarity is within, and Movement without, one has greatness and abundance.&quot;Karen's poetic pairing with #55&quot;&quot;IS ENOUGH&quot;&quot;birds sit on the tree -----outside my windowlike the last persimmons ----- of winter ----- beautiful fruit&quot;Quoting one poem (and one of the shortest at that) out of sixty-four is, of course, unfair to the book. After all, things taken out of context lose something that can be achieved only by putting them back into context. To do this one must read the entire book, including the Introduction. Read, contemplate, and meditate if you want the full impact."},{"Title":"Book of Changes","review":"Karen's poems has opened the door to more understanding of each I Ching hexagram for me. Each poem stands on its own and I often read them to my students. She gives powerful images and emotions to the meaning of each hexagram.

One of her poems will be in my upcoming book: I Ching For Teens (Fall 2001, Inner Traditons & Bear and Co.,). Her book could accompany any I Ching consultation.This book of poems shows that there are many ways to convey, read and translate the I Ching while still holding on to its message of hope, compassion, personal integrity and cosmic truth.Thank you Karen for adding to the meaning of the I Ching with your poetry..."},{"Title":"Book of Changes","review":"Karen Holden's poetry is a treasure of insight and courage.

Trouble soon finds them, but so too does a mysterious stranger.Up high in the surrounding dry hills there is another finely built cabin, built by the same long gone and mysterious man, a man who supposedly had stashed a big cache of gold before he was killed.In the nearby hills there is a band of killers who want that gold. Over on the Dry Side is a mystery as much as it is a western. Clues are found and the reader along with the characters in the book ...all are trying to figure out where the stash is, and what it is, as it may be gold, but may not be either. The story is told almost always through the eyes of the young boy, who is about 16. Up in the hills in the other hidden and deserted cabin he finds a little pot of flowers and realizes that a female, a girl probably, left those flowers. He starts to daydream about this girl, pictures her as young and beautiful, as well she does turn out to be. She however, isn't exactly as he has envisioned her to be...she's beautiful but not like he has \\"seen\\" her in his mind. As the book evolves, the boy becomes very jealous of the stranger, the man who turns out to be the brother of the original man who had built the cabins. The story is compelling at all points, the pages turn and you have to keep on reading. Told through the eyes of the young boy, the story has a fresh feel to it, and the reader gets to really care about him and what will happen. In all respects, one of L'Amour's finest books; a real pleasure to read. Do yourself a favor and check out On The Dry Side. I predict, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Over on the Dry Side","review":"I have noticed that Louis L'Amour books with certain characters often seem to stand out. It's as though he gave special attention to special characters. This book is no exception. One of the main characters is called Owen Chantry. He is somewhat mysterious, but the Chantry name is quite popular in L'Amour novels. This book was also unique as L'Amour gave us another character, Doby, a sixteen year old boy. Doby speaks in first person. We read his every thought and plan. We see how lonely he is living far from civilization. He dreamed about about a \\"golden haired girl.\\" We even hear his poor english skills throughout the book. L'Amour is a master at capturing \\"country talk.\\" Of course the book has the regular bad guys, killing and even treasure. But, this time it is quite different. Get this book and read it. It is short and easy to read, but interesting all the way through."},{"Title":"Over on the Dry Side","review":"First, let me say that I am a HUGE Louis Lamour fan. I have read his books extensively over the years (going back to the 1960's). I am very familiar with his writing style. I believe that this book was part of many unfinished manuscripts that were found after his death, and are now being published as finished works. The storyline is fine, the characters are there, but......there is not a consistent voice. Part of it is told in the first person voice of the young boy, and part of it is in 3rd person voice of the character Owen Chantry. I don't think that this is a literary technique being used, because these voice perspective shifts occur in the same chapter, in some cases. It doesn't flow well, and it doesn't feel right.There are many areas where there is just a raw, disjointed, unfinished feel. The boy's character is not developed and you are left with the feeling of \\"who's story is this, anyway? The boy, or Owen Chantry?\\" I have never encountered that in all of the Louis Lamour books and stories that I have read before. Louis Lamour's works always rang with truth and authenticity, because as he said, \\"he walked those hills and lands that he wrote about. He grew up with true stories of the frontier. His own grandfather was scalped.\\"Frankly, the story needs more work - which, I believe, was why the author did not publish it before his death - it just wasn't ready. This is still a rough draft; not the usual polished gem that Louis Lamour typically produced."},{"Title":"Over on the Dry Side","review":"Over on the Dry Side is vintage L'Amour. Set in the years after the Civil War, far out in western country that few European-Americans have ever seen, it is the story of Owen Chantry as he learns about the death of his brother Clive. Clive seems to have brought some sort of treasure up from the southwest, which was still a part of Mexico at the time. The bad guys killed Clive, and still seek the treasure, but in vain. The story is told partly through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Doby, who is alternately admiring and jealous of Chantry. As usual, L'Amour's ear for dialect is a joy, although the shifting of narration between that of Doby and a God's eye view of Chantry's activities may be a bit jarring."},{"Title":"Over on the Dry Side","review":"Yet another \\"new\\" Louis L'Amour novel that I only found out about thanks to Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Over on the Dry Side","review":"This book is a great one, the story does not take the turns that you'd expect.

Not only is it very well written, but it contains numerous anecdotes that, from a psychological standpoint, are nothing less than fascinating. Simply put, &quot;Life on the Color Line&quot; illustrates the absurdity of prejudice with greater profundity than any book I have ever read. Words that came out of the mouth of Gregory's own grandmother left me so stunned that I was numb for hours, and I am still shocked by it.Dr. Williams, you have written a masterpiece. Thank you, thank you, for telling your amazing story. Your childhood may have been unbelievably horrific, but it has left you a greater man by far."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had the unusual pleasure of hearing him speak at a public function when this book first came out. In fact, that's how I got my free copy. The story of this man's life is simply amazing. That came through in his honest and heart-felt reflection of the hardships he's had to overcome growing up. I've lived in San Francisco most of my life, attending public school with the normal cross section of the city's diverse ethnic crowd. I can say with a degree of certainty that I'm culturally aware of the African American experience. So it is with a bit of sadness that I regret not having met more people with Williams' ambition and determination when I was younger. To be fair, the circumstances in which his life unfolded would probably be hard to duplicate in this day and age, especially in San Francisco. But regardless, I truly believe young blacks of today, regardless of where they may live can draw inspiration from his story. We all still face a huge amount of inequality and injustice in our society today. With such polarization along political and religious lines in our national conscience as I'm writing this, it is critical to remember that race still matters. The other day, the biology department chair at my school presented a slide show of New Orleans where here Alma Mater was severely damaged by Katrina a year ago. She's a parasitologist with a Ph.D from Tulane University. The contrast between the French quarter/downtown and the poorer residential areas are striking. Those who've read Williams book would immediately draw parallels with the stark geographic division along racial lines of Muncie, Indiana - where Williams grew up. How many other cities in America are New Orleans waiting to happen? If something unthinkable should happen in Muncie today, how will the citizens of that city fare today? Will the impoverished blacks of Hunter's point/Bayview in my own city suffer the same fate as those of the lower 9th ward when the \\"Big One\\" strikes California? If more of my fellow black San Franciscans can aspire to be like Williams and strive to lift themselves and their community out of poverty and strife, we just might have a chance at doing better. One can hope."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the very best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. The amazing bonus is that it is also true and gives tremendous insight into being &quot;colored&quot; in America. I wish that all teenagers would read it. The insight it offers is invaluable. It has a lot of adult themes, but I am going to give it to my 15 year old to read this summer. After all, it all actually happened to a teenager. An interesting sidenote: I came across this book because several of my friends were students of Greg Williams when he was a law professor at Iowa. They loved him as a professor and a person."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, I thought Gregory did a great job describing his childhood and making the reader feel like they were there along with him. I'm sure some of this had to have been difficult to dig up and remember, though I'm sure some parts always stuck with him. It just goes to show you that you never can tell if someone is bi-racial or not. I'm really glad that he wrote this book, I know it's been out for at least 10 years now, but still.In the story he tells of his child hood, for first 10 years he grew up as a white boy, thinking his father was a dark Italian. Well his father was actually bi - racial, having a white father, and Black/Native American (his Great grandfather). - Mother When he and his younger brother go to live with their black kinfolk, they are treated just like any other black was in those times, even though they appeared to be white. I think the story is in a way about Gregory , growing up and learning to deal with the harshness of life, not just dealing with his black heritage but also his mother abandoning him, rejection of most of his white relatives once his grandfather passes away.I would recommend this to people at least 15"},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is masterfully put together. It's a memoir but it is also an excellent piece of literature. It may sometimes be very unpleasant but it is very real. I really liked it.As the author's father is on the train from Virginia with his ten and nine year old sons, the author Greg and Mike respectively, after his white wife fled his violent alcoholism with their two other children, heading for Muncie Indiana after his previously modestly profitable business enterprises, including a tavern, had collapsed, he informs them that he is not Italian as they had always assumed but half-black, the product of a wealthy white Kentucky man and his black maid.Their father, a dreadful alcoholic, eventually settles himself and his two sons with his mother in Muncie who is also an alcoholic, in her hideous shack which is a hang out for all sorts of neighborhood low life. The boys are eventually rescued by a widow of a prominent local hustler whom they call \\"Miss Dora\\" a fifty two year old black lady who is very poor but strongly motivated vis a vis the boys by religous conviction and she lets them live with her. She is well acquainted with their father.Their father Anthony or \\"Buster\\", is probably the most picturesque figure throughout the book. He seems to have been one of the greatest hustlers in the history of humanity. He spents alot of his time in the shack with his mother drinking and fighting with her. He spends the rest of the time working odd jobs dragging his sons along to help out, gambling, swindling rummage sale clerks, asking for favors and money from local politicians and policeman, bar hopping and visiting the local brothel as well as engaging in sex with any woman willing (his abilities in this area have a high local reputation). My favorite episode involving him is when heleaps up on the podium to kiss John F. Kennedy who was campaiging in Muncie in 1960 and waves to a cheering crowd.The author was clearly regarded in Muncie and under the circumstances was forced to call himself black which he did not shrink from but was forced to endure pretty abominable racism. He was an excellent student and a pretty good athlete but the only serious guidance he got from counsellors or teachers throughout his schooling were stern warnings after he was caught engaging in suspiscious behavior with a white girl in a secluded part of school. He was always very dilligent and polite and was particularly grateful to Miss Dora whose home shielded him and his brother somewhat from the vulgarity and violence of his father's life and to whom he gave all the income that he and his brother could muster from working odd jobs. But his father excersised a greater and greater alcohol-inspired tyranny over them as they got older though his wrath was directed the most at Greg.This book contains a very vivid portrayal of the violence and misery of life in 1950's America. Not exactly \\"Ozzie and Harriet.\\" The author portrays very well his teenage years where his environment at his junior high and high school both of which contained a mixture of black and white students was very racially volatile. Towards the end of high school, he ends up falling in love with a pretty white girl named Sara whom he he will marry in 1969 but not before alot of pain particularly from her side as she experiences the hostility and ostracism of her family and anyone else who finds out she is in love with a \\"Negro\\" and participating in civil rights activism. His youth was in many ways what one would expect in an environment full of dreadful poverty and apathy. On the other hand it was a pretty typical American male youth.The author is very far from reticient in dealing with matters involving sex. In his social circle sex or at least talking often about it was a big part of achieving one's maturity, though Greg always was far behind many of his friends particularly his closest friend Brian Settles. Though he did have quite some interesting experiences with a pretty young gal named Hattie including when he was fifteen in Miss Dora's living room engaging in intense carnal stimulation while Miss Dora, Hattie's mother and his grandmother were in the next room. He ran up excitedly to his room in the atic and carried down with him his pencil pouch from school and Hattie said.......There are alot of memorable or perhaps fascinatingly grotesque characters in this book. Like Fred Badders, a white man, twenty five years his grandmothers's junior but utterly hideous looking who shows up at his grandmother's house every time her social security check comes in and he allows her to use him sexually. Or his brother Mike who becomes involved with various gangsters and moves into a violent and very poor housing project in Chicago with one of his ladies and ends up sleeping with, among a good many women, a student teacher at his high school and two fourty year old women including \\"Bernice\\" and Mike at one point tells his brother about a time that he had his dad were lying in bed with her and......Oh boy, anyway I should rap this up. Mike eventually straigtened out though not before he lost his eyesight in a shooting.Anyway a remarkable achievement. The author, who is currently a professor of law, is able to tell his story in a very unpretensious and intelligent way. There is quite a few grotesque and shocking episodes in this book but they are molded into a story which is very real."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I learned about this book in an article in the Baton Rouge newspaper. LSU has assigned it as summer reading for many of their students and a group is working to get others in Baton Rouge to read it as well. At our church's partnership group with a local African-American church we decided to read it as a group project, and I'm glad we did. Williams' memoir tells the fascinating story of a young man who is born into the lower-middle class white world of suburban Virginia only to learn when he is about six years old that his father is the son of a mixed-race couple from Muncie, Indiana. Circumstances resulting from this news takes the boy, his father and his brother to Muncie where they live among their African-American (or colored as they were called in the 1950s) family. Billy's (or Greg) father Tony (or Buster) is an alcoholic, which makes life no less difficult as he's scorned by his white classmates and, with his white skin and Caucasian features, standing on shaky ground in his own colored community. A good-hearted woman named Dora raises the two boys as her own, as their birth mother spurns her now-black children. Dora's kindness and Greg's determination to do more than survive are inspiring."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a haunting portrayal of a young man's struggle to reach adulthood.

People's realities are so different and we can never really be able to feel what it is to walk in another's shoes. Mr. Williams, though, in this remarkable book, gives us the opportunity to experience some of what it is like to be someone other than yourself and to understand how your life can change, depending on how people perceive you. One reason this book touched me is that I have had a similar life experience and have lived too some of what Mr. Williams details in his book. He articulates it beautifully. I think this book should be requred reading for anyone hoping to bridge racial divides and begin to understand and really SEE each other. Thank you, Mr. Williams, for sharing your story."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Imagine waking up one day and finding everything different. Everyone's perception of you has changed. The social and economic conditions around you have changed because of your race. A child born and reared as white discovers he is not. The author shares his experiences honestly- almost too honestly. There is deprivation, and repression contrasted with privilege, opportunity, and comfort. It is an extraordinary account of a man of two worlds, two heritages, mixed-race, who perseveres and triumphs over incredible odds. Taut, dramatic, well written."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book should be required reading for students and teachers in high shcool and college.

This book represents the triumph of the human spirit over adversity."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was well written. I feel this way because the only way to tell the story was to write exactly the way it was lived. I believe anyone that goes through a childhood like the main character, Billy, did deserves the publicity for writing this book. In this book Billy gives in great detail how significant his family was throughout his life. His father, even though an alcoholic, had been a big part of Mike and his life. After the mother left, the father was left to care for the boys. Consequently, being left with their father Billy and Mike became problem children. An example of this is when they were kicked out of many schools for fighting and making a nuisense out of themselves. Until they grew up, they were unsure how to act because of being told they were black. Unfortunately, this added to the fact that their mother had left them. However, by the end of the book Mike and Billy learned how to be successful and how to tell the difference between right and wrong, in their own way. Anyone who reads this book might be thankful and appreciate their family a little more. I know it changed the way I look at my childhood and my family."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Many of us are met in life with challenges, which alter our views on life. These experiences often are minor, however, the ones that affect us most profoundly are those that force us to open our eyes to the real essence of humanity on a much broader scope than our individual existence. Such an experience is not felt unless a person endures a large degree of suffering, which is not easy to get through by a mere expression of emotion to another human being, but to reach out to the world to make some type of impact - as to add a drop of water to the ocean of humanity to cause a ripple effect that others can feel. In the book Life On The Color Line, an autobiography written by Gregory Howard Williams, the author adds his drop of water. He shares his experience of growing up white in the early 1950's only to find out he is black, and is able to communicate to readers what it is like to look white, in a racist society, and to have to endure poverty common place in the black community. One that the other side of the color line would not venture to look at. The situation he grew up in was enough for one to fail, and just goes to prove that human endurance can conquer many obstacles. If his experience is not a drop of water to touch another persons soul, then that person does not have one. I will pass this book on as another ripple in the ocean of humanity."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In the world of the 50s and 60s where the only meaningful value seems to have been that of \\"being white,\\" Mike and Gregory Williams, possessing all the outward characteristics of whiteness, nevertheless experienced the ultimate fall from grace: They found themselves on the wrong side of the racial divide and were thus forced (as their father put it) \\"to learn how to become Niggers.\\"Much to their surprise and horror, their father, a light skinned Negro \\"passing\\" as Italian, had survived most of his adulthood playing both sides of the race card as a way of life. He did so successfully until misfortune, divorced and alcohol overtook him and struck him back down into \\"his place\\" in the slums of Muncie, Indiana.In one ugly misstep by a scheming father, Mike and Greg Williams found overnight that their whiteness had been cancelled -- made null and void.After more than a decade of poverty, degradation and loneliness later, straddling the racial fence -- in which they were both ignored by the white side of their family -- and ultimately rescued by the humanity of a single, poor, Church going Black woman, named Miss Dora, Greg was able to overcome the handicap of his Nigger-hood and in the end attained his (and his father's) dream of becoming a lawyer.Mike on the other hand had no such luck. He succumbed to the build-in iniquities of the Black slums and was unable to break from the mold so carefully laid out for young ghetto men of his generation. After a life on the edge, he was blinded in a barroom brawl that was the signature of such environments. Today he remains without means or hope in the care of a state supported nursing home.There are many deeply touching morality tales in this book, but an inescapable one is not its most flattering one: It is that in a racist society nothing is more meaningful or valuable than \\"being white.\\" Whatever you do in life, do not become a Nigger; and if by an accident of fate you should become one, then you should do whatever you can WITHIN THE RULES OF RACISM to OVERCOME it.That is to say, don't try to eliminate the cause of this moral discontinuity, racism, or change its immoral and corrupt rules and imperatives, just try as best you can to overcome it. After all, overcoming Nigger-hood is a goal worthy of pursuit; while ending racism is not even one that is attainable.No one wants a world where \\"being white\\" ceases to be America's highest value, anyway, does one? Think about it. Would that not mean a world reduced to the least common denominator of human existence? Would not such a world define us all downward so that we would all represent a lesser form of humanity? Would that not in short make us all niggers? Is that the kind of world we really want? Better to leave racism in place so that whiteness is a viable goal for everyone to attain.Another morality tale of this book is that no matter how inhumane and corrupt white values are, they nevertheless remain okay because they are after all the standard and norm of society and there is just nothing one can do about them. They remain inviolable. If you are white, being a racist is okay because racism is society's norm. White humanity is always better than black humanity because it is self-defined in that way. However, if history teaches us anything, it teaches us that immorality and corruption no matter how normal, feeds on itself. The chicken will eventually come home to roost.Yes, in principle we can be thankful for the Miss Doras of this society, but in practice she is just a fluke, a freak in an otherwise wholly immoral but at the same time a very orderly society. After all it is particular kind of order, not morality that America demands of itself.In a curious and backhand way, Miss Dora is America's Mother Theresa, she will forever be an unsung heroine. But just as there are no penalties for grandparents who forsake their grandchildren because of their father's Negro-ness, there are also no rewards for the Miss Dora's of American society. No matter how self-affirming the book is, it will not let you forget that in America, it is the side of the tracks you end up on that defines who you are; your morality; how far you can go in life; and in the end even the level of your humanity.This is a classic on the same level as John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me. It will make you think and that is what all good books do. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Reaching goals and obtaining them when you get there can be very hard. It is one thing to say you're going to accomplish your dreams, but to do it is another thing also. Gregory had used hard times in his life growing up, as willpower in acheiving his goal as a lawyer. I felt that it goes to show that you don't have to let hard times stop you from reaching your dreams. From reading and getting a better understanding of the book I've learned the value of hard work and dedication. Gregory used all his extra hours of life, studying,and reading to keep his mind refreshed with new thoughts. He was also forced to become a man before his time which had made him become more responsible. This responsibilty was also put forth his education. I really recommend this book for anyone.

Though faced with constant obstacles, Williams is able to finally acheive his dreams in this uplifting biography."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a heartfelt book, which helped me to understand how the American obsession with race perverts the characters of both so-called black and so-called white people. It tells us that these terms do not mean much, either. According to social scientists, 80% of black Americans have white ancestors, and 20% of white Americans have black ancestors. This book shows us how this happens. Gregory Howard Williams lets us feel the cynicism and rage of blacks in the 1950s and 1960s,long before whites became aware of it. It also is a stark description of the unfeeling, harsh behavior by both young and old, toward blacks of all ages.

And what would be your reaction? This story is also a coming of age story. As much of a drunk as his father was, he still managed to inspire Greg to be his best. Greg endured a lot of racial tension from both sides of the line, but ultimately it was the African American side that pulled him in and supported him.I just finished Cacausia by Danzy Senna.

A story is often told better through the eyes of those who have lived it, and that remains true with &quot;Life on the Color Line&quot;. Gregory Howard Williams should continue to write as he has a gift for character development and a flow to his writing that keeps you enraptured throughout.This is a fascinating tale of two young boys who truly lived on the color line. An unusual perspective, they can tell the joys and sorrows of living both a privileged white life and a persecuted black life. I hope to see more work from Mr. Williams. I was only disappointed in the end, when he stopped his enthralling story in his mid-college years and spent the last 3 pages wrapping up the rest of his life. With his gift for writing, I'm certain he could have written a sequel about the succeeding 30 years of his life with just as much fine detail, thoughtful emotion and keen insight as the first 20 years.

I purchased this book more than 10 years ago, and I still love it. I treat it like gold and diamonds, because it changed my life. When I first read this book, I was going through the worst pain of my life. I picked up this book, because of my own family dynamics. Most African American families have one or 2 members that look like someone of another race. My family is no exception. After I started to read this book, it moved me unlike anything ever had. When I finished reading this book, I was so drained emotionally, because it brought out some very intense emotions. I was so moved by the author's story that I had to contact him, so I could let him know what his book meant to me. I located his faculty email address via the internet, and I wrote him a very lengthy email; it was very heartfelt. I didn't expect for him to respond, but the very next day, I recieved an email from both him and his wife. All I'll say about that email is that it changed my life; I still have it to this day. Before I read his book and recieved an email reply, I was angry with the world, which included my family. Almost instantly, I release my anger, and I set out to change my life. I've published five photography books, and I'm working on a sixth. Also, I'm currently working on a MS Excel text book. None of this would have been possible, if it had not been for Gregory's book. This alone tells you the impact that his books has had on me."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, not many are able to recount their childhood experiences from a perspective similar to Williams'.

Even after all his father put Greg and his brother through, they still loved him because he was all they had and he was their father. The children's love for their mother never vanished, even after her 10 year absence. I loved this book because it shows that faith will allow you to make it through. Greg Williams could have chosen a variety of life paths but he always kept his goals in mind and in the end that was all that mattered."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a true story of a boy who became a man in the worse of circumstances. Gregs father was intelligent and charming but also an alcoholic who beat his wife. When living in Virgina his father was a successful, if not somewhat shady business man. When his mother could no longer endure the beatings and abuse, she fled taking the younger two children with her. Leaving the other two Greg and his brother Mike to be raised by their father James. Gregs mother was white and even though her family tolerated the presence of her children there were references to their heritage. When Greg's fathers (James) business failed due to his alcoholism, the family moved to Indiana where Greg first learned that his father was not Italian but instead half black. James dumped the two boys on a relative who although she tried to help was unable to support the boys. They were then sent to live with their paternal grandmother..who was also an alcoholic. The boys were forced to sleep! ! on a small cot next to the toilet, kept awake all hours by the drinking and gambling that was a constant presence in his grandmothers home. The major concern in the household was if they would have enough money to get drunk, never worrying that the boys hadn't eaten. At this point in using the modern term of dysfunctional family, would be considered kind in describing the kind of family /upbringing that Greg was forced to endure. Greg and his brother were taken in by a lady who was completely unrelated and not financially able to completely provide for them but willing to sacrifice everything she had for them. This is what I find so touching in the book and in real life as I know...amoung the &quot;black&quot; community, this is not an unusual thing. From the time that Greg and his brother moved to Indiana, they struggled not only in day to day survival for the bare necessities..but in trying to learn where they fit in. This is what I find so heartbreaking. I thi! ! nk that this book needs to be required reading...not in col! lege but in 6 or 7th grade. It teaches so many good things. The friendship that he found with Brian who accepted him for who he was, not the color of his skin. This is a lesson sorely needed in today's society. It also teaches that education and hard work is the way out of the getto, not drugs...again a lesson needing to be taught to todays children. It is easy to hate Gregs father for the abuse and alcoholism or his mother for abandoning him...but as Greg had to deal with all these issues...the one thing that he could not forget was that for whatever else they were...they are his parents...and every child longs for their parents approval and love and even in the end..when Greg stood up to his father and was angry with his father..he never forgot that this is his father. There were so many issues brought out in this book but I think the ones I would want my daughter to learn by reading it is: You can go anywhere you want if you work hard at it and decide that is what yo! ! u are going to do; Not to settle for what others decide your worthy of...make your own choices and then fight with every fiber of your being for those choices. The profanity and sexual situations in this book I know would be considered by some to be too vulgar for young readers...but what they need to think about is that, kids hear alot worse in school or on the playground, in their music and on t.v.. Those lessons that Gregs father pounded into him were to not get caught up in sex/alcohol/drugs...because it would make achieving his dreams that much more difficult if not impossible."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Book: Life on the Color Line (285 pages)Author: Gregory Howard WilliamsRating: 4 out of 5 starsPublisher: Plume PublishingFew books on the market can both tear at your heartstrings and rebuild them at the same time. I read Life of the Color Line as a sophomore college student at Cal State Channel Islands and felt that Gregory Williams' story will do to that to a reader. In his autobiography, Williams recounts the unspeakable circumstances he survived as a half black, half white young boy caught in the turmoil of racism in the 1950s. Williams was abandoned by the very mother whose responsibility was to comfort and protect him and was abused by a Father who could not defeat his own dependence on alcohol. He spent his life searching for acceptance in a cultural community which he fortunately found in a caregiver named Dora. She was the first person in his life that treated Williams with dignity and generosity. Life on the Color Line contains foul language, derogative terms, and topics such as rape and traumatic issues of abuse, which probably makes it inappropriate reading for those below the age of 14. An important strategy to use while reading this book for those that are easily offended by racism and neglect, is to read sections over a time horizon rather than in just one sitting. I found this to be crucial while engaging Life on the Color Line because at times, the disgusting discrimination against the Black race was emotionally overwhelming. It was sometimes too much to handle. Gregory Williams completes an impeccable and heart wrenching novel that will have you shaking your finger at humanity for unjustified racism and turning to yourself to reconsider how you judge races other than your own."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Before I began reading Life on the Color Line, I became absorbed and curious as to what it was going to be about. Of course, my immediate theory was that this was just another book written about the horrible mistreatment of African Americans throughout history. Even though my first thought was that this was just another one of those books, I was still very intrigued to read the book. I knew that the story would most likely be tragic and sad, but I had no idea what I was about to read.The main event that occurred throughout this story was how the author, Gregory Howard Williams, life took a huge turn while he was only ten years old. Referred to throughout the story as Billy, his brother and him were left abandoned by his mother, and his father was a raging alcoholic. It wasn't until after his parents left his, and his brother's lives, that he learned he was not an all white child. Billy learned that he was half black. His life before that fell way into his memory quickly because his life as a privileged white child unfolded into a life of a black boy stricken with poverty.This book caused me to advance my knowledge in our country's harsh past, but to also connect more emotionally with it. We watch movies in school and learn about slavery but it never really directly hit us. This story was not just the usual narrative description; it was personal. It leads the reader to share aspects of an actual person's life. Every moment he experienced and every thought that crossed his mind he wrote in this wonderful story in an effort to connect with an audience. I am not a huge reader, but this is definitely a book I would recommend to others as well as a story I would read at the very least once a year. This is a book that truly takes your breath away while reading it."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What can I say...this book is written with so much feeling that it's felt so strongly while reading. I can imagine the heartache that these two innocent young men went through while growing up. My grandmother often said \\"if God put you in it, he will bring you through it\\" and he did as promised for these two young men. This book should be required reading for all school age kids. Its about race, but in the end its about survival..I would one day love to meet the writer...Opry, should have him and his brother on her show to speak about surviving the color line.

As falling through the cracks of the system and emulating a tough environment rules our inner cities, this book is the story of a person who hung on to the edge of this proverbial crack in the system. The ingenious way this Author's autobiography clearly illustrates and humanizes these issues in this near perfect book throws the soapbox in the gutter, putting responsibility were it has to be, with the individual. A story of strength, survival, and humanity; so go ahead and nourish your mind with this visionary book and maybe you to will become a little color blind, for both directions that is."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an intriguing memoir that allows the reader to see what life was like for the author whose early life was defined by issues of race and color. The author had spent his early years in Virginia, where his white mother and his dark-skinned \\"Italian\\" father operated a roadside tavern. Growing up in the South, where issues of race and color were so important, the author had always thought that he was white, as he had been raised as such. When his parents' business, as well as their marriage, collapsed, his mother left them, forcing his father to return home to his roots in Muncie, Indiana. Abandoned by their mother, it was there that the author and his younger brother, Mike, were to discover which side of the then great color divide he and his brother were on. The lesson would be a difficult one.In Muncie, Indiana, they were to discover that their father, rather than being Italian, was bi-racial, born of the union of a Black woman and a White father. In those times, however, you were considered to be either White or Black. So in Indiana, he was Black, even though, ironically, in the South he had passed for White. Now, his children, Greg and Mike, were to learn that, notwithstanding their appearance, they were considered to be Black, and forced to live in a segregated world on the wrong side of the race and color divide. They quickly learned what it was to be considered second class citizens. This was the nineteen fifties, during the heyday of the Klu Klux Klan, and well before the Civil Rights Movement had taken hold, so feelings ran very high on issues of race and color.Looking as if they were White but considered to be Black, the boys found themselves in a limbo of sorts, rejected by both Whites and Blacks. They had to learn how to maneuver in this crazy patchwork quilt of absurd and confusing racial notions that would marginalize their existence and make them the target for every miscreant on either side of the race and color divide. This was to have great impact on the brothers, as they each found their own personal coping mechanism for the deprivation, poverty, hostility and prejudice that circumscribed their life in Indiana. Unfortunately, they ultimately each took divergent paths. The author would seek legitimate work and higher education as a way to forge ahead in life, while Mike would seek solace in the lure of easy money, easy women, and life in the fast lane, a choice that would end in personal tragedy for him.The book clearly delineates the fact that, in the nineteen fifties, there were two Americas that existed side by side. One America was born of privilege and opportunity reserved for Whites. The other America was one of repression and lack of opportunity reserved for Blacks. Clearly, those who were defined as Black but wished to pass for White did not do so because of racial hatred. They did so as a way of bypassing a hated system that could so circumscribe someone's potential and ability to seek a better way of life. Who is White? Who is Black? These are questions that should generally be unnecessary. The response should be, \\"Who cares?\\".The author focuses on his early life, the part that evidently caused him so much pain, while skimming on the latter part of his life. It would have been interesting to have spent some additional time on the latter part, to see how those early experiences affected or shaped the man he was to become and is today. Still, this is an intriguing memoir that is written by someone who has lived in these two Americas and endured. It is a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Gregory Howard Williams is a man who faced up to his father's past. A white boy who was found out he was really Black. This book is about &quot;passing&quot; and the legacy it leaves behind.

He experienced several difficulties throughout his life because of this. Gregory Williams was forced to choose between black and white friends. Gregory's father was in the picture but never really set any good examples and his mother left him at a young age. Growing up with someone else being the mother figure in his life was very difficult for him. Miss Dora treated him and his brother as though they were her own flesh and blood. Even with all the bad experiences and wrong decision making, in the end Gregory completed the novel with a very successful life. He became married, had two children of his own and had a degree in law. I did not give the book 5 stars because throughout the book it talked about his brother's life as well as his. Towards the end of the book, they never spoke on how he became blind in very much detail or how his life ended like they talked about with Gregory."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book has been reviewed and previewed extensively, so I won't go into it further. I read this book twice - both times, aching for the shock GHW and his brother suffered and the struggle to adjust and find a corner of the world for themselves. My one arguement, however, is that the author damns the town for its' treatment of them. I always kept in mind the time frame and the reaction could have happened in any other town in the country - such was the prevailing attitude, in general, in the late 50's and early 60's. In an email to the author, after one or two had passed, I asked him if possibly he had damned a whole town as a racist, when it is entirely possible that he and his brother would have faced the same problems elsewhere. There was no response. I do live in Muncie and I have lived all over the country as well - it is not a perfect town. Racism exists - everywhere and on all sides. I am sorry for the life he and his brother had to endure in their boyhood years - he overcame more than I could handle, I think. That said, I don't believe the man was fair in how he views the time and events as pertains to the town...he could have been anywhere and this would have happened. It is an indictment of the era, not specific to just one place. I found that aspect to be flawed in his writing."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read &quot;Living on the Color Line&quot; for a school assignment, because the other book looked unappealing. As I started reading &quot;Living on the Color Line&quot; though, I feared I had made a mistake. While this book has its entertaining moments, it moves along slowly. It's the story of Greg, and how when he was 9 his parents divorce forced him to learn of and rely on his father's side of the family. A family that turned out to be black, when Greg had always been told that his father was Italian. This book shares a heart breaking story, and shows that if you work hard enough and never give up, you can get where you want to go. I did, however, find the last 100 pages of the book much better than those leading up to it. The first part of the book was quite repetitive, and towards the end, he started branching out. There are several big moments in the book, but the one that stands out in my mind is when Greg and his younger brother Mike come face to face with their mother, 10 years after she left their father and hadn't seen them since. But no matter what the hardship was, Greg always pulled through, and put what really mattered first.

The book deals with Gregory Howard Williams, who until he was 10 years, believed that he was white, but he later learned that he was actually black. There are some sections of the book that appeal to me while there are some that don't. To begin with, I am not very thrilled with the use of foul language. Growing up I wasn't around people that spoke so much foul language, and at moments I was appalled. After I read this book, I learned what his point of using this foul language throughout the book was. It shows the environment where he was growing up. His father is abusive towards his mother and the children are exposed to violence, abusive behavior as well as racism. On the other hand, there was a positive influence that I got from the book and this is the relationship Billy had with his brother Mike. I often felt that they had such a closeness between them. One would always look out for the other one, and they would always help each other out. After reading this book, there was also a negative aspect to this book; it was the drinking of Tony Williams that slowly, after time, affected him and his children. When I say it affected him and his children, I mean, that he was almost about to die at different points in the book. One time it was a bar fight which was right in front of his kids' eyes. He did however always want good for his children. In his mind, if they were in trouble he would go and rescue them. Whenever the Dad would tell the kids to get a job, he would take up the money himself and not share it. From reading this book I got the impression that Billy was hardworking throughout his whole education. He would have to tell his brother to focus on his education because his life would continue to decline. I feel that Mary, the mother, did the right thing by leaving his husband since he was the one that was so abusive towards her. I felt that Tony should not have dumped the kids in Muncie and should have taken responsibility for his own children and since it his duty to raise them right. From reading this book I got a positive influence and that he actually does care for his children because he really did try to show up for Billy's high school graduation. A positive thing that I got from Tony's character is when he said that he should be put in jail so that his drinking would decrease. This is an example of someone who is trying to change himself into a good man. On the whole, I feel that I actually enjoyed reading Gregory's Howard Williams autobiography because I have learned much about what it feels like to have a double identity and what type of sturggles come with that. While they are some flaws in the book, the positive points clearly outweigh the negatives making Life On The Color Line a great book to read."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Look, I have a great deal of sympathy and a great deal of admiration for any individual that overcomes adversity, but let's be real here. Mr Willliams is white. Race is a phenotypic state. Period. Everywhere Mr Williams goes he is regarded as white because he is. African ancestry is not a taint. If it was, many an Arab or Latino person claiming to be white would be one-dropped right out of the category. We don't do that to any mixed white from any other nation,only to Americans. A study done in 1958, by the federal government found that, conservatively, twenty percent of the American &quot;white&quot; population had a black ancestor within four generations. This is nothing new. In order to be white in America they just had to deny they ever had a black ancestor. One cannot &quot;pass&quot; for something one IS. Mr Williams, unfortunately, had an alcoholic, abusive father who attempted to wreck his life. He is not black because being black is merely a perception of phenotype and he doesn't have it.

His life and experiences were so unique that there couldn't have been a more appropriate title than \\"Life on the Color Line.\\" The blatant racism he encounters all through his childhood and teenage years while trying to just grow-up and be a normal kid is something that American should be ashamed of when remembering this time in our history. Anyone that thinks racism wasn't THAT bad back then should read this book, reading about his perspective should definitely change their mind.Greg started growing up as a young white boy in Virginia. His life was pretty normal for him and his \\"white\\" family at that time. His father successfully passed as white, even though he had black blood running through his veins. He had a couple of successful business ventures, the most notable of which was a booming cafe/diner, which of course adherred to the laws of segregation. Greg's mother was white in the true sense of the term, and she seemed to care for her children deeply as any mother should.Everything was perfect for Greg and his family until misfortune hits and the veil is pulled off the charade of his father's false life. In a poetic justice type of moment the father's life in Virginia is devastated and shaken literally back to his roots. It looks initially like Greg and his brother Mike will stay with their mother in Virginia, but they have to tag along with their father back to Indiana where all 3 of their lives are changed forever.Back in Muncie, Indiana, the book almost splits into 3 separate interesting stories: Greg's life, his brother Mike's life, and the father's. Their struggles bring a new meaning to tough times. Greg and his brother now have to blend into the black community which isn't easy, all while they are summarily rejected by the white community, and most painful of all an apparent rejection by their mother.There are a lot of negatives in their lives now dealing with their living situation, and ... people which are almost laughable. One situation that stands out are the two school officals that get upset at his expressing any interest in white girls, but then the same people are angry when he is marching with a black girl during graduation. However, through all the negativity there is one person that shows how powerful Christian love can be as she adopts them and tries to keep them on the right path.Greg and Mike's experiences and ongoing fight with racism hardly let you put the book down.

Becoming a basketball legend changed that to some degree. Geezzzzz! I was even disowned by a female cousin of mine because I danced with a black girl at a 7th grade record hop back when it was acceptable for girls to dance with other girls! The girl remained a friend of mine throughout our school days (for Greg's knowledge, this was Sylvia M.). Moreover, I worked (in H.S.) with the mother of the white girl he eventually married.

While the classification of race more often than not is strictly arbitrary, its consequences for an individual life are far from that. Williams looks &quot;white,&quot; but his father is a light-skinned black who had fostered the lie that he is of Italian descent. All this changes when a turn of bad luck dashes his business ventures and marriage to pieces. Sensing that he cannot take care of his sons alone, &quot;Buster&quot; takes them to live with extended family relatives in Muncie. There, Greg and his brother do not merely discover the truth, they experience how the truth can turn a world of white priviledge inside out -- and hurt like hell. The boys are constantly made painfully aware of the consequences of race, as they find challenges in coping with scorn from both sides of the racial divide. Greg goes on to overcome the obstacles, and one must admire his sheer force of will. Mike, his younger brother, lives an altogether different story, succumbing to one temptation after another. In all of this, the awareness of race sears their minds like a hot poker. At the conclusion of this book, one really does attain a deeper appreciation for the nonsensical underpinnings of America's preoccupation with race. This is personal biography that goes beyond self-indulgence, exploring a wider social landscape that we all take part in and take responsibililty for. Insightful storytelling of the highest order -- highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life on the Color Line should be required reading for every American, especially anyone who wants to put their life's problems in perspective.This is the most moving book I have read in a long time and I read a lot! William's account of his childhood truly woke me up to how fortunate I am to have the life I have, despite losing my mother at age 20. No one should have to endure the painful struggles of racism, poverty, rejection, parental neglect and abandonment that Williams did, as well as a dysfunctional family to top it off. Whether Williams dated black girls or white ones, he was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.Life on the Color Line contains many harrowing scenes. One that stood out for me was when William's white maternal grandmother refuses to pass along her daughter's messages to her children after she has left the family. She calls her own grandchildren \\"niggers\\" and refuses to let them live with her in a nice section of Muncie only a few minutes away from the black ghetto where they reside with a family friend Miss Dora.One question that remains unanswered after reading this book is why William's mother only took her younger children with her when she left her husband. Why did she leave Gregory and Mike with their alcoholic father? It doesn't make sense that she would take some of her children to safety with her, but not all of them. The only explanation I can come up with is that Greg's mother figured her older boys were mature enough to fend for themselves. Towards the end of the book, their mother's inability to understand what kind of life she left her boys to leave left me wanting to throw rocks at her and give that woman a good beating.I am in awe of the author's maturity, courage, and sheer will power that enabled him to overcome all these obstacles. His experiences put my own life in perspective.I borrowed this book from the library, and now that I've reached the last page, I will definitely be buying it on Amazon!"},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I came to read this book as an assignment in preparation for my oral exams in defense of the PhD in English from The Ohio State University. Initially, I resisted reading the book thinking it was &quot;just another story of a White person trying to make some money off a trend involving Black people. However, when I finally sat down to read the book, I found Gregory Williams' story so compelling that I could not put it down until I had read every word two days later. When Dean Williams first arrived at OSU as the Law School Dean, scholars fervently debated the finer points of his book and students flocked to hear him speak. After having actually read the text, I can understand why they were drawn to this man. He describes in heart-wrenching details the privations he and his brother endured when they were forced to remove themselves from the life of White privilege in Virginia to one where survival in Muncie, Indiana meant learning quickly the cold hard facts of being Black in skin that appeared to be White. The family friend who took Gregory and his brother into her home is the only character who stands out as more memorable than the boys' alcoholic paternal grandmother. No reader could sit dry-eyed through a reading of this book where two innocent children were scorned and battered by relatives, peers, and strangers alike. Gregory Williams is to be admired for withstanding the agony of his unusual upbringing and the marvelous outcome as he now holds a superlative position in one of the nation's most prestigious universities that prides itself on the number of minority doctorates it produces. My only puzzlement following the reading of the book and viewing the family Dean Williams built, is that he seems to have ended up with a very &quot;White-looking&quot; family and so he seems to perpetuate the same image of self-hate that he describes his father as producing. However, Williams is truly to be commended for his superb handling of a &quot;race&quot; issue that confronts a society which declares that there is no biological basis in race---all Blacks are not always all Black (F. James Davis) and more multi-racial writers and scholars need to step forward and be recognized."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am a 19 year old college student. I picked this book up not knowing what to expect. This book took me to a place that I could not imagine anyone ever having to go. Imagine living a happy life with all of the privileges of being white. Imagine your life taking an unexpected twist and all that you ever knew is gone, including your identity. This is the life of Gregory and Mike Williams.Greogory and Mike were two white kids with not a worry in life until their alcoholic father beat their mother one time too many. She left the kids with their father and fled scared for her life. After their father's business diminished, they had to move to Munchie, Indiana and learn the horrid truth of their lives, they were now known as &quot;colored&quot; in white skin.The father that they had been led to belive was Italian, was really a black man that crossed over trying to make a better life for himself and his children. I wanted to cry as the boys went through trials and tribulations no child should have to suffer. They didn't have a mother or father to rely upon, their &quot;white&quot; family disowned them, and they had to fend for themselves just to have something to eat. I cried in many place because I couldn't imagine living a life like this and surviving.I commend Mr. Williams for this masterpiece and letting us in on his life. I will not take any of the things I had for granted after reading this masterpiece of an autobiography. Thank you Mr. Williams for making me appreciate my life."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was a graduate student at Ball State University, and this book was a required reading for a course I was taking. For someone that did not grow up in Muncie, IN this book provided a solid perspective of the history of this area. What's even better is that I have been able to recommend it to friends and family on the East Coast that had virtually no knowledge of Muncie, IN--a city that was once part of the historical &quot;Middletown&quot; study. Gregory Williams provided a powerful account of the racial intolerance he faced and his struggle for an identity during his childhood years. The evolution of his relationship with his father is one you will want to follow to the end. Not only was his narrative a compelling one, but his style of writing kept me captivated throughout. There were few books that were required reading for me in college that I truly enjoyed, and felt had significant meaning. Whether you read it for class or pleasure, you will be amazed by the story of Gregory Williams. At the conclusion of this true story you will honestly want to know more!!"},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life On the Color Line is a very powerful book. It shows the struggle Gregory Williams had to encounter being black but looking white. First part of his life he believed he was white. It wasn't until his mother abandoned him and his father lost the family business that he and his little brother, Mike, found out they were black. They moved to Muncie, Indiana. Greg's father was an alcoholic and could not care for the boys properly. So a kindhearted woman, Miss Dora took them in. Between holding down a job to get by and trying to guide Mike in the right direction,(who had made a turn for the worst) Gregory must also overcome the stuggle of racism to gain his education. Thoughout this book Gerg is descriptive of how life was growing up colored and looking white. In the last chapter I think he was to general and quick on how he finished the book. For me he left to many unanswered questions. I feels like the story is not finished. But all-and-all I really liked the book and would recommend for everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Very interesting book about a mixed race child growing up in a very segregated America. He struggles with his identity and where he actually belongs. I liked the story and it was well written."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life on the Color Line is an inspirational account of an extraordinary life. I was drawn to the book when I learned my neighbor Sonny Sage, an outstanding quarterback for Richmond High School in Indiana, was mentioned in the story. Little did I know that I was about to read one of the best books of my life. The author details his journey from the most meager of beginnings in a manner that has all the drama of a novel; he possesses that essential tool of any successful lawyer---a memory that includes details of conversations, scenes and situations. His utter surprise when his father tells him that he and his brother are black; his gritty poverty; his refusal to give up or give in; his will to succeed; his love of his family despite their many flaws; his love of those who raised him and his recounting of their many selfless acts---gripping scenes that will move most readers from tears to joy. I recommend this story of an heroic individual to any reader who desires to experience a detailed and motivational review of one man who had every reason to fail, but decided instead to succeed beyond all expectations. This book should be required reading for today's teenagers; it will direct young readers toward success regardless of circumstance."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I did not want this story to end; afterwards I was greedy to find out more about Gregory, his lifw and his family.

Are you listening...then read this book!!"},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I will forever treasure this book as so very few books stop me in my tracks and force me to take a step back. Prior to reading Life on the Color Line I thought it was impossible for anyone, particularly a white person, to understand the black experience if they were not black. Sympathize certainly, and empathize maybe, but actually know it... no way. Greg Williams is the first man who proved me wrong in this thought.This is a dynamic memoir. Each time I look at Greg's smiling face on the cover reduces me to tears. Makes me think, what if there were no people in the world like his father, and mother, and Miss Dora, and the many people of Muncie... would there be a drive to help others? Would it alter they way we compete? Extolling another demographic of social intolerance intrinsic to the individual and collective human need to feel worthy... be superior? Would it ever lead a man such as Mr. Williams to bring his experiences to positions of influence that inspire us to take that step back to see further from a deeper scope?Outside of appreciating the tremendously uplifting premise, I laughed the hardest about the rooster and that dang Buster kissing President Kennedy! Just as I did, Greg found a way to find humor in some of his father's embarrassments, which otherwise may have left him powerless to become the man he became. The greatest penchants however, were the numerous lessons he took from his father, and Miss Dora. There just aren't enough words to express what a spiritually grounded woman Miss Dora was. So much is contained in this book. No word is wasted. Every page rocks with raw emotion. Life on the Color Line is an absolute inspirational must read."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I 1st read this book when I was 15 (when it was 1st released).

The book wasn't the typical tale of passing that involves a slave trying to pass in-order make it to freedom.

It lays bare the underbelly of American experience by shining a bright light on discrimination, segregation, the failure of the social systems and the consequences of alcoholism, as well as physical and emotional abuse on children. While the author's situation is understandably frightful while he was a young child, this is nevertheless no maudlin tale. It is recounted sincerely and without the unnecessary pulling of heartstrings. The reader's empathic response needs no teasing out when presented with the straightforward portrayal of the author's upbringing. The fact that this story unravels in Muncie, Indiana, rather than somewhere in the South might come as a surprise to those who believe that the black/white race issue is mostly a regional problem.This author was able to rise above his difficult childhood, attend college, attend law school and eventually become the Dean of a law school. I have heard him speak in person and to hear him tell some of these same stories in his own voice is downright chilling. Riveting, gripping, and intensely human.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"GOT TO MAKE THIS A SHORT REVIEW.

It is a book that everyone should read - no matter his or her age or background. Gregory Howard Williams writes a riveting story of his childhood experience, when society sees him as a White, then black person.The personalities in this memoir are touching, from Williams's father who was unable to deal with demons of his own, to the author and the rest of his family. Most especially, I loved reading about Miss Dora, the elderly woman who opened her heart and home to the author and his brother and played an important part in helping Mr. Williams become successful despite all the odds against him.Gregory Howard Williams has led a harsh, mesmerizing, sorrowful, incredible, yet triumphant life on the color line.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"Life On The Color Line (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life on the Color Line by Gregory Howard Williams is an amazing story of the author's racial transformation from being white to black as a young boy in the 1950s. The story touches on many issues and life changes affecting Gregory. Not only is the reader introduced to problems dealing with racial barriers, but also abuse, abandonment, and alcoholism. As Gregory matures through the book he faces a multitude of obstacles, but his ability to perservere captures the reader's heart making you want to continue reading and hoping for the best. Williams did a wonderful job writing this book. His description of the surroundings, characters, and racist acts done towards his family makes the reader fully understand what his life was like on the &quot;color line&quot;. There are parts that will make you want to scream out of disgust towards the characters and their actions and there are times when you will smile with happiness as someone does a kind act.

It is very well written, with many great adjectives. The Author makes it seem as though the reader is actually the character in the story (who was Gregory Howard Williams). The book was a great insight into the racial happenings in the nineteen hundreds. I thought it was very sad because the two kids (Gregory, and his brother, Michael) were not welcome in either the black community or the white community. I also found it very uplifting that Gregory could bring himself out of the slums, and make his life by studying and believing in himself. The contrast of him was his brother, Mike. Mike would get into lots of trouble, and his father wouldn't care because he didn't believe in Mike, but he would believe in Gregory. The father would take Mike to the Whorehouses and bars, while Gregory would study. It ended up that Mike would go blind from a gunshot.

I was attracted to it because of the supernatural angle, but the author does a much better job with the more naturalistic details. There are strange happenings in a small Maine town one summer, and what the book does well for most of its length is build up a nicely ambigious view on these occurrences: are there &quot;ghosts&quot; haunting the women of this town, or is sexual and social malaise affecting everyone? The narrator is a skeptic who grows to want to believe, and the trouble comes at the climax, which is presented as wholly supernatural. The Reader's Guide at the end brings up the idea of the unreliable narrator, but if that is supposed to be a possible &quot;solution&quot; to the book's central predicament, it's prepared for very poorly. In fact, given the careful writing earlier, the climactic chapters are almost laughable in their &quot;Exorcist&quot;-like tone. The language throughout is lovely, but the plot ultimately disappoints."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"The Incubus is an example of what happens when a person who's never read horror tries to write horror. The only horror novel Ann Arensberg admits reading is Dracula, which is about as scary as a rerun of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. It shows. The Incubus doesn't work as a horror novel because Arensberg ignores the rules of the genre. Passive characters; lack of suspense and mounting tension; a garbled, confusing climax (what happened?); worst of all, an unsatisfying ending. What were the creatures that invaded Dry Falls? What attracted them? Why did they leave? We never find out, and that's a major let-down. Why does the author think we've read 300+ pages? People who call The Incubus a classic horror story probably don't like horror, and thus haven't read much in that genre. This is really literary fiction, disguised. It's not Ann Arensberg's fault the book is being marketed as a horror novel. If you read literary fiction, give The Incubus a try. If you read horror, save your money."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I read several recommendations on this book and it sounded like a good read. However, I found the pace way too slow and filled with uninteresting and unnecessary fillers. The supernatural aspect of the book didn't really fit with the small-town feeling I got from it in the beginning. I enjoyed the first half but found the last half dull and unbelievable within the context of the story. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"This book has ambitions to surpass its genre, like &quot;The Sparrow,&quot; (which is another work of speculative fiction by a female author I would highly recommend to anyone also disappointed in this book). And the author writes evocative prose, knows her small-town Maine setting, and draws the literate reader into her spell from the early pages. Unfortunately, the core story is simply undeveloped, the central characters (Rev. Lieber and his wife Cora, our narrator) are curiously underdeveloped compared to lesser players in this story, and the climax of the book just does not work.It is possible that our author was going for a veiled message of sexual politics, a kind of Stepford Wives of the millenium, and if so she's failed at this, too.Some great descriptive prose and character study in the service of a story that never gets off the ground and finally just crashes.Keep this writer away from the supernatural in the future. That's my advice. She's on surer ground with relationships, small-town life, and the natural world.PKL"},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Arensberg commits the worst of all author's sins: she's boring! This empty tale of an invisible demon is as deadly dull as the drought affecting the town of Dry Falls, ME.

Arensberg's tale is a rip-off of a bad 1983 movie called The Entity (at least there were some visuals to help the film!), and the totally predictable climax is stolen from The Exorcist.

It may be that, categorically, but I didn't find it frightening at all.It's more like reading one of Cora's food columns in the newspaper than a horror story, since she focuses often on food, furniture, local flora, and such.I've never been to Maine, so it was a little difficult to identify with some of the climactic descriptions, such as an unexpected hot spell.The impression I had of Cora, her husband, and their friends and associates, is that of a group of adults somewhat bored with their lives, looking for excitement, and with a tendency toward the supernatural. The author admits this, too, in several part of the book.Reading this novel falls somewhere between a chore and a light entertainment. At no point did I become wrapped up in the plot or want to continue reading to find out what would happen next.

Is it like &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, the short story of a psychological journey where middle-aged faithless Cora, wife of an Episcopalian minister has been so inured by the late 20/21st century fascination in all things New Age mystical that her innate skepticism turns her towards finding an explanation for the odd occurrences in Dry Falls, Maine in the realm of aliens and UFOS rather than in believing in an actual manifestation of good old fashioned evil of the-tempting-by-Satan brand? Christianity and its traditions are not strong enough or viable enough to conquer the oddball extra-terrestrial imaginings that it does not define; its function is to save the soul. But what if you don't have a soul to save? What good is Christianity then?What a great concept for a story. If only it had worked on a purely suspenseful level. But, alas, I must submit to the bewilderment conjurred by Arensberg's mundane style that works when describing gardening hints, recipe advise and disdain over husband Henry's lack of interest in the more intimate realms of married life. Does she employ this same straight-forward technique when describing her coupling with the incubus of the title simply because she wants to appear 21st century jaded, immune to the truely horrific after a steady diet of the likes of Hannabal Lector and Freddy Kruger in all their graphic gory splendor? Perhaps. Or maybe she is just giving a respectful nod to old Nathaniel, imitating his 19th century style.And how this would have worked, if only the story had taken on big black leathery bat wings and soared into that part of the psyche that shakes weak traditions and the most steadfast of religious foundations. &quot;Incubus&quot; just doesn't go there---and I am not talking about Stephen King territory; throughout my reading of this novel I felt the need to beg for some episode which actually left my skin in a goosebump state on a purely mind game level. All of Arensberg's clever little Hawthorne reversals travel within a medium which doesn't have the clout to deliver any impact. We, the readers, wallow in our own jadedness, we wait for something to happen, some momentous moment where it will all click and allow some back-pedaling insight to wash over the montony of the story.

A reader had compared &quot;Incubus&quot; to &quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot; in that it is more if a story about life in a small town disturbed by horrifying events. The difference is that &quot;Church&quot; succeeded splendidly with the story of life in a small town, and how there is no such thing as privacy. &quot;Incubus&quot; just didn't move at all, and life in the small town wasn't captured so as to be interesting for the reader.

My theory: they all were looking for a &quot;Horror&quot; story filled with spirits, demons, etc. What they got was a character study on the lives in a small town, a look into spiritual beliefs and the wieght of personal relationships.Much like Mr. Dobyns &quot;Church of the Dead Girls,&quot; &quot;Incubus&quot; is more a social study of a small town when things go astray. There are definitly some eriee scenes and some strange happenings, but without the blood &amp; gore of most horror novels today.I would recommend this book but not as a horror novel. Instead, a novel that looks into Middle-America and small town life."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I had to add my two-cent worth and agree with those readers who reviewed this book and found it to be a wonderfully written novel of a woman's, and a towns, descent into hell. Arensberg has taken the myth of the incubus, (an evil spirit that lies on women in their sleep, pinning them down to have sexual intercourse with them), and has asked the question &quot;What if?&quot;. What makes this story truly frightening is the way she blends the myth of the incubus into a 21st century setting, a small town in Maine in 1974. Told in retrospective by Cora Whitman, the wife of the local Episcopal minister, she begins to notice the subtle changes that are happening to the people of Dry Falls. But then things take a nasty turn, and Cora finds herself a victim of the evil that has settled over Dry Falls. Arensberg writes with a slow, matter of fact pace yet she is able to evoke a sense of doom and despair. She is a wonderful writer, the scenes she creates pull you in with characters that are real and fully developed. Arensberg has written a horror novel of a higher caliber, and she is one hell of a storyteller."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"As opposed to the reviews given to a book I bought at the same time (&quot;Wither&quot; by Passarella)which claim that book as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; (and I think the average reviewer must be 16 years old), this book comes poorly reviewed in its wake.This, from the very first lines is an anguish inducing, very haunting novel. Its only problem (in the eyes of the readers, I think) is that it lacks blood and gore and though it has an erotic undercurrent it also lacks sex, which is what most people associate with horror.Cora's pilgrimage (so to speak) is actually a horrifying experience. Her life will NEVER be the same and that is what horror stands for: the utter, abrupt and irreversible change in our lives against our wills is what we fear the most. Ms. Arensberg creates a palpably (if slow-paced) atmospheric story, that uncoils in utter horror.Nowadays a &quot;good&quot; horror novel must deal with vampires and/or killers, with lots of gore and smut... this on the other hand is a novel, and it is a supernatural horror odyssey too well crafted. Pity for those who couldn't get the point at all. It's like never knowing the difference between champagne and cheap fizz."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"This eerie novel collects all the miscellaneous bits and pieces of lore about the incubus to fashion something quite frightening - and I've read a lot of horror novels. But since this is not a generic horror novel, there's a lot more going on in the book than that. There's the retelling of the Ceres/Demeter myth in the relationship between the narrator's mother and sister, for instance, which is wonderfully done and puts a whole new twist on the myth. There's the undependable narrator, a device I personally enjoy a lot. There's the depiction of a town populated by people engaging in all sorts of supernatural activities right under the narrator's nose - the narrator's mother is a hedge witch, the local private girls' school worships the Goddess, many characters use herbs for non-culinary purposes, etc. And there are a lot of wonderful echoes with Hawthorne.The individual who carped about this novel's alleged \\"postmodern\\" discomfort with the hardshell duality of good and evil hasn't read many horror novels. The very exclusivity of those categories has been undermined in horror for a long time, maybe since the beginning of the genre. For evidence one only has to look at such longtime horror trends as the sympathetic vampire (and there is nothing whatsoever postmodern about those). But frankly, I did not see any blurring of the boundary between good and evil here in any case. The only blurring I saw was on the part of the narrator, who was unable to accept a manifestation as supernatural and instead had to see it as extraterrestrial.This book did have trouble getting started, which might account for why some people thought it slow moving. Once it got going, it smoothed out. There were a lot of eerie moments crafted from ordinary things, such as a black dog that appears next to a sunbather. I thought the everyday details of life for a minister's wife added to the believability of the story, and I enjoyed how gardening was incorporated and made into a metaphor. Such use of realistic detail fits in well with the horror tradition, IMO. I enjoyed this book enough to want to read other novels by this author, even though they are not horror."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"This is a brilliant novel, which should not be pigeonholed in the &quot;horror&quot; genre or compared to anything by Stephen King. Ann Arensberg has written a perfect novel for 1999. For she writes, &quot;there is a clandestine traffic from the underworld in every era, but particularly at the end of a millenium... The inhabitants of the underworld smell our panic...&quot; This is a powerful, haunting, sexy book with plenty of commentary on religion and friendship and family life. And it is driven by a gripping plot about the supernatural invasion of a small town in Maine in 1974. Like Isabel Walker, the narrator of Diane Johnson's stunning novel &quot;Le Divorce,&quot; Arensberg's narrator, Cora Whitman, is a lot more astute and knowing than she would have us believe. She is a cook, a gardener, and the wife of a minister-- all occupations that soothe us as she leads us into this macabre and disturbing tale of the supernatural. This is one of those rare books that signal to you that you are in the hands of a master writer. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I was scrolling through one of Amazon's lists when I noticed &quot;Incubus.&quot; I couldn't believe that it had an average of two stars and was forced to submit a review. I thought the book was richly detailed, the characters realistically protrayed and the writing poetic. The portrayal of New England town life has rarely seen its equal since Hawthorne. Think of it as a Jane Hamilton novel with elements of the supernatural. Everything is in the details! This being said, readers searching for blood, gore, heroic battles between the Forces of Good and Evil, must look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I hesitate to give an unfavourable review to any book; I know how difficult it is to gestate and finally give birth to any work in literature. I have no criticism for Ann Arensberg's prose; her writing is beautiful, her descriptions wonderfully evocative, the similes and metaphors fresh and original. Unfortunately, this is not enough. The story is so disjointed and rambling that after having read over half the book I have given up on it in dismay. This reminds me of the unfortunate experience of Infinite Jest: some parts of it were utterly brilliant, but the rest left the reader thumbing through scores of pages trying to find something meaningful. I happen to love reading good prose for its own sake, but it needs the support of well developed characters and/or a good story. There may very well be a good story in this book, but so far I haven't been able to find it, and the characters are not strong enough to carry us along on their own merit. As I aforesaid, I really dislike writing negative reviews, and would not even bother to do so if the writer of this book was simply a hack out to make a buck. But I can see that this is a carefully written story with little pockets of insight and even brilliance, but it lacks continuity and organization and, most importantly, focus. Ms. Arensberg, if you read this, I hope you don't take it in the wrong way. I advise you to look for a new editor, someone who can really help you without compromising your talent."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"There should be an option for zero stars. BOMC called Ann Arensberg the female version of Stephen King. Don't believe it! I was highly disappointed with this book, in fact, I was angry when I finished it, for wasting the time and money, and for being duped in to thinking it would be entertaining. The premise was good, and the actual physical product was good, but the story was awful. I tore into the book thinking it would have frightening, yet titillating, parts, but Arensberg writes like a college professor. All wording, especially the descriptions of supposedly horrific events, is cold and clinical. The &quot;climactic&quot; ending is so poorly described, it leaves you wondering what happened, even after you read it again. The main character, Cora, is devoid of any emotion, regardless of the subject matter. Whether she's talking about her relationships with her mother and sister or her sexless marriage, she seems hard and unaffected. Her pastor husband seems to have little faith. At times the sentences do not flow well, and quotations are confusing; it is difficult to decipher which character said what. Too much emphasis is placed on the author's knowledge of plants, and not enough on the plot. I only kept reading with the hope that it would get better. It didn't.I've read some bad books in my life, and I have to say this has been the worst. It makes me wish I had a fireplace."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"There are moments in Incubus that will have you rivited. The problem is these moments are few and seperated by a whole lot of uninteresting self indulgence.While Arensberg can obviously write (there are three great, creepy scenes) her book is bogged down by an over all feeling of \\"I'm better than this genre\\". Her best scenes are the ones dealing directly with the demon/supernatural, yet she seems to be trying her hardest to rise above this. By avoiding sensationalizing, she had robbed her story of narrative power.One last note: Would it [hurt]Arensberg to give us one likable character? If given the choice, I would stay in a room with the Incubus rather than spend any more time with any character in this novel."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"\\"Intellectual\\" horror is not very mainstream (read: not very popular with the teens), perhaps, but it's the best kind of horror there is. Cora Whitman, a minister's wife, narrates this tale with sharp clarity and stunning insight. It's a study of ordinary people undergoing genuinely extraordinary experiences, and its horror lies in the randomly devastating occurrences that no one can - or dares - explain.People who didn't like this book are obviously of the \\"Where's my blood, sex and guts?\\" ilk, and for those people I recommend writers like Richard Laymon. He'll give you what you need."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I love horror and read this based on the review in &quot;The Washington Post Book World&quot;. At first, it appeared to be building to something good, but it went nowhere. No real thought to the plot or characters. This is a waste of time for REAL horror fans."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Cora's endless details of her mundane life drag this story down. The interesting scenes are buried in and amongst the chit-chatty monologues about her mother's garden, (...), her cooking, and the weather.I tried my best to get into this book but after 200 hundred pages, the horror bits were just too far and few between. There was too much local gossip. I think the author was trying to write in the style of Lovecraft but she kept getting bogged down in too much detail."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Cora Whitman, the narrator of this tale, helps us through bizarre and disturbing material through her erudite use of denial, humor and distraction. These devices are as much for the protection of the narrator as they are for us, as she is as fully prepared to deny the existence of some pretty kinky supernatural events as we are. Throughout most of the book she objectively describes the goings on and makes it clear that she is having none of it, all the while tempting her readers with interesting menus, recipes and (really good) gardening tips. Given the mastery of this author, such distractions alone make for a delightful page-turner. Yet, while the underlying horror of what's really happening is far beyond the narrator's understanding -- and ours, the author builds a story from which there is no escape -- either from the mounting fear and tension in the plot or from her brilliant writing. The fact that she always leads us away from the horrible truth while nagging us with its in-your-face evidence, is what is so compelling about this book. This reader found herself grateful for Cora's denial and was far happier comtemplating the smell of fresh gingerbread than the miasmic substances hovering over people's beds. Alas, despite her denial, the sinister corruption prevails until Cora and her readers can no longer resist consideration of a parallel universe. If you can't deal with such possibilities, don't read this book. Be warned, however, that if you don't, you'll miss an awesome piece of literature!"},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I was surprised at how many people were disappointed in thisnovel, since I was completely caught up in it. It was well-written andI was as fascinated by the goings-on in the lives of the characters as I am with real life people. I agree with the New York Times reviewer that it is Victorian in tone, rather than '90's slash-and-scream style horror. In my opinion, the Victorian tone made the story, but if you prefer horror that hits you in the face, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy horror that creeps up you and disturbs your view of the universe (not to mention your sleep!), then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I can't in any way believe that this had the well-written style to be a BOMC Main Selection. I was so, so misled by the description of this slow moving sleeper. In fact, I qiut after about 100 pages. The plot went nowhere and there was too much description. I hope BOMC comes up with better books for their Main Selections, cuz this sure wasn't worthy of being one!"},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Incubus was unfortunately for me a disappointment. The beginning was too weird and disconnected. The great hint of a plot kept me coming back hoping to be drawn into a potentially wonderful story. The genre and literary style is quite unique and shows extreme talent. But the writing stlye alone can't make a good book. The general plot is very unique and could make for a great story. But the author is too engrossed in proving God does not exist; even going so far as to misquote the Bible several times. The compelling but strange relationship between the sister and mom becomes too strange and confusing. It is very hard to care very much about any of the characters. I never could connect or relate with any of them. The resolution is never quite clear and I was left feeling puzzled and frustrated. Great writing, potentially great plot, but it's never developed enough to make the reader care."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I am currently reading this book and find it fascinating. I think that the author's story telling is accurate for the surroundings in which the novel takes place: a small town. The local gossip, the endless descriptions and the drawn out passages make the reading more enjoyable. I also find that it is not a traditional book of horror. It is a horror novel in a different way but is well written and worth the read."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I don't get it. Others seem to love this book--and I thought it trite and sentimental, almost to the point of making me sick. So much treacle. Yes, there were some nice sentences. But I felt the author was trying so hard to justify her &quot;love will save us&quot; message in the face of such horror, that I sometimes believed she would better have used her talents in the greeting card industry. Yes, I like the bravado of taking on Stephen King. Kudos to her for that. But she didn't do much except rehash an old myth, using sexual and gender stereotypes that defied my imagination. I felt we were headed straight to film. Maybe a screenplay would have been a better choice in the first place."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Whether this book is supposed to be a \\"horror\\" novel or not makes no difference. It's about as exciting and/or interesting as going to the laundromat. The narrator is self-centered and not entirely objective and there's not really a character in the whole book that I liked. Arenberg spends her time dealing with the sexual frustrations of a bunch of Peyton Place wannabes and her incubus terror is more humorous than frightening. A real overblown farce."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"An amazingly boring book. I did read it through entirely, but only because I'm an eternal optimist and kept thinking, &quot;This just HAS to get better!&quot; The plot was boring and the characters so poorly developed I didn't understand them and wished they'd all just sink into the big black beyond. For being a minister's wife, Cora is incredibly faith-less, unfriendly (all her friends in town she admits were only of convenience!), and self-absorbed (she doesn't do any of the social work usually required of a minister's spouse); very irksome qualities, especially since I've known so many ministers' wives, and they are the polar opposite of Cora.Cora proclaims to be a food writer, but her references to food are sporadic and uneven, so that aspect of her character fails miserably in its attempt to be believable.I would have thrown the book across the room when I was done (I hate wasting time reading drivel!), but I was afraid the hardcover book would damage something worthwhile in my home.BUT THE COVER PHOTO IS VERY PRETTY! I think I'll cut it out, maybe have it enlarged, and frame it for my office wall. It reminds me of the churches in the area I grew up in Pennsylvania."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Incubus, by Ann Arensberg was an incredible chore for me to get through. If it wasn't for some curse I have that I MUST finish a book that I start, I would have given up on this book within the first 100 pages. As stated by many other reviews, nothing happens in this book. No action, no suspense and the ending is a ludicrously-contrived, hurriedly thrown in mix of The Exorcist and Poltergeist.I don't need blood and gore to be happy with a novel of the supernatural. THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE by Shirley Jackson is one of my favorite novels, one reason being that it shows that you CAN grab your reader and terrify them with a &quot;less-is-more&quot; approach, with no gory beheadings or buckets of blood necessary. INCUBUS, however, is no HILL HOUSE. One has to wait until exactly half way into the book before the first mention of demons or an incubus is made. Before that, the only action that occurs is three women having erotic dreams and six school girls going a little bit beyond that. That's it. The characters are forgettable and we care about none of them. The narrator's (Cora) sister Hannah, is a self-centered, selfish snob. The mother, besides being unnecessary to the plot, is a martyr mother...she loves Hannah no matter how spiteful or inconsiderate Hannah might be to her. Our hero(?) Cora, is a disbelieving, spineless preacher's wife who won't even speak up for herself when her husband and friends practically make her a prisoner in her own home.The author's endless insistence with detail concerning plants or food is infuriating. If the author had spent more time writing about the supernatural elements that this book demands than telling us what Cora planted, how she cares for plants, what she's cooked or planning to cook at any hour of the day or night, and the list of ingredients for the dishes that she's made/making....we'd have had a much better book.I'm usually not this cruel with a review, but this book was so boring to me....I couldn't WAIT until I could be done with it. I really do feel that I've wasted a few days of my life."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I took a flyer on this novel because the it has an interesting (to me) title and the author is Ivy league educated. I figured \\"even if the plot is stupid, at least the prose will be well crafted.\\"My take after reading: this is a REALLY good book. The writing is excellent and descriptive. The author's understanding of personality defects brings the characters alive and the story is original.For me, finding this novel was like discovering a rare coin in the jar I throw my change into at the end of the day."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"It's unfortunate that this books has gotten (at the time of this review) a rating of only 2 1/2 stars here. When I saw the reviews here, after bringing the book home from Barnes and Noble, I chewed my lip a bit nervously, but decided to give it a try anyway.I'm happy to report that the low rating, it seems, is the result of a number of reviewers being disappointed by their own expectations. They missed a thoroughly enjoyable (albeit more leisurely paced than the average bestseller) novel. I would (and am about to) recommend it to friends."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I managed to find the book both compelling and, at the same time, a bit tedious. The underlying story was interesting enough for me to want to continue turning the pages while I often became frustrated at Cora's rambling style of telling the story and her lengthy descriptions of everything surrounding her. Some details were interesting (gardening) while others made me smile (especially those of her friends sex lives) but many were just plain dull. This tidbit, taken from a scene where Cora is describing herself, could just as well describe the author's method of telling her story: \\"When he (Cora's husband) told me a story I made him repeat himself. When he baptized an infant I asked him to describe the christening dress.\\" (...)Guess this book disturbed me on a level that I wasn't aware of! And, here I thought I was too jaded to be bothered by a story."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"This is the best low-key, adult supernatural horror story since Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, and is told in very much the same style. The horrors it paints are initially presented in suspensefully suggestive backdrop, mounting gradually to a graphic and dramatic conclusion.Narrator Cora Whitman is a pastor's wife in rural Dry Falls, Maine, which in 1974 suffers from a non-stop blighting heat-wave. It also suffers from something more sinister: an invisible menace that sexually molests sleeping women and maturing girls. Cora is far more reluctant than her falteringly religious husband, and his paranormal-researching circle of friends, to accept that the reported nocturnal assaults are the work of some supernatural agent - until she becomes its target, herself.Cora begins her story with Charles Fort's most famous quote - \\"I think we're property\\" - and an enumeration of paranormal events in our time and before our time, before walking us through her own voyage from skepticism to belief. Her perspective enables the reader to witness events that could be nothing more than overactive imaginations or sexual frustration (all the women in Dry Falls are suffering from an epidemic lack of sexual interest from their husbands), but gradually become more indicative of supernatural intrusion: one woman feels as if a masculine presence was in her room, but sees nothing; another senses a vague shadowy outline in the door, while suffering apparent sleep-paralysis; a third has chunks of flesh gouged out of her scalp, by nails sharper than she possesses, and is certain an unseen male figure was in her room. Even after several girls from the nearby prep-school are found, in the same room and on the same night, sleeping as if drugged and sexually hyper-excreting while seeming to respond to bedpartners, Cora and the Dry Falls townsfolk manufacture rationalizations to account for the phenomenon. Eventually, however, too many people witness events beyond any natural explanation, and Dry Falls becomes a town besieged by fear.What makes this novel work is the understated, first-person approach. Daily events are described in mundane fashion, with the odd occurrence here and there sandwiched in, mulled over for a moment, and then forgotten - until the next. By the time Cora is convinced that outside entities have targeted Dry Falls, so is the reader. She and her husband come off very much as a Scully and Mulder pair, the story itself feeling a great deal like a well-written episode of The X-Files. In fact, the presentation of paranormal researchers and their techniques is spot-on accurate, and completely believable for it. The tone and style have almost a documentary feel, and the illusion of reality is exceptionally well sustained.The Reader's Guide/author's interview at the end of the book reveals that Arensberg was consciously drawing from lore of historical fairy abductions, demon hauntings, and contemporary reports of UFO entities in crafting her tale, and she presents them extremely realistically. Literarily, she sought to emulate Nathaniel Hawthorne and Shirley Jackson, and she succeeds fabulously.This is thinking-man's horror, for mature readers only."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"To catagorize this book in the horror genre would be misleading and disappointing. Even though something horrible does happen to the women of Dry Falls, fans of classic pop horror authors such as King, Koontz, Barker and Rice might not find the book &quot;meaty&quot; enough. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book (even though I myself am a horror fan) and found it a refreshing read since it is rather short. The dialogue is clipped but this may be due to the New England dialect, and by extension, the New England culture portayed in the book. There are very good descriptions of the psychological make-up of the main characters and I found the relationship between the main character's mother and sister thoughtful and compelling."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"One definition of &quot;prose&quot; is: tedious speech or conversation. That defines this book. If you like the Clive Barker/Stephen King brand of horror, save your money. A bore."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"Ann Arensberg has written a very good supernatural thriller in \\"Incubus\\", a book which relies moore on atmosphere and character development/interaction then in pacing and plot driven scares.\\"Incubus\\" is written in the Shirley Jackson tradition of cool, straight ahead and level headed narration. Cora Whitman Lieber is the narrator, the wife of an Episcopalian minister whose serene life is muddled somewhat due to her dysfunctional family situation and her husband's lack of interest in the physical part of marriage. Her husband appears to be growing tired of his life as a priest and is increasingly becoming fixated on supernatural phenomena in an attempt to prove that there is \\"something else\\" out there. Cora, a food reviewer for a series of magazines mixes these facts in with lessons on horticulture, food preparation and vignettes on the other residents of Dry Falls Maine who attend St. Anthony the Hermit, her husband's church.\\"Incubus\\" is about a series of paranormal events that occur in Dry Falls Maine from April-September 1974. A permanent heatwave/drought descends on the town despite normal weather everywhere else, men lose and sudden regain their sexual ardor and the women of the town are subjected to attacks from something...To tell the reader any more would be to ruin a cracking good book. Cora Whitman Lieber is a believable narrator who never raises her tone during the novel, even when she becomes the victim of the unexplainable. Her husband is presented as an overall good man complete with faults and other warts that render him human and believeable. The other characters are so believebaly rendered that the reader can make comparisons to those they know in real life, from the shrewish sister to the wise, didactic, sexually ambiguous older friend of the Lieber's, an antique dealer with a knowledge of the supernatural, the ditzy/sexy new age parish secretary and the psychic whose gift sometimes works but is a first rate real estate agent.The novel is presented in the form of a case study, told in a cool, straightforward style perfected by Shirey Jackson in her wonderful works \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" and \\"We have always Lived in the Castle.\\" Unlike Jackson, Ms. Arensberg's work misses a five star rating due to the length of her book. This book clocks in at 322 pages hardcover, not a large novel but one that could easily be reduced by 20 pages. Ms. Arensberg's horticultural and culinary descriptions are sometimes bloated and take away from the events that occur in her book. That being said, the last 90 pages of the novel are first rate bordering on extraordinary.I heartily recommend this novel to any true horror fan as a wonderful study in atmosphere and character development. If you favor novels by Shirley Jackson, Ruchard Matheson, Ray Russell and Anne Rivers Siddon, particularly \\"The House Next Door\\", then \\"Incubus\\" will be your cup of tea."},{"Title":"Incubus","review":"I was interested in this book after reading summaries and reviews of it but once I had it in my hands, it was a real chore to plod through it.

I think that the book would have benefited from more direct action."},{"Title":"Drift: Poems","review":"Although there are three blubs on the back cover of this book laudings its\\"hyperliterate wit\\" I found nothing even mildly amusing and I do read a lot of contemporary poetry.

What I wasn't prepared for was how funny it was going to be, treating a serious topic that effects so many women with a wonderful mixture of wit and wisdom.So many of these womens' stories resonated with me, and I've already recommended it to a bunch of friends."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"This book had me in hysterics from the moment I picked it up. As a person who makes a conscious effort not to think too much about body image and how much I've gained or lost on any given day, I have to be honest with myself and admit that I do think about it. A lot. And I'm certain that most women I know do too. It's nice to be able to get a good laugh about the whole thing for once.It's unfortunate that we live in such an image obsessed society, but this book makes no apologies for the fact that we all give in to the pressures that are put upon us from time to time. Instead it offers up a refreshingly irreverent perspective on how to take ourselves and our pursuit of perfection a little less seriously. We all have quirks and insecurities that we'd rather not admit to. I only wish that I could own up to mine with the same brazen honesty and humor that the author and the women in this book do."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"This is the type of book that is hard to put down! Goldman was able to put into words so many women's inner dialogues about their bodies, including her own. Her observations are hilarious and compassionate as well. It's time the truth was told about what woman think about their own bodies - especially those that exercise. I enjoyed Goldman's honesty and her wonderful exploration of the \\"perfect body.\\" It is definately a fun read for woman of all ages."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"(This isn't the most cohesive review; the book itself is fragmented into very delineated chapters.)Leslie Goldman spent a long time eavesdropping in her locker gym, interviewing women, and making pithy observations about women and their attitudes toward their bodies. Goldman is recovering from an eating disorder, which she mentions quite often in the book, and I think it's great that she's so open about it.Throughout the book, at various points and in line with various subjects, Goldman calls for women to accept themselves as they are. She describes a multitude of bodies, in various conditions--fat, thin, tall, short, white, black, Hispanic, young, old, pregnant, post-pregnancy, etc. Through out she describes women traipsing around the locker room in various states of being, not to mention nudity. Unfortunately, her emphasis on appearances undermines the message. At one point, while discussing flaws, she actually encourages readers to look for flaws in others, stating that \\"schadenfreude can be your best friend\\" in the locker room. In short, if I were new to the gym, this book would make me more concerned about being scrutinized in the locker room.In addition to the locker room, Goldman has a clear obsession with exercise in general. She clearly looks down on people who don't exercise. I believe at one point she expresses admiration for an anorexic at her gym who exercises three hours a day, seven days a week. The overall impression is that if you don't exercise, or don't exercise enough, you're not as good as Goldman.There are also places where she just flat-out goes on tangents--for example, about people talking in the steam room. She also complains about womens' beauty rituals in the locker room. Now I admit I'd probably laugh if I saw a women take a break from blowdrying her hair to blowdry her nether regions--but Goldman apparently thinks that's just disgusting. She also criticizes women who blowdry or do their makeup while topless--while also stating that she does the same. She at one point says she'll stop walking around topless because some of the women she talked to were made uncomfortable by it; but she also talks about encouraging other women to go topless.Gym-specific locales aside, the author's language also clearly belies her spoken message. I've already returned the book, but the example that jumped out at me the most is that assertion that someone's 36C breasts were \\"respectable\\". It really bothered me all the way through, and I think if I were less secure in myself this book would have made me even more critical of my \\"flaws\\".The most depressing part to me was probably at the very end, when Goldman interviewed older women. Although some of them did express a certain comfort with their bodies, their comments seemed overwhelmingly negative. The same could be said about Goldman's interviews with women who had had children--such as the women who said she didn't want another baby because of how it made her body look, and another one who described her post-pregnancy breasts as \\"a nipple on a board\\". There were a couple of women who said they looked at their bodies in different ways now--able to create and sustain life, etc.--but most of them seemed devastated by how giving birth had changed their bodies.There were some good things about the book. I admire the intent behind it, even though I don't think Goldman really believes in accepting people as they are. Goldman is also quite witty and amusing. I appreciated her efforts to include everyone--not only the various gym patrons, but the people who work at the gym, including the largely Hispanic cleaning crew and how their culture influenced their views regarding body image and nudity.All in all, I think Goldman's intentions were great, but I think the concept would have been better served with a larger sample size (rather than just her $140/month gym's clients) and by less of an author bias."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I am giving this book two stars because the author can write well, but that's about it. As someone who is trying to recover from a negative body image brought on by childhood abuse, I picked this book up with the intention of possibly unwrenching some underlying negative body image views I have.I was hoping for something to rally around, some \\" we are all in this together and we are all beautiful\\" type of mentality. Instead I felt like I was surrounded by shallow, three pound weight gain obsessed exclusive club goers talking about physical minutae.The author is a recovering anorexic. I am happy for her that she was able to overcome the dehibilitating disease.....but it is painfully clear that she still struggles with body image.Talking over and over about the towels that women drape to cover their bodies, occasionally she throws in a half-hearted what-is-wrong-with-our-body-image statement, then proceeds, for the bulk of the book, to show veiled ( and maybe even subconscious) disdain for pregnancy and what it does to your body, women being comfortable with nudity in the locker room ( she even says \\"no thanks\\"),and a multitude of other \\"sins\\" that she attempts to cover up with random vague affirming body image statements.From a writing standpoint her writing was entertaining, but as a whole the book never really SAID anything outright.In attempting to ( possibly?) remain objective by just \\"interviewing\\" women, all she did was facilitate the negative torture wheel that a lot of women continue to run miles on, and reveal her own issues.I hate that I bought this book, and reading it made me so angry that I couldn't even finish it."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I go to the gym five times a week, so i'm in the locker room quite a lot. This book really puts my locker rooms into a new light - a scary one! Are women REALLY trying to see what size labels are on each other's clothes? Peeking to see the weight on the scale when other women weigh themselves? Are they all thinking anyone fatter than themselves is gross, and anyone thinner than themselves a b**ch? Ok, i don't go to a fancy gym that costs a lot (she mentions a billion times how fancy hers is), but really, we don't all sit around half naked spending 20 min applying lotion. I've never spent 20 min in the locker room at one time, admittedly, but i've never seen anyone doing that. Still, now I'm almost paranoid to go! LOL. I'm a woman who doesn't hang out with many women, but if this is how most women think, I realize why! Honestly, I go in, change, and leave, minding my own business. Still, an interesting book, I just hope that it's been exaggerated a bit. I also wish she'd gone to more gyms, maybe some cheaper ones, some from different parts of the country, stuff like that, got a wider range of people to talk with besides herself and friends."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I really enjoyed this book and appreciated the mix of humor with such a serious topic.

We affirm you. Now go and learn about capitalization; you capitalize nouns that take the place of names, like \\"Grandpa.\\""},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I checked this out of the library because the three pages I read in the aisle were engagingly written and amusing. And, throughout the book, Goldman has that going for her (although she sometimes seems a little too pleased with her own cleverness and must have been paid per cliche.)Aside from that, though, this book was hugely disappointing. If it hadn't been so smoothly written, in fact, and if I hadn't found myself with a chunk of time to race through it, I doubt I would have finished it--as a woman who isn't stick thin but has a reasonably healthy body image, Goldman's assertions and judgments made me vacillate between feeling confused, sad, bad about myself, and angry. I could go on for way too long about how a book that claims it wants women to have more positive body images does this but it comes down to one fundamental reason (and two corollaries): though Goldman claims this is an \\"ethnography of the locker room,\\" it's really a book for and about very wealthy white women, who exercise several times a week at health clubs (NOT gyms), live in northern urban areas, and, in most cases, have experienced eating disorders (I know, I know, there were some women in the book who had not experienced eating disorders, but the proportion of women in the book who had was way way out of whack with the overall proportion in the U.S. population. This would have been fine if Goldman had made this a book about body image and women recovering from eating disorders, but as it was, she made it seem like 3/4 of the women in the country--or at least 3/4 of the women at her gym had experienced them.)This super narrow perspective, as well as Goldman's own biases, had two major effects on the way she presented information:1. This book was so judgmental of women whose bodies Goldman perceived as flawed--and of those who Goldman saw as perfect and flaunting it. Goldman persists in equating \\"thin\\" with \\"good,\\" whether she's talking about other adults she sees in the locker room, friends, or even the teens she interviews (seeing how Goldman awards those girls with value was particularly heartbreaking.) Goldman's perspective was less \\"women should feel good about their bodies because their bodies are strong, support them, and work for them,\\" and more \\"women who are thin and work out and look great should feel good about their bodies because they're thin and work out and look great.\\" Which, sure, is true in a sense, but is so limited and convoluted as to be useless, and really doesn't seem to be what positive body image is about, from my perspective.2. This book completely minimizes the experiences of women who are not wealthy, not white, not regular gym goers, or even have just found contentment with their bodies. Goldman half owns up to this at one point, then goes back to talking about \\"women\\" as if she were including all women, or at least all American women. Her chapter on body image across races was so un-insightful as to be embarrassing. She seems inordinately proud of herself for interviewing the locker room cleaning staff to provide a \\"latina perspective,\\" (can she seriously be so dense that she doesn't see how problematic that is, as well as how uneven it makes her \\"study\\"?) At one point, Goldman even goes so far as to claim that white women are the only ones who truly struggle with their bodies or body image. This despite some of the non-white women she interviewed directly contradicting her. Altogether, she seemed genuinely uncomfortable with non-white, non-weathy women and wrote off any part of their stories that didn't gel with the picture she had of their experiences.This felt much more like the book Goldman needed to write than a book anyone else needs to read. Her experiences and hang-ups color her presentation of information on every page, which, at worst, makes the book uninteresting, and, at most, makes it damaging. I genuinely hope that Goldman's representation of how women act in her locker room is inaccurate--or at least exaggerated--and, after reading this, I'm truly grateful that this is not how women act in my gym's locker room."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"Like way too many women, I have struggled for years to achieve that ever-elusive feeling of 'self-acceptance', and in the process, was diagnosed with an \\"atypical eating disorder\\" - whatever that means - years ago. Consequently, body image is a topic that always piques my interest and curiosity. This book did 2 things for me: cracked me up (I literally laughed out loud more times than I can count); and precipitated a true shift in my thinking about weight, beauty, priorities, and happiness. For me, body image will always be a struggle, always sitting there somewhere in my brain ready to act out and take me to that 'bad place.\\" But the insight, empathy, and straight talking with which Ms. Goldman has infused her book, has given me a sense of...hmmmm...the word that comes to mind is relief. 3 words ladies: READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"The author was far more interested in discussing her own preoccupations with weight and her own looks than in really opening up some kind of valid discussion about body image. This book is mainly a self-involved narrative of the author's own rituals, with the occasional nod in the direction of \\"wouldn't it be great if women just accepted their own bodies?\\" The anecdotes are simply that: pretty banal observations without any real content or analysis."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I am puzzled by all the very positive reviews Locker Room Diaries has here and especially all the reviewers who commented on how \\"hilarious\\" and \\"laugh out loud\\" funny this book is. Funny, I didn't laugh once. I didn't even smile. I am wondering if that is more a function of my age (60) or if I am merely too cynical.For all that Ms. Goldman disavows any obsession with weight and superficial physical appearance since her experience with anorexia, her obsession with weight and superficial physical appearance seeps out from every page. In fact, other than memoirs written by anorectics, I have never read a book so permeated with such issues. When I finished the book, I did not feel empowered or more content with my body but rather quite distressed when I had never been before. I had the queasy feeling throughout that Ms. Goldman was a titillating voyeur, in the end probably making those she stared at, solely in the course of research, of course (says Ms. Goldman), wondering what she was up to. Had she been in my locker room, I certainly would have felt more than self-conscious.And that brings up another aspect of this book. It had never ever occurred to me that fellow locker room attendees were sizing up my body or comparing it to theirs. And I have never done the same myself and I spent 20-odd years studying ballet, an endeavor that is most conducive to poor body image. I don't know what Ms. Goldman does for a real job (and I don't think she'll get rich from this one) but she obviously does not have much of a life if she can spend five years on obsessing about women's bodies."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I've been an avid gym goer for 15 years and too oblivious or too busy to notice what occurs around me in the locker room. Leslie Goldman doesn't miss a thing. She candidly discusses her mental health struggles, making her the perfect author for this book. She picks up on everything around her in the locker room through the eyes of a journalist and woman that struggled with anorexia. The book elaborates on female rituals, some healthy, some not. Some examples are laugh-out-loud funny (brazilian bikini wax). Others are thoughts that have gone through our heads but often are not discussed (What is he/she thinking about my breasts?) Ms. Goldman sends a message to women to be proud of their bodies, wherever they fall on the physical spectrum. I believe it is a well-written and helpful book for women of all ages."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"This book is amazing.

Eye opening looking at how similar women seem to be in their views of body image, which is also kind of disheartening.Cons: Since Goldman only concentrated on her own gym (which seems like an \\"easy way out\\" in terms of researching a book to me) I cannot help but wonder if the information gleaned from her interviews is skewed and inapplicable to the outside world due to her myopic sample (it seems as if most of them had or have an eating disorder). It would have been nice for her to break up her rapid-fire excerpts of interviews with same data and analysis to provide a balance (when she does provide data such as statistics, sources are not cited). Also, in terms of balance, an \\"outsider's view\\" such as talking to a few men or non-gym users would have been welcome. Goldman's flighty tone can seem out of place, especially in her conclusion, where she notes that she would like the unhealthy preoccupation with body image to lessen. But she provides no suggestions about how to make this happen and her facetious asides take away from this \\"time to be serious\\" moment.Grade: C+"},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"This book was fantastic!

From the instant I started reading I felt that this author and I were engaged in a personal, one-on-one conversation regarding all of the insecurities I've felt about my body throughout my entire lifetime. I have always been athletic and active, and at the age of 44 I teach 4-5 Spinning classes per week. However, childbirth and the fact that I'm no longer in my twenties has changed my body in ways that I used to find discouraging. Locker Room Diaries literally changed the way I perceive my \\"imperfections\\", allowing me to cherish and nurture my body for all of the amazing things it's done and continues to do for me. The book left me with a yearning to meet Ms. Goldman in person, as I related to her wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I'm not finished reading the book but I'm really enjoying it. Being a female with body issues, I find Ms. Goldman's comments and observations very entertaining. She shows me that although my issues are real, they are also really ridiculous.

I teach writing at a local university and Goldman's words sing and dance across the pages of her powerful book - a book that is part memoir, part ethnography, and part sociology. It is a beautiful work of art and a true labor of love.Like Goldman, I too have struggled with my body over the years - constantly pushing it too many miles until it breaks or pinching every ounce of fat on my stomach and magically wishing it would turn to rock hard stone. Goldman's book is a testament to the times that we live in where Dove pushes for a \\"real beauty\\" campaign, yet the \\"real women\\" splashed across billboards are selling FIRMING lotion.For any woman who has ever spent time in a gym, Locker Room Diaries will resonate with her. She will laugh and cry simultaneously as her fingers turn the pages. The voices that we hear talking about their boobs, bikini waxes, and food obessions are voices that we are familiar with - that we can relate to.I highly recommend this book!!!

This book is unique because it blends a lot of wit and humor, research and expert opinions, and women's experiences together into a diary of lessons learned. Moreover, I appreciate that Ms. Goldman sometimes shares or even illustrates her own struggles with body image throughout the book. This is another attempt by the author to allow those readers who have been struggling with similar issues to understand it may be a long and sometimes bumpy road to recovery, and most of all, no\\"body\\" is perfect."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"I read this book in one day - it was THAT fascinating and THAT funny!

There were more than a few gems of knowledge that I learned by reading this book and it makes for a great conversational piece.Beyond finding myself laughing at Goldman's quick-witted barbs, I found myself having greater compassion for my own self-image...flaws and all!

The whole book is a parade of people spending their lives fretting about minute weight gains or the C-cup versus D-cup issue. But that is all it is: a parade of people lost to the world in navel-gazing over something truely meaningless. The authors obsessive listing of numbers does not sound to me like someone who has recovered from an obsession with weight and looks (nor does her picture on the backcover).

I am shocked by M. Prindle's negative review, and couldn't disagree more with her/his opinion. Did M. Prindle even read Locker Room Diaries in its entirity? I doubt it; in my opinion, this book was filled with invaluable anecdotes and information about women and body image.Like many women in my 30s, I have experienced a myriad of body image issues---ranging from anorexia in my teens, to a combination of anorexia and exercise bulimia in graduate school. I'm considered healthy now (thanks to therapy and medications), but I always carry with me an awareness of my body---my physical fitness and dietary intake are omnipresent in the back of my mind. Locker Room Diaries helped my to realize that I am not alone, and that body image issues are pervasive in our society. It also helped me to see that my body has meaningful and amazing functionality, and it's physical beauty (based upon societal and cultural standards) doesn't need to define me as person.Locker Room Diaries made me both laugh and cry, but more importantly, made me contemplate my view of my own body in a less critical way.

The book's most revealing moments showcase the judgements we pass on ourselves and other women--for anyone who has ever thought to themselves, \\"Her _____ looks so much better than mine,\\" this book invites the reader to join the club.It treads the dark territory between elliptical machines and showers in brutally honest flip flops, not shying away from the pressures that our towel-wrapped sisters can apply--usually unknowingly and unintentionally. In anecdote after anecdote, Goldman shines a light into the heart of every woman's insecurities, especially her own.Through its astute observations about the nature of women au natural, Locker Room Diaries gives any woman who has ever been in a locker room a sense of sorority, and the hope that maybe we shouldn't worry so much about being perfect, because we're already beautiful."},{"Title":"Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image, and Re-imagining the \\"Perfect\\" Body","review":"LOCKER ROOM DIARIES: THE NAKED TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN, BODY IMAGE, AND RE-IMAGINING THE 'PERFECT' BODY stems from interviews with hundreds of women over five years, conducted in gym locker rooms.

As someone who has recovered from both bulimia and anorexia, and someone that has read every book on the topic of body image, I find it refreshing to finally laugh about it. Goldman's visual descriptions, brutal honesty and writing style made me feel like I was sitting at brunch with my best friend gabbing away; sometimes serious, sometimes funny, but all honest. She also made me appreciate my body in ways I had never considered as she took body image beyond just \\"fat\\" or \\"thin\\". Locker Room Diaries made me stop and think: my body will fight disease, my legs strong enough to kick and fight off an attack, my belly will be home for a fetus, my breasts will feed a baby, my arms will provide hugs and love to people around. And just like the older woman Goldman talks to, I too hope that when I'm 90 I can look back at a body I hated so much as an adolescent and young adult and not only accept it for what it carried me through, but treasure it for the sacred moments it brought me that define \\"life\\".

If I had a fever or a pain I couldn't explain, the curandera (who I'm sure didn't have a license-medical, drivers, ministry, or otherwise) would be summoned. Upon arrival, she would rub a whole raw egg all over my body, crack it open, pour it in a bowl, and place it under my bed. If I felt better in the morning, it meant the magic worked; if I didn't, it was because I was a bad boy who was suffering for his sins.Speaking of eggs, I remember that the 3rd of the month was always a holiday at my house since that was the day the mailman would bring our authorization letter for food stamps! The visit to \\"la oficina de estampillas\\" was always followed by a trip to the grocery store, where mom would give me my monthly allowance of $5 in the form of a purple food stamp note. I would buy all the junk food I could with the government-issued currency and would not eat anything else until the last crumb was gone.All these images have flooded back into my consciousness after reading Mario Bosquez's (no relation-honest!) \\"The Chalupa Rules: A Latino Guide to Gringolandia.\\" Even Mario has a place in my memories as I remember watching him live a life I longed for as he co-hosted a popular local television show with an attractive female co-star. Lucky devil! Little did I know then that he and I were living a life more similar than not.While the TV screen always projected an image of a suave and debonair gentleman explaining the wonders of the Alamo City, the cruel reality was that he was struggling to support his family-mother and siblings--while living in a government sponsored FHA 235 home. Bosquez has taken his life experiences and has crafted what he calls \\"The Chalupa Rules,\\" using dichos (proverbs) as inspiration to overcome poverty and a childhood surrounded by domestic violence and alcoholism.For those of you unfamiliar with a \\"chalupa\\" (and no, I don't mean the tasty food concoction made with a fried corn tortilla coated on one side with refried beans and topped with grated cheese and chopped lettuce and tomatoes), it's a Mexican version of bingo, more commonly known as loteria. A caller pulls a card from a deck which contains a colorful imagery-a rooster, a hand or a man holding the world, among others-and calls the names of these items in Spanish--el gallo, la mano, el mundo. Players use pinto beans to mark the squares on their playing card and the first one to cover all the images on their card wins.The book contains 30 homespun rules for success that still ring true in today's world of the all-knowing internet. Among other things, Bosquez will gently remind you that the devil never sleeps, that it's okay to sleep on important decisions, and that there's no harm in proudly waving the banner of your identity.\\"The Chalupa Rules\\" is witty, entertaining and prevalent in today's world, regardless of race, creed or religion. It's written as if your favorite uncle has decided to devote a whole afternoon to you and only you, in order to tell you about the mistakes he's made so that they won't happen to you.Bosquez is now an anchor in the number one television market in the world, no doubt by following his collection of dichos.

Mario has an in depth and useful analysis of many of the recognizable characters in the game of Chalupa, and brings his own life stories into each of them. While this book is titled as \\"A Latino Guide to Gringolandia\\", I think all cultures will benefit from this unique perspective on the popular Mexican game and everybody will take something useful out of it.

These dark, gothic images of sensual female vampires by some of the top artists in fantasy and erotic art are always a treat for the eyes. Crimson Embrace Vol. 5 is no different as it presents 64 pages of luscious vampire art starting off with a cover by Greg Loudon and featuring artists such as Fastner & Larson, Daniel Pascarelli, Mike Hoffman, James Ryman, Gerard Gallego, and many more.Gerard Gallego presents the domineering vampire as a blonde vamp is using her submissive slave as a lounge chair. Gallego is also the creator of the most erotic piece in the book, as a hot female vamp straddles her nude victim as blood flows down her chest. Fastner & Larson are always at the top of their game with their beautiful and care-free illustrations of females and they provide some great pieces for this latest edition including a trio of sexy, sultry vampires cavorting before a full moon, and a pair of barfly beauties sipping their cocktails while their latest victim grasps at his freshly bitten throat.James Ryman is another one of my favorites whose work always evokes a sense of bestial power. This is well displayed in his nude, bat-winged vampire and his vampire mermaid, swimming away from a fresh kill. Daniel Pascarelli shows the neck is not the only place a vampire likes to take a bit out of as he draws a snarling vampire sinking her fangs into the backside of her female prey. Villagers are enacting their vengeance on a vampire, burning her at a stake in a powerful piece by Mitch Byrd.Crimson Embrace continues to set be a trendsetter in the field of dark, erotic art. The diversity of talent each volume presents is outstanding. Another great offering from SQ Productions!"},{"Title":"The Silent and Soft Communion: The Spiritual Narratives of Sarah Pierpont Edwards and Sarah Prince Gill","review":"In The Silent and Soft Communion: The Spiritual Narratives of Sarah Pierpont Edwards and Sarah Prince Gill, Sue Lane McCulley and Dorothy Z. Baker provide an insightful introduction to two generations of Calvinist women in eighteenth century America via the spiritual autobiographies of Sarah Pierpont Edwards and Sarah Prince Gill.The book begins with detailed histories of Sarah Pierpont Edwards and Sarah Prince Gill, followed by an insightful look into the historical context of their spiritual narratives. Aside from the narratives themselves, this portion of the book is quite interesting and informative, with brief looks into their communities, churches, and the impacts of literature, popular ideas, and events of their day.Sarah Pierpont Edwards' narrative covers a short time period in 1742. While her husband was preaching in another town and visiting ministers filled his pulpit in Northampton, Mrs. Edwards experienced a spiritual awakening. Because he believed that many would benefit from reading her experience, Jonathan requested that Sarah write the details of her awakening. Sarah's narrative begins with a description of her feeling very \\"low in grace\\" and an earnest desire to seek God and ask him for help in experiencing greater personal holiness. She writes of sermons and scriptures and how they affected her mind and heart, of her hatred for her sin, of finding peace regarding the circumstances surrounding her family, of wholly submitting to God, and of the inexpressible joy in the Holy Spirit she experienced.Sarah Prince Gill's spiritual narrative is a personal journal more than the retelling of a particular experience. Gill begins with a short testimony to explain why she began her journal. \\"In the year 1743 reading Mr White On the Power of Godliness, I was convinced that it is may duty to comit to writing My Experiences. [I] hope it will be a means of keeping alive the work[ings] of Grace in me--And excite me to be maki[ng] Progress in Religion--Accordingly I set about it in the Fear of God who searches the Heart and trieth the Ruins--And beggin[g] the assistances of his Holy Spirit to bring all thing[s] to My Remembrance.\\" Gill's journal begins in 1743 and ends in 1764. Each entry is dated and she admits that she continues the journal in other papers, so that where there are gaps one may assume that she has written in her other papers.While Mrs. Edwards' wrote her narrative with readers in mind, Mrs. Gill's narrative is deeply personal and introspective. Gill writes of hating her sin and self, of an earnest desire to be Christ's, of her desire for Jesus to be her all and to grow in holiness. She writes detailed and passionate descriptions of how she plans to employ God's means of grace in order to be more like her Savior and live only for His glory. Gill even writes of her struggling through those times when she did not desire God or have an appetite for spiritual things. She alludes to various events, like an outbreak of smallpox, church trials, an earthquake, the French and Indian War, and the deaths of close friends and family, and how these events affected her spiritually.Both narratives are useful for encouragement and spurring one on in her pursuit of Christ. It is helpful and edifying to read the spiritual accounts of those who have walked with Christ and finished their respective races. Though I live hundreds of years removed from them, our struggles against sin and the world are not so different. Both journals encouraged me in one way or another to pursue deeper fellowship with Christ, to fight the fight of faith and to keep a record of God's work of grace in my life. I enjoyed this book and think that most Christian women will benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"Living and Dying in Nursing Home","review":"I read this book from cover to cover in the space of an afternoon. The true stories were engaging and poignant and the reflections provided by the authors on each situation are an invaluable resource to anyone working in healthcare.I would also strongly recommend this book to anyone with a parent or family member living in a nursing home (particularly in Australia). It gives you an insight into the day to day running of a nursing home, the dilemmas faced by staff and the quality of care which should be provided. The book includes descriptions of times when a high quality of care was provided, and also times when a situation could have been handled better.

Ellen Clah, head of the Navajo Reservation Major Crimes Unit, must find out who killed Jimmy Blacksheep, a Navajo national guardsman, who was on his way home from serving in Iraq. The rental car he was driving is missing. The obvious suspects are a car-jacking ring that has been operating on the Rez for some time. Clah, however, quickly decides that Blacksheep's murder is not simply a botched car-jacking.MOURNING DOVE is more purely a police procedural than the other Clah mysteries I've read. Navajo life and traditions form the background rather than the foreground of this story. Clah's latest family problems are woven smoothly into the non-stop police action. In addition to the tribal police, the Farmington PD, the county sheriff's office, the FBI, the ATF, the CIA, and the US Army CID are drawn into the widening investigation.

I was hoping these books would be another Native American mystery series comparable to those of Tony Hillerman and Margaret Coel.Well, to say the least, I did NOT find what I was looking for in any of the 3 Thurlo books. I really tried to read them, even picking them up to read again after several hiatuses. However, I just could not get past the 1st or 2nd chapters, because they were SO BORING!I thought the story lines of the plot had potential, if they had been developed in a more structured, compelling and interesting way. The main characters of the story were difficult for me to identify with, or feel empathy for, because they were so one dimensional. It seems that the writers tried to use dialogue to develop their characters and story line, but fell far short of achieving either.This book appears to be mainly dialogue, and not very exciting or interesting dialogue, at that! So, if you are looking for a book of not particularly stimulating, or dynamic dialogue, this is the one for you!

While often they deal with mundane family matters, the letters contain some theological gems that ask and reflect on questions that are as pertinent today as in the 1940s. Letters and Papers from Prison is a must read for anyone who would take the idea of Christianity and the Christian life seriously in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"It's impossible to write a review that can, in any way, describe the depth and intensity of this book. It merits a review of each letter. It is listed in Terry Glaspey's Great Books of the Christian Tradition. It is a collection of letters to and from the great martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer during his two-year imprisonment prior to his hanging in April 1945. The letters express a vast range of thought and emotion. In a few letters, he does express complex theological ideas, but in most of them, it is profoundly readable as he expresses what it means to be human in a difficult situation. He acknowledged the revelation that the Christian life is not lived in theological work or in contemplation or meditation, but in the ups and downs of daily human life. Much of it is difficult to read not only because of the angst it produces but also because of the tears in the reader's eyes make it difficult to see the words on the page. As I have tried to say, the breadth of thought is too great to summarize in a review, but it was notable to me that he stated that he was no longer certain that the ideas he expressed in his book \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" were valid. In the early days, he said that he read the Psalms every day and was reading the Bible straight through. He often quoted Scripture or referred to passages, testifying to his love of and value for the Bible, a Book that too many people deprive themselves of altogether, even though they are free and not confined in prison. He said that he believed that his time in prison was not wasted though he did not know what would come of it. He wrote, \\"I believe that nothing that happens to me is meaningless, and that it is good for us all that it should be so, even if it runs counter to our own wishes. As I see it, I'm here for some purpose, and I only hope I may fulfill it.\\" Of course, his letters themselves present a unique view of what it means to live as a Christian in the most horrible circumstances imaginable. He often said that his fellow prisoners and the guards found him calm and pleasant, while he often felt anything but that inside. He was depressed, happy, lonely, content in solitude, crabby, compassionate. The entire spectrum of human life and feeling is expressed through these letters in a way that could never occur in a formal theology book. And in a sense, he expressed in a simple, straightforward way the thoughts of humankind about life. It is very simple and very profound and heartbreaking, all at the same time. This is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"This compilation is &quot;Pauline&quot; in its style and character. It really is an &quot;epistle&quot;. Like the Apostle Paul, Bonhoeffer's committment to Christ is challenging and his writings are moving. This is a life changing volume and has had a profound affect on me and my Christian walk. I recommend it to any serious reader."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Not all the letters are all that interesting but the situation makes them worth reading. Bonhoeffer was the rare preacher who not only preached the Gospel but also sacrificed his life for it. In his last letter on December 19, 1944 (before his execution) he amazingly suggests that he can still find happiness inside despite all that he has suffered in the various Nazi prisons."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"I read this book several years ago at the behest of my Pastor when I was still a man of faith. And although I've essentially fallen out of that faith in the last few years, I still consider this one of the most inspiring true stories I have ever read. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German minister who openly spoke out against the Nazis-and allegedly even participated in the plot to kill Hitler-was imprisoned in 1943 and eventually hanged by the German government shortly before the end of the war. This is a collection of his correspondence with his family and friends during his two years of incarceration.The strength of this book is that Bonhoeffer was not only a truly courageous man who refused to abandon his principles, but as a Christian, he actually practiced what he preached. This seems to be rare these days and I think the reason that so many people resent Christians and Christianity is that they see so many of them as hypocrites. They constantly talk about God and peace, and righteousness, yet they are so quick to drop a bomb or condemn those that disagree with them. Bonhoeffer represents a pure Christianity of love and justice. This is my take at least and others might disagree with my assessment. With that said, this was a man who truly believed in his God and accepted with dignity whatever fate that God had in store for him. His courage and joy in the face of such a harsh fate is evident in his writings. So, even though I don't share Bonhoeffer's religious beliefs or some of his \\"ethics,\\" I don't hesitate to recommend this truly inspiring book to believers and non-believers alike. My only warning is that there is a lot of theological discussion and those with little or no knowledge of the religion might find these parts a bit over their head."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer clearly had a link with God. Many people may not agree completely with his theology, but as evidenced in his letters he clearly had an understanding from which most people can stand to learn. These letters are raw and real, profound and easily adaptable."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a hero to many - a man who died a martyr for his beliefs. I got a glimpse into Bonhoeffer's pre-WWII theology when I read his Cost of Discipleship. However, Letters and Papers From Prison shows Bonhoeffer from a very different perspective. Most of Letters and Papers deals with Bonhoeffer the man - how he interfaced to his family and friends and how he reacted to imprisonment, restriction of physical freedom, and personal danger. Just this part is fascinating. Then, in the last part of the book, Bonhoeffer delves into theology and his concept of living in a world come of age. His thoughts on this are challenging and influenced many later theologians.This book is a great snapshot of a sensitive, gifted man in the last months of his life. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Although I did not review this specific book personally (It was sent to my son who was in prison.), having read several of Bonhoeffer's other books and heard my son's thankful comments, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Again, another great book. Full of love and encouragement and hope. A great and &#34;helpful&#34; read. My son was deeply touched, moved and blessed."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Bonhoeffer is the real deal.This is the second time I have bought this book. The first time was about 6 years ago when I read it to learn how others had dealt with the Big Questions of Meaning, Values and Ethics across temporal and situational divides. Now I just want to read it again with some larger measure of insight to see what I can learn.Pastor Bonhoeffer seemed to grow stronger as his personal and societal life eroded in prison. This is important to us all in maintaining powerful ethics in a changing world.This is a small spoiler, so stop here if you like. His comments to his family to \\"give everything of mine away,\\" and statements to his hopefully to be bride of how much he loved her are tear shedders. It ended ignominiously, but in Grace, for Herr Bonhoeffer. Recently, I found out that my father was in the US Army Group (XII Army, 372nd Gen Eng Serv Reg ) that \\"liberated\\" Flossenburg 2 weeks after Pastor Bonhoeffer was hung naked, beaten, by a wire around the neck, from a meat hook, by the Gestapo.Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings are seminal to many across the artificial divides from Right to Left, Conservative to Liberal, Christian to Non Christian. Meaning, Values,and Ethics abide.This is not always an easy read due to the German-English translation, the 60 year plus language and cultural differences, and the old school Christian style, but there is true wisdom here. The story is compelling. Stick and Stay with the book to get the whole story.Best to you."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"help but feel a sense of impotent rage as this man chosen for martyrdom writes thinly disguised pleas to his 18 year old fiancee, begging for news of her every smile and the minutae of her daily life.Despite the excruciating loneliness and suffering, Bonhoeffer manages to reach the conclusion of this theology both literally and figuratively. He is desperate to communicate the hope of Christ to a nation mired in worst evil imaginable and also to the entire world. In July of 1944 he elucidates on the meaning of his poem, \\"Christians and Unbelievers\\", which is really unremarkable except for the ideas expressed in it.\\"The Christian must plunge himself into the life of a godless world, without attempting to gloss over its ungodliness with a veneer ofreligion or trying to transfigure it. He must live a 'worldly' life and so participate in the suffering of God. He may live a worldly lifeas one emancipated from all false religions and obligations. To be a Christian does not mean to be religious in a particular way, tocultivate some particular form of asceticism (as a sinner, a penitent or a saint), but to be a man. It is not some religious act whichmakes a Christian what he is, but participation in the suffering of God in the life of the world.\\"The slow recognition that the world (and even in the absence of Hitler one might say that this state of affairs has grown worse) was so devoid of any sense of the divine and therefore any sense of real commitment that most cohesive sense of community among believers had been chopped up into a million insincere rituals and cheery platitudes. Therefore, the task of the true Christian is to hold his/her own in a world without recognition of God's presence and to do His will anyway.And this is precisely what Bonhoeffer did unto death. Before he was hung he thanked all of his guards and a soldier who witnessed the event later said that he had \\"never seen a man go so calmly and submissively to his death.\\" He had thrown himself entirely on the mercy of God when He must have seemed entirely absent. His last poem is manifesto of uncompromising faith. An example of the triumph of the human spirit over ultimate evil."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"At times hard to read, this book gives some insight into the man Bonhoeffer. His relationship with God, and the sheer intelligence of the man are most impressive.

What a great man!"},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Reading his words, we are saddened in knowing he is soon to die a martyr at the young age of 39 by the Nazis. Bonhoeffer fought for biblical truth, and against appeasement. He writes his thoughts (at times very deep and philosophical) from prison, when he entered in 1943 until extradition to another prison over two years later, just before the Allies' liberation in 1945. In his letters to his parents amazingly he is not bitter, but thankful and in good spirits. He was always hopeful. He finds joy in even the smallest of things. Some of the letters we will discover are slightly coded to get through the \\"checkers\\". The preface sums it up better than I can: \\"page by page, these letters show us a picture of life in a prison cell, as it was experienced in all its aspects, with the intimate details of an individual life fused into a striking unity with the disastrous events that were going on in the world outside, a unity produced by an outstanding mind and a sensitive heart.\\"Much of Bonhoefffer's letters were written to his dear friend Eberhard Bethge. Bonhoeffer expounded with difficult theological questions for Bethge........I would like to hear his answers. Bethge as editor writes the foreword and preface, along with what Bonhoeffer experienced during his final days. The preface is a short biography and explains how the papers came to be.The two years Bonhoeffer spent in his dreary jail cell he consumed an immense amount of literature; he discusses his favorites. He also gives us a hint of what jail life was like: the solitude, the allied bombings (air-raids), the cell attendants, and his fellow prisoners, whom he does not justify their pathetic cowardly actions; he believed prison was no excuse for poor behavior.

Prior to the war, Bonhoeffer had established himself as a visionary, if somewhat moderate, young Christian theologian. His imprisonment by the Nazis in the wake of the failure of the conspiracy to assasinate Hitler gave rise to this series of letters, ranging from the trivial to the most profound, reflecting the thoughts and ideas of a man whose ideas continued to evolve, even as hope dwindled. It is tempting to see Bonhoeffer as a sort of modern Christian saint &quot;set-piece&quot; of a man, or a Spielberg movie waiting to be made. Such an interpretation of the man would trivialize the flesh and blood reality of his life, as these letters demonstrate. Collections of letters typically suffer from one of two defects--either they are inanely trivial and gossippy, or they spend far too much time on being &quot;literary&quot; for posterity, and not enough time giving real insight into the writer. Bonhoeffer's letters avoid both of these traps. Although the letters collection is not overly burdened by the confessional, letters to his parents and fiance help us understand in very human terms the horror of imprisonment by the Nazis, notwithstanding their careful phrasing to avoid the censor's pen. The letters do contain some of the intentionally &quot;literary&quot;--Bonhoeffer writes poetry which is reasonably spare and connective and sometimes writes for the hypothetical future reader. But the real tour de force is Bonhoeffer's analysis of the evolution of his theological thought in light of the changes wrought by modernity and made apparent to him through his experiences. In several reasonably succinct but incredibly sweeping letters, he outlines a new vision of Christianity, a form of post-Christian Christianity if you will, which has generated a half century of debate and provided inspiration to Christian and non-Christian alike. In this age in which &quot;liberal&quot; religion has been sadly equated by some with &quot;flaccid&quot; religion, we see through these letters a deeply disciplined thinker outlining the way for Christianity to remain relevant in a world all too ready to try to &quot;outgrow&quot; the faith. Although his thinking is complex, and in some instances he assumes a base of knowledge of late 19th C and early 20th C. Christian theology the 21st C. casual reader may not have, the letters are quite accessible and profoundly human. This is not a man building a neat construct out of his dissertation. This is a condemned man hinting at the blueprint for the transformation of a faith. Although it is tempting to suggest that this is a &quot;Christian masterpiece&quot; of 20th C. faith, the suggestion is a disservice. This is a masterpiece of literature which transcends genre or faith. In the interminable list of intellectual heroes of the 20th C., we rarely see Pastor Bonhoeffer among the honorees. But this book is a powerful argument that this man, who saw the need for religious people to use religion less as a crutch and more as a transformation, should be included prominently in our intellectual heroes list."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"From April 1943 to April 1945, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a prisoner of the Gestapo. Suspected of participating in a plot against Hitler, he was eventually executed in the closing days of World War II. This book is a collection of letters he wrote from prison to his family, his fiancee Maria, and his dearest friend Eberhard.Bonhoeffer was in his late 30s when he was arrested. He was a Lutheran theologian, who had publicly questioned the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in Germany and was systematically silenced by Hitler's government, unable finally to publish any of his writings or to preach in any pulpit. Along with other members of his family, Bonhoeffer secretly participated in an effort led by officers of Army Intelligence to undermine the war effort. Attempting to build a case against him, the Gestapo kept him a prisoner, awaiting trial. Incriminating evidence did not emerge until after the July 1944 attempt on Hitler's life. And at this point the letters stop, as Bonhoeffer was transported to another prison and eventually to a series of concentration camps.The letters in this volume describe in detail the routines of prison life. And they offer a glimpse of life lived by ordinary civilians during months of aerial bombardments, as the fabric of daily life slowly crumbles. They also reveal the thoughts and emotions of a man whose faith in God and trust in survival are put to the severest test. While he is remembered by those who knew him in his last months as a fiercely brave, courageous, and selfless man, we see in the letters his inner turmoil, his fear, loneliness, and sense of isolation in a world his theology never imagined.Included in the collection are polite and cheerful love letters to the young Maria von Wedemeyer, to whom he has proposed marriage. And more deeply moving still are his heart-felt letters to Eberhard Bethge, a fellow clergyman and dearly loved friend. It was Bethge, many years later, who collected these letters and published them; he has also written an extensive biography of Bonhoeffer. (The letters to Maria von Wedemeyer have been published separately as \\"Love Letters from Cell 92\\"). A collection of Bethge's essays on Dietrich Bonhoeffer was publisehd in 1995 under the title \\"Friendship and Resistance.\\" They portray Bonhoeffer's friendship with Bethge and describe how the prison letters between them survived.Bonhoeffer's life should have been that of a theologian much respected in his own time who, in a large body of work, advanced an understanding of God for a modern, secular world. His years cut short, we can only guess what his final contribution would have been. But the letters are an inspiring testament to a life lived without compromise or despair, in the face of overwhelmingly destructive forces."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"If nothing else, you just have to admire Dietrich Bonhoeffer for the stand he made for the truth. Whether or not you agree with his role in the murder plot of Hitler, you have to salute the German theologian for his honesty in this book, which is comprised of letters sent mainly to Eberhard Bethge and his parents. An appendix includes letters that he penned to his fiance Maria. If you want to read this book for pure theology sake, then I would probably turn to The Cost of Discipleship first (which, he mentions in one letter, he wrote partly out a false hope to acquire faith by trying to live a holy life, a very honest admission). But if you want to better understand the man and what he was truly made of in the time of his last two years of life, then this book is very insightful. I don't think anyone can do better to get into the head of this great theologian than to read Letters and Papers From Prison."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"In late 1942, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, \\"... the power of some needs the folly of others. It is not that [intellectual capacities] become stunted or destroyed, but rather that the upsurge of power makes such an overwhelming impression that men are deprived of their independent judgment, and -- more or less unconsciously -- give up trying to assess the new state of affairs for themselves. The fact that the fool is often stubborn must not mislead us into thinking that he is independent. One feels in fact, when talking to him, that one is dealing, not with the man himself, but with slogans, catchwords, and the like, which have taken hold of him. ... folly can be overcome, not by instruction, but only by an act of liberation... a person's inward liberation to live a responsible life before God is the only real cure for folly.\\"Folly and Bonhoeffer were on a collision course.During his long imprisonment by the Nazi regime, Bonhoeffer corresponded with members of his family. Many of these letters were collected, and later published, by Eberhard Bethge, Bonhoeffer's niece's husband. The letters between Bonhoeffer and Bethge, his intellectual and spiritual confidant, are the most insightful in terms of revealing the intellectual Bonhoeffer. Although his life hangs in the balance, Bonhoeffer only occasionally speaks of his own welfare, and then apologetically and only in passing. With Bethge, and to a lesser extent with his father and others, he prefers directing his thoughts to a great breadth of interests -- art, history, music, philosophy, physics, psychology, sociology, theology. With all correspondents, Bonhoeffer expresses constant concern for their welfare, as well as for the welfare of his fellow prisoners and even his Nazi guards. We continually have statements like this one:\\"I wish you much joy and don't want you to be disturbed by any thoughts about me. I have every reason to be so infinitely grateful about everything. ... the prisoners and guards here keep saying how they are 'amazed' (?!) at my tranquillity and cheerfulness. I myself am always amazed about remarks of this kind. But isn't it rather nice?\\"To 'flesh-out' the context for Bonhoeffer's letters, Bethge has included much of the letter writing of his correspondents, and you may choose not to read all of this material. The reader should quickly notice that the language of the letters is, in some passages, less than frank, as in Bonhoeffer's seemingly exaggerated statements of patriotism. One must remember his position, and that of his family. Bonhoeffer speaks of a desire to be able to speak freely one day, to converse face to face. To serve as a pastor, to counsel others, to be a husband to his fiancee, to support and care for his family, to study and write.The Nazis, sadly, had a different agenda."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Closing this book and setting it down on my desk, I feel that it should be one of the most depressing books I've ever read, and to many it may be. Happily, it's one of the most encouraging. Wow, how great this book is!Bonhoeffer's letters begin shortly after the time of his arrest in Berlin in the Spring of 1943. The letters in this collection are mainly those written to his parents and his associate (and husband to his niece) in the German Confessing Church where he was pastor, Eberhard Bethge. At first these letters are fairly basic and simple reassurances of his well-being and encouragements to his friends and family. There is not simply a hope that he will be released from the Tegel Interrogation Prison where he was being held, but an almost naive expectation that his release will be soon. Gradually, with time, Bonhoeffer clearly begins to see the truth of his imprisonment and the reality that he'll probably only be freed upon the defeat of Germany and liberation by the Allied Forces. But it is with this realization that Bonhoeffer's letters become stronger, more passionate, more philosophical, and simply more powerful.Anyone could forgive Bonhoeffer for having become depressed, bitter, and hopeless during his horrendous, Kafkaesque, imprisonment. But amazingly, his spirit is lifted in the opposite direction as his detention carries on. People can debate what the cause of this irrational hope and joy was due to (although Bonhoeffer never appears delusional; rather, very grounded), but Bonhoeffer himself makes it clear throughout that his hope and strength is due entirely, in his belief, to Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit.Eventually, after many letters and papers filled with short stories, poems, pastoral sermons, and theological debates, Bonhoeffer's letters become shorter, less frequent, and more direct, due to the closing of the war and his implication (among hundreds) in the assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20, 1944. But even in these final letters, he is positive and encouraging to his family. Finally, Bonhoeffer's letters stop, and we know from other sources that he died one of the most miserable deaths imaginable, via executionary hanging in the Flossenburg concentration camp, as the Nazis, sensing their downfall, began to eradicate every witness to their crimes. But from his letters we can know what Bonhoeffer would have told us upon learning this: \\"Death is the supreme festival on the road to freedom.\\" Someone who can write that and truly mean it (i.e. not in some hypothetical sense), is either a complete fool, or knows something that many others do not. I believe with Bonhoeffer, the latter applies."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"I bought this book not knowing what to expect. What I found was an odd mixture of thoughts of a man in a horrible position. The letters, poems, notes, and short stories run the gamut of emotions. In one letter Bonhoeffer is examining some theological principle and in another he is keeping up on family relations. If you read this book, you will get an idea of what it must have been like to be a Nazi prisoner and depend on others for your care. You will also learn how much Bonhoeffer cared for his fiancee and best friend. Three words of advice: 1) know a bit about Bonhoeffer's life before you pick up this book, 2) look into the new translation of this book that will be coming out soon from Ausburg Fortress Press and 3) be prepared for an emotional and moving look behind the closed doors of a Nazi prison."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"No theologian of our century has so seriously questioned the premises of our Christian beliefs as Bonhoeffer has. And no one has dared to thrust the Church into the &quot;world&quot; and so honestly explored the implications of doing so, as him. And certainly no one has brought to the world a vision of Christ large enough, embracive enough, to make full-hearted involvement in the secular efforts of our time a Christian imperative. At the mere age of 39, such a light as this was extinguished, and who has there been to take his place?When we are reading L&amp;PFP, we are reading fragments of incomparable genius... fragments that at one point or another were packed in tin cans and buried in the garden of Dietrich's best friend/nephew-in-law (Eberhard Bethge). Because of Bethge's own arrest in October of 1944, many letters were lost... these that survive reveal to us enough of Bonhoeffer's wrestlings with &quot;religionless Christianity&quot; and the &quot;non-religious interpretation of biblical concepts&quot; to conclude that his ideas came from no one who preceded him... he was without a doubt the most original of theological thinkers.The friendship that Dietrich shared with E. Bethge was indeed profound, and as such, he speaks with him in these letters with greater intellectual depth and honesty than is evident in most of his other correspondence. At one point he even expressed the opinion that the success of any of his thought and writing depended on whether or not he would again be given the opportuinity to freely interact with Bethge. That time never came for Dietrich. On April 9, 1945 he was executed at the concentration camp at Flossenburg.Especially poignant is the abrupt end of the contact between Dietrich and Eberhard, and the frustrated attempts of his parents and fiance to locate him. Unbeknownst to all of those closest to him, Dietrich had been transferred to Buchenwald, and one can only inadequately imagine the pain of such loss of contact. Bonhoeffer is a hero of the Christian faith, and I feel that in many ways, the reading of this book ought to be some sort of non-optional Christian event.On February 23, 1944 he wrote: &quot;The important thing today is that we should be able to discern from the fragment of our life how the whole was arranged and planned, and what material it consists of. For really, there are some fragments that are only worth throwing into the dustbin (even a decent 'hell' is too good for them), and others whose importance lasts for centuries, because their completion can only be a matter for God, and so they are fragments that must be fragments... If our life is but the remotest reflection of such a fragment... we will not bemoan the fragmentariness of our life, but rather rejoice in it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Letters & Papers from Prison was a most edifying read, primarily because it stripped away the mystery and mythical aura that surrounded him, before and after his murder by the Nazis in 1945. The fact that his reputation is so universally well known is greatly due in part to his brother-in-law, the late Eberhard Bethge.Having been raised in a very German household myself, I would hear occasional stories from my own father, who grew up in Germany at that time, about the German pastor who was a part of the plot to kill Hitler, the one who was the moral conscience who aided the conspirators while they tried to rid Germany of the diabolical dictator and his vile atrocities that were sweeping throughout the land, for nothing was sacrosanct.Bonhoeffer, known throughout the Christian world for his books, The Cost of Discipleship and Ethics, among other treaties, pamphlets and sermons, was a great example in respects to how a man or woman can truly live an independent Christian life while working in the world and that heroism does not necessarily come from preaching the Gospel, but rather, living it or trying to. It also comes from incorporating nuances of those truths, big or small, into the daily activities of ones life and sharing that Christian goodness (in a healthy and practical manner) with people from all walks of life, irrelevant of class structure, education, ethnic background, et cetera.In this book, Bonhoeffer's theological musings move from the act of suffering to the meaning of love, whether human, religious or even material, and the insights that he shares with some of his correspondents, especially Eberhard Bethge, is sometimes profoundly compelling, and one can endlessly cite the abundant source material to back that up. But while he was accepting his cross of suffering, knowing in a way that it was a gift, he had an agony for those whom he was separated from, specificially his fiance, Maria von Wedemeyer-Weller.The overall profile of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, as presented in this work, showcases an all too human man, sometimes short-tempered and impatient yet very religious, contemplative, moral, ethical and surprisingly creative. For an example of that, read his short fiction piece entitled: \\"Lance-Corporal Berg: A narrative\\" which is almost similarly reminiscent, style-wise, to that of the writer and author Erich Maria Remarque. His poems, however, were not that great, but it made him only more real.Though I am Catholic and my interpretation of Scripture is slightly different, much of what Bonhoeffer wrote spoke volumes to me, especially in tackling the day-to-day challenges and experiences that life has to offer. I think he speaks to many people, and that is good, for what he has to say, by his life, writings, choices, down to his martyrdom can cross all ecumenical boundaries. And that is indeed a remarkable witness."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Although I am not a Christian, I am in awe of Bonhoeffer and of this book, a collection of notes he smuggled out of prison before being executed because of his failed assassination attempt on Hitler. I admire Bonhoeffer more than any human being because he was able to maintain his faith, despite living in times when that faith was challenged more than it had ever been. Bonhoeffer wrote that the world was more &quot;godless&quot; and thus closer to God than it had ever been before. Bonhoeffersaw the world at its worst and yet found affirmation and hope.

Christians frequently quote sections from \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\", re: \\"cheap grace\\", however I bet they won't be quoting this much ! It's also a very personal book. While Bonhoeffer continued to the end to speak in the letters to his parents in traditional terms, the letters to his friend betray a continuing radical shift in his thinking from any conceivable traditional position in Christianity. I am left to wonder whether he even actually intellectually assented to a personal god, in the end. If his god is irrelevant, as he states, then why discuss that god at all ? (Igtheism ?) Very interesting, (and comforting actually) that Dietrich was not, in general, in any way tortured, and in fact grew to love his solitude, and the time it gave him to think and write. There is no way anyone could maintain that his mental faculties were diminished by the prison experience. I wish I had read this a LONG time ago."},{"Title":"Letters and papers from prison (Macmillan paperbacks)","review":"Bonhoeffer, it has to be said, was a man locked up in a prison. He may have been a visionary, a great leader, but he ended up in prison and had to cope with that. There is a drabness to his writing. It doesn't quite lift you up. It doesn't quite inspire you. Of course, it was his own choice. He didn't have to wage war with the Nazis. He didn't have to come back from America and put his head in the lion's mouth. He went back knowing what was in store for him. It's questionable whether he achieved anything after that. Posthumously? Possibly. But his writings from prison?

The above quote I found on page sixty-one in this work; Pages 56 to 69 is an outline of a letter to the judge advocate Dr. Roeder; Reading this outline I perceive a prisoner making his case that he is cooperative to the state to the state, not oppose to the war, and not a hindrance to the German Government. It is not an argument for a higher calling to serve God or mankind. No his words describe a defense that he has been cooperative with the state. One certainly can make the argument Bonhoeffer was frightened and compare it to Peter denying Jesus three times? It is one of the reasons I wished I had spent my time reading a biography about Dietrich Bonhoeffer instead of this particular book.I did not read anything in his letters that the man was particular against the cause of the war or those who lead Germany. I read about a man who suffered hardship because he lived in Germany in those dark years in Germany; about a man who had a loving family and friends. I read about a man who had an eye view of the Berlin bombing and who was in danger because of it. Very little and arguably nothing speaks particular of the Nazi evil of the war. There are three particular works within the book that give theological flavor: on marriage, infant baptism, and Corporal Berg.I debated whether to give the book two stars or three stars.

It ought to be considered a companion to Swaine and Tellis' excellent INTERPRETING CHINA'S GRAND STRATEGY.They author'shave four ultimate recommendations, briefly summed:1) The US should &quot;deepen and widen&quot; its bilateral security relationships throughout the region.2) The US should pursue a balance-of-power strategy among the major rising powers and key regional states in Asia that aren't within the US' alliance.3) The US should draw clear lines in the sand over the use of force (Taiwan figures preeminently in this), while trying to resolve territorial disputes and avoid being dragged into them (i.e., Mischief Reef).4) The US should promote security dialogue among all Asian states. (Elevating the smallest states puts a higher political imperative on a regional aggressor, this is probably the most stabilizing recommendation)The overall analysis of the security balance in the region is the best part of this work. It allows a quick overview of American views on other countries' perspectives, concerns, and intents.The weakest part is probably the attempt at recommending force structure changes. Although the ideas are good, they don't seem particularly well fleshed out. RAND is best at considering Air Force needs, thus there is no real consideration of Naval force structure beyond its aircraft supporting or being supported by Air Force. This is a somewhat glaring omission, as the Air Force may be a powerful deterrent as well as utterly essential in wartime, the Navy's function as GUARANTATOR of peace and stability on the surface as well as protective of SLOCs must be considered in any comprehensive review. The considerations of Air Force force structure (emphasis on long-range strike platforms) is well done, and an integration of Naval fighters as protective is overdue. This integration of specialization allows for a more effective and meaningful division of labor without sacrificing capability. That section, though, is far too short; I assume (or hope) because of security classification issues.With its appendicies, this book comes out at over 200 pages.

I found Huxley's account of his trip round Guatemala, Mexico and the Caribbean boring. For him, Indians are uncivilized. \\"The village Indian can read, but his mind is so conditioned that he cannot understand what he reads,\\" he says. Still, it seems Huxley doesn't think much of the masses in general; \\"The intrinsic and congenital stupidity of the majority is as great as it ever was. Universal education has created an immmense class of what I may call the New Stupid.\\"After reading this, I would classify Huxley among his ranks of the New Stupid. He states on page 152 that \\"to civilize primitives may be impossible\\". He seems to have been influenced (brainwashed?) by D.H. Lawrence's book The Plumed Serpent. According to Huxley, \\"No-one has ever written more forcibly than Lawrence in The Plumed Serpent of the hopeless squalor and stuffiness of human beings who have not yet reached the spiritual and mental stage of consciousness.\\" In an Indian colonel he sees \\"a profound, hopeless melancholy\\". Huxley's explanation: \\"He had, I suppose, enough of our education to make him aware of his own Indianness.\\"After reading this, I suspect that people like Huxley and Lawrence had reached the stage of hopeless stuffiness, although it's not clear if Huxley shared Lawrence's view, as expressed in vol 3 of the Letters of D.H.

There is plenty of coverage of the every season from 1990-1998 due to the prominence and popularity of Michael Jordan but the great 1993-94 season is mentioned only in passing if it all in most basketball books on this period. Unfortunately, this book came up short of my hopes.The biggest problem with this book is that it focuses little on basketball. The Hue Hollins call, which cost the Bulls a likely trip to the NBA finals, is mentioned only once. Their regular season record is mentioned at various points but there is nothing, aside from a passing mention to a loss in the penultimate game of the season, about the stretch run which saw the Bulls battle the Knicks and Hawks for the #1 seed. She spends about two pages discussing the Bulls' efforts to acquire a legitimate starting two guard to fill the void left by Michael Jordan before the trade deadline.When it comes to the playoffs you would think Jim Mora wrote this book! There is no substance about the playoffs. She spends plenty of time on \\"1.8gate\\" but that is pretty much it for her coverage of the playoffs. We are told about a jacket Corie Blount wore but told absolutely nothing about the Bulls' sweep of Cleveland and given about four sentences worth of substance (Myers frustrated Starks, Pippen had no help, Cartwright had a good series, Hue Hollins made a controversial call. That is it!) about the great Bulls-Knicks series.She does a good job talking about the various personalities on the team and you learn about their backgrounds, what they were like, what they were thinking but the problem with this is she spends as much time talking about Pete Myers as she does talking about Scottie Pippen. I liked the chapters on Horace Grant's clashes with management and his consequent desire to leave the team and Toni Kukoc's transition to America and the NBA.There was no coherence to the book. It was not chronological. It was divided based on the personality she focused on. There is a weird chapter on her life as a sports reporter that had nothing to do with the Bulls.All in all it is a decent book. If you are a diehard Bulls fan this book is worth reading. It is short and you will learn some things.

If you want the other end of the spectrum, you might consider this one.Of course, on the tenth volume, one would expect this to be lesser episodes -- you won't be disappointed if this is what you expect. This set does represent all three seasons equally (as do #s 4 and 8, though both collections were superior to this).My favorite episode in this is \\"The Empath\\". However, this contains some of my least favorite episodes, such as \\"Is There In Truth No Beauty,\\" \\"Galileo 7,\\" and \\"A Private Little War.\\"That said, there are some good science fiction premises. There are three episodes each (one from each season) dealing with alternative universes and the edge of the galaxy, and one of each is in this volume (\\"The Alternative Factor\\" and \\"Is There In Truth No Beauty?\\" respectively). This volume also contains one of the three \\"Prime Directive\\" trio, where a friend of Kirk's violates the directive not to interfere with a culture, and siding with the bad guys: In this case, it's \\"The Omega Glory\\". By the way, I find it interesting that two episodes alluding to the Cold War but from different perspectives are back to back: The anti-Vietnam \\"A Private Little War\\" preceding \\"The Omega Glory\\" where the Yangs (Yanks) defeat the Goms (Coms, or Communists).If you're a Star Trek fanatic, or if you happen to enjoy one of these episodes, you'll enjoy this book.

The episodes aren't sorted into books according to either chronological order or identity of screenwriter.\\"The Alternative Factor\\" (episode 21, season 1, screenplay Don Ingalls). Personally, I always think of this episode as 'What of Lazarus?', one of Kirk's final lines. While surveying an uninhabited planet, ENTERPRISE experiences the first of a series of tremendous disturbances, during which apparently everything in existence *ceases* to exist for an instant - and in which Lazarus, a human-appearing alien, appears on the planet. He claims to be pursuing a great evil, although nothing else seems to be around. After he's taken to ENTERPRISE's sickbay, the truth begins to emerge: that there are two apparently identical Lazaruses, one each from a different universe; that one is insane, wanting only to destroy the other; that if they ever meet in either universe, both universes will be destroyed; and that a meeting seems inevitable. Despite the ENTERPRISE's help, the real hero of this story is Lazarus - one of them, at least.\\"The Empath\\" (episode 63, season 3, screenplay Joyce Muskat) ENTERPRISE arrives in the Minaran system to retrieve a research team before the star goes nova; stellar activity forces the ship to leave the away team - Kirk, Spock, McCoy - alone on planet for a time. Except that they're not alone: a previously unknown superpower race, the Vians, have arranged a meeting between the away team and a mute empath, whom McCoy names 'Gem', who can heal with a touch - although she herself must experience the injuries to do so. The away team learns that the researchers have been tortured to death by the Vians for some reason connected with Gem - but the Vians appear detached rather than sadistic, so something more is obviously going on, as the Vians shift their focus to the ENTERPRISE team.\\"The Galileo Seven\\" (episode 14, season 1, screenplay Simon Wincelberg and Oliver Crawford; the latter contributed to \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" and \\"The Cloud Minders\\"). An episode designed to reveal character, along the lines of \\"The Naked Time\\". The situation: Spock is dispatched with a crew of 6 - including Scotty - aboard the shuttlecraft GALILEO to comply with a standing order to investigate quasar-like phenomena to avoid delaying ENTERPRISE's urgent assignment to deliver medical supplies. A combination of factors brings about the crash of the GALILEO on an uninhabited planet while simultaneously causing ENTERPRISE to lose contact, so the GALILEO's crew with their limited resources must scramble to ensure rescue before ENTERPRISE is forced to leave the area on its medical mission - awaiting the ship's return might be a fatal delay.\\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\" (episode 62, season 3, screenplay Jean Lisette Aroeste; see also \\"All Our Yesterdays\\"). ENTERPRISE is to transport Medusan ambassador Kollos, his human companion Dr. Miranda Jones, and Marwick, one of ENTERPRISE's designers, to the Medusan home planet. While humans ordinarily cannot bear the unshielded sight of a Medusan, Vulcans - and the Vulcan-trained telepath Dr. Jones - can. Dr. Jones' personal issues come from other sources: jealousy that Spock might potentially be more effective than she at contact with Kollos, and a realization that someone at the ENTERPRISE's formal reception harbours murderous thoughts toward Kollos. A mystery hidden in plain sight, unusual for STAR TREK.\\"A Private Little War\\" (episode 45, season 2, screenplay Don Ingalls and Gene Roddenberry) One of the sleazy little conflicts between the Klingons and the Federation that, taking place through 3rd parties, manages to avoid breaking the letter of the Organian Peace Treaty. Revisiting a low-technology planet he first encountered as a young lieutenant aboard the FARRAGUT, Kirk finds that his old friend Tyree has married Nona, a Kahn-Ut-Tu woman of power and risen to lead his tribe - and that their traditional enemies have acquired superior weaponry from the Klingons, in the form of primitive firearms. Several issues: Nona is ambitious, and very clever both at manipulating others and at acquiring information without losing her mystique. Tyree, peaceful at heart, resists some of her plans, but is largely under Nona's control.\\"The Omega Glory\\" (episode #54, next-to-last of season 2, screenplay Gene Roddenberry). Some similarities to \\"Miri\\" (1st season), as ENTERPRISE learns that the crew of the EXETER have all died of a peculiar condition picked up on Omega IV - all except the landing party who remained on planet - and that the crew members who beamed aboard EXETER are now also faced with a choice between death and exile on Omega IV if no cure can be found. Ron Tracey, EXETER's captain, survived - and noting the unusual longevity of the inhabitants of Omega IV, has deduced that the disease naturally prolongs life. Some interesting violations of the Prime Directive occur, as Tracey succumbs to temptation - but he lives to regret underestimating the inhabitants of Omega IV. Interesting points, although encumbered with unnecessary parallel-Earth syndrome."},{"Title":"Refuge from Abuse: Healing and Hope for Abused Christian Women","review":"Directed toward past and present sufferers of domestic abuse, this book gleans expertise from authors with two diverse backgrounds--Nancy Nason-Clark, a sociologist, and Cathie Clark Kroger, a biblical scholar--to provide multi-dimensional insight into the insidious reality of domestic violence. Hands down, the greatest values of this book are (1) its breadth of topic--investigating many issues in violence against women, and (2) the varied methods the writers use to convey the information presented.At a glance, segments of bulleted information throughout provide a quick, pithy resource with captions such as \\"A Relationship is Not Healthy When,\\" \\"Things to Ponder if You are a Victim of Abuse,\\" and \\"Signs that the Church is a Safe Place to Disclose that I am a Battered Woman.\\" In similar fashion, common myth such as \\"Abuse doesn't happen in our region,\\" \\"...our neighborhood,\\" \\"...my church,\\" \\"...my family,\\" and \\"...to me,\\" is dispelled early on.Within its 173 pages, the text affords numerous vignettes of abusive situations, each concluding with a summary making explicit the present dynamics: past history, mental health issues, alcohol or drug influence, and other facilitators of violence and abuse cycles. The stories presented are of exceptional value in that they show the vast diversity in how domestic violence manifests--sometimes beginning as early as a couple's honeymoon (or before), in other instances beginning after a couple's retirement; violence occurring for years, or as an isolated--never repeated incident; some women abused by men without religion, others abused by husbands who pastor an evangelical church.Adding another dimension, Biblical stories are vividly retold, and while characters in company with Hagar, David, Rizpah, and Mary come to life, readers can empathize by linking the universality of their hardship with the adversity of these saints. Other explicit Scriptural teachings within the work investigate the Biblical evidence that domestic violence is sinful, and one chapter provides an appropriate exegesis of separation and divorce.Regarding intervention, an eclectic approach to abuse recovery is proposed that utilizes community care (legal, medical, and social resources) as well as spiritual aid for Christian women, for it is suggested the Christian \\"church can't deal with family violence in isolation from other community services.\\" In support of this, the authors' suggest that few women seek religious services in response to abuse as they write, \\"Where did these women seek help? Some reported the violence to the police, some to a community resource agency...Hardly any women told their pastor.\\" However, this quotation is a curious discrepancy in relation to the authors' previous work that references research reporting 54% of religious and 38% of nonreligious women sought help from a religious professional in the aftermath of violence in the home.A wealth of pragmatic content summarizes what kinds of services one should expect from particular community agencies, as well as from pastors and church ministries; legal information about restraining orders and leaving the home; details about staying in a shelter; and significantly more. Step-by-step instructions are a repeating theme and the reader is provided a veritable roadmap to refuge detailing extra-precautions to be made when leaving a dangerous situation, as well as steps to take when seeking protection from a violent partner.Finally, the path to recovery is alleged to engage spiritual healing and often mental health counseling, for the task may involve reforming personal characteristics that put one at risk of an abusive relationship in the first place (i.e. low self worth, fear of the future, dependency, fear of being alone). Notably, the act of forgiveness in the process of recovery is discussed.In sum, this work is pragmatic, encouraging and scripturally sound. Though comprehensive it does not \\"bog down\\" and a woman using the book only briefly will be able to procure much of its value. Lastly, this book does not lean toward the dramatic but serves to be a sound, reasonable and reassuring voice for women in the turmoil of abusive situations."},{"Title":"Refuge from Abuse: Healing and Hope for Abused Christian Women","review":"received product in timely manner, condition of book was excellent as described.

So what a shock when I picked up what I thought would be a pot-boiler by Randy Wayne White and was absolutely knocked cold by who, I think, is a genuinely brilliant writer. I've read all of White's books and they led me to other Florida writers: James. W. Hall, Carl Hiaasen and Mr. Shames. I have just finished Mangrove Squeeze and it is, frankly, far beneath the quality of the books by the aforementioned writers. It is trite, strained, predictible and just plain silly. Mr. Shames tries so hard to be a tough guy and it just doesn't ring true. He tries equally hard to be literate and literary. Same results. Sorry -- I seldom write negative reviews but this guys is out of his league."},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"Laurence Shames is a very enjoyable writer if you are alive and well living in this decade.

And I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard! I kept waking my girlfriend up I was laughing so hard in bed! This book has the kind of wry sense of humor that is so hard to find. It also has sweet, likeable characters. And Shames has left out a lot of the violent nastiness a lot of other writers in this genre go so heavy on! I can't wait for my next trip literary trip to Key West!"},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"'Mangrove Squeeze' is my third Laurence Shames novel (after 'Florida Straits' and 'Sunburn') and is easily the worst of the bunch. Yes, it has the same south Florida setting and similarly quirky characters. But the plot fails to ignite, and the laughs are comparatively few.In 'Mangrove Squeeze' we have big crime by the Russian mafia in small town Key West. A nosey do-gooder from the local weekly newspaper gets herself in trouble with these guys, gets her boyfriend caught in the middle of it, and ... so the story goes. As a previous reviewer has noted, 'Mangrove Squeeze' does pass the time rather nicely. But otherwise it is forgettable in every way.Bottom line: useful beach-reading material. But you won't want to keep it on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"This is possibly the funniest book I have read in a while and I really appreciate when an author makes me laugh.

Fred & Pineapple who live in a fiberglass hot dog on the outskirts of Key West, the Russian mafia with their mispronunciations that had me in stitches, the old geezers Sam & Bert with his \\"moribund chihuahua.\\" The book was published over a decade ago, but it still captures the essence of Key West and the crazies who live there. The plot is good even though it is a bit far-fetched. The story takes a more sinister turn at the end, which jarred a bit with the overall tone but, hey, 5 stars for witty dialogue and hilarious images of the afore-mentioned characters."},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"...and still my favorite. It isn't as funny, comical and absurd as some of his other stuff, but it is more touching. Where the others go out to produce some fairly hectic action, this one here is more quiet and almost deliberate. Characters other than the central ones get more screen-time, and this is all for the good.Shames's language and descriptions mirror the tone of the novel. Instead of going for comedic, he tends toward affectionate for the protagonists and grim to pathetic for the bad guys.I liked this book. It has a lot of heart and a lot of soul. An interesting change of pace from his other ones.Till Noever, owlglass.com"},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"Not one of Shame's best, but the shenanigans of the Ruski Mafiosos in Key West intermingled with a nice little love story with a few whackoes in the guise of Fred and Pineapple, the introduction of Sam Katz and the return of the elderly Bert the shirt with his constipated chihuahua makes a breezy read, which is the way it should be.Laurence Shames ranks with the best of the Florida Mystery Genre writers. And like them he has a voice of his own, writing excellent descriptions and dialogue. It's a form, it's an art.It is a difficult genre to do well, and Mangrove Breeze is well written. Often people poo-poo such writers, but in truth The Florida Mystery Genre can scale the heights of good writing, often bettering so-called modern literature.I suggest the reviewer &quot;A shopper, February 7, 1999&quot;, who gave Shames 1 out of 5 stars for Mangrove Squeeze, go and do some homework, despite telling us that &quot;I teach writing for a living --literature, we call it. ...&quot; I don't believe &quot;A shopper&quot; knows what literature is.A note here to the publishers and cover designers: The paperback cover of Mangrove Squeeze is fabulous. It gives you a laugh and makes you want to buy the book. The same cannot be said of the hardcover however, which is often the case."},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"This is the best of the Laurence Shames books.

The beauty of his language just gets better, &quot;gnarly knots of mangrove roots.&quot;If you haven't noticed, I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"Shames once again puts together a passable-but hardly noteworthy-South Florida thriller in the vein of Carl Hiassen, Elmore Leonard, et al. This time he trots in the tired specter of Russian mafia types running tawdry tourist t-shirt shops as a money laundering operation for the big bucks they make as brokers for ex-Soviet art and weaponry. Against these cardboard villains are arrayed an ex-Wall Street type who left it all to forget about his divorce, take care of his father, and renovate an old hotel; a Jersey transplant called Suki who's stuck in a dead-end job, two creaky old men, and two nice semi-homeless guys. Through it all there's a kind of stumbling, bumbling good naturedness-which serves to heighten the nastiness of the Russians. The outcome is hardly surprising, but it passes the time and is slightly more successful than two other of his books I've read, The Naked Detective and Scavenger Reef,"},{"Title":"Mangrove Squeeze","review":"Another fine book by my now-favorite author, Lawrence Shames! If you love his previous books as much as I did, you'll love how in this book he brings in a character from past stories.

It was very different from the movie and I found I liked it better than the movie. Much to my surprise the book also had 'After Worlds Collide'The dreams I had about living on the new planet and in the domed cities....I wore out two paperback copies over the next thirty odd years.The books were written almost eighty years ago and although a bit dated in science and dialog are still a good read.I am very happy that Amazon had this copy and I enjoyed them all over again."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Countless books have been written about the end of the world, it's not a new concept.

Too be sure there are some outdated ideas as one would expect for a novel written 80 years ago, but considering the scienctific understanding and what was the social nornal at the time it's very believable. The desription of space ship construction is almost NASA-like. Interesting Biblical references without being preachy which is not the norm today as well. There are few novels where the end of the world really means the end of the world like When Worlds Collide.

Around 80 years old, it gives great perspective not only into the scientific knowledge of the time, but also to the cultural biases that existed. 80 years is less than some lifetimes yet so much has changed...That said, while the story moves along at a good pace, I never really found it to be very fun to read. The characters were a bit cardboard I thought, simple solutions were often applied to complicated problems, and often the actual action - the resolution of conflict - was done in as little as a simple sentence (for example the resolution of the Tony / Eve / Ransdell triangle).I would recommend this book to anyone with some interest in classic science fiction, or in apocalypse stories.

Yes, the characters are all two-dimensional, and of course various social details are dated. But the plot is so compelling that: who cares!Anyway, the first book leaves you hankering for more, and the second book more than satisfies that hankering. Again there is edge-of-your-seat adventure. But for me the overriding pleasurable impression is of mystery. I won't give away the details, but suffice it to say: they are an excellent surprise, and I wish this had been a trilogy! Nevertheless, the book is actually more true-to-life in that some things remain unanswered and unknown. Really, the mysterious aura of the second book provides a kind of satisfaction in its own right.Now I've got to find other books by Wylie!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I first read this back in the early 80's and because of it, fell in love with science fiction.The book describes the death of the Earth in horrifying detail. The Noah's Ark theme is classic, where a group of survivors board rockets (arks) in order to escape the destruction of the planet. All in all, the authors give a good story, rich with adventure, emotion and incredible new worlds.Not perfectly explainable in terms of science, but enjoyable even today."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I too read this book when I was young boy. It is the book that sparked my interest in reading. I have been looking for this book for many years and was so excited when I finally found it on Amazon. This book is for all you space nuts that can't tear yourself away from the apocalyptic visions of our planet on Discovery and TLC. This is the ultimate doomsday scenario ever written."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I discovered this one when I was in 5th grade. Buying it now, 30 years later, I was worried that it just wouldn't hold up. To my delight, it stands up to the test of time magnificently.We've seen movies and TV specials in the past few years on the impact of some cosmic body with Earth (Deep Impact, Armageddon, Meteor). Balmer and Wylie did it decades ago, and did it on a scale and with an attention to (then-current) detail that's still staggeringly convincing, if dated, today.Written before WWII (1933 and 34), When Worlds Collide features the destruction of the Earth in the most complete manner possible, and focuses on the efforts of a few people to find a way to escape that destruction. The manner in which they do so is brilliantly thought out and detailed, the progressive deterioration of both society and of the Earth itself is heartwrenchingly chronicled, and the final flight from the doomed planet is a classic. Yes, we have super-science, purple prose, and sometimes overly-simplistic characters (not to mention outdated concepts), but this is an example of the Golden Age that can still stand on its own. It DEFINED the disaster novel, and set the bar so high that few who came after even dared attempt the grand scale that Balmer and Wylie achieved. The sequel has its own charm, a combination of aftermath and exploration, with some eerie scenes that still give me a bit of the creeps to read."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Many of the earlier reviews on this site call for a reissue of the sequel, \\"After Worlds Collide\\". Please note: BOTH STORIES, \\"When Worlds Collide\\" and \\"After Worlds Collide\\", are contained in this paperback version. The title is misleading because it only includes \\"When...\\" -- but both stories are there.Other reviewers have correctlly noted that there are some scientific inaccuracies, and some 1930s political and social views that seem out of place today. Who cares?! This is a wonderful story. In part 1, the authors concoct an excellent apocalyptic scenario. And in part 2, their conception of the alien planet is brilliant.This is a very well-told yarn."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Probably the best science fiction story of all times! A &quot;gas giant&quot; planet about the size of Uranus was dragged away from its original orbit around its sun in a distant solar system by a passing star, perhaps millions of years ago. Also dragged away was the gigantic planet's satellite, an earthlike planet. The two bodies retain their original orbital influence and wonder for eons, frozen in the absolute zero of space, until they come close enough to our solar system and are pulled in, attracted by the gravity of our own sun, their speeds increased several times in their endless travel through space. Star gazers soon discover that at least one of the newly discovered bodies will collide with and destroy the earth. Upon being discovered by a South African astronomer Professor Bronson, the two bodies are named by scientists after its discoverer. The larger one, the gaseous &quot;Bronson Alpha&quot;, will destroy the earth, so a Noah's Ark rocket is built at a franctic pace to provide escape of 100 chosen would be travelers, so they can start a new life in Alpha's companion, the earthlike &quot;Bronson Beta&quot; which will replace the Earth in its orbital position. Time is of essence in this classic sci-fi thriller which should be remade by Hollywood in state or the art computerized special effects and sound!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Two rogue planets, one the satellite of the other, are heading directly toward the earth. The scientists who make this horrifying discovery have a plan to save a small remnant of humanity.The story is engaging enough that I was content to suspend my disbelief at the implausibility of the disaster and especially of the opportunity for survival. Much of the entertainment value of the book is in its being old: news of the impending disaster is spread by newspaper; atomic power is being hastily developed; and the attraction between two main characters is expressed only in passionate kisses.There's plenty of apocalyptic fiction I'd recommend over this (e.g., \\"The Road,\\" \\"Earth Abides,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" and \\"Alas, Babylon\\"), but \\"When Worlds Collide\\" is entertaining enough for a rainy Saturday."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I first read this book more than thirty years ago. I have read it many times since and it will always remain on my list of all-time favorites. This is a book in the tradition of Verne and Wells in that it brings many basic scientific principles to life and makes them understandable to the reader.Against the backdrop of universal disaster, Wylie and Balmer manage to tell a story that has real human dimensions. Love, hate, ingenuity, and compassion all play out here in characters that will truly engage the reader. Furthermore, the scope of adventure the book gives will compel the reader to keep turning the pages, eager to see what happens next. In this way the book is a true success. However, for the discerning reader, the story also raises some perplexing and even disturbing questions, giving it a depth that mere adventure can't.My career as a geographer and mathematician can trace its genesis to one book, and that book is WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. So I personally owe its authors a great deal, and so does all science-fiction because this book epitomizes the genre's greatest strengths."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I first read When Worlds Collide/After Worlds Collide in the 1960's, while in junior high school. They were my introduction into what I considered adult science fiction, and I was hooked! After thinking about them for years, I finally ordered them, hoping the books would not disapoint so years many later. The themes are just as current today, though the prejudices and some science are certainly outdated. I highly recommend this book for pleasurable reading as well as a look into science fiction writing from the 1930's. Note that this volumn contains BOTH books bound together."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"This book and its sequel are two of the greatest sci-fi books I have ever read and read and read. I have re-read them at least 5 times since I first read them as a teenager. In fact I still have the books I bought as a teenager!It's a monumental epic struggle to save the human race and the trials and tribulations of a group of scientists as they prepare to save the human race. It's also a look in to the dark side of man when faced with annihilation and too much time to contemplate it.I would recommend this book and the second book, After Worlds Collide, to anyone, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"This is a true science-fiction classic. The reason is simple: it is plausible. I first read this story almost forty years ago when I was in junior high school, and in the intervening years, it has lost none of its' fascination for me. I especially was taken by the sequel. The basic story is this: an astronomer discovers two planets from outside the solar system that are on a collision course with earth. One of them is a gas giant the size of Uranus, the other is a planet similar to earth, which will be destroyed. The other planet will assume the approximate orbit that the earth had. The scientists of earth build space vehicles in an attempt to save the human race. When I heard it was back in print, I orderd a copy and was very happy to find that the sequel was included. After Worlds Collide deals with the adventures of the people who land on the new planet.Some of the criticisms of these books are somewhat understandable. For example, the dialogue is sometimes--to be charitable--unrealistic. And the absence of diversity will offend some. There were only whites and Asians mentioned, and the &quot;Asiatics&quot; were, for the most part,the villains. Ignoring these relatively minor flaws however, still leaves a story that fascinates.One disappointment in the Bison reprints is that they do not have the maps of the new planet in it, but I am still glad it is back in print.If your local bookstore does not have it, order it. I doubt that you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Once the reader remembers that this work and its sequel, After Worlds Collide, were written in the 1930s prior to WWII the imagination of Balmer and Wylie regarding space and rocket development, as well as the psychology of the &quot;hate cultures&quot; was brillant. As a young man my imagination soared while reading these novels. The screen play discarded too much of the character development available in the the book. I strongly urge any lover of good science fiction to get a copy for a great read. I only scored the original as 4 stars, but if you are fortunate to have &quot;When&quot; and &quot;After&quot; to read concurrently, then you will have a 5 star experience."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Though this book was written back in the thirties and has a very strong political bias, it's got an ingenious idea and an exciting and realistic plot. The existence of the human civilization is threatened by an asteroid which is about to collide with Earth. Frantic preparations begin to save the mankind from disaster. Read and see what happens.This novel has a follow-up \\"After Worlds Collide\\" which isn't good at all."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Like so many people who have read this book, I too have read it many times. It is that type of book. I read it the first time as a young boy, and over the years (when I can find a copy)I read it again. It captured my imagination from the beginning and has not let go in over 40 years. I believe this book, with its vivid scenes of catastrophe, and its portrayal of the triumph of human ingenuity, affected me deeply for the rest of my life. This book illuminates ones imagination, sense of wonder and longing for adventure. I heartily recommend it for readers of all ages, and sincerely wish that this book will be published again for a new generation. I am sure that this book, and its exciting sequel (After Worlds Collide), which is full of mystery and intrigue, will capture the imaginations of yet another generation. Just imagine what Hollywood could do with a remake of this novel as a movie!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Perhaps the granddaddy of the science-fiction subgenre of cosmic impact novels, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; takes a totally implausible situation and makes it a deadly serious story...It doesn't look at itself and chuckle...It presses on like the end of the world really is tomorrow...That, and the fact that it is a disaster novel, are what save this novel...Although the movie version has not been well received, it does give a rare opportunity to view some familiar faces, including Frank Cady (Sam Drucker on Green Acres and Petticoat Junction), John Hoyt (Grandpa on Gimme A Break), and Hayden Rorke (Dr. Bellows on I Dream of Jeannie)."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"While this book is often refered to as a &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; book, to me it was a story about people put in a fantastic situation. The old testament biblical subtext was evident even to me as a child. The second book, After Worlds Collide, was better than the first and a good example of a sequel surpassing the original. While there was a satisfying resolution, I have always wanted to know what happened to this brave new world in the making after the story ended. I did not enjoy the 1951 movie, though many people did. Someone, please reprint both of these jewels!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"The school nurse recommended this book to me when I was in the fifth grade. It was the first science fiction book I ever read. After Worlds Collide was the second one. Like many other people, I re-read these books at least a dozen times--and would love to read them again. With all the recent talk of &quot;near miss&quot; (we hope!) asteroids in our neighborhood, these books would be of particular interest to lots of people who've never heard of them. They need to be back in print.By the way, if you haven't seen the movie---don't bother. Someone might be able to remake it more true to the book (in which case I'd check it out), but it would probably be just another dumb disaster film. I'd rather see a film version of After Worlds Collide. I still explore those cities in my dreams....Another book I read back in the fifth grade was Earth Abides, by George Stewart. It, too, is timely albeit for another reason. An unknown disease destroys most of humankind. No miracle cures just in time to save us---just a few survivors, and what happens after that. Much of the story takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area, which made it very real to me when I read it in 1960. Sometimes, when the bridge is not crowded I still look for a certain abandoned car.... I'd love to see this one made into a film, too."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Like many others, I too first encountered (and read for the first of many re-readings) When Worlds Collide and its sequel After Worlds Collide when I was in seventh grade. It remains for me a vivid experience. What a tremendous epic adventure written in a straightforward, clear style with terrific descriptions and lots of great action, and the sequel has a wonderful mystery about it which elevates it above the first. Both novels are well worth reprinting and I would be glad to know of this as my paperback copies are getting pretty discolored by now."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I read the two books as a child in german language; they are in the same categorie as Heinlein, Assimov and so on"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I first read this book (and it's sequel,&quot;After Worlds Collide&quot;) in my early teens and it has remained a dear friend since then.

You may have to wait for awhile, but ultimately, you'll get you copy!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I first read this book as a child. I have probably read it at least a dozen times. For those who are not aware of this, it is actually two books - When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide. I actually prefer the second.I own a copy of the movie, which was made in 1951.

It detailed the efforts of rocket scientists to build a rocket to escape a doomed earth.That did it. I decided I wanted to be a writer. I sat down and wrote my two-page epic \\"Third Company Advance.\\" This told the story of an infantry commander who orders the third company to advance and \\"it '''felt good.\\"My father, the former World War II infantry company commander upon whom I patterned my fearless lead character, was delighted with my work. Reminding me that Phil Wylie had promise he would illustrate any book I wrote, he dragged the bashful aspiring author to the master's house. I stood blushing while words of praise were heaped on me.Phil didn't illustrate \\"Third Company Advance\\" but he gave me something better. Finding a Pocketbook edition of When Worlds Collide, he gave it to me. Although the book long ago disappeared, I remember the inscribed words so clearly:\\"To Ware,my permanent pal and apparent competitor,Best wishes,Philip Wylie.\\"And so fifty or so years later, I want to return the compliment. This remains great science fiction."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer have produced possibly the earliest of global disaster novels. The most frightening thing about this book is its plausibility; there is the ever-present danger it could very well happen! If you read this story, you'll be well-prepared to view the George Pal 1951 film of the same title which is loosely based on this novel, and appreciate its presentation. Two more recent films, &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, and &quot;Armageddon&quot;, appear to have been inspired by this book."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"It must seem repetitious when looking at all these five star reviews, but it deserves it, as does its brilliant sequel, After Worlds Collide. Even when the book is so clearly dated -- it was, after all, written in the 1930s -- it is nevertheless riveting. I can only concur with the many other reviewers in calling for a reissue of this book -- preferable in an omnibus edition with its sequel (as in fact has been done in the past). And if only Steven Spielberg would work on doing a remake, not only of When Worlds Collide itself, but its remarkable sequel, perhaps updating it and correcting the (remarkably few!) scientific flaws. If you've never read these books, find them!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I read all the science-fiction books in our high school library in 1958 and by far this was and has been the BEST Science-Fiction book I've ever seen. In April of 1972 I was fortunate enough to find When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide published in 1 book, published by J.B. Lippincott Company It is bound as 1 book with both books in it. Both are about 340 pages long. To me After Worlds Collide was the better of the 2 books, but you need the lead-in When Worlds Collide to prepare you for After. I was intrigued by the old civilization found on the new planet. Especially since this was written in the 1930's. A super combination book. A REAL CLASSIC !!!"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"It's remarkable how well this book holds up after 70 years. It's not exactly =hard= science-fiction, and it emphasizes a lot of social issues, which is probably one of the reasons it has aged so well. Most importantly, it tells the story expertly, with a good amount of suspense and intrigue (and a lot less misanthropy than can be found in the excellent film adaptation).The sequel (&quot;After Worlds Collide&quot;) on the other hand, is =far= more dated, thoroughly permeated with '30s notions of nationalism. By today's standards it's more than just politically incorrect, it's borderline racist. But that aside--and it doesn't serve to try to read old novels with modern prejudices--it doesn't have the same sense of urgency (the impending doom of all mankind) found in the first book."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I read this book, for a class; we were supposed to pick any book we wanted to. Me not being into reading books that much, went into one of our cupboards in our living room. There I started looking thru some of the books my dad got at a Library sale. This when i found the book entitled &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; I open it up thinking its going to be about something that is metaphorical, i was wrong. This book is literally about 2 worlds colliding. I started reading it, right there on the floor and i couldn't stop reading it; i was reading the book in school, at times when i wasn't supposed to be reading; like history class. I read all day all night, I didn't want it to end. I read this one part i still remeber in history class, the description of the mathematician, was spot on just like me. I did notice some fallacies in the book, about space, and the spaceship being made out of a material that is radioactive, but i thought nothing of it since the book was so old, they wouldn't be able to know certain things about space. I kinda read over the part really fast while they were in space, because of the schema i already had about space.I read the whole book in before the project was supposed to be completed, thats when i realised, that i was only about half-way thru the book. It didn't say on the cover, it did say on the inside cover it contained, both &quot;when world collide&quot; and &quot;after worlds collide&quot; I did not know this, so when i reached the second book, i stopped; I didn't want the book to end. I later read the second part, it was great, it was just like how i would imagine exploring a new planet would be. I did think the ending of the second part was little too abrupt, i was somewhat dissapointed of the ending, it seemed like they ran out of ideas and raced to the finish.One thing i did notice being different with my book was there were lots of spelling errors, and wierd symbols in the words. eg. &quot;&quot; they were all over and i had trouble finding the deffinitions for those words. I later found out that my copy is an original copy. So thats why there are all those spelling errors and stuff.This is truly my favorite book of all time, and it has brought me into the world of reading more than anything else."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I found this an enjoyable listen over all (I listened to the Audible audiobook version), however the writing style is is quaint, highly embellished and somewhat stilted to 21st century ears. In fact, I can't believe people actually spoke like that in the 30's. The narrator does an excellent job of interpreting it, reflecting the formal tone but embellishing with good characterisation. The formality of the narrator's tone took some getting used to it, but once I realised it reflected the writing style, I appreciated it far more.The science is quite outdated - pre-space travel and pre-nuclear trying to imagine both. It must have been thrilling when it was written and while even to layman's ears is obviously wrong, it doesn't detract from the story and the search for a suitable casement for the nuclear reactor adds to the tension. A novel set in the 21st century would be very different, but probably wouldn't have the same drama as technology would be at hand to overcome many of the obstacles. The 1930's, however, provides a far more challenging and thus interesting setting.I'm looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"This book, written prior to World War II, presents a quite dated look at the end of the world. A pair of runaway planets are on a collision course with earth. The world is doomed--but humanity might have a chance to survive, if the best and brightest minds in the scientific world can succeed in building a spaceship to take a few lucky pioneers to resettle on one of the approaching planets.Without question, this book was ahead of its time in a number of respects. The description of space travel, for example, is remarkable, given that the book was written more than a decade before the earliest high-atmosphere rocket launches. Likewise, the use of atomic energy in the book predates the actual use of fission power by a number of years. The apocalyptic genre is similarly prescient; nowadays, this kind of book is everywhere, but in the 1930s, prior to the doom-and-gloom days of the Cold War, the end of the world was not something too many people were writing about.The writing quality, narrative style, and characterizations all betray the book's age. One glaring example of this is the main character, who is horribly sexist, bordering on misogynistic, and this is portrayed as perfectly normal and acceptable. This is doubtless a fairly accurate depiction of society's view of women at the time, but it's distracting nonetheless. I found myself rolling my eyes at least once a chapter.The story itself is pretty good, particularly the imaginative natural-disaster scenarios that play out as the planets approach earth. As \\"modern\\" society descends into chaos, only the strongest and smartest survive, and the authors did a good job of showing what that might look like.When Worlds Collide is a worth reading if you enjoy science fiction, particularly early science fiction. It's not exactly on a level with Ray Bradbury, but it's a good story and will hold your interest."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I remember clearly going to a Saturday matinee as a child to see the movie version of this book. It made a huge impact on me and I went to the library so I could read the book. I loved it, but time passed and I forgot all about it except that it fueled my love of science fiction which I've pursued my whole life. I was very excited to see that the book was available again, so ordered it from Amazon - I just had to have it in my library. Nostalgia aside, it's clear when reading it that it influenced many books and movies that came after it. That said, some of the references are jarring to a 21st century reader. References to the hero's \\"Jap\\" servant, a comment about Prohibition and the realization that neither the Great Depression or the Second World War had occurred when this was written (1933) though there was a passing reference to Hitler, do make one realize just how much attitudes have changed. When the earth is totally destroyed by a roving planet and an \\"ark\\" is created to carry people to a new planet, the only minority included is the before mentioned \\"Jap.\\" Nevertheless, it's an amazing, imaginative book of it's time, reflecting prevailing attitudes. If you can get past some of the references, you'll enjoy it and even search out the sequel, After World's Collide, by the same authors."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Of all the books in my collection, this is perhaps my favorite.

Now, kudos to Bison Frontiers of Imagination for republishing this fantastic work -- both When Worlds Collide AND After Worlds Collide in an omnibus edition! The movie -- great fun though it may be -- doesn't do the first book justice in the least, and the equally exciting and absorbing sequel is ignored. The books were written in the 1930s and apart from a few scientific miscalculations -- remember, they were only guessing at the time! -- the book is remarkably believable. The awesome spectacle of the first book is followed by the fascinating scenes set on Earth's successor planet, Bronson Beta.

I wonder what a modern movie after these books would look like...."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"After 70 years, When Worlds Collide/After Worlds Collide remains as one of the most imaginative science fiction yarns ever. I will continue to read my newly acquired copy of the stories (yes, both books are contained in the Bison printing) every few years.But there are weaknesses. The dialogue is overwrought to the point of silliness (example: the frequent use of &quot;Oh&quot;, as in the following quote when the valiant band of survivor/explorers are being attacked by an armed mob: &quot;Fall back! Oh, fall back!&quot; Can you really imagine someone saying it that way?). Also, you may forgive the social/political angle of the second book, but the denouement seems very rushed, as if the authors had to speed up to meet a deadline.But the descriptions of Bronson Beta and its cities, by themselves, make this story well worth reading. Although flawed, this is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I wasn't much of a reader when I first picked up this book in Junior High School, but it quickly grabbed my interest - I couldn't put it down! It wasn't until later that I learned it had a sequel, which I promptly read. Over the years, I have read it over and over again, until the library decided to take it out of circulation. I look forward to the opportunity to buy a copy for my personal collection, and share it with my children."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I have just recently obtained a copy of When Worlds Collide, which is a book that, despite it's being written in the early part of this century, is entertaining, and irresistable. The idea of an astronomical body in direct collision with Earth has recently been many peoples thoughts due to the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet encounter with Jupiter. This book is a well written classic which reads like a documentary, with the lifes, fears, loves and other emotions of people attempting to try to escape the doomed Earth. The chapter noting the passing of Bronson Alpha and Beta was explained as if it really happened, and the final climax was riveting! I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I found this book in the library when I attended elementary school.

It was even better than this book."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the movie... I've even heard about the book for years, but I never read it until recently. I picked up a volume of WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE coupled with its sequel AFTER WORLDS COLLIDE and found myself very much enjoying both its fiction and its insight into the mindset and attitudes of people from seemingly another time. I recommend this book to anyone (and everyone... Oh yes), both as a &quot;what if...&quot; science fiction tale (of which there are few good ones being written these days... shame on those authors who jump on the disater bandwangon peddling asteroids and deep impacts for quick cash), and as a indepth look into what some would save and some would leave behind if the world was indeed going to be destroyed. A shame it can't be bought right off the shelf in any bookstore. If a publisher is looking it it might be a good idea to shop this one around again... who knows, Hollywood is in a remake kind of mind, perhaps WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE might make a mint again. If you find one used, pick it up, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"My father warned me when reading the \\"When Worlds Collide\\" duology that I would love the story, but be unsatisfied with the ending. Indeed, this paramount science fiction creation was as captivating as it was definitional for the disaster genre it founded, but after reading book two I was left with so many questions. Who were the Other People? Were they still alive? Were there more survivors from Earth? More and more questions left me wondering . . . why didn't Wylie create a third novel?Deciding to answer these questions for myself, I began putting my thoughts to paper, and another story began to unfold. After realizing the scope of the project I was getting into, I decided it was time for a rewrite, and I started writing the story to present to an audience.Now complete, the third and final novel of Philip Wylie's phenomenal series is available for print and Kindle. This dramatic, action packed finale to the series is titled \\"The Terrans of Beta\\", and is nearly the size of the first two books combined. Don't miss out on the conclusion to an epic adventure started nearly 80 years ago. As a true fan of Wylie's works I have gone to great lengths to pay homage to his original creation while elaborating on the original story. Let's hope Paramount Pictures pays the same respect to their 2012 remake of the original 1951 film.People who bought \\"When Worlds Collide\\" also bought \\"The Terrans of Beta\\" as you can see on Amazon-suggestion link above (links provided below too, Kindle on bottom). I'd greatly appreciate Wylie fans buying a copy of my story too, and I hope you enjoy!The Terrans of Beta: Book Three in the When Wolds Collide Series (When Worlds Collide)The Terrans of Beta (When Worlds Collide)"},{"Title":"When Worlds Collide","review":"Transaction was flawless.

She and my grandfather got out separately, and were reunited in Harbin, which was taking in hordes of Russian refugees during the Russian Civil War. By the time they got to San Francisco, in the Twenties, my grandfather had fought in World War I, then fought with the White Army against the Reds, then crossed Lake Baikal in the White retreat and been taken hostage by a Mongolian warlord before getting to Harbin. In San Francisco, after working on painting the new Golden Gate Bridge with no respirator (they didn't use things like that in the Twenties) and by then physically exhausted, he came down with tuberculosis and nearly died. There was no welfare then. No food stamps, no nothing. Many of my grandmother's family members had been killed in the Revolution. She supported her recovering husband and sons by becoming a couturier, much like Valentina did in New York at the same time. But all during her designing years, during the 30s to the 40s, she wrote bits and pieces of \\"Dawn of the Eighth Day,\\" which was her memorial to the people and home that she had lost.To the contemporary mind, \\"Dawn of the Eighth Day\\" seems written in a different age, an age in which people engaged in long philosophical discussions at the dinner table. The writing style is more Edwardian than modern, but the problems the book confronts are the problems of modernity: culture's lurching transition from one era to another. This is no \\"Diary of an Edwardian Lady.\\" My grandmother pulled no punches.Oddly enough, \\"Dawn of the Eighth Day\\" shared the same publishing season at the same publishing house as \\"The Naked and the Dead.\\" The publisher, upon seeing that it had a hit on its hands, pulled all the publicity money from its other books that season and put it all behind Mailer. It's a fitting metaphor for the changes in society that occurred during my grandmother's life."},{"Title":"The Little, Brown Reader","review":"I was able to purchase this book for a fraction of what college book store wanted.

Computers were not available to do \\"brute force\\" calculations, so no in-depth statistical analyses were expected.

So while I cringe at the statement \\"Finally, keep in mind that in all games of chance the 'feel' of the dice must be considered,\\" I give the authors credit for at least cataloging a list of canonical opening moves. Unfortunately, they have been viciously upstaged by Wikipedia."},{"Title":"Duets #48 (48 Makeover Madness) (Between The Covers/The Matchmakers Mistake) (Duets : 2 Romantic Comedies)","review":"This is definitely a Duet worth reading!Cathie Linz' story, &quot;Between The Covers&quot; tells the tale of Paige Turner, a woman destined by her name to become a librarian. She's a &quot;nice&quot; woman, and becomes friends with Detective Shane Huntington, the Huntington family's black sheep. It seems he turned his back on his family's tradition of becoming proctologists by joining the police force, and they've never quite forgiven him. In order to meet conditions of an inheritance, he has to get married to a woman who meets a set of exacting conditions. Of course he turns to Paige the librarian for help in finding the perfect wife.This was an amusing and fast-paced story. It had some classic themes of the genre - Paige's transformation in designer gowns, snobbish family members, the answer to Shane's dilemma being right before his eyes, etc. - but they were all done with style and wit. It was a very enjoyable story.Jane Sullivan's &quot;The Matchmaker's Mistake&quot; is another excellent example of why I'm always on the lookout for one of her books. Her stories never fail to entertain. This story tells the tale of Mark McAlister, accountant. He's up for a coveted partnership in his firm, but he can see his chances slowly diminishing because he has neither the style nor the connections nor the trophy wife to advance the interests of the firm. Mark is not a one-dimensional character; he's overcome a lot in his earlier life to get where he is today, and it has scarred him. He goes to a bar to try to meet his perfect future wife, and is ultimately taken under the wing of Liz Prescott, the bartender. Liz takes pity on him and decides to take him in hand and help him achieve his goal.This story was a version of Pygmalion in reverse. Liz is the free spirit who is trying to loosen up up Mark and recreate his image. Both characters were wonderful, the writing sharp and humorous, and the romance lovely. This book is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Duets #48 (48 Makeover Madness) (Between The Covers/The Matchmakers Mistake) (Duets : 2 Romantic Comedies)","review":"BETWEEN THE COVERS by Cathie Linz is a laugh out loud keeper.

The book's content is great and a useful."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"This book is about Richard I the Lionheart. Its main characters are his Lute Player Blondel, his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, his wife and her sister. This work of fiction carefully follows the thread of history, explaining actions that Richard was criticized for, and filling in history's blanks. The book plays out during Richard's crusade. The historical information about the troubles faced and the experiences of soldiers on crusade were amazing. I thought that I respected those men before, but I had no idea. When the book ends you are left begging for more. It is a shame that she didn't write a part two."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"This is the story of Richard the Lion-Hearted and the Third Crusade, but the miracle of it is that you see it not from Richard's viewpoint but from the viewpoint of a princess who loved him, her hunchbacked half-sister, and an ordinary lute player. Much of it is based on old legends and histories which makes it even more fascinating. Yet it is a tale which has a modern resonance because Richard, at least in this telling, was a homosexual."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"When I was a child my aunts and grandmothers loaned this book around in the family and everyone loved it. As an adult I found it, and a box full of other books by Norah Lofts, at a second hand book store. This book is brilliant, as are all of Norah Lofts' books; she is my favorite author. I am shocked at how many are out of print. Other great books: Jassy, Nethergate, Queens of England, Scent of Cloves, The Lost Queen,How Far To Bethleham...they are all great. Please put them back into print."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"History has been truly kind to Richard the Lionheart. He's remembered as the great medieval king of England, a man of honor and bravery who led a crusade to free the Holy Land from the Saracens. He's a real hero revered for his justice and military skills...but when looking at his actual history one has to ask the question *why?* Yes, he was a great military leader. But this is a king who spent less than a year on the island he ruled, couldn't speak the native tongue of his people, and nearly bankrupted his people to finance his war and, after his capture by a rival potentate, to pay off his ransom. So why is this king so beloved?'The Lute Player' succeeds in bringing this contradictory king to life through the eyes of three main narrators: Anna of Apieta, the crippled half-sister of Richard's wife; Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother; and Blondel, a court musician who begins his service with Anna but later accompanies Richard on his travels in the Holy Land. Each narrator brings his or her own biases to their vision of Richard. Anna meets Richard when he comes to joust at the court of her father, the King of Navarre, and her sister Berengaria falls madly in love with him. Although he is engaged to another woman, Richard eventually marries Berengaria. It soon becomes clear, however, that he did so only to get her dowry to finance the crusade to re-take Jerusalem, Richard's true passion. When he leaves, Berengaria sends her musician Blondel with Richard to keep him safe and keep her apprised of his condition. Blondel, desperately in love with Berengaria, does as his mistress commands and chronicles their adventures in the Holy Land. Any romantic notions about the glory of the Crusades are removed by the accounts of disease and depravation that wear down the army far more effectively than the Saracens, but even in the midst of suffering Richard maintains a determination and bravery that makes him seem worthy of his legendary status...until the cruel way he ignores his wife and his people resurfaces again.Ultimately Norah Lofts shows Richard for the flawed and egotistical man that he was, but she doesn't vilify him. Her deep exploration into his character makes the novel seem quite modern, even though it was originally published in 1951. At one point she suggests that Richard's coldness to Berengaria may have been because he was homosexual. For a good, proper Englishwoman writing in the 1940s, I honestly would not have expected that particular twist in the book. But from what little evidence we have from his life, it's certainly a plausible explanation for some of his behavior.Thoroughly engrossing, 'The Lute Player' had me completely absorbed from the first few pages. There's a focus on the Big Plot of the Crusade of Richard the Lionheart, and he's still the star of the show. But it's all the little day-to-day conversations and relationships between the \`minor' characters like Anna and Blondel and Berengaria - the ones actually telling the story - that really make this novel interesting and bring the world of Medieval Europe to life."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"I have been reading historical novels for about 65 years, including most of the books by Norah Lofts, and The Lute Player is my all-time favorite.The story, being told by the \\"tales\\" of various of the characters puts a different perspective on the same events which I find fascinating. Anna Apieta is one of the most interesting fictitional characters I have ever encountered. How many stories do you find told by a crippled, hunchbacked, but brilliant minded bastard daughter of a king?I have always been a great fan of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who had been the wife of two kings, and The Lute Player shows what a truly strong woman she was, even in her old age and after years of imprisonment. When Richard was too busy with his crusades and being kidnapped and all that sort male foolishness, Eleanor went back to England, got her son (the King John of Robin Hood tales) under control and took over ruling the country wisely and well until Richard deigned to pay a visit. The part about Richard being gay ties in with many other books I have read about him, and helps explain why he never spent one night under the same roof as his wife. I could go on an on, but I can only say I cannot imagine how some of the above reviewers could make the comments they did. I can only assume that they did not really read the book."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"The subject matter was not my first pick, but Norah Lofts wrote as though first hand experience was her co-author. She captured me in one page & it's difficult to impress me. Her words weave and ring, continuing to resonate long after you put the book down, humming to you until you pick it back up. I'll leave it to the other reviewers to review the plot; just know that there is music to be heard through her words & other wonderful things about this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"By looking at the other reviews, I can see that I am clearly in the minority here - I do not get those five star ratings. The Lute Player is told in several parts, with each part being told in the first person POV of one of the main characters, Blondel the Lute Player, Anna a fictional half sister of Berengaria and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother.The story begins as Blondel finds his way to the Court of Navarre and home to Berengaria and Anna. Berengaria is in love with Richard (who is engaged to the King of France's sister), the hunchbacked Anna is in love with Blondel and Blondel is in love with Berengaria. Richard's engagement is eventually broken and desperate for more funds to finance his crusade, he agrees to marry Berengaria. The rest of the book details known history, the wedding on the way to the crusade, the third crusade itself and Richard's alleged preference for young boys, his being taken hostage on the way home from the crusade and his non-existent relationship with his wife.I love reading medieval fiction and learning of the history of the times, but frankly I found this whole book to be quite boring and by the time it got to the crusade half way through I found myself skimming quite a bit, and the final third covering the last days of Richard and Berengaria were just one big snooze fest, at least for this reader. It could just be me; I've never been that fond of Richard I and Berengaria I found to be bordering on the TSTL category, almost, but not quite. I guess if you're a die hard fan of this ruler and want to learn more about him it might be worth your while, but I would recommend getting this one from the library first (as I did) and then buy it if you like it. 2.5 stars rounded up to three."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"This Norah Lofts title , a wonderful and insightful story,should have been considered to be worked into an endearing movie"},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"This is my second Norah Lofts book, and I will go on and read more, but this one was somewhat disappointing after \\"The King's Pleasure.\\" That story was told well and the main character was developed nicely; when reading \\"The Lute Player,\\" I was not sure after a while what the point of the story was or who some of the main characters really were. The book goes on too long. It is an entertaining story with a couple of compelling characters, those being Anna Apieta and King Richard. We come to know Anna and to understand and like her. Richard the Lionheart is presented here somewhat differently than in other things I've read, and I wish we could have gotten to know him better here and see his relationship with and to the lute player a little more deeply. By the end of the book, I was wondering why it is titled, \\"The Lute Player.\\" This character starts off great, interesting and promising, but then loses appeal as the story goes on. What on earth is supposed to be so compelling about this guy? All in all a worthwhile read, but nothing to write home about. I'm looking forward to \\"The Concubine,\\" supposedly one of Lofts' best."},{"Title":"The Lute Player","review":"The Lute Player is the story of Richard the Lionhearted, as told from the point of view of Blondel, the eponymous lute player; Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Anna Apieta, crippled half sister to Richard's wife, Berengaria. The novel focuses on Richard's reign of England (a country he spent very little time in), especially the time he spent while on crusade. It's hard to write about someone in English history who is so well-known and well-loved; what better way than to write his story from the point of view of the people who knew him best?The book takes a while to get going--most of the beginning is devoted to Berengaria, hopelessly in love with a man who was more in love with the idea of reclaiming the Holy Land. In fact, the real action of the book begins with the crusade, which doesn't actually happen until around page 300! Nonetheless, this novel is written in an engaging style, and many of the characters, especially the ones who are narrators, are well-defined. I feel as though Eleanor of Aquitaine is a difficult person to write about, much less put words into her mouth, and I think Lofts did an admirable job of writing as her. I found myself less sympathetic towards and understanding of Anna, mainly because of her self-deprecating attitude towards her condition and natural acceptance of her spinsterhood.The book is a little long, however, and it gets wearying after a while. For a book that's supposed to be about Richard, I got a feel more for some of the other characters--especially since Richard kept haring off at every opportunity. And the major event that happens that changes the relationship between Blondel and Richard isn't described, only alluded to, so the awkwardness between them seemed a bit contrived. Still, I enjoyed this novel about the late-12th century--though I think there are better novels out there.

In that time I feel I've \\"seen\\" it all. Rarely, however, do I come across a book like \\"Crossing the Sauer,\\" a book that I can't put down until I've read every page. Somewhat short (189 pp.) but chock full of honesty and realism, Felix's story oozes with gut wrenching confession. Too often things get glossed over and former soldiers leave out the juicy details. Mr. Felix, however, has brought his doubts, reluctance and horror at finding himself (trained in the artillery) attached to an infantry unit at the front to the reader's consciousness. It doesn't get any better than this.Smooth, free-flowing prose and an eye for detail kept me riveted. I got some great laughs out of Felix's re-telling of some of his buddies' adventures, especially the sexual ones. We know those things went on but, until recently, the WWII generation has been reluctant to let the public in on their not-so-delicate tales of prostitutes and willing females. We want the whole story, not just the horror of war stuff.I was a bit frustrated at not knowing the dates and, more importantly, which unit Mr. Felix served with but these are minor complaints. It would seem that he was with the 5th Infantry Division but one reference mentions the 28th Division, not part of Patton's Third Army, to my knowledge. Maybe he kept these things confidential to protect the participants. The officers, especially, come off looking pretty bad. As a former Marine I was appalled at how they treated the enlisted men. Marine officers and NCOs take care of their men first.Evidently that wasn't the case in the WWII Army, especially the front line infantry units, full of replacements/draftees and lots of men who really didn't want to be there in the mud, blood and snow. Barely speaking to the lowly privates at best and sacrificing them for their own glory at worst, the higher ranks had no qualms about eating a fresh, hot meal of roasted chicken and baked potatoes under the nose of poor Felix who, while manning the radio, frequently went days without food. Spending up to fifty-two hours on duty without a break, Felix and his fellow \\"peasants\\" were at the mercy of the Army's \\"upper class,\\" condescending, abusive, vainglorious and impervious to the plight of their underlings.If you want to know what it was like to be drafted into an infantry unit during the war, pick up a copy of \\"Crossing the Sauer.\\" I think, like me, you'll appreciate the author's honesty, insight and very literate tale."},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","review":"Crossing The Sauer: A Memoir Of World War II is Charles Reis Felix's staunchly honest and unflinchingly vivid memoir of what it was like to serve in Patton's Army and advancing through the German battlefields of World War II.

A moving book."},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","review":"\\"Crossing The Sauer\\" by Charles Reis Felix.Subtitled:\\" A Memoir Of World War II\\".Burford Books, Short Hills, NJ, 2002.This is a well written personal memoir, written the way all personal memoirs should be written: little on the preliminary training, more on the actual combat experiences. This book begins with action in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in December 1994, the month of the Battle of the Bulge. The author, Charles Reis Felix, launches his story by stating that he was being \\"shipped\\" across France in the famous (infamous) boxcars known as 40 and 8s. Shipped like cattle! This iconoclastic attitude continues throughout the entire book. He relates how an Army corporal and two PFCs bilk the replacements out of American money by saying it was against regulations to have American money in France. American dollars had to be traded in for French francs. Welcome to France! Non-coms taking advantage of the new people; (\\"boots\\" as we called them in the Navy.)Trained as artillerymen, Charles Reis Felix and his friends are thrown into the turmoil of the ETO just as the Battle of the Bulge was demanding warm bodies. The author and his friends expected to be assigned to the relative safety of behind-the-lines artillery, but, as usual with the Army, the replacement artillerymen were dispatched up front with the infantry ... despite their technical expertise with the 155mm weapon. SNAFU. The author did not identify his outfit by number or name. Personally, I did not check other books to see which outfit was where in the ETO at such and such a time, as I was more interested in the personal experiences of the writer. The author mentions the Army specialized Training Program (ASTP) on page 30.For a time, Charles Felix escapes actual front line foxholes by volunteering the information that he was able to operate a radio. As a radioman, Felix worked up with certain officers, for whom he has not much good to report. He describes one officer who, with the intention of getting rid of Felix, sends him up to a dangerous front position. All this because the officer had been seen by Felix in an embarrassing position! Then there is the major, (later in the book), who likes to be first into a newly captured German town. The major would prance and dance and strut his stuff in the town square, so the recently surrendered German officials would obsequiously bow down to him. As they rapidly tracked through Germany, the major always wanted to be first into the town so that he could mince about in the part of the conquering American. This all ceased one day when a Hitler Jugend fired a Panzerfaust at the major's jeep. After that, the major was content to sit in his jeep in the middle of the convoy, protected both front and rear. There was one officer, however, who treated enlisted men, and radioman Felix, fairly well. In fact, he tells the author to go upstairs and enjoy some of the food that the officers are gobbling down. Of course, the \\"good\\" officer is quickly killed.As the war winds down, early April 1945, Felix feels sick. An old German woman looks at him and says, \\"Krank.\\" (p. 183). He WAS sick. Finally, he is diagnosed as having yellow jaundice, sent to the rear, and flown on a C47 to Paris. The war ended for him.I wonder if he became sick because the U. S, Army had given him an unapproved vaccine against yellow fever. See: \\"Mapping Epidemics: A Historical Atlas Of Disease\\" by Brent Hoff, page 34. According to that reference, the unapproved Army vaccine caused thousands upon thousands of cases of yellow jaundice in American troops."},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","review":"A refreshing look at the last days of World War 2 by an American who first entered the war as a replacement towards it's dying days. Considered himself lucky to get a job as a radio operator and not as a rifleman on the front. Who writes honestly and freely about his friends and himself trying to survive what can only be described as one of the worst nightmares mankind has ever experienced (not that you read about any of these nightmares in this book). A look at the war that can only be described as honest by a man who makes no claims at being a hero, who openly explains about the efforts he made to avoid fighting at the front and finally an American who realised it was not because of America that the allies won the war and who actually praises the work done by the Russians and in particular the battle of Stalingrad and it's/their effect on the German army.Not a book I would describe as being a must read for anyone interested in world war two but a short easy book to read by a man who made every effort possible not to actually fire a rifle during the war."},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","review":"if charles bukowski (minus all the alcohol intake) had been in world war II, and had written a memoir about it, you probably would have gotten something like this. a fantastic, unpretentious, totally enjoyable book. i wish this author had written more."},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","review":"The novel Crossing the Sauer is a book based on World War II. You read and learn about the different experiences from a soldier in the war. The man that you read about is Charles Reis Felix himself as he tells you what he encounters being in Europe during WWII. He explains about the hardships he has to face, not only physically but mentally as well. Charley is still young and he is confused on what he really wants in life. When he comes across those \\"you see your life flash before your eyes\\" moments, during an attack in Europe, he feels that there's so much more he wants to do with his life but feels trapped now that he is in the army and at war. Charley comes to think that being a soldier you either end up dead, then your life obviously is over with. Or specifically WWII, you spent most of your life over in Europe and by the time you return to the United States you've already missed out on several other opportunities. As he has so much going on in his mind he has to be able to fight the physical challenges and learn how to build up strengths and emotions.One 9r class reading Crossing the Sauer connects to is mostly The Pearl. In Crossing the Sauer, he learns the value of life and that you need to make the most of it. In The Pearl,Kino realizes what's important in life, not material things such as what he could get with the pearl. They each have to learn the hard way, Kino and Juana by losing the life of their child, and Charley being in war and seeing that his life could end in almost any minute when they are attacked or at battle.Personally I did not enjoy the book as well as some other people might have. I liked the topic of WWII but, they go into great detail on war terms that I didn't understand and made me confused. What was good about this book was he talked about different events that had happened to him and to other people in all different countries. They were interesting because you didn't hear much about them and probably wouldn't expect to. I would suggest this book to adults or teenagers. The language and some conversation may not be appropriate for younger children. I'd especially recommend this to anyone that's been part of the army in any because they might be able to relate themselves tot his book."},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","review":"The issue of global warming is scaremongering, a massive red herring to make workers take their eyes off the tasks facing us - stopping deindustrialisation, unemployment, the destruction of our services, the European Union's destruction of our nation Britain. Scare stories about global warming, melting ice caps and glaciers, intensifying storms and droughts, a \`Day After Tomorrow'-style ice age, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, nuclear proliferation and energy shortages are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. They are kin to medieval fears of apocalypse. We need to denounce the doom-mongers who portray us as helpless victims, at the mercy of events beyond our control as a nation.The facts are that Antarctica has been cooling and its glaciers thickening for the past 30 years. Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before. Environmental pollution accounts for at most 2% of all cancer cases versus 30% caused by tobacco use. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the world's forests covered 40.24 million square kilometres in 1950, and 43.04 million in 1994. 80% of the world's original rainforest is still intact. Sea levels in the region of the Pacific around the island nation of Tuvalu have been falling.Amicus and the NUM recently warned that a growing crisis in our electricity industry will lead to blackouts and further electricity price rises. They warned against relying on oil and gas from unstable regions like southern Russia, the Middle East and North and West Africa. Powergen confirmed how right the unions are when it recently told us, \\"From 29 November 2004 your electricity prices will rise by around 44p a week. Why the price increase? There are many reasons, for example: producing energy is now more expensive, so the wholesale price of energy has risen for all suppliers. The UK's gas supply is also declining so we must now spend more importing gas from around the world.\\"The unions warned that EU directives would add to our energy problems, particularly the carbon emissions trading directive which would curtail the lifetime of existing power stations. The unions believe it is vital that the nation invests in clean coal fired power stations and in power engineering and manufacturing industries to develop expertise in designing and building new power stations.In 2003 nuclear power stations provided 23% of Britain's electricity. By 2010, a third of these will have reached the end of their operating lives and will be closed, and nuclear power will account for just 16% of our electricity supply. Only two new stations are under construction. The closures will reduce Britain's ability to generate our own dependable energy supply. We need to plan and build more new nuclear power stations. France's nuclear plants produce three quarters of the country's power, one of the cheapest energy supplies in Europe.We need to reduce energy waste, estimated to cost 5 billion a year, and rationally use our resources. We need to develop new technologies to economise on energy use. The government has failed to invest in Combined Heat and Power. We need more R&D; into carbon free and carbon sequestration technologies. Biomass crops could be grown especially for use as environmentally-friendly fuel. This would boost farm diversity and create rural jobs. It could be competitive against conventional hydrocarbon-based energy generation, and could meet 10% of our energy needs.Friends of the Earth say, \\"Renewable energy has the potential to provide all our needs.\\" Not so - hydroelectricity, wind and tidal sources provide just 3% of our present energy, and wind and solar energy are intermittent: their annual power output is only 25% of the potential output if operating always at full power; by contrast, nuclear power's output is 90%. Blackouts three quarters of the time, anyone?"},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","review":"Bashes the looney left and popular misconceptions about environmental issues.Embraces the rabid right with polyanna conclusions that past successes guarentees future successes.Skips the truth in between, which is a heck of a lot more complex.Similar to Bjorn Lomberg's collection of half truths, which focuses on the facts that support his political position, and conveniently leaves those that rebut it.Sure, it's been well known in the scientific community that an Antarctic meltdown would take centuries, and there seems to be an increase in the ice cap OVER the land. But it is also true that the oceanic ice shelves are breaking up and melting, with likely negative effects on the ecosystem.It's also known that the arctic icecap has thinned by about 40%, with much, much less summer sea ice.Western fertility rates where never the question for folks like Ehrlich, club of Rome, etc., and it is deceiptfull to use them to bash concerns about over population. Non-western fertility rates have indeed fallen dramatically, but it is still highly uncertain if they will fall enough to avoid future catastrophes. (E.g.: the Hutu vs Tutsi genocidal conflicts in Africa was more due to over population &amp; limited resources, than ancient frictions).Last century, potatoes were the wonder crop of Ireland, supporting a massive population boom. By relying on the most productive agri-tech (i.e., a certain type of potato), Ireland was left vulnerable. Focusing on our current successes while ignoring the vulnerabilities and limitations will just as surely lead to future disasters.Consider the following bait &amp; switch arguement from the review:Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generatorsFact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmillsSo where's the contradiction? Both statements can be true! It is true (but unstated) that clean energy technology is often cheaper than fossil fuels in many applications. E.g., it's often cheaper to install, say, solar panels on roof tops than to build power transmission lines (especially in sunny areas). E.g., wind power has fallen in price from &gt;$0.30/kwhr down to about $0.05/kwhr since the 70's and often competes favorably for generating peak load electricity. --but is often discouraged in the market place because of tax disincentives and other structural barriers.Fossil fuels on the other hand may still be abundant, but we are definitely using up the large &amp; cheap supplies and running out of places to look for new sources. Even Saudi Arabia will soon see their production costs rise from $2/barrell to &gt;$4/barrell.If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that we can rarely rely on the solutions of yesterday for the problems of tomorrow, and fossil fuels clearly fit into that category.Or consider:Myth: Modern pesticides and fertilizers are increasing the rates of cancer in humansFact: No study has ever shown that anyone has developed cancer from the legal application of pesticides, and environmental pollution accounts for at most 2 percent of all cancer cases versus 30 percent caused by tobacco useLEGAL applications? How convenient a way to ignore the fact agricultural workers do indeed have higher cancer rates (NB: not for all cancer lumped together, but for certain types of cancer)Example: recent studies have associated DDT with lower birth weight babies (why recent? They haven't looked before). Extrapolating from the data, it could be that up to 10% of infant deaths in the USA could have been due to DDT exposure during the heyday of DDT use. But since the banning of DDT is a past success, and DDT has no strong linkage to human cancer, it doesn't count for the authors.And on and on it goes.

A hippie idiot and a rational-thinking individual can witness the exact same event and both will report different facts. The difference is this: nine times out of ten, the hippie is so consumed by their political beliefs that their ability to be objective is completely incapacitated.Ever notice how lefties define themselves through their political beliefs more so than conservatives? Their sense of identity is so extensively intertwined with their misinformed value system that to question their political stance is to question their worth as a human being. Defend the political view at all costs. If they were to concede victory, they would see it as compromising themselves. Hence the passionate speech.Luckily, reason still prevails in most places.

You don't need 13,000 windmills, you only need around 300. It's rather easy to go to GE's Wind Energy website and find this out. One is forced to conclude that If the authors can't get their first fact anywhere close to reality, why would you trust the contents inside?"},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","review":"Global warming is the subject in only one of the twelve chapters in this book. Other chapters are on pesticides, water wars, bioengineering, the concept of sustainable (or &quot;sustained&quot;) development, crop yields, etc. The spirit of the book can perhaps be taken from Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug, who wrote the chapter entitled, &quot;Feeding a World of 10 Billion People: The Miracle Ahead.&quot;The &quot;Miracle Ahead&quot; in Borlaug's title and his enthusiasm for feeding ten billion people are typical of the optimistic tone throughout. I would prefer that we not have ten billion people to feed, but that is another argument based on my belief that we should leave room for substantial agrarian and wild spaces on the planet and that we should keep alive in their natural habitats as many of our fellow creatures as is reasonably possible, and that such resources are of inestimable value. The authors of this book are not much concerned with life other than as it relates to the short-term economic welfare of the human species.This brings us to the question, what are they concerned with? Why are they arguing so vehemently against almost any sort of restraint on economic growth? Why are they not concerned about how many humans may occupy the planet? The answer: they know that poor and disadvantaged humans are needed to work at subsistence wages in order that others (themselves, their friends, and their children) may enjoy a high standard of living. One of the most important environmental trends during the last century NOT noted in this book is the movement of poor people from less developed countries to Europe and the United States. These people gladly leave the lands of their births, many crossing borders illegally, to take on the lowest paying jobs in our economies. Without these eager workers we would all be less well off.Consequently the authors want to continue to be able to exploit not only the environment to the fullest, they want to be able to exploit a ready supply of human labor as well. This is why they do not argue against the dangers of overpopulation and belittle those that do. They want a substantial number of poor people in the world.But philosophic and moral issues aside, is global warming an &quot;eco-myth&quot;?First, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased since the levels were first measured, especially during the last century. Second, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; that is, it allows the sun's heat to penetrate to the surface of the planet but prevents heat from escaping. Third, the overall temperature of the planet has indeed risen over the last century with some of the hottest years on record occurring in the last decade or so. All of this is indisputable.However, what is argued in this book is that, one, it is impossible to prove that increased CO2 admissions are causing the warming; two, it was warmer, much warmer earlier in the earth's history; and three, it is not clear that this warming is something to be concerned about. The authors argue further that plant life loves having more carbon dioxide. Indeed, this belief is why carbon dioxide levels are not included in the graphs showing pollution levels in the air. The authors have simply decided that CO2 is not a pollutant. Of course this is contrary to common sense and to the long held dictum referred to by contributor Angela Logomasini in her chapter on &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; that &quot;the dose makes the poison.&quot; (p. 159) Plants do indeed like carbon dioxide but researchers have found that at too high a dose, even plants begin to suffer from too much CO2.It may well be that the increase in CO2 levels is not the reason the earth is getting warmer; it may be just a coincidence or a temporary anomaly. However--and this is really the crux of the matter ignored by the authors--what if they are wrong? What if the most likely argument, that increased CO2 levels produced by a growing human population, ARE causing or contributing mightily to global warming? And what if it gets worse? The really scary thing about global warming is that we may pass over the point of no return without knowing it. A full-blown, runaway greenhouse effect would make nuclear winter look like a walk in the park. Look what happened to Venus, where on any spring day (or winter day for that matter) the surface is hot enough to melt lead. Could that happen here? The real and direct answer to that question is: we don't know.Another underlying argument is the idea that human ingenuity is limitless and that whatever problems do develop, our creativity will solve them. This pollyannaish stance, this matter of faith, really, is not compatible with the rigorous scientific discipline to which the authors aspire.The arguments against the hysteria about bioengineering, about how prognosticators were wrong in the past (Paul Ehrlich, etc.), about how wondrous has been our ability to grow food faster than babies, etc. are all well taken. Even the argument that natural resources have become cheaper is true, but that is because a great leap in technological skills coincided with vast areas of the planet being available for exploitation. For our children and grandchildren, who will probably have an even more advanced technology, there will be unfortunately precious few unspoiled lands on which to use that technology.The argument that the past is a guide to the future, held here as an immutable law, is a respectable one, but is not anything near infallible. A contrary argument, that nothing is ever the same, that what applied as truth for hunter and gatherer, and for agrarian societies, may not be true for advanced technological societies, is perhaps a better guide."},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","review":"I have been reading up on global warming, pro, con and other.

Do some research into the Competative Private Enterprise group and who is funding and has funded them. Exxon Mobil was one of the bankrolls for this group. This book is an attempt to keep ignorant sheep under control - people who don't want to accept the harsh reality that human activity - particularly the excessive use of fossil fuels - has had and is having a seriously negative affect on our planet. The word \\"environment\\" is treated like a four letter word when in fact the environment is where we - human beings - live. I live in Alaska. Global Warming is real. It is happening NOW, and it is destroying my state!

Yes, the earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling, but our man made Global Warming is a crisis because of the rapid and extreme changes it is causing to our climate. Humans can adapt, but many species of plants and animals cannot adapt quickly enough to survive even a few degrees change in the average temperature of their environment. Coral reefs for example are dying and we, human beings, need these reefs because they support the oceans diversity and provide the foundation for one of our food sources.

On top of which, he is either a terrible researcher or an out-an-out liar. His very first 'FACT' (listed below the reviews) states:Fact: Antarctica has been cooling--and its glaciers thickening--for the past 30 years.Anyone who has watched ANY television or read Nat'l Geographic knows that not only is Antarctica NOT cooling and the glaciers NOT thickening, the exact opposite is happening, and at an alarming rate. Both the Arctic and Antarctic icepacks have thinned several FEET in just the last few years. Glaciers all over the world are shrinking rapidly, a FACT that is easily seen by comparing before-and-after photographs. Glacier National Park will soon have NO glaciers. The number of days the tundra stays frozen (and thus hard enough to drive on) has dropped from over 200 to under 80 in just THE LAST 30 YEARS. Polar Bears are in danger of going extinct. It goes on and on. I have no idea how Bailey can state his 'facts' with a straight face. But for those of you still not convinced, just look at the price of this book. It's down to a bargain-basement $4.95 because NO ONE WANTS TO BUY IT.

Yes, the authors are from what one could call the 'other side' as they make no bones about directly attacking what the authors call 'ideological environmentalism'. However, the book is well written given the number of authors involved and clearly presents their arguments and information.The book covers such topics as global warming, sustainable development, biotechnology, chemicals/pollutants and the environment, population, et. al. that should be of interest to everyone.The strength of the book is the attempt to bring scientific research and data to bear on these important and sensitive issues and the policies that exist or that have been promoted to deal with them. This approach is very much needed and the authors should be commended for their work, regardless of where you might stand on any of the issues. We need reasoned debate.The authors do engage in some of their own political poking at those they don't agree with and do resort to the straw man approach using 40 year old books and articles as the straw man and they do also use statistics in ways ranging from acceptable to somewhat dubious that present their case in the strongest possible light. They do ignore certain issues such as biodiversity where positive data (their obvious preference) is not available to support their strong optimism that markets and science have and will benefit humanity and solve all its problems. However, this political and economic perspective is to be expected from the American Enterprise Institute and is not presented in a too polemical tone.Overall this book is comprehensive in its coverage, informative, well referenced and thought provoking, and therefore I can highly recommend it for those seriously and dispassionately interested in understanding these issues better.I do not agree with certain of their analyses or use of statistics or all of their underlying philosophy but I commend them again for providing a sane and reasoned book that gives me the opportunity to study, analyse, raise questions, search references and become better informed.Lets not shoot all the messengers or we can't discuss anything serious anymore."},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","review":"Having actually read the book, unlike most of the reviewers in this list that have not cracked its covers or turned a single page, I think that my review should carry some weight.First, global warming is almost certainly due to macroenvironmental factors that are not due to human activity. This is widely documented from everything from studies of glacial gase entrapment to ocean sediments.Second, wide variations in climatic conditions are the NORM. Thus the current period of global warming, that has continued since the Little Ice Age several hundreds years ago (and centuries before CO2 emissions from human activity were a factor) can not be thought of as a radical departure from normal climatic change.Third, Carl Sagan wrote of a &quot;baloney detector&quot; that we should use when evaluating science. One of the surest signs of baloney is the &quot;reducto ad hominum&quot; argument. True, &quot;only&quot; two PHDs were involved in this book (there are countless books by a SINGLE PHD that are not attacked in this manner) but that is not the fault of the book. Also true, the book is sponsored by a pro-development group, but there are countless books by environmental groups that are not debased solely by that connection. Finally, most of the science is fully footnoted and you are able to check their conclusions. This is not true of most of the environmental movements polemics.On the whole the book is readable and does not insult a laymans intelligence.

There are three chapters on general policy-philosophy which go along with topic-specific chapters.The themes which run through all parts of the book may roughly be summarized as: 1. Strident environmentalism needs to be braked with logical thinking and a truthful look at actual data; 2. Too many \\"hot\\" environmental topics of the past have been misunderstood at best, intentionally misleading at worst; 3. Human beings are not Earth's pests; and 4.

Any attempt to cover up this obvious truth must be regarded as utter unwillingness to change our destructive life style and shows the extreme selfishness of western civilisation.Regarding CO2 as the lifeblood of the planet is deceptive nonsense: if concentrations of CO2 rise too much, it is only going to be harmful. I wonder how the authors would feel if I would put them in a room with an elevated level of oxygen, so they can experience for themselves what an enlarged concentration of a life giving gas would do to them.

The main character of this book, Bean, certainly has aspects of her life that could also be considered pathetic, but somehow, I related more easily to her behavior (eg, lying in bed eating Ben &amp; Jerry's when her husband was away) than I could to the more amorphous actions of Carrie. Bean comes across as extremely real, from her ambivalence toward the various people in her life to her earnest search for direction and meaning. Here is a lost soul who you really root for; you want to see Bean triumph in the end. While the conclusion of the book isn't exactly uplifting--the author resists the ever-present temptation to tie everything up neatly--as you come to the end of Bean's story, you can easily imagine that she is on the path to a brighter future. A well-written, wonderful detailed, and refreshingly original work."},{"Title":"A Hole in the Heart","review":"I just happened to pick this book up at the airport and absolutely loved it. I read it slowly so I could linger over the characters. No one I know has heard of it, but I think I've discovered a gem. The book is so vivid I constantly daydreamed of a movie being made from the novel...who would play the parts?What more to say? This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read in a long time. I found myself laughing out loud and a few paragraphs later had tears in my eyes. The writing flows so smoothly it's hard to put down. I think this one is going to be big."},{"Title":"A Hole in the Heart","review":"I just loved this book and found it hard to put down. It's a beautifully told story of a young woman who had the courage to rebuild her life after a tragedy leaves her wondering what to do next.

This is because they are merely good, and not lovely. A Hole In The Heart is lovely, a book to savor. And Bean Jessup is a character to savor; flawed and hurt by life, but human like the rest of us with her own measured portions of hope and insight.As for the prose, I love it when a writer can stun you with a plain phrase, as opposed to extorting admiration through complication. Chris Marquis draws you in with his lovely readable sentences, then stuns you with, for example (not the best example, either, but just the first one retrieved): &quot;She remembered coming home from school and slapping the rope swing dangling from the elm so that it convulsed wildly over a dirt path she had scuffed with her feet.&quot; Here he has grounded you in the action, revealed the character and a bit of her past, stunned you with his accuracy."},{"Title":"A Hole in the Heart","review":"Boy, what was that last reviewer thinking?? I picked up this book after reading the rave review in Entertainment Weekly and loved it start to finish. The characters are so incredibly real, I felt like I actually knew Bean.

I'm recommending this one for my book club and can't wait to talk about it with my friends."},{"Title":"A Hole in the Heart","review":"I didn't absolutely love this book, but enjoyed it quite a bit; found the dialogue very real and refreshing, the characters and locales interesting.

I have never found a book to be so unconvincing and painfully lacking real emotion. The book starts off well enough with Bean adjusting to a new life in Alaska, but it suddenly downward spirals and we're left to believe that Bean has meaningful relationships and a dignifying rebound from a tragedy. Her relationship with Jimmy bothered me more than anything -- apparently he was her best friend, yet at one of the most important parts, the author skims right over him and only provides a brief outline of Bean's emotions. I would have quit halfway through, but since I heard so many positive reviews, I thought the end might be redeeming. Again, I was wrong. The book got worse as I went along and by the end I was thrilled to be freed from reading this dull book."},{"Title":"A Threat to Justice: A Novel (Justice Riders)","review":"A good book about people fighting for the right and defending the weak.

Could not put it down until I was finished. Well written, funny, exciting, an all around good read."},{"Title":"A Threat to Justice: A Novel (Justice Riders)","review":"A THREAT TO JUSTICE picks up after the Civil War. Ezra Justice and his elite group, who served as special operations soldiers, have parted company and are back living their pre-war lives. However, when there is a need to combat armed resistances against President Grant and his efforts to reconstruct America, Justice must call the group together and saddle up. Justice's orders from General Sherman were simple; reunite his elite soldiers to covertly fight the Confederacy.The American West was a wild frontier and dangerous outlaws pursued unscrupulous dreams of fortune. As everyone took the law into their own hands, the President was hard-pressed to get control. The Justice Riders became unsung heroes who ventured West to bring order and justice to the adventure-filled quest of prospectors and South to thwart the vicious acts of the Klan and rebel infantrymen. For every good there must be an opposing evil and the nemesis for the 'Justice Riders' is a different band of soldiers called the 'Death Raiders'. The battle of law and order suddenly becomes deadlier and far more personal.The name Chuck Norris immediately invokes images of Walker, Texas Ranger policing the Texas plains. With that image in mind as you turn the pages of A THREAT TO JUSTICE, the second Old West novel from Chuck Norris and friends, you should expect to be charmed. This is an action-packed adventure when the country was untamed and uncensored. Mr. Norris and the contributing authors sprinkle elements of faith, romance and excitement throughout the pages.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ(tm) Reviewers"},{"Title":"A Threat to Justice: A Novel (Justice Riders)","review":"Just recently bought the book lastweek.

Ah, that I could be like that!"},{"Title":"The Careful Writer","review":"The Language Wars\\"Let us recognize,\\" writes Theodore Bernstein, \\"that accuracy in a world of loose talk and confused thinking is a quality to be prized.\\"Indeed, the language wars have been ongoing since at least 1758, when the first English usage books were beginning to get published, and came to a head in 1926 with W.H. Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage. There are two schools of thought:On one side, there are those who say that language is a river that should be allowed to flow where it may, and that it is ridiculous or un-modern to tell people their English is wrong or nonstandard, because language constantly changes and is blind to the dictates of ivory-tower academicians. What is wrong today might be right tomorrow; the best that can be done is to observe how people use English--with a scientist's objectivity, not a priest's self-righteousness. We call these people the descriptivists or structural linguists.On the other side are those who insist that careful thought should go into writing. Unlike spoken English, whose communication is aided by visual and aural cues, written English has no such help other than its structure. Confusion, miscommunication, ambiguity, and a general fogginess therefore ensue. Without doubt, one's writing could be made clearer and more powerful if only the writer could bring himself to think more carefully, with reason and common sense. We call these people the prescriptivists.Bernstein belongs to this second camp, together with Fowler. He was an editor at The New York Times and was a professor for 25 years at Columbia University. In his introduction to The Careful Writer, in a direct dig against structural linguists who thumb their noses at grammar books of the kind he writes, he asks: If 99% of drivers park illegally, would you let them? \\"If a crime is committed commonly enough, it [does not become] legal.\\"Lesson in HistoryThe Careful Writer is a 500-page dictionary of about 2,000 grammatical points that writers should watch out for. Published in 1965, it is quite outdated, and phrases like \\"price hike,\\" \\"a pay boost,\\" \\"to stick up for,\\" and \\"corporate image,\\" phrases that today are considered commonplace, were then still considered vogue and slang.Reading a grammar book that is 50 years old is a lesson in history. During Bernstein's time, for example, the word \\"scan\\" meant \\"to examine closely.\\" After 50 years, the word now means its opposite, \\"to view hastily.\\" The word \\"quite\\" underwent a similar mutation, changing from its old meaning \\"completely\\" to its new one, \\"rather.\\" Bernstein warned against using the adjective \\"self-deprecating,\\" saying that it is not possible to disapprove of oneself. He suggested using \\"self-depreciating\\" instead, because belittling oneself is at least in the realm of possibility. Today, of course, everyone is into self-deprecation and loneliness. And perhaps, one might ask: Is this 50-year difference due not only to a difference in grammar but also to a difference in cultural temperament? In 1965, perhaps it was not possible to disapprove of oneself. Today it is the fad. And quite becoming in a fop.Good Grammar is Good ReasonGood grammar, guided by reason, has a way of sticking. So much so that if a modern dandy were to open Bernstein's book at random, there is a good chance he'd find something useful. Although the meanings of some words may have changed dramatically after 50 years, some grammatical points seem to have the force of the divine in them. A case in point is the double genitive. People today probably couldn't care less whether they say \\"This is a statue of Mr. Gold\\" or \\"This is a statue of Mr. Gold's.\\" But the first one means a statue of Mr. Gold himself, and the second a statue owned by Mr. Gold. There is a thin difference, and the double genitive makes this nuance possible. As Bernstein says, \\"This may seem like a fine point, but fine points can draw blood.\\"Consider this sentence: \\"In 1892, he spent the hitherto unheard of sum of $1 M to buy a house.\\" That looked correct to me, until Bernstein pointed out that \\"hitherto\\" means \\"until now,\\" not \\"until then.\\" Substituting the meaning, the sentence actually reads, \\"In 1892, he spent the until now unheard of sum of $1 M to buy a house.\\" Of course this is ridiculous; it should read \\"until then.\\" Bernstein suggests replacing \\"hitherto\\" with \\"theretofore.\\" After reading this, I felt blessed. Divine lights appeared, halos, chiaroscuros.A Funny DictionaryHumor is a quality that one would probably not expect in a dictionary, but Bernstein has it. A lot. Expounding against too-stuffy writing, he says: \\"And words that are too proper, like girls who are too proper, are not easily embraced.\\" Again: \\"A falling body always rolls to the most inaccessible spot.\\" Again, on the suggestion that there should be one idea to one sentence: \\"Marcel Proust and James Joyce undoubtedly never heard of such a dictum.\\" And because the public is unaware that the words \\"inflammable\\" and \\"flammable\\" both mean \\"able to catch fire,\\" and fearing that someone using a tub of gasoline labeled \\"inflammable\\" might assume he is out of danger, Bernstein concedes grudgingly that we should make \\"inflammable\\" mean \\"not flammable\\" to avoid confusion, \\"If it will save a single burned eyelash.\\"I find Bernstein quite funny too, even when he does not try. Attacking what he calls purposely obscure and high-brow prose, he writes: \\"Windyfoggery may result from sheer pomposity.... a kind of wistful desire to make learned sounds. It may result from an incapacity for direct, clear thinking. Or it may result from incomplete knowledge of one's subject, which leads one to wrap a paucity of information in a plethora of words.\\" When Bernstein mistakenly uses the word \\"insure\\" for \\"ensure,\\" and asseverates without qualms that a statistical mean is different from a statistical average, I couldn't resist a giggle (he is wrong). And when he talks about punctuation, he actually starts by saying: \\"The world of the hyphen is anarchic.\\"In short: If your grammar is pretty good, and you just want a solid up-to-date practical guide about the problematic points, I would recommend, first of all, Garner's Modern American Usage (2009). That is 1,000 pages though, and would take about a year to read in full. If you want a guide you can read in a week, Bernstein's The Careful Writer is a good start, alghough you have to forgive him some outdated rules here and there. If you want to see how rules can change over time, then reading both Bernstein (1965) and Garner (2009) would be best."},{"Title":"The Careful Writer","review":"Others have already explained the many virtues of Bernstein's book. What I want to add here is how refreshing and easy to use it is for American readers and writers.There are a number of good and classic reference sources, especially Fowler's \\"Modern English Usage.\\" But Fowler is indeed English. His advice is without error, but it is also, well, British-sounding. Bernstein is much more accessible to most American users. I am sure that this is particularly true for new and young writers, who are most in need of a good reference book.

I was happy to find it on the shelf of Amazon when all Canadian efforts to procure a copy failed (OK, I just called a few local booksellers and checked Amazon's competitor; I didn't say I'm not a _lazy_ editor sometimes).It's a useful volume that has been used in my office to put snivelly writers back into their places as an effective \\"See, I _told_ you you're using those casualisms incorrectly, and Bernstein agrees with me!\\" atomic flyswatter ;).I only give it 3 stars since it's dated (pub. 1966) and shows its age. Many times B. uses references to the Soviets as examples, which no doubt is amusing yet dates it somewhat. Similarly there are references to daily life and women's lowly state of the time that are quaint at best. Also I was looking for something that had a heavier grammatical bent, moreso than usage. I also am not in the newspaper business, so continual references to headlines and copy editors are not of much use to me.All said, you must have this on your shelf, and you must read it, if you, like me, are editing for a living.Any solid, respected tool such as this one earns it's cost the first time you can finally go after that PITA contributor who always thinks he/she can one-up you yet again in usage."},{"Title":"The Careful Writer","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

Theodore M. Bernstein created a gem for the ages when he assembled this collection of some 2,000 entries. I cannot imagine how often I've consulted this text to resolve some slippery usage issue or to refine my own text.If you need help sorting out the use gender vs. sex, for instance, here you will find that gender is a grammatical term and not at all synonymous with sex. If you are not sure whether the context demands the use of fewer or less, Bernstein will set you straight. Did your supervisor remove all the commas you correctly inserted into a report? Check out the clear, precise explanation here.Even as the standards of language erode, there are still many who strive to uphold correctness, precision, and nuance over fad and fashion. If you can find a copy of The Careful Writer, you will have a powerful tool to help preserve the legacy of our language.Any copy editor, writer, broadcast journalist, or English professor who does not yet have a copy of Mr. Bernstein's stellar book is bereft of one of the essential compendiums of usage.

Bernstein, former consulting editor of the New York Times, wrote/co-wrote seven books on writing, but this one--in my estimation--is his best. The font styles are old; the archaic structure of its syntax at times made me chuckle; and the topic is as appealing as banana juice (though I understand our Army boys in Kuwait love it--they can't keep it stocked), but it has stood the test of time and writers should consider it a must-have for their reference library. Where else will you go with a question like, Is 'none' singular or plural? It doesn't hurt that Bernstein schools us-readers with a dry sense of humor, making the medicine more palatable.A little about Theodore Bernstein (November 17, 1904 - June 1979). He was an assistant managing editor of The New York Times and from 1925 to 1950 a professor at the Columbia University School of Journalism. When he died, Time Magazine wrote an obit bio on him that read like this:Back in the old days, a brilliant editor of The New York Times named Theodore M. Bernstein was also a professor at Columbia J School. After he died in 1979, Time Magazine noted, \\"Theodore M. Bernstein, 74...served as the paper\`s prose polisher and syntax surgeon for almost five decades, authoring seven popular texts on English usage and journalism...In a witty Times house organ called \`Winners and Sinners', the shirtsleeves vigilante caught solecists in the act.\\"Bernstein would have objected to their neologistic use of 'author' as a verb. Today, no one would even notice.Besides covering basic good grammar, Bernstein addresses the idiomatic words that are more difficult to classify and covers them with the same rigor as he does the traditional words.Here are some of his best tips:* accident vs. mishap: 'accident' is an undesigned occurrence. 'Mishap' is an unfortunate happening.* amid vs. amidst--Americans prefer 'amid'; Brits prefer 'amidst'* can vs. may: use 'can' for ability or power to do something, 'may' for permission to do it* elder vs. older: 'older' compares old things whereas 'elder' compares people* he has lots of slang-type of phrases--guild the lilly, likes of, pinch hitter (which he terms a 'weary cliche'), some of which have since 1963 become mainstream. American English is nothing if not adaptive.* hanker takes the preposition 'after' or 'for'* hara-kiri--the correct word for the more popular term, 'hari-kari' and not a correct substitute for the Japanese ritual suicide, seppuku* how come: out of place in good writing and not legitimized because Shakespeare used the term 'how chance'* incidental: takes preposition to or upon* libel vs. slander: 'slander' is oral defamation while 'libel' is defamation by any other means* like vs. as: Bernstein takes three pages--filled with humorous examples--to explain the use of these two words* madam vs. madame: one is a married woman; the other the keeper of a bawdy house* may vs. might: 'may' is present tense; 'might' is past tense--who knew that?* mixaphor--when a writer mixes his metaphors. I love this.* pupil vs. student: those who attend elementary schools are 'pupils'; those who attend higher institutions of learning are 'students' (again, who knew? In this case, probably more of a history lesson than followed)* sensual vs. sensuous: 'sensual' applies to gratification of the animal sense with overtones of lewdness; 'sensuous' applies to enjoyment produced by appeal to the senses.* though vs. although: mean the same with two exceptions: 1) only 'though' can be used in idioms like 'as though', and 2) only 'though' can be used adverbially in a final positionIf you are in a position where you must--really must--be accurate in your grammatical decisions, there is no better authoritative source than Bernstein.

I'll sell it back."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"The book opens with a vicious divorce between Beale and Ida Farange. From brief details given, it seemed like a circus of mud-slinging. And at the centre of it all is their little daughter, Maisie. The court decides that she is to split her time between her parents. Six months are spent with her mother; six months with her father. And, through all of this, both of her parents decide to use her as their own personal weapon. Sending her to the other parent with little \\"gems\\" and messages, Maisie cannot help being a carrier pigeon for her parents' continued hostility. As things progress, each of her parents remarry. And, from all appearances, her step-parents love her, care for her, and give her more love than either of her parents. However, being the people that they are, her parents decide to partake in adulterous affairs with other people, and, whether it is full intentional or not, they involve Maisie. All the while, her step-parents are drawn together out of their mutual love for the child. Instead of being an innocent child, Maisie is thrust into an adult world of intrigue, drama, and failed relationships.From the first page to the last, this book is heart rending! It appears as though Maisie was merely an accessory to her parents. She was constantly used as a way to send hurtful and damning messages to each parent, they wanted her as their own information gatherer, and so on. Every horrible thing you can imagine, her parents made her do. And, unless she had some juicy tidbit about the other parent, neither parent was interested in her company, and she was cast off to governesses. When her parents do speak with her concerning other things, she is subjected to horrible psychological abuse.Through all of this, Maisie is struggling with her position in the world, her family, and her role. While she loves Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale--and the idea of them being together--she wants her parents to want her and to be a part of their lives. At every turn, she is cast aside by the people who are supposed to love her the most. When each parent individually asks the child to come with them, it hurt to read that Maisie--in the maturity and knowledge gained from watching her parents' self-destructive and self-involved behavior--knew they didn't really want her but where just reassuring themselves that they did try to put on a show that they wanted her.Honestly, this book is extremely hard to discuss without giving everything away. Suffice it to say, this book obviously spans a number of years, and Maisie grows older as the story goes on. However, while James does not tell the specific passing of time, it is obvious in Maisie's widening of knowledge, her field of vision, and her ability to learn and manipulate the games being played around her that she is aging. While this book follows Maisie, it also seems to be a huge statement from James about parents refusing to take responsibility and the decay of the system of marriage and what people will do/sacrifice in order to keep themselves happy. At the centre of the whirlwind of her parents' divorce and multiple love affairs, Mrs. Wix's batty nature, and Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale's relationship, is a young girl who has been cast aside by her parents and desperately wants someplace, someone to belong to.The finally chapter of this book really brings home the reality that Maisie lives in. Furthermore, it also uses Mrs. Wix as James' mouthpiece to attack the behavior exhibited by both sets of parents and voice his feelings concerning the parental role. And, while I understand Maisie's final choice, I still find myself wishing that Sir Claude had been willing to do as the child had asked."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Definitely a page turner. I feel that this book was wonderfully constructed by James. This story, told through the eyes of a young girl, really does show her growth. Maisie was a blank slate and was constantly lied to but in the end she attains knowledge that will hopefully benefit her future. Highly recommended and I'm sure you will enjoy another one of James' brilliant work!"},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I was into Henry James, reading all his books. Not one of his best, but an interesting story any way."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Doh! I meant Lolita. Well, I think that Maisie is a protyope for Lolita. She adapts to being shifted around by her parents and their various lovers by becoming something of a nymphette herself with Daddy Claude. This is a must read for all of us Nabakov fans. I'm quite sure he read it too."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"This is a well thought effort by James where he tries to introduce a symmetrical relationship between two divorces parents- who each try to use the daughter as a pawn - plus the new partners of each parent. There are four primary characters plus the daughter Maisie and an older housekeeper or nanny Mrs. Wix, and a few minor characters. The book is a bit like a play with a few characters and concentrates on their dialogue.The heart of the story is what does Maisie think of the situation and how does she deal with it. As a character is the information too sophisticated for her - or does the story fit with a girl such as Maisey.That is, can she as a character be expected to understand the situation?Obviously, Henry James put some thought into creating and writing the story and it has a certain mathematical symmetry. Saying that, the prose is sometimes a bit too complicated and the story lacks drama and passion.It is the sort of book that is easy to put down and it is not a page turner.Hence 4 stars."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James. The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure. I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine. Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel. I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side. Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun!"},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Not a huge fan of Henry James. I have to read it for class. But the book came in perfect condition!"},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"There wasn't much of a plot. The author, used commas, just about, everywhere. Made it very difficult to read. It might have been avant-garde when it was introduced in the early 19th century but now, it's just a slow read where nothing happens."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I read about halfway through this book, and then I gave up. I read James' &quot;Turn of the Screw,&quot; and &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.) One of my all time favorite books was James' &quot;Washington Square.&quot; It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote &quot;Square&quot; and &quot;Maisie.&quot; This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I'd read The Ambassadors, Portrait of a Lady, and a bunch of short stories - and I flipped through two introductions that said that this was perhaps one of James's most succesful works, so I picked it up.What I discovered is that those introduction writers are crazy. This book is incredibly boring. It is, of course, well-written, and there are no parts that I can identify as specifically bad - but it fails to live, it fails to arouse any interest. Despite a surprisingly lurid and eventful plot, with people changing partners all the time, none of the characters ever feel really THERE.Maybe it's because the adults are the genuine focus of the book, with Maisie just the hub around which they spin, and using her perspective was too limiting: James is best when he can fluidly illuminate the consciousness of one character after another, and there's only so much of that you can do through a child's eyes. We get the irony of knowing more about the corrupt adults around Maisie that she does, but this doesn't really allow for a full exploration of anyone.All of this would be tolerable if we at least had a sense of Maisie, if we had a real sense of being inside a child's mind. But the star of this book is by far the least convincing little girl in the history of literature. Which means that her perspective never feels real either. It sinks the whole book.I can't think of another great writer, actually, that would be less suited to depict the world of a child than James: immediacy, physicality, animality are the words that come to mind when I think of the way children live, and they're the last words I would associate with HJ. Tolstoy and Dickens are at one end of the spectrum and he's at another.Don't bother plowing through this one: pretty much everything else is better."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Never mind the thickets of subordinate clauses. Henry James could look at ugly situations and use them as a means to explore human nature. Written about a century ago when divorce was rare, the novel deals with a little girl whose value to her appalling parents is as a weapon to use against each other. If that wasn't bad enough, nearly everyone who shows the child some kindness has a reason for doing so other than her welfare. What makes this other than pathetic is Maisie herself. She watches the adult's grim game of musical spouses with utter clarity. She may not understand everything she sees, but she is without illusions. She observes, she watches, she copes. Mrs Wix is appalled by Maisie's acceptance of her stepparent's adultery. What Mrs Wix doesn't understand is that Maisie has no conception of conventional morality. How could she? It certainly makes for an interesting protagonist. Maisie may be a strange little girl, but it is because she has lived a strange little life. Shs is more a miniature woman than a little girl because the twisted adults around her have stolen her childhood. In this, James was prophetic of what we have done to our children since he penned this novel at the dawn of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"What hubris to review a work by such a major novelist as Henry James, even though WHAT MAISIE KNEW may not be one of his major novels! All the same, a review can perhaps be useful in two regards: by commenting on this particular edition, and by suggesting how the novel might appeal to those familiar with other James works but not this one.The Penguin Classics paperback is crisply printed, comfortable in the hand, and well annotated. There is also an excellent essay by Paul Theroux. It gives too much away, I think, to be read as an introduction, but it does make a helpful afterword. If you do read the essay first, which is how it is printed, it may seem that Theroux has revealed virtually the entire plot, but in fact this is not so. James's narrative exposition is unusually swift in this book, and a lot happens very quickly, but his main interest lies in exploring the psychological depths of the situation that he has established; there is a distinct change of gear at roughly the halfway point of the book.As Theroux points out, the novel is generally considered a transitional work between James's earlier style and his later one. Theroux also locates this gear-change at the point where James ceased writing in longhand and started dictating his novels to a stenographer -- a crisis described so well by Colm Toibin in his biographical novel,THE MASTER. The first half of the book shows a leanness of style and also a great sense of humor not often associated with the author. But the book's premise is intrinsically comic: Maisie, a five-year-old girl, observes the doings of the adults around her as she is shipped from household to household in consequence of her parents' divorce, as the parents take lovers and remarry, and then as virtually everybody else in the story takes other lovers. The humor comes from the fact that while Maisie understands so little at first, the adult reader quickly picks up what is going on. The spider symmetries of the expanding web of sex make a formal pattern as clear and intricate as a dance, illuminated by James's dry wit and his beautiful ability to see through childish eyes.Several things change at the half-way point. Maisie becomes old enough to understand a little more. The adults whom she had previously observed from below now become more conscious of her as a potential ally and start using her unscrupulously to further their own ends. Twists of the plot which had at first seemed only amusing now appear as quite nasty turns of the screw, as Maisie's affections and loyalties are forced into the vise. Questions of morality come to the fore, and eventually dominate the action. The narrative tone also changes; although Maisie's knowledge and moral awareness develops considerably, James is forced into using his own voice to describe it, as though Maisie herself has lost the words to follow her own farewell to childhood.The reference above toTHE TURN OF THE SCREWis deliberate, for WHAT MAISIE KNEW (1897) seems almost like a preliminary draft for the more famous story, published in the following year. Yes, there are differences: this is comic rather than tragic, complicit rather than mysterious, and much less hermetic. The child heroine appears to come through with more wisdom and less trauma than the situation might have caused. But the final scene is astonishingly close to the ending of the later story: a struggle for control of a once-innocent child waged between a humble governess and two charismatic figures who exert a powerful hold both on the child and on each other. Only the ending is different, though no less worth waiting for."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"While this novel is a less popular work than some of the author's others, it should not be dismissed as a minor one. James' prose is refreshingly complex - a true balm in these illiterate times - and his narrative bears his distinctive creative style.Maisie is somewhat different in style from James' other works, but this is not a lapse in quality but rather a testament to his versatility as an author - he was not stuck in one particular mould. The choice of subject matter is fairly unique - I don't know of any other novels that deal with these topics in quite the same way. Social mores may have changed since James' time, but the way children are effected by such events remains the same. The story is narrated, but we see the events unfold through the child's eyes. The numerous dialogues between Maisie and her various adults portray brilliantly the veiled manner in which children are spoken to about 'inappropriate' subjects, and the vague scarcity of key details which a child should not be allowed to know is left to the reader to be unraveled. In this unraveling the reader is given a tangible sense of the child's confusion, her struggle to comprehend these unexplained happenings with her lack of definite information. It is James' intention that the reader should share in this confusion - that there should be some struggle to piece together what is occuring out of the direct line of sight. This helps to create a connection between the reader and the little heroine.Some criticize the novel for its consistantly dark tone - but this is hardly a basis on which to assign value to the work (or any work for that matter). Furthermore, what other tone could the novel have? This is after all an exploration of a group of supposed adults behaving very badly indeed towards a helpless child. The moral qualms are not all rooted in the Victorian age, many remain just as topical today as then - which is in itself quite an achievement."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Everything in this novel evokes childhood's mysteries. It all seems to take place at knee or waist-level, with the brave Maisie (who &quot;throbs&quot; instead of speaks) attemtping to develop a moral code in the middle of a custody battle between parents who are less mature than she.A tough read, but give it time to weave its spell."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I have not read any other James, except for Daisy Miller over 20 years ago, but picked this up on a friend's recommendation.Yes, you do have to read this book slower than most novels, but it is well worth it. It is a sharp, dark, and devastating satire on how adult use children. Each character that Maisie encounters uses her as a prop to meet their own emotional needs--any affection they give her is purely secondary.Perhaps many people do not like this book because it is so relentlessly dark. As the book goes on and Maisie is more and more aware of by the coldness around her the same behavior that makes the reader snicker in the first chapters becomes painful.If you are looking for a escapist period novel--skip this one. If you want something more probing--this is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"WHAT MAISIE KNEW is probably the weirdest novel by Henry James. He had already written of seamy themes before this, but now he writes a variation of one of his favorite themes--that of the corruption of the innocent. Maisie is a young female child, perhaps six years old whose parents are getting divorced. In the best of situations divorce hits hard, and this was far from the best. Maisie's parents, Beale and Ida Farange are morally depraved and care not a whit for the welfare of their daughter. Maisie is a good-natured child who wants only to be loved by the parents she loves. Maisie is the prototypical Jamesian innocent about to be plunged into a maelstrom of decay.The terms of the divorce allow Maisie to live with each parent at six month intervals, and this she does. It is what she sees and happens to her that begin to cloud Maisie's moral universe. To begin with when she stays with her father, his friends paw her in ways that smack of sexual abuse. Maisie's mother, Ida, hires a governess, Miss Overmore, to care for Maisie. Soon enough Miss Overmore begins an affair with Maisie's father, Beale, ultimately marrying him. Ida follows suit by marrying her lover, Sir Claude. So now Maisie must adjust to a set of step parents. Claude's interest in his step-daughter verges on the incestuous--indeed later on when Maisie is thirteen, she outright propositions him. Ida hires a new governess, Mrs. Wix, to take the place of the erstwhile Miss Overmore. Mrs. Wix is a decent elderly woman who truly loves Maisie and tries to inculcate in her a moral center of goodness. This sense of goodness is put to the test immediately, when Maisie's remarried parents begin a new dance of musical lovers.As Maisie ages toward young girlhood, she shows signs that she has well learned the lessons of moral depravity that abound. She has no problem adjusting to a series of new adults zipping in and out of her life as parents, step parents, and lovers of parents. Maisie even makes it easy for these newcomers to pull the wool over the eyes of their cuckolded partners by making suggestions to facilitate what is by now a familiar routine or illicit romances. By the end of the novel, a thirteen year old Maisie desires Sir Claude as her own lover. Mrs. Wix, when she hears of this, angrily demands of Maisie what has happened to the sense of moral decorum that she thought was by now firmly instilled in Maisie. The answer, of course, is that the sense of propriety was doomed from the start since Maisie early on learned the difference between words of decorum and deeds of decorum. The Maisie at the end of WHAT MAZIE KNEW suggests that children--or adults for that matter--need a ongoing foundation of goodness to show that the ugliness they may see unfolding around them need not envelop them."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I read this about 10 years ago, had to write a paper for it in college. I remember the first ~200 pages being excruciating, then the last 40 or so transforming the novel for me (for the positive). It's in the end where the themes really came together for me; it might not be a coincidence this is when Maisie really begins to emerge as an active character. Throughout the novel she passively absorbs the actions of her bourgeois parents, step-parents, their lovers, etc. Then, finally, she tries to apply what she understands, through the filter of her consciousness (and imagination), and becomes a participant in the intrigues and romances floating about her. She doesn't understand it's not her time; the object of her affections is cynical and weak, but not debauched, and in fact she is the aggressor. He tries to guide the burgeoning light of her consciousness as best he can. In the end I thought the novel was a lovely story about a child's encounter with the wall of possibility, the reconcilation of imagination with human limits."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"I think this is the most modern of Henry James' stories. Young Maisie's parents divorce and then seem to spend their lives using her to get a teach other, until they develop other interests. Sadly, the story resonates today - immature, self-centered parents and the children that they create. Henry James' insight into the life of such a child is brilliant."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Henry James' 1907 WHAT MAISIE KNEW provides deep psychological insight into a young girl's predicament, as a result of her parents' bitter divorce in Edwardian England. Inspired by a friend's comments on the \\"shuttlecock\\" lifestyle of a divorced child in the vicious game of spousal revenge, this novel studies the harmful existence of an innocent victim of a joint custody dispute. Even at the tender age of seven, Maisie realizes the wisdom of playing dumb. Although she reports little back to the opposing sides, Maisie keenly observes and thoughtfully listens to all that occurs in both her uncomfortable biospheres. Eventually she adopts the simple policy of not telling--thus refusing to provide more fuel for animosity on either side.As in THE GOLDEN BOWL--a lengthy novel dealing with the marital and emotional battles among a very limited cast of characters--this shorter work could easily be adapted for the stage, as the chapters fall naturally into Scenes. James' protracted dialogues between Maisie and the impassioned adults who dispute her parenting rights would be delicious to dramatize, although readers would lose the private psychological depth as Maisie copes with increasingly new information. She reconciles her maturing lucid udnerstanding to the empowered adults in her universe with private schemes to protect one or the other parent and later, step-parent.These intense colloquies are designed both to elicit information re events which have occurred offstage, and to stir Maisie to the brink of definitive action--which will directly effect the five adults whom we assume are most interested in her welfare: Beale Farange, Ida Farange, Sir Claude, Miss Overton, and Mrs. Wix. Little Maisie unwittingly serves as a catalyst for adult passion, while she secretly exults in bringing her favorite people together. One of the great literary ironies of this novel springs from the unexpected separations which her warm-hearted meddling precipitates. To her childlike logic, being Free is the most desirable status for formerly married persons--free to love and marry whom they choose--free to make a cherished home for her and to ease their own heartache.Maisie is further isolated from children, even girls her own age; thus she is left to puzzle out the world using only her keen observation of adult interactions. But how can the lonely girl truly develop a sense of morality--at least by Edwardian standards? Is she herself Free to choose her new and permanent step-parents? Does she have the right to demand that the adults who love her make extreme sacrifices--just to retain her presence and loyalty? Does Maisie at 12 know what is best for herself? Which path will she ultimately choose? Her final decision will impact the lives of three far-from-blameless but well-meaning adults. Maise at 12 is too worldy-wise to indulge in Child's Play. This absorbing work is truly Vintage James."},{"Title":"What Maisie Knew (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED]","review":"Although he never had children, James was interested in and had the skill to penetrate the infantile mind, sometimes in a very peculiar way, as in \\"The Turn of the Screw\\". \\"What Maisie Knew\\" depicts several years in the life of a girl, during and after the bitter and altogether farcical divorce of her parents. The initial agreement (each parent having her for six months), turns out to be a failure. The father is a merciless, egomaniac, philanderer and despicable man, who marries the girl's nanny, a woman of unrevealed intentions. The mother, after numerous adventures, marries a certain Sir Claude, a young man who develops a close relatinship of protection and sympathy with Maisie. But soon the mother is having other affairs. Far from her parents, Maisie grows basically with the new nanny, the old, ignorant, but kind Mrs. Wix, as well as with Sir Claude. After several plot twists, Sir Calude takes the girl to France (something that today would be a scandal and authorities would consider and international crime: abduction of a minor). But somehow, far from being distressed, the parents seem to be glad about getting rid of the child.This novel is, undoubtedyl, strange, and necessarily has to be narrated with a dark-humor undertone, as otherwise it would have to be a lacrimous soap opera. Maisie herself couldn't be other than a strange child, living a very odd life back when divorce and open adultery were rare and socially punished. Indeed, the novel sounds more like the story of, say, the child of a couple of Hollywood celebrities, who seem to be in trouble to remember the name of the person lying by their side most mornings. Maisie grows mature precociously, not so much out of comparison with other kids, but because, although clearly resenting the cold manipulation and bad treatment from her parents, she seems to think that life is like that. Not attending schol, she has practically no \\"normal\\" family around with which to contrast her situation. With certain naturality, she gets used to her changing circumstances, while contemplating from afar the odd behavior of adults.With he exception of Mrs. Wix and, at least in terms of his attitude towards Maisie, Sir Claude, the rest of the characters are monsters of egotism. Under current laws, they would deserve jail. And strangely, Maisie seems to traverse her life with no apparent signs of serious emotional damage.James's literature here is less convoluted and enigmatic than in other (major) pieces, but both dialogue and descriptions are characteristic of his singular style."},{"Title":"Why I Chose You (100 Reasons)","review":"My twin foster children have been with us for almost two years.

I had previously read the excellentA Dragon Apparent: Travels in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnamconcerning his travels in Indochina in the early \`50's, during the war for Vietnamese independence from French colonial rule. I've had a deep and abiding interest in Burma, alas sometimes known as Myanmar, visiting the country four times in the \`80's. When I discovered that Lewis had written a travel book on the country, based on his travels in the early \`50's, I considered it an essential read.Although the central authorities were discouraging, they did not give an absolute \\"no,\\" so Lewis was able to travel throughout most of the country, when there was considerable fighting due to separatist groups, a condition that exists today. He took a boat from Rangoon to the \\"deep south,\\" Mergui, via Moulmein (of Kipling fame). He describes his departure thus: \\"There was a lassitude in the air propitious to the embarkation upon a voyage to decaying southern ports.\\" He manages to return to Rangoon by air, and then on to Mandalay (whose only \\"romantic\\" part is its name.) From there he travels by jeep to the former British hill station at Maymyo (I probably took the same WW II jeep as he, some 30 years later). Perhaps half the book is centered on his experiences in the northern Shan States, between Lashio and Bhamo, including the market held every five days at Nam Hkam. He manages to reach the far northern town of Myitkyina, famous for the jade found nearby. He returns to Mandalay by boat on the Irrawaddy, and on to Rangoon by train, despite the fact that the middle section has been destroyed by rebels.He writes with immense descriptive power, knowing the names of the birds and flora. He is also insightful into the human condition, with meaningful descriptions of the personalities that he encounters. And he studied his Burmese history before arriving, describing aspects of rule of various Burmese emperors, such as Bodawpaya (the Burmese Ivan the Terrible) dealing with such paradoxical issues that in a country where the killing of many animals and noxious pests is frown upon, or outright forbidden, the Emperors would bury people alive to protect bridges and palaces. Some of his trenchant political observations: \\"The difference between common piracy and empire-building is a matter of scale and success.\\" And one that resonated with my own experiences: \\"Although the classic English traveler is spurred on in almost all cases by nothing more sinister than an extravagant curiosity, it has been hard at the best of times for others to believe that he is not an agent of the Intelligence Service...\\" His conclusions also resonate, at least for that period, if not for today: \\"I state here my sincere belief that the average Burmese peasant working his own land, lives a fuller and happier life, and is a more successful human being than the average Western factory hand or office worker.\\"But I had several problems with the book. Save for one powerful passage on the attempt of 20,000 to flee into India ahead of the Japanese in WW II, he mentions the impact of the war on the country minimally, and it was a devastating event for them. Likewise, he was light on the actual impact of British colonial rule, discussing in greater detail the invasions by the Mongols, and the Chinese. He never mentions the experience, and book written by a former British colonial officer in the \`30's, George Orwell. Emma Larkin did justice to Orwell by writing a book on the places he lived. Finally, and most stunningly, he never mentions Pagan! The ultimate tourist destination for any Burmese visitor.Fortunately I was able to visit Pagan thrice; Lewis however had the time, and \\"guts\\" (or stupidity) to risk traveling in unsafe areas, and seeing so much more of the country that was \\"off-limits\\" in the \`80's. Overall, a very good book for any traveler. Sadly the conditions he describes in the 50's are largely still true today, unlike the ones described in \\"A Dragon Apparent.\\" Burma remains an enormous, open-air, history museum.Finally, Eland Publishers deserves much credit for keeping this book, as well as numerous other travel books in print."},{"Title":"Golden earth: Travels in Burma","review":"I read this book in preparation for a trip to Burma that I was embarking on. Norman Lewis travelled there shortly after the country received its independence from the British and this book is best read as the reports of a historical eyewitness. Much has changed in Burma since Lewis travelled there and so this book only provides limited insights into contemporary Burma, but it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Golden earth: Travels in Burma","review":"Like those jerks who go mountain climbing before a snowstorm, this author went exploring in Burma in 1950 despite everyone's warnings. Hitching rides on broken down trucks, sleeping on bug infested floors, boarding trains that were expected to break down or be attacked, he somehow survived to tell about it. Some of his descriptions were well written, but I came away knowing more about his bad choices than about Burma. My time would have been better spent watching \\"Lonely Planet.\\"'"},{"Title":"A Listener's Guide to Mozart's Great Operas (Dover Books on Music, Music History)","review":"If I am not wrong, this book has been previously released under the title &quot;Famous Mozart Operas. An analytical guide for the opera-goer and armchair listener&quot;, that's at least the title of the second edition I now have in front of me. For the readers acquainted with it, this new title may be a little misleading and suggesting a new revised edition. Equally misleading may be the double authorship: the Amazon.com database gives both Spike Hughes and Patrick Cairns Hughes as the book's authors, but this is simply a confusion resulting from the fact that Spike Hughes's real name - Patrick Cairns - has been used for copyrights. Hughes's book is a wonderful guide for anybody interested in Mozart operas - beginners will find here expert guidance through the operas' complicated plots, advanced Mozartians - a series of delightfully written essays highlighting many important points too often taken for granted. In the author's words, the book is meant to &quot;serve as a supplement to those programmes found in most opera houses or to the analytical notes on the picturesque &quot;sleeves&quot; of L.P. records (I imagine that the new edition has &quot;CD&quot; here) which tell the story in more or less intelligible terms but do not always explain why the tenor should suddenly want to burst into a song, nor what he is singing about when he does&quot;. The guide contains 343 musical illustrations usually no longer than 5-6 bars, designed, according to the author, with the student of orchestration in mind, but this shouldn't set off anybody without a reading knowledge of music. Even without it, one is able to follow and enjoy Hughes's musical arguments easily - his language is simple and devoid of heavy specialistic jargon, though readers with no theoretical knowledge of music may sometimes need to consult a little dictionary of musical terms. I can't help thinking how wonderful it would be if such a delightful book - one of its kind - could be re-edited in our CD-room era with these musical illustrations actually played - or, even easier, supplemented by references to certain milestone recordings (just little notes on the margin referring to tracks and timing - nothing more simple in the CD era!). The book is divided into 5 chapters, each devoted to one opera (&quot;Entfuehrung aus dem Serail; the three Da Ponte operas; Die Zauberfloete). Musical illustrations are inserted along the text and, where necessary, shortly discussed. These illustrations together with Hughes's insightful comments are the high points of the book and it would be difficult to find a popular introduction to Mozart's operas done with more charm combined with expertise. The guide is also very helpful in following stage productions of Mozart's operas either in the theater or on video. We have to remember that Mozart's stage instructions are very often skimpy and most of the important staging hints can be found in the libretti themselves (this seems to be of no importance to some opera directors today). Hughes's book offers its readers a vivid description of an &quot;ideal&quot; production, taking into considerations even the smallest of Mozart's stage directions. It also highlights certain difficult points, easily unnoticed, but important for the dramatic action. It is so easy to get lost in some of the plots - &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; being the best example - and Hughes does everything to make them as clear as possible, often borrowing helpful hints from literary works or other operas (here Beaumarchais's original play and Rossini's &quot;Barbiere&quot;). How many times did you wonder about the relation between Rossini's and Mozart's characters? If you are not eager to read Beaumarchais, this guide will answer all your questions. Here and there the author makes some mysterious statements that make you feel like a bad student who didn't do his homework. In the chapter on &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, page 200, description of Tamino's encounter with Papageno, brings a surprising piece of information about Papageno's past (supposedly told by Papageno himself): his &quot;mother had been in the service of the &lt;Queen who flames like a star at night&gt;&quot;. I was really surprised, since the libretto - at last in the form I know it - never says anything about Papageno's mother, even more - the bird-catcher, asked by Tamino about his parents, declares that he knows nothing about them. Everything he knows, he continues, is that he has his straw hut nearby, which protects him &quot;from the rain and cold&quot;. I don't know where the idea of Papageno's mother comes from, but before I suggest a mistake I would like to hear from more experienced Mozart opera lovers. The other strange statement appears in &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;, when Despina, laughing at the two &quot;Albanian&quot; visitors' appearances, says - in Hughes translation: &quot;What clothes! What faces! What moustaches! Are they Poles or Turks or what?&quot; I am Polish and I was very surprised to find an allusion to Poles in no less than one of the Mozart's masterpieces, while the whole operatic literature contains maybe two or three. Despina, however, doesn't say Poles, she says &quot;Vallacchi&quot;, what - if you listen to the opera without following the printed text - can easily be taken for &quot;Polacchi&quot;. But Poland was hardly exotic in Mozart's times (in fact, it never was because of generally Western character of its culture) and making Guglielmo and Ferrando look like Poles wouldn't help create an exotic aura around them. \\"Vallacchi\\" are simply Wallachians or Rumanians, if we want to use a more familiar term, Wal(l)achia being a province of Rumania. These are, however, minor complaints about the book that cannot be praised enough for its charm, general expertise and beautiful language - the world of Mozart's operas as seen through it is now even more delightful (if it were possible). Indispensable!"},{"Title":"The Razorbacks: A story of Arkansas football","review":"This is a good overview of the history of the Arkansas Razorback football program. Henry glosses over many good teams, however. He focuses particularly on the mythical championship team of 1964 and leaves a lot out about the better teams of 1969, 1988 and 1989. He has also left out many lettermen from the list in the appendix."},{"Title":"The Razorbacks: A story of Arkansas football","review":"Besides the Bible (seeing it is at the top of my list), this is one of the best books I have ever read.

Jim Bailey covered the earliest years of Arkansas football, beginning in 1894 and taking us through the 1956 season, when Coach Jack Mitchell resigned to take over at his home state university, Kansas. Mr. Henry picks it up with the hiring of Coach Frank Broyles and covers the next forty plus years including the dying days of the old Southwest Conference and Arkansas' lead-off jump to the Southeastern Conference with Athletic Director Broyles steering the HOGS all the way in the right direction. Looking back at that momentous decision, and knowing of very recent developments involving the Big XXII (now 10), the Big 10 and the PAC 10 (almost 16), Coach Broyles couldn't have made a better decision."},{"Title":"Lucan: The Civil War (Pharsalia) (The Loeb Classical Library, No. 220)","review":"If I had known it was another translation of Lucan, I would not have ordered it, BUT I would have made a mistake. This work has a better translation for the modern reader, and lots of good supporting information. Some of the comparisons I made with other versions make me wish I had this ten years ago. The notes are worth the price of the book!"},{"Title":"Lucan: The Civil War (Pharsalia) (The Loeb Classical Library, No. 220)","review":"Lucan, the author of the full-throated but incomplete epic the \\"Civil War\\", certainly deserves a spot next to the great Latin poets Ovid, Horace, and Virgil, whose epic works mark the pinnacle eloquence and intelligence of Latin verse. The epic was written during the reign of Nero in the first century AD, and it is characterized by its vehement condemnation of civil war and imperialistic sentiments--this possibly caused Lucan's later fall out of Nero's favor. The primary characters in the epic are Julius Caesar, who is portrayed as a destructive warmonger, and Pompey (Magnus), who is described as ambitious and over his prime. The vivid descriptions of the wars in this work are exciting and at the same time sobering since Lucan's narrative never fails to reveal those attributes of civil war which invoke the most disturbing of feelings. For all this, Lucan's \\"Civil War\\" is recommended, and also because the Oxford World Classics always present reliable translations, and this particular edition retains Lucan's charming and long-winded verse that courses so smoothly through the hearts and minds reader's who are fortunate enough to come into contact with it."},{"Title":"Lucan: The Civil War (Pharsalia) (The Loeb Classical Library, No. 220)","review":"An underrated work of the Silver Age. There are some excellent epsiodes that could stand on their own as mini-epics: the suicides of Vulteius and comrades, Appius 'rape' of the Pythia, Caesar's journey by sea, Scaeva's aristeia, Erictho's necromancy, and Cato's journey through Africa to name just a few. The historical insights into the lives of Caesar, Pompey, and Cato are also especially enlightening. Absolutely worth a first and second look!"},{"Title":"Lucan: The Civil War (Pharsalia) (The Loeb Classical Library, No. 220)","review":"Braund is painfully literal, which may her translation great as an aid to my reading of the Latin text, but made the translation itself a bit unexciting. The trouble with Lucan, in my view, is that so many of his richest moments are also incredibly subtle. There's also no way to deny that it's difficult--very difficult--to render the geographical/astronomical/sophistic passages interesting to modern English readers.Braund had a great set of notes at the end, too. (I wish these were footnotes, but beggars can't be choosers. There aren't many editions of English Lucan in print.)"},{"Title":"Growing Beautiful Houseplants","review":"This work contains more USEFUL information onhouseplants in one volume than you might find in ashelf of other books.The author starts with basic understanding of theplants and explains them as broad and usefulcategories; e.g., flowering plants, foliage plants,bromeliads, succulents, and orchids. Then follows brief butcomprehensive essays on bulbs and tubers, bonsai,greenhouses, window plants, planters, and thephysiology of plants with particular attention tothe necessities of light, soil, temperature, dormancyperiods, diseases, and other essentials.Then follows the heart of the book; a compendium ofover 1,000 varieties of houseplants, most illustratedin color photos, and here's the genius of the work:each listing gives the necessary care in detail, withpropagation details, light requirements, optimumtemperature, water needs, humidity, and preferredsoil. Try finding all that in one other book!The last section groups plants in tables such as&quot;plants that need half shade&quot;, &quot;plants that requirea dormant period&quot;, &quot;plants for an office&quot;, etc.,for very handy reference.

This reviewer does notemploy numerical ratings.)"},{"Title":"Growing Beautiful Houseplants","review":"I've been trying to find a good comprehensive book on indoor plants that is at least the equal of my old standby, Foliage Plants for Decorating Indoors by Mr. and Mrs. Elberts (1989, Timber Press)[q.v.]. That book gives info on each plant from the direct knowledge of the authors and as a result has proved to be the best tropical houseplant book bar none, thus far. They give personal observations, recommendations, etc. Whereas 19 out of 20 such books have the usual set of short paragraphs with pedestrian info (i.e. dimensions, temperatures, light requirements, etc.). The Elberts also cover a goodly number of varieties and cultivars one is likely to encounter.I had hoped this book was the worthy \\"colleague\\" to the Elberts: the other review was good and I even held the book in my hand briefly at my local nursery. And yet when I got it for my own and began to really look through it, I was disappointed. Why? Well often the photos are not illustrative - they feature just flowers or just leaves, or some other aspect of the plant rather than the plant as a whole. If I didn't know what the overall habit and look of a given species was before I referred to this book for info, I would be left still without an idea. Also, there are too many cacti in this book. Now I love cacti and I even specialized in them once, but they are not indoor FOLIAGE plants in the tropical houseplant vein. Too many orchids too - there are books aplenty just on orchids. They don't need to be in here, except perhaps for the definitely terrestrial types such as the Jewel Orchid (Haemaria, or Ludisia). There are even outdoor plants here, like Eustoma, Ipomoea, Leucothoe, et al.). Lastly the text which is supposed to be the meat of the book's info will leave you starving. The author does not even give you dimensions! How large or small is this plant? Hello!?This is a book that was translated from the German, and is almost of a size worthy of coffee table books. Well, maybe it IS a coffee table book. Regardless, it is as disappointing as it is big. The sub-title is \\"An illustrated guide to the Selection and Care of more than 1,000 varieties\\". Hrumph! I would have preferred fewer varieties better covered and photographed."},{"Title":"Curious naturalists (Natural history library)","review":"A fantastic book written by Nobel prize winner Niko Tinbergen.

If Dave Etter were a boxer then getting into the ring with him would mean getting a boxing lesson. He would teach you a few things, first with his left jab, followed by a quick two-step shuffle, and then he would dance away from you smiling. You'd know he was going to knock you out later, and he wants you to think about it for awhile.Dave Etter is that kind of poet where every stanza is a surprise and he makes it look oh so easy. LOOKING FOR SHEENA EASTON continues the journey that began with GO READ THE RIVER which many place side by side with Etter's ALLIANCE, ILLINOIS as a masterpiece of modern poetry. I would be in agreement on that point. Dave Etter has been described as a Midwestern Poet but he speaks a universal language. His voice is the voice of midland peoples; the small town farmers, the lonely housewives, the frustrated teenager, the blue collar laborers, and the white collar entrepreneurs. And the land that often characterizes their lives - the endless fields of tall prairie corn, the rivers and valleys. And always there are the small towns, some no more than flyspecks on the map, but all vital and alive with the characters that inhabit these poems.The title poem establishes the theme that runs through the book. Etter uses the once highly visible Sheena Easton to represent loss: Something I had wanted to hang on to/was lost and gone forever./The people I loved who lived and died/in the Twentieth Century/are now farther away than ever/and I can't tell them goodbye again.Etter uses the title of Easton's famous James Bond song, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, as a rhapsodic refrain. The forty four poems that follow vary in tone and length, although most fill the space of a single page. Etter is justifiably lauded for the brevity of poems that are startling in their complexity and depth. Here is a writer of genius who can transform a solitary blank page into an insightful exposition on life. What creative depth Dave Etter can do with one page puts the rest of us to shame. Rather than describe the remaining poems, I leave it to interested readers to discover the magical work of Dave Etter. He is perhaps America's best living poet, and while he has experienced extraordinary critical acclaim during his career, let us all make certain that his present work receives the attention that it deserves. LOOKING FOR SHEENA EASTON is a knockout punch."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and The Marvelous Land of Oz","review":"I not only got the book much sooner than I excpected, it was in MUCH better shape than I had expected.

Unlike most of those who agree with me, I've gritted my teeth and continued through the series cringing as the woman mows over other characters with complete lack of human compassion or sense of her impact on those around her.I do agree that Carol O'Connell is a powerful story teller who brings her quirky and often surrealistic characters to life. With this fourth book in the series, I do feel more of a hook which keeps me reading Mallory. This book takes her to her roots and I find myself beginning to understand her a bit better, but I still have trouble liking her. And I have difficulty respecting Charles Butler, rather pitying his obsessive love for this person. But although I felt as if I was plodding through the book, I feel a growing fascination.So in this review, I speak especially to those others who hate Mallory in tentatively recommending the book. You do learn more about her and the revelation as to why she insists on being called Mallory rather than by her given name. You may well find yourself caught up a bit more in this series. I read somewhere that Mallory is definitely, for many of us an acquired taste and my reaction was who in his right mind would want to acquire a taste for her.But as I labelled this review, it is a turning point and if you've gotten this far in the series, it may be worth your while to continue with this book."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"OK, I'll be the lone voice of dissent. This book (all O'Connell's books) shows a skilled writer with great descriptive ability and storytelling skills. Then WHY are we treated to a pseudo-mystical cardboard main character? Mallory is a barely functional psychotic, yet we're expected to fall for her gorgeous looks, computer skills (yeah, just try read the part about her controlling the power grid on a per-streetlight and per-room basis, from a homemade laptop, atop a powerpole, without laughing) and her ability to withstand physical pain. Sheesh!O'Connell could do so much better. I won't read another of her books!."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"After reading the previous three books in this series, I'm afraid this story was a bit of a disappointment but maybe that's because I hold O'Connell to too high a standard and certainly any Mallory book is well worth reading. However, I found some of the town's characters to be a little far fetched not to mention stereotypical and the mystery surrounding Mallory's youthful years which ended on the streets of NYC had a few holes (so much was made of Mallory only having this telephone number and we never found out who it belonged to although we know it was a female and can assume it was Augusta and why didn't her mother just tell her to run to either of their closest neighbors since surely Augusta or the scupltor would have helped?, etc.). The resolution to this story was not as crisp as all the others and I felt that so much more could have been done with the revelation of Mallory's past; but don't get me wrong, the murder mystery of both past and present was well crafted."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"After racing through the three previous books in the series (Mallory's Oracle, The Man Who Lied to Women, &amp; Killing Critics,) I could hardly wait to start Stone Angel. Kathy Mallory is a fascinating character and the hints about her past in the rest of the series really whetted my appetite for the truth promised in the fourth book. Unfortunately, Mallory is only a supporting player in this one. Charles Butler (in jeans on a big white horse!), Riker, and some interesting locals have center stage, here. The Louisiana setting is intriguing,with all kinds of colorful characters from an elderly ecoterrorist to an Elmer Gantry-style evangelist, but the final solution to the mystery is more sordid than satisfying. Anyone who enjoyed the other Mallory books will want to read this, but be warned - it is slow going! All the right ingredients are here, but without a more active role for the main character, this literary gumbo ends up having all the flavor of dishwater. Author O'Connell seems unable to get past the charm of the young Kathy (who was actually more interesting as a wild child in New York City than as the happy doctor's daughter she used to be before her life went bad)in order to show any kind of catharsis in the adult. I would read more of her books on the strength of the rest of the Mallory series, but I would not recommend Stone Angel to anyone who was not already in love with Mallory."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"This book does not come close to my other favorite CarolO'Connell books such as Killing Critics, The Man Who Cast Two Shadows. Very disappointed. Hope the next book is better."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Kathy Mallory is back in the most riveting, complex novel of the series. Sociopathic New York Detective Mallory takes on the bayous of Lousiana as she returns to her hometown to set some things straight. The mystery is not as important as the story and O'Connell introduces several new, very interesting characters - specifically Sheriff Tom Jessop and Augusta Trebec. The interactions and the actions are fascinating and the plot twists and turns enough to mesmerize. Mallory is not the whole story in this novel, which is a turn for the better. In addition, we finally see a little bit of human reaction and emotion. Mallory may be made of stone, but the surface chips slightly here. This is a keep-you-up-at-night book; O'Connell keeps getting better and better. You must read this one but be forewarned, it makes more sense if you've read the other three Mallory novels first. Let's all hope that O'Connell continues to humanize Mallory more and more (but not too much, she's at her most interesting when she's in her total sociopath mode) and can find a way to bring Tom Jessop into future books - the surface stereotype small town southern sheriff with much more than meets the eye! Mallory is the most interesting hero(ine) introduced in many years and O'Connell characterizes her perfectly.

Definitely the best of the \\" Mallory books,~ * ~ I believe this book is really the best read if you have read the other books in the series (\\"Killing Critics\\" etc.). However, I did share the book with some people who were new to Mallory and they said they enjoyed it immensely.~ * ~ Mallory was taken in at age 12 ?? by an NYPD cop, who found her as a tough street kid, apparently a \\"throwaway\\", in earlier novels she is eerily without the type of \\"consicence\\" we recognize though we can sympathize with her ruthless pursuit of justice, especially in avenging her foster father's death.~ * ~Now Mallory has returned to what apparently once was \\"home\\" the scene of an inexplicable crime- the murder of her mother, a well liked, caring physician.~ * ~ Mallory tries to refuse any assitance in her quest for justice and vengeance, but eccentric and loveable allies fall in beside her in an elaborate plot to uncover the truth and strike terror into the hearts of the guilty.~ * ~This novel is almost frightening in the way in which the reader becomes a willing participant in the quest for revenge. The author does a wonderful job of first enticing us into the plot and then shifting back to consider whether the quest for vengeance itself is really such a good idea even in the face of the enormity of the crime, as no-one involved can emerge unscathed. Very beautifully done- this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Love the story. BUT the editing was awful!! One of main characters was named 'Riker', we got \\"Piker\\" instead. Not so bad, easy to figure out. A question was asked and the answer was \\"Nof.\\" These are just two of 15 to 20 errors. Very distracting from the story and the Kindle product."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"it was wonderful.I love Carol,she puts a different spin on things.She mades you want to stay up alnight reading the book"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"All I ask of this genre of fiction is entertainment. Perhaps Carol O'Connell's depiction of New York City's particular \\"brand\\" of crime and murder (and all its elements: victims/detectives/police/characters (central and peripheral)/chance-passers-by/location/language/etc.) can only be fully appreciated by New Yorkers. In fact, I doubt if anyone can completely get her novels if they aren't a New Yorker, in some shape or fashion (e.g. from any borough, time/duration/East- or West-Side/Up- or Down-town, bred and born, temporary or fleeing:-). New York City is a central character in the series, Stone Angel included via contrast. Riker is always priceless as are the ghosts of Mallory's foster father and mother, Louis and Helen Markowitz. Red herrings abound, cleverly done. Mallory, herself, is a well crafted, modern, anti-hero. From the beginning of Mallory's Oracle through Stone Angel to Find Me, she is better than any other such character I've encountered. I adore O'Connell for creating her. I cried at the end of Find Me as I realized Mallory had truly run her road and I couldn't imagine O'Connell having anywhere else for Mallory to go that wasn't anticlimactic. Judas Child is excellent as is Bone by Bone (testaments to the author's craft) but how can there ever be another Mallory? Brava, Ms. O'Connell! Ignore all critiques to the contrary. Please find your way to continuing to entertain us. \\"We\\" need you."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Kathleen Mallory returns home to collect the evidence necessary to prosecute the leader of the murders of her mother.

Actually, Kathleen is aided by some exceptional strong secondary characters whose own searches for the truth have taken them down bitter roads.O'Connell draws complex characters with a sharp pen and keeps the reader riveted for the next page of murder, cultism, greed, and hatred.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"After becoming fully gripped in the Kathleen Mallory series, I was blown away by Stone Angel. In this book we learn about Mallory as a child, and the horrific event that (almost) destroyed her soul. But as you will see in the interactions with Ira and Charles, Mallory is much stronger and emotionally developed than previously indicated. This one will deserve a second, and a third, read to fully appreciate the writing efforts."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"This book was fantastic. I could not put it down. The descriptives of the town and people were so perfect it was like being home in Louisiana again and that is a priceless treasure!! I have recommended this book to several people who love mysteries as I do. Definitely worth your time and money!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"This, the fourth in the Mallory series, was a thoroughly engrossing read. Ms. O'Connell's character development is exceptional. The plot is intricate without being overly busy. This book did cause me an embarrassing moment. The scene where Mallory is reunited with her very old dog triggered uncontrollable sobs which proved to be rather disconcerting for the people around me in the dentist's waiting room. There were a few chuckles too. When Detective Sergent Riker meets Sheriff Tom Jessop, it's a match made in heaven. You could probably read and enjoy this book without reading the previous books in this series, but I think you would be missing out on a lot. All of Ms. O'connell's books to date have been very good."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I loved the first book in this series but was a bit disappointed in the second and third. I was starting to dislike Mallory a bit and hoped the author would be able to at least explain her more. At the same time I didn't want to see Mallory &quot;redeemed&quot; - I enjoy reading about imperfect heroines who don't anguish over their &quot;faults.&quot; This book is absolutely perfect - it reveals some of Mallory's past with empathy and respect for her present character, in a realistic and logical manner. It also leaves the reader with more questions about Mallory and whether her experiences in this book will result in any changes to her essential nature. Thanks for Ms. O'Connell for not spoiling Mallory for her faithful fans."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Rather than dwell on the books I wish to share a discovery - why O'connell wrote them in the first place.I believe she had an inspired vision of a character - Mallory - which she wished to reveal to us. No doubt in her &quot; writing room&quot; there is a huge bulletin board. upon this board O'Connell artfully sketched out Mallory's life. Once this was done she then began the task of constructing story formats each of which would slowly reveal more of Mallory. I don't believe for a minute that we know all there is to know. Carol - I await the next step in my journey."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Before reading the Stone Angel you must read the first two books in the Mallory series! This book was slow in places but more than made up for it in the end. We see a small crack in Kathy's hard shell, and a toughening up of Charles. The ending of the book was so well written it had my heart pounding, my pulse racing, and a feeling of looking over my shoulder as I tried to help by pushing them along. A great way to come full circle. I can't wait to see how Mallory develops after this! ."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Mallory is not our typical heroine. This book grabs the reader within the first several pages and doesn't let go until several days after finishing the book. This book contains some of the most original and unexpected twists yet. It is also written for a more sophisticated reader. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I read Judas Child by this author and thought it was one of the best books that I ever read. I loved the writing style and the story and expected the same from this book. There were some surprises to Stone Angel but there was many drawn out areas. The characters and story line were extremely unrealistic and it didn't have the page turning excitement to make that acceptable."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I'm lucky enough both to have read all the Mallory books in the order written, and to be a native of South Louisiana. Some have complained that the writing is complicated and difficult to navigate, but that's the mark of a great writer--someone who can think on many different levels while telling a story. O'Connell captures the local idiosyncracies well, and accomplishes perfect timing by revealing in this novel the explanation for Mallory's complexity. It and its preceding novels are a litmus test for who the truly dedicated (and compulsive) mystery readers really are. O'Connell is mystery writing's best kept secret."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"This was a poor attempt at any kind of writting. I was upset that they used the same title as the great margaret lawarance. it made me quite upset. the book was overly poor and i was quite disappointed."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Alive with eccentric and oddball characters, \\"The Stone Angel\\" explores the sinister undertones of small town dynamics and the dark secrets festering in the hearts of communities which can drive people to murder.I have not read any of the previous Mallory novels, which did not mar my enjoyment of this book - quite the opposite, I found the character of Mallory equally fascinating and disturbing, and was soon drawn into her quest to search for her mother's killer. There is nothing ordinary or predictable in this book and its characters, giving it an almost dreamlike feel - or nightmarish at times. Each character is so flawed, and so disturbed, that finding out about their history is like unpeeling an onion and finding it rotten in the middle. I admit it took me a little while to get into the author's writing style, but soon her wickedly dark humour and keen observations had me enthralled and wanting more. Feeling equally moved, repelled, shocked and fascinated as the story moved towards its climax, I was unable to put the book down until I had turned the last page.A solid, unusual and spellbinding thriller - I am looking forward to reading the other books in the Mallory series."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Stone Angel is a must read if you like suspense and crime solving novels. It takes place in Louisiana and takes the reader back to Mallory's childhood. The characters are interesting, and if you are reading these books out of \\"order\\" as I have...you will learn more about Charles Butler's character, and Mallory's mysterious past. I really loved this book, it's one of my favorites of the Mallory novels as the heros show their faces, and the feminism in this book is excellent."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"It was all right but could have been better. Too much Charles, not enough Mallory and I think a little more of her past relationship with her mother and may be a hint of a future story about who her father is. In my opinion it could have been much better."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Stone Angel should not be read before the others in this series!!! Read Mallory's Oracle or Killing Critics first! This book was everything I could want from O'Connell, I could not put it down and cannot express how much I love this series--and Stone Angel is the crown jewel. Its seems that O'Connell gets better with each book, revealing just enough of Mallory to make us want more. If you love mysteries, interesting characters or great writing pick up this series--you will not regret it in the least."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Once I started reading it, I could not put it down! This book is wonderful. I loved all of the characters. I was &quot;transported&quot; to the small town where this story takes place because of Carol O'Connell's incredible writing.

If you like Mallory, you will like this book. It offers the same suspense, quirky characters, the twisting plot and even the explanation of Maloory's background. However, the bad things are: the book is written from primarily Charles' point of view; Mallory, Charles and Riker are the only original characters to appear and you are left wondering what is going to happen to our fair heroine after this story is over. Is it the end? Hopefully not because Mallory is one of the freshest takes on the fictional detective that we've had in a long time!!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I have never, in spite of wide reading in mystery, come across a more compelling charecter than Mallory. A sociopath cop who ISN'T a bad cop! The stories are great too and her relationships with everone else are different and fascinating. So far everyone I've reccommended the book to has loved it. Start with &quot;Mallory's Oracle&quot; then go with the others. &quot;Stone Angel&quot; is grteat but atypical. It makes more sense to read the others first."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"This had a Mallory I liked better. The suspense kept me going from start to finish, without any slow spots."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I have read the entire Mallory series, and I can't wait for the next book in the series! In Stone Angel, Ms. O'Connell further develops Mallory's character for us, and answers questions she raised in the earlier books. Not only was it a good &quot;whodunnit&quot; with several plausible suspects, the characters were rich and complex. When does the next Mallory book hit the market?"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I think that Carol O'Connell has perfected her Character, Kathleen Mallory by this time to seem like the cold, unfeeling perfectionist on the outside but really does hold some aspects of human emotion.Mallory is on a quest for information...information on the death of her mother and her illegal &quot;partner&quot; chases after her in an attempt to try and win her affections.Ah, I know what you're thinking...but alas, this is not one of those sappy romances with a mystery weaved into it. No, the mystery is definitely dominant and the romance is just a subtle tap on the shoulder...enough to keep you wondering about the outcome of this one-sided relationship, but your brain working furiously to solve the mystery.I'll admit that the identity of the killer was not difficult to figure out, but for some reason, I still couldn't close the book...I just kept on reading.I highly reccomend this book and all other books written by Carol O'Connell. However, it is in your best intrest to read the Mallory series starting from the beginning so you know the whole story, beginning with &quot;Mallory's Oracle&quot;."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Against a richly realised Southern Gothic background, a strange and exotic story works itself out. By the end of this novel, I was breathless with excitement, moved almost to tears by Mallory's tragedy and the damage that has resulted from it, and emotionally drained. You won't read another crime novel quite like this all year."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"A touch of gullibility in the reader is needed to admire Mallory right out of the box. But this reader is perfectly willing to be treated like a child in the interests of a truly good read. If you don't enjoy this one, you'd better swear off Mallory; she doesn't get much better than here."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"O'Connell has created a book that is both original and incredibly fascinating. I read this book in under four hours at one sitting simply because I couldn't put it down. Mallory (main character) might be on the verge of being a sociopath, but at the same time evolves as a character by not outright killing the bad guys in the end (at least most of them). But the uniqueness of this book doesn't lie in just the creation of a deeply flawed and borderline sociopath lead-all the characters are some of the most complex and colorful people to be written about in any book, period.O'Connell is a master at using seemingly insignificant details and phrases to describe places and people that make them unforgettable. She has a way of writing whole paragraphs that should lead up to a predictable conclusion-but then in the last sentence floors the reader with a different perspective. (Usually Mallory's rather illegal or sociopath views) This makes for some of the most humorous and thought provoking material that I've read in a long time. O'Connell is simply at the top of her game here, making this book, in my opinion, much better than the previous three books in the Mallory series due to tighter editing, a more emotionally involved plot, and an insane setting.The detail of Mallory's name at the end of the book completely shocked me. It showed that O'Connell has either planned out this book from the very beginning of the series, or simply is a master writer. Everything about this book is incredible-from the autistic piano player with broken hands and the old dog waiting for his owner to the haunting stone angels in the cemetery and a mischievous old lady who lets her mansion go to ruin. In short, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"The best, most disturbing Mallory book to date! O'Connell answers many reader's questions from past Mallory novels, yet leaves us waiting in anticipation for the next novel in the series!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"my largest complaint about this book - the only criticism that i have, really - is that o'connell is just too good. not only can you not put the book down, you scan ahead, skipping paragraphs in your rush to devour her words. DO NOT CONSUME HER WORK IN THIS MANNER! i've read Stone Angel six times now, and each time i pick up something i've missed, and every detail is paramount. Mallory (Hopefully we can call her Kathleen after this one)is on her most painful, obsessive mission yet, and Charles has managed to keep both his convictions and his rose-colored image of Mallory. Riker, cynical to the last, threatens to thwart Mallory's plans for avenging her mother's brutal death. The climax is riveting; images of Mallory stepping from one pool of streetlight to the next in her other-era gunslinger clothes is ultimately satisfying. i confess i missed Slope and Rabbi Kaplan, and the interplay among the NY cop shop, but hopefully they'll be back in the next of the series. Carol O'Connell is the true master, and Mallory is my hero - strength personified, but completely vulnerable. we understand why she doesn't want to be human, and yet, in spite of her self, her humanity shines through in her code of honor and her desire to protect the men she cares about. Yes, she cares, and we care. read all four novels back to back on a rainy day, and if you haven't read O'Connell's work yet, you've really missed the boat."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I started this book at 11 pm and ended it at 4 am. A big mistake, and the way I read O'Connell. My first was Killing Critics, then I ordered the first two and this one, read them seriatum in three nights. I'm exhausted, but now I can go back and savor them in order. Mallory isn't believable, except in the context of being a sociopath, and so placed, she becomes believable. The complexity of the relationships between characters Mallory, Charles, and Riker is never forced, and their interactions with the characters introduced in this book are understandable. A few spots I did say, &quot;No, I don't think so,&quot; but they were few. I certainly recommend this book. One note though, a man of 6'4&quot; isn't that shocking to people, not in NYC, so constant references to Charles's inhibitions about his height are a little annoying. I think he'd need another 2-3 inches to be as freakish as he appears in the series. A very minor quibble, I admit!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Fifty pages from the closing of STONE ANGEL I did not want the book to end. I did not want to leave Mallory or Charles or Riker or Tom or Augusta and other characters. Thirty pages from the end Carol O'Connell had me squirming in my seat with tension and anxiety. At the end I was drained and need a rest from these people...unfortunately I will get that rest while I wait for Mallory and troup to return.This is Carol O'Connell's four mystery-novel and her fourth Mallory character study. What a startling person Mallory is. As a child of ten she was arrested in NYC. The arresting officer and his wife take her into their home and raise her rather than let he be taken by the system. What a break for all of us. Mallory grows into a beautiful and extremely intelligent detective and gives us, through the talent of Carol O'Connell, some tremendous history.In the book store where I work part time, I have sold some seven hundered plus copies of MALLORY'S ORACLE (O'Connell's first). I've only had a handful say they did not enjoy the book. They are no longer allowed in the store.Each succeeding book (THE MAN WHO CAST TWO SHADOWS, KILLING CRITICS, and now STONE ANGEL), has been better and better written than the preceding one. Halfway through STONE ANGEL I wondered how I could possible induce my customers to purchase all four at once. After careful consideration I do believe I can just work with the first and STONE ANGEL. The reader will return for the middle two.STONE ANGEL is one of two of the best novels I have read so far this year and there have been some very good book printed. However, STONE ANGEL top the list because it has all those wondrous things a book can have and be to the reader. Great characters that you can love for themselves and for the interplay with each other. Evil characters that you can trul despise. Wounded characters that you can anguish over. STONE ANGEL is a mystery that is presented shrouded in magic and love. This is a book you will not put down except to rest your heart and brain and replenish your soul.There is a scene near the closing that places Augusta and Charles bareback atop a horse racing away from danger and to aid Mallory. I was with them atop that horse and it was some ride.Saddle up folks!"},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Stone Angel by Carol O'Connell is the fourth in her Kathy Mallory mystery series and one of her strongest books yet.At the end of book three, NYPD detective Kathy Mallory fled NYC without telling a soul and leaving her job and friends behind. Friend Charles Butler sees a newspaper photograph of a stone angel grave marker that looks like just Mallory. He travels to the bayou town of Dayborn, Louisiana to investigate. Mallory's partner, Detective Riker, is not far behind. Not only does Charles find Mallory, but she's being held in jail as a material witness to a murder. When Mallory was seven, her mother was stoned to death by a mob of 27 townspeople. The crime remains unsolved and not one person has ever been charged. Butler and Riker suspect that Mallory has returned to her hometown to seek revenge.The characters in Stone Angel would make Tennessee Williams proud. They include an autistic savant, an evangelist tent preacher, a mute sculptor, and an eccentric woman who is letting her mansion crumble around her to become a bird sanctuary. As with any southern-style novel, there are lots of secrets, gossip and high drama as well as a dash of alcohol and good food. We learn more about Mallory's past in the first chapter than in the first three books combined. She is determined to solve this seventeen year old crime despite a wall of silence.Two aspects of Stone Angel kept me from giving it five stars. First, O'Connell's characters are just a little too over the top (especially regular Charles Butler). But I forgive O'Connell this fault because her writing is so good. Second, this is the third mystery that I've read recently where the main character (cop or private eye) goes back to investigate the unsolved murder of their mother. I encountered the same theme with Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch series) and James Lee Burke (Dave Robicheaux series). Despite these faults, I still really enjoy O'Connell and the Mallory series."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"Kathy Mallory goes back to the southern town where her mother was murdered to seek revenge. This was one hell of a book and I read it word for word in order not to loose the thread. Deeply affecting. Charles and Riker show up in the book to try and influence Mallory.

I got shivers when it was revealed why Mallory insists in being called \\"Mallory\\". I hope subsequent books by O'Connell are as good as this one. The first ones were."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"I think this might be the book of the year. I am an avid mystery fan and have read hundeds of books and I think this is one of the best ever. I could hardly wait to get to the next page, yet I didn't want this book to end. There were numerous surprises and revelations weaving a most unusual story. Each of the small town characters had a story of their own to tell. Even though the mystery surrounding Mallory has been unveiled, the awe and excitement still exist...This can't be the end. We would all be cheated."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"After years of reading mysterys populated with angst-ridden, upper-crust British detectives or moralizing female forensic scientists, Carol O'Connell's Kathy Mallory comes as a brisk, rousing slap in the face. In the fourth Mallory novel, Stone Angel, O'Connell thrusts us on a dark, twisted journey into NYPD Police Sergeant Kathy Mallory's past. As relentless and ruthless as Mallory herself, O'Connelly drags the reader towards the increasingly horrific truth about the death of Mallory's mother... a truth that begins to explain the howling emptiness that resides within Kathy Mallory. O'Connell has undoubtedly created the finest mystery detective to hit the book shelves in recent memory. The exquisitely detailed Mallory is as sharp and cutting as shards of glass. The fact that we somehow care about this women is evidence of O'Connell's mastery of writing. If there's a mystery reader on your gift list, give them all four of the Mallory novels ...it will be the best present they receive this year."},{"Title":"Stone Angel (Kathleen Mallory Novels)","review":"There is nothing worse than jumping into a series mid-stream, unless, of course, the series has nothing whatsoever to recommend it.

I loved using it in my homeschool plans."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: Selections from The Interior Castle (HarperCollins Spiritual Classics)","review":"Teresa of Avila is one of the more remarkable figures in the history of Christianity. Living in a perilous time, when the Roman Catholic church was suspicious of anything that might develop into Protestant heresies and schisms, she walked a fine line between obedience to the political structure and obedience to God. It is often the case that mystics and spiritual giants are at odds with church structures of the day (this is rather ecumenical, reaching across Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant lines).Teresa lived at time shortly after the explusion of the Jews from Spain (which occurred in 1492). Her own family was a converso family; hence, there were different dimensions to the wariness of the powers in the culture toward her activities. Being a woman at the time didn't help matters, either, as she defied the stereotypes in several ways, by seeking education and leadership opportunities, all the while being part of the discalced Carmelites, who strive to cultivate humility and poverty.Teresa's life was not an easy one; she suffered physical ailments and political difficulties. However, she was also a sought-after advisor, spiritual leader, and fairly prolific author. Her various writings made her famous in her own day, but the towering achievement that has lasted over time is without doubt 'Interior Castle'. This text shows a spiritual journey on the inside, developing different walks through aspects of spiritual life and prayer developed in seven stages, or mansions.The life of prayer is the castle, with seven stages of development. The first three stages are pieces that humankind can practice with their own efforts; the final four stages are those which are given from God, and God alone - no human effort can reach these places. The first mansion looks to the striving toward perfection of the human soul. The second looks to different pieces that give spiritual edification; sermons, readings, prayer practices, conversation, etc. The third mansion sets forth discipline and penance, striving toward good works while reaching for self-surrender. These are not easy stages, but are within the realm of human possibility.The fourth mansion begins the mystical journey in earnest at the behest of God. Here Teresa uses a metaphor of water and a fountain to explain the soul, and explores graces as spiritual consolations. Here is the Prayer of Quiet. The fifth mansion continues the theme of water, looking toward a Prayer of Union, which leads naturally to the sixth mansion, where the soul is prepared for a marriage of sorts, as intimacy with God increases in the soul. The seventh and final, most interior mansion, which is heaven itself; metaphors here used include two candles joining as one, and the falling rain merging to become one with the river.These mansions are based on visions; Teresa was compelled to write them down at the order of her ecclesiastical superiors, for she herself thought to keep them to herself. Her writing was done very late in her life, but even so, she took care to be humble and as non-threatening as possible; modern readers might be a bit taken aback by the self-deprecation of Teresa, and the general stance she seems to take towards women. This may have been an attempt to make an authoritative text written by a woman more acceptable to the male-dominated hierarchy of the time. However, not all of Teresa's humility should be dismissed or argued away in this manner. She is reputed to have said, 'There are more than enough books on prayer already,' in response to being told to write her visions. This might have been true (then and now), but few reach the power that Teresa's 'Interior Castle' achieve.This book of selections is perhaps less intimidating than the unfiltered text (one of the better translations for English-speaking audiences is by Peers; an interesting re-cast is done by Mirabai Starr) - the selections here come from a translation done by the Paulist Press, and so will make pieces familiar for those who want to continue with their work with Teresa in greater depth."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: Selections from The Interior Castle (HarperCollins Spiritual Classics)","review":"Saint Teresa of Avila's spiritual insight is remarkable. Anyone who has read her work with reverence knows this.I take particular exception to the Foreword to this edition of her work, though. Patricia Hampl seems to think it would be helpful to reiterate our 20th and 21st-century biases before we plunge into the interior world of Teresa. Her foreword is rife with irrelevant political commentary, to say nothing of its banal syncretism, a predictably dialectical approach to orthodoxy and freedom in traditional Christianity and a downright daft approach to the history of Teresa's time.Dallas Willard, at the very least, has the good sense to remind the reader in his Introduction that this is a specifically Christian mystical text. However, he, perhaps unintentionally, sets up Teresa's work as something truly exceptional within the tradition. Far from it! Teresa is genuinely representative of an age when Christian mysticism was still rooted firmly in contemplative and sacramental piety. Contrary to Willard's observation on the rarity of Teresa's spiritual depth, Christian tradition has produced a treasure trove of mystical literature, of which Teresa's work is just one sparkling jewel.These ostensibly silly commentaries mar the spiritual beauty of a woman who actually has something profound to say, and so I can't give the HarperCollins edition of Interior Castle five stars. The publisher would do well to find more qualified commentators."},{"Title":"Teresa of Avila: Selections from The Interior Castle (HarperCollins Spiritual Classics)","review":"St. Teresa of Avila was a daughter of the Church. For someone to write a foreward to her works and to malign the Church is both a contradiction and an affront to this holy woman."},{"Title":"The glory of the Empire;: A novel, a history","review":"There's a very small & wonderful niche in literature occupied by the invented history, detailing the legends & customs & people of nations created wholly out of the author's imagination, yet set in this world. Austin Tappan Wright's \\"Islandia\\" is the Olympian benchmark for this sort of book, but there have been others, such as Jan Morris' \\"Hav\\" & Ursula LeGuin's tales of Malafrena.Lesser-known is Jean d'Ormesson's \\"The Glory of the Empire\\" -- and that's a pity, because it's an irresistable, compulsively readable story of an empire that lasted a thousand years, conquering both Europe & Asia, leaving its traces in rich art & literature. That none of this actually happened in mundane recorded history is utterly beside the point. What matters is the telling of the tale, in the style of an old-fashioned narrative history that reads like a novel, but is ornamented with countless baroque historical & academic details.Not that the story itself is ever academically dry! From the days of the barbarian prince Arsaphes, to the age of the golden emperor Alexis, to the decline & fall of the Empire, the reader is swept up in an epic that amazes & delights with every page. It's told with a certain touch of sly, satiric humor, delivered with deadpan seriousness that makes it all the more enjoyable.I sometimes think that if the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series had lasted a bit longer, editor Lin Carter would have added this novel to its ranks, as a sort of then-contemporary \\"Islandia\\" -- it even has a gorgeous cover by frequent Adult Fantasy series artist Robert LoGrippo. But it's not typical generic fantasy -- the readers of Jorge Luis Borges (for instance) will likely enjoy it as much as those who have traveled in Islandia. It's definitely a literary fantasy, in the best sense of the world, engaging the mind as well as the emotions.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The glory of the Empire;: A novel, a history","review":"This book describes the rise of a fictitious empire. Ormesson recounts in detail the heroes and heroines of this nation, that is at once like and unlike that of the Roman Empire. This book is the spellbinding result of meticulous research and boundless imagination."},{"Title":"Puritan Treasury of Quotations (Puritan Paperbacks)","review":"1st Reason: The writings of the Puritans are so voluminous (and often prolix) that any source that allows you to sample so many of them so quickly is worth owning. 2nd Reason: The subject matter lends itself to delivering alot in small measure, and the Puritan writers could be very pithy. 3rd Reason: These sayings and passages stay with you because they have a real foundational strength and truth in them. They are worth memorizing too. 4th Reason: Though it's now relatively easy to acquire most of the well known Puritan writers many of them still are difficult to find, and this book includes selections from many of the hard-to-find ones. 5th Reason: The selections are ordered by topic. 6th Reason: To quote the back cover: \\"This book does not belong to the ordinary run of anthologies but is a masterful selection by an author who has given many years to his work.\\" (My sense is, though, that anybody who puts together an anthology of Puritan selections will be faced with such an embarassment of riches that it would be difficult to do a poor job, not to take anything away from Mr. Thomas.) 7th Reason: The Puritans, because of their focus on practical aspects of Christian teaching, can provide insight and validation to people who maybe have learned some things from other sources; and, along this same thought, this can also increase valuation for Christianity in people who are perhaps only familiar with more shallow Christian writing or preaching. It can inspire one to read more of the Puritans as well. That being said, the Puritans themselves would remind:\\"The Bible is the statute-book of God's Kingdom, wherein is comprised the whole body of the heavenly law, the perfect rules of a holy life, and the sure promises of a glorious one.\\" - Ezekiel Hopkins\\"The Scripture is the library of the Holy Ghost; it is a pandect of divine knowledge, an exact model and platform of religion. The Scripture contains in it the 'credenda' (the things which we are to believe) and the 'agenda' (the things which we are to practice).\\" - Thomas Watson\\"The Christian is bred by the Word, and he must be fed by it.\\" - William GurnallRead the Bible 7 times complete - Genesis through Revelation - before you die, or die trying.

More primitive, rustic in a way (mostly sand and gravel, reedy where it slides down into the sea) with cottages near the lighthouse. Who'd ever think foul play would or could take place in this all natural environment located 300 miles from London.Dr. Harry Frost and his wife, Jeanie, both in their 70s, were there in July when the weather is calm and reassuring to visit their daughter and family. The inhabitants were insular but knew everything about everyone except for the two young people who had disappeared. It was the topic of gossip, because these were working residents there. Both had jobs there and their activities was the talk of all the regulars.The reserve is intended for nature lovers and has a quarry similar to Ilams in South Knoxville. This quarry fits in to the mystery as the doc does a bit of snooping around and starts his own investigation. The wife lectures a motorcycle gang, who seemed to have lacked basic civilization among other things. As the 'dreadful business' is worked out to its conclusion, the issue of smuggling was revealed. The key to the puzzle lay somewhere in the reserve itself.Written by Josephine Bell, the copyright is by Doris Ball (1966).

This is a children's picture book confusingly by the same name - an original fairytale by author and illustrator Ruth Sanderson, also know for her works 'The Crystal Mountain', 'Cinderella' and 'The Golden Mare, the Firebird and the Magic Ring'.That said, this book is an interesting mix of truly beautiful paintings (its a pity there isn't a picture of the cover on this webpage, as that always puts people off buying products) and a traditional, predicable story.After a beautiful kingdom becomes plauged by a drought the king sends his three sons Edmund, Owen and Galen to find the Heart of the World that lies within the Enchanted Wood to restore the kingdom - in finding it their purpose will be magically achieved. Successively the three head off, and individually come to a cottage on the verge of the forest, where an old woman warns them not to wander off the path no matter what. Well, you don't really need to be told any more to know exactly what happens. The two older sons succumb to temptation, while the youngest remains true to his quest and succeeds, inheriting the kingdom and marrying the old woman's beautiful daughter Rose who accompanied him through the forest (for both mother and daughter had been unwilling gatekeepers of the forest, though eventually liberated by Galen's nobility). It is an old formula, encompassing all the cliches of a beautiful maiden, the threefold trial, the cursed kingdom, the virtueous youngest brother... Even though children will certainly not be bothered by this, seasoned fairytale lovers will know the tune oh-so-well and be frustrated at its predictability. Thus the title 'original fairytale' is somewhat misused.On the other end of the scale however, some points of the story are quite confusing. It is unclear why finding the Heart of the World restores the land to its former glory, nor how it actually manages to achieve this. Furthermore, though Edmund and Owen's submissions to temptation (respectively to hunt a white stag and engage in battle with a Black Knight) are indeed vices, we are never really certain whether Galen did the right thing in turning his back on his own brothers when witnessing them in peril. Lastly, the meaning of the silver key that Rose drops into the Heart's waters and the 'ceremony' that she performs is unclear in its meaning and point.However, *please* don't let my grousing over this feature stop you from finding this book as they pale in comparison to Sanderson's exquisite oil paintings, and are in fact (in my opinion) her best. In no other book of hers has she reached the level of detail and realism that she does in 'The Enchanted Wood'. She captures motion perfectly, her animals (deer and horses) are beautiful, and all little girls be satisfied that the heroine Rose is stunning. The best part however is Sanderson's illustrations of the forest - their misty, mysterious, shrouded depths are gorgeously created, from their forbidding entrance at the iron gates to the Heart of the World - three treetrunks intertwinging to make one.The illustrations more than make up for the story and make this book a must-have for all lovers of great art, children's books, fairytales or beauty in general.It is unfortunate that it has such a well-used title, as I know of two other books by the same name (Enid Blyton's, and another 'Enchanted Wood' by the Australian writer and illustrator Shirley Barber) but the illustrations *are* worth the effort to tracks this book down, either from Amazon or your library."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Wood","review":"Ruth Sanderson is an excellent story-teller and author. This is a fine book to add to anyone's collection of fairytales or picture books.

There are not only princes and Kings with major roles but women who have more to do than just get rescued:) I love this book, for my children the lesson is wonderful!

The folly of selfishness and vanity are foremost among the lessons to be learned. Devotion to a greater good than our own individual desires is modeled, and the pitfalls of the opposite character trait. I find it fascinating that the one temptation that ruled each of the first two princes turned out to be all 'smoke & mirrors'when the enchantment was gone. There WAS no black knight, only hack marks in the trees. So often in real life, the things that detour us from a noble purpose turn out to be irrelevant."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Wood","review":"I am 23 years old and I bought this book for myself!

The Enchanted Wood, by Ruth Sanderson, is a book set back in the medieval times of kings and kingdoms, and takes place in a kingdom. After giving birth to her third son, the queen dies and the king and the land share the same grief. Then the king decides that the only way to end the drought is by going and finding the heart of the world and ask for the drought to end.There are many good qualities about The Enchanted Wood and here are a few. The genres of The Enchanted Wood are historical fiction and fantasy. One good thing that Ruth Sanderson did is that her themes are very easy to find, like her theme,\\" Don't be distracted in life by things that you want, just be glad with the things you have.\\" The main character is Galen the king's youngest son and he wants to prove himself to everbody by finding the heart of the world. This book's genre is similar to Cinderella's genre because both books are historical fiction and fantasy.The Enchanted Wood would be a good book for younger kids because ruth Sanderson wrote the book like it was for little kids. I believe that Ruth Sanderson should use more forceful language. The Enchanted Wood's theme is very easy to find where other books have it harder to find the theme. I think that this is a good book because it has a great theme. Remember, if you like medieval times then you will love The Enchanted Wood."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Wood","review":"I've never read Ruth Sanderson's version of this book but when I was about 8 years old I found an old hardcover book by the same name in my uncle's basement. It was by Enid Blyton and had been published in 1939. I just about read the covers off that book and I still have it today. I recently started reading it to my children (ages 5 and 8) and find that they love it as much as I always did. I hope Ruth Sanderson has kept the same sense of wonder and innocence that the original book had. Just a note; the original book by Enid Blyton was followed by a sequal called The Folk Of The Faraway Tree which was filled with more adventures that Joe, Bessie and Fanny had with Moonface, Silky and all the other friends they made in the first book."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Second Annual Collection","review":"The second of the massive sf annuals Bluejay/St. Martin's put out was issued in 1985, and covers 1984. Dozois meant this series to be definitive, and he does offer a great deal in it. First there's his summation for the year, with comments about the publishing industry, a report on the magazines, briefs on the year's novels, collections and anthologies, films, awards and obits. Then we have 26 stories from magazines and original anthologies. The appendix lists five pages of other stories that Dozois thought notable. Dozois prefers longer stories, so getting through a volume of his is a long haul. He sometimes chooses stories that later win awards, the best of which here is John Varley's &quot;Press Enter,&quot; a terrifying story about computers that becomes more prophetic each year. Octavia E. Butler's &quot;Bloodchild&quot; also won awards, but it disturbed me (I like other stories by her). One superb story here is Richard Cowper's &quot;A Message to the King of Brobdingnag,&quot; which takes a routine scientific experiment gone wildly wrong to its logical conclusion. Other stories I liked in this edition include: Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;The Lucky Strike,&quot; an alternate history of a bomber pilot who refuses to release nuclear weapons over WWII Japan; Gene Wolfe's &quot;The Map,&quot; a touching fable set in the earth's far, declining future; and Rena Yount's &quot;Pursuit of Excellence,&quot; about how far an obsessed mother will go to make sure that her unborn child has superior genes. Most of the other stories are worth reading, and no doubt each reader will prefer different stories. I sometimes like shortlisted (or nonlisted) stories to the ones he anthologizes. It's a shame this book is out of print, but dealers or search services can produce a copy of this book. All of Dozois's annual anthologies are worth having."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Second Annual Collection","review":"Not quite as good as the First Collection, but just as hard to find.1. \\"Salvador\\" by Lucius Shepard. Tense, poignant story of a young soldier struggling to survive a nerve-racking guerilla war in a lush, surreal jungle. Beautifully written with a brilliant ending that is subtle, shocking, and sad. Shepard kicked off the Fourth Annual with the formidable \\"R & R\\", also about troubled soldiers in a future Central American war, but this effort is stronger. A+2. \\"Promises to Keep\\" by Jack McDevitt. Standard space opera fare about a crippled space ship limping home from Jupiter's moons. C3. \\"Bloodchild\\" by Octavia E. Butler. Not for the squeamish. Wormlike aliens love humans, not for their minds, but for their bodies, in a most unusual way. Great realism lies at the heart of this strange tale: the interspecies relationships have all the depth, tension and complexity of human ones. A+4. \\"Blued Moon\\" by Connie Willis. Same problem here as in her First Annual contribution, \\"The Sidon in the Mirror\\": tricked-up linguistics in the dialog detracts from an otherwise passable story. This one takes a lighthearted look at the unexpected side effects of improper hazardous waste disposal. C5. \\"A Message to the King of Brobdingnag\\" by Richard Cowper. Crop researcher looking to cure world hunger fails spectacularly. Tautly written, laced with irony. A6. \\"The Affair\\" by Robert Silverberg. Man and woman with rich psychic powers connect for a long-distance mental yet highly sensual affair. Thought-provoking examination of where the boundaries lie-or don't lie-between physical and spiritual love. A7. \\"Press Enter []\\" by John Varley. Set around 1984, this spooky speculation on computer networks makes for an interesting read in 2003...Two Southern California misfits fall in love as they uncover lethal secrets lurking in the burgeoning Internet. However-fuzzy plot undermines sharp characters. B8. \\"New Rose Hotel\\" by William Gibson. The day of reckoning draws near for a twenty-first century gangster holed up in the New Rose Hotel. Bleak and shadowy, it's a film noir in print: the protagonist's eleventh-hour confession reads like Fred MacMurray's clipped narrative in \\"Double Indemnity\\". B9. \\"The Map\\" by Gene Wolfe. Not a big fantasy fan, so NR.10. \\"Interlocking Pieces\\" by Molly Gloss. Brief but emotionally powerful examination of medical transplanting ratcheted up a notch, featuring a pair of tragic, touchingly human patients. A11. \\"Trojan Horse\\" by Michael Swanick. The world's first total personality transplant causes massive confusion for the recipient...and the reader. D12. \\"Bad Medicine\\" by Jack M. Dann. Man in the spiritual wilderness seeks truth by participating in a violent Indian exorcism ceremony. C13. \\"At the Embassy Club\\" by Elizabeth A. Lynn. Romantic fairytale set on an alien planet with a complex, highly ritualistic Oriental-like culture. C14. \\"Pursuit of Excellence\\" by Rena Yount. Twenty-first century married couple struggle with the harsh socio-economic realities of bioengineering their progeny. Their uncomfortably realistic tale of woe is perhaps more relevant today than when it was written. A-15. \\"The Kindly Isle\\" by Frederik Pohl. A widower haunted by his past gradually finds happiness on a business trip to a tropical island. But wait! Everybody around here is happy--and he thinks he knows why. Complex, appealing characters and plot: a refreshing change from the gloomy, cynical or outright cataclysmic perspectives so prevalent in short sci-fi. A16. \\"Rock On\\" by Pat Cadigan. Set in the near future, a barely comprehensible, abrasively written, but mercifully short story about a psycho-invasive rock and roll creative process...or something. D17. \\"Sunken Gardens\\" by Bruce Sterling. Sterling's vivid imagination and descriptive brilliance carry this Mechanist/Shaper story about a high stakes terraforming contest among posthuman sects. B+18. \\"Trinity\\" by Nancy Kress. Loathsome entomologist manipulates sister and clone brother in attempt to keep them from participating in an experiment to scientifically verify the existence of God. Kress roasts atheists and believers with equal gusto, leaving us with an indigestible hash of hopeless negativity. D-19. \\"The Trouble with the Cotton People\\" by Ursula K. LeGuin. In just a few pages, LeGuin paints an extraordinarily vivid picture of a future barter based world, as seen through the eyes of a young, plain spoken traveler. B20. \\"Twilight Time\\" by Lewis Shiner. A man from a politically oppressive near future time travels back to a defining moment of his youth and encounters things expected and unexpected. Suspenseful, nostalgic, well crafted, with evocative characters and an impressive catalog of 1950's Americana. A+21. \\"Black Coral\\" by Lucius Shepard. A nasty American on a decaying Caribbean island gets his during a heavy-duty bender of drinks, drugs, and voodoo. A lush, dizzying kaleidoscope of terror. B22. \\"Friend\\" by James Patrick Kelly & John Kessel. Twisted love triangle onboard an interstellar passenger ship. B23. \\"Foreign Skins\\" by Tanith Lee. Young British boy in Colonial India becomes a man (quite literally) in a supernatural trial by fire when a mysterious woman secrets him away to her world of shape changing, reptilian demigods. B24. \\"Company in the Wings\\" by R. A. Lafferty. Psst: imaginary characters populate alternate realities. C25. \\"A Cabin on the Coast\\" by Gene Wolfe. Man on holiday with his girlfriend walks (swims, actually) into a magical illusion, and through it discovers the terrible reality beneath. Sharply written, fantastically finished. A+26. \\"The Lucky Strike\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson. Robinson seems to favor stories about men slowly being squeezed in a vise of hostile circumstances. In this one, the bombardier in an alternate reality sweats out his bombing run to Hiroshima. Taut, action-packed, vivid and realistic in both description and characterization.

It opens with an excellent summation of significant developments in SF during 1984. And each of the 26 stories is introduced with a thoughtful description of how it fits with the author's other works.Five of the stories that I particularly enjoyed:In Jack McDevitt's \\"Promises to Keep\\" a member of an historic expedition to Callisto shares his personal recollections of the voyage and the voyagers. His story is a little different than the official version. The deconstruction of history theme is similar to McDevitt'sA Talent For War.John Varley's \\"Press Enter\\" foresees many of the privacy issues we face today on the web. A man kills himself, leaving behind a great deal of troubling information. And some of the software he has written is still running. It's right behind you.Elizabeth Lynn's \\"At the Embassy Club\\" is a bar story about an undersecretary in an embassy on another planet and the sixteen-year-old girl from a prominent local family he has secretly been seeing. We know from the start that this story has been retold many times.Ursula Le Guin's \\"The Trouble with the Cotton People\\" is another of her stories that might have been told by an anthropologist. A young man travels to a far land to learn why his county's trading partner has begun shipping them inferior goods. The joy of reading it is inthe carefully crafted and credible details.Gene Wolfe's \\"A Cabin on the Coast\\" is in some ways a \`deal with the devil' story. We know the deal will turn out badly for the protagonist. But how? This one messed with my head a little. I didn't necessarily enjoy that, but I respect the author for pulling it off.This is a very good collection and is highly recommended. It is as good as, or even a little better than the first volume in the series. Go ahead and spend some time with it."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Second Annual Collection","review":"As a kid I devoured science fiction. As an adult, I just can't do it any more. Bought two different books for an18 hour flight to Europe. COuldn't get through them."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Second Annual Collection","review":"A very good anthology, and a very good copy. I have one remark, though - the cover is for the Third YBSF, not the Second, which is, frankly, quite confusing."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Second Annual Collection","review":"Potential buyers should note that Amazon appears to have gotten different years mixed together. The hardcover edition linked to as \\"The Year's Best Science Fiction Second Annual Collection (1985)\\" is actually the \\"The Year's Best Science Fiction Twelfth Annual Collection (1995)\\". Obviously these are two different books."},{"Title":"The Collected Poems of Robert Burns (Wordsworth Poetry Library)","review":"This is a poor, sloppily bound mess. Seems to be a Xerox copy of only the second volume (not even the fourth as is indicated) of the sixth edition of an 1809 four volume collection. Some of the pages are not even copied straight. Compiled with no notes, no glossary, no thought or imagination. Only contains some of Burns' letters containing some of his poetry. Worthless without context. Would be an insult to my shelves and certainly to the Bard. I should have been tipped off by the sophomoric product description. Back it goes."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"Picture yourself with a group of friends that include Miss Jane Marple. Sitting around the fire, someone brings up the idea of presenting mysteries that only you know the answer, and the other friends must solve. Guess who wins hands down every time? Yes, that little lady with lace mitts who is knitting little fluffy things.This is a fine book of short stories and, as usual, Dame Agatha outfoxed me every time. Though Miss Jane publicly disdains outlandish plots (\\"undetectable poison from an African village\\"), her creator is sometimes guilty of just that. The very few that left me less than impressed involved entirely too much running around, an outlandish premise, and an overabundance of purple prose.My hands down favorite was \\"Death By Drowning\\" when Dame Agatha shows her superb ability to misdirect. Even with broad hints, I didn't come near the answer. And never be certain that the villain will be punished, at least right away. \\"The Tuesday Night Club\\" and \\"A Christmas Tragedy\\" each have her particular brand of cleverness stamped clearly throughout.This would be a wonderful book to have in the guest bedroom, but be sure to read it first!"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"I'm not generally fond of short stories, but there exceptions: Somerset Maugham, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker... and Agatha Christie. At her best, Agatha Christie's short stories are the equal of any by these more literary writers--and THE THIRTEEN PROBLEMS is very much Agatha Christie at her best. The individual stories are loosely tied together as something of a party game: after dinner each guest is required to present a mystery to which he or she knows the solution and the other guests must puzzle it out. The concept produces a chatty sort format that is both entertaining and perfectly suited to Agatha Christie's demure yet remarkably sharp Miss Marple--who disconcerts the others by inevitably solving the crime.In addition to Miss Marple, the storytellers include a number of always welcome re-occurring characters such as Mr. and Mrs. Bantry, Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West, and Sir Henry Clithering. Each of the stories is as memorable as anything Christie wrote in novel form, and although you can easily read any of the stories out of sequence the dinner party concept gives the collection a unified quality which nonetheless escapes the more demanding requirements of tackling a full-length novel.This is the ideal bedside book, for you need read no more than a single story--drop off to sleep--and then return again to the next story at your leisure. At the same time it will satisfy even the most hardcore Christie fans; every one is sure to have their own favorite tale (mine is \\"The Herb of Death\\") and serious Christie readers will enjoy spotting plot devices that Christie later elaborated into full-length novels. Very, very enjoyable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"This is by far one of my favorite works by Agatha Christie - a perfect example of the &quot;cozy&quot; mysteries where the detective would solve puzzlers from his/her armchair. The stories all get to show off Miss Marple at her best. The action begins when six people form a &quot;Tuesday Night Club&quot; aimed at solving various crimes that only they know the solution to. Miss Marple asks to join in and rather condescendingly, the other members allow her to participate. Each week, one member narrates a mystery which the others try to solve. Ironically, it is Miss Marple that unerringly leaps to the truth each time while the supposedly more worldly people fail! Her explanation is that having lived in a small village her whole life, she has developed a very good understanding of human nature and is able to see patterns in crimes that leads her to the truth. There is an air of gentle wisdom about Miss Marple that is a refreshing change from Christie's other detective Hercule Poirot who can be insufferably arrogant sometimes. The other nice thing is that while the stories start out as a game, other players soon develop such great respect for Miss Marple's mental abilities that they start coming to her for solutions to unsolved tragedies. Each story is a little gem, full of atmosphere with some pretty puzzling twists. If you like your mysteries more refined and your preferred means of death arsenic in the teacup instead of a gunshot wound to the head, this book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"These 13 stories actually form 2 groups; all but one are stories-within-a-story, in which one character reveals a mystery to which he or she knows the solution, and the others are allowed to ask questions and try to solve it. Since the characters' story-telling skills vary, this can be interesting. :) Only the last story, 'Death by Drowning', is a 'live' case. Joan Hickson recorded unabridged narration of all the stories, which are split up over 3 recordings:- \\"The Tuesday Club Murders and Other Stories\\" (TCM)- \\"The Blue Geranium and Other Stories\\" (BG)- \\"The Herb of Death and Other Stories\\" (HD)The first 6 stories cover one of Raymond West's extended visits to his aunt, Miss Marple, while Sir Henry Clithering is also in the neighbourhood. He, she, and four other guests on the first evening form the 'Tuesday Night Club' (1st story, told by Sir Henry), to see which of the various professions represented has the best chance of solving a mystery. Miss Marple, as hostess, is included as an afterthought - at first. :) One real mystery is why Raymond never quite realizes that he's plain wrong in underestimating his aunt. Given the short format, the characters aren't drawn out at length, but even so, we see signs of a romance progressing between Raymond and Joyce, and that they certainly aren't fooling Jane Marple.Dr. Pender, local clergyman, sets the 2nd puzzle, 'The Idol House of Astarte' - reader, beware that Christie, as a member of the Detection Club in good standing, never set puzzles requiring a supernatural solution. Raymond West, the writer, tells of a strange Cornish holiday in 'Ingots of Gold' - although he doesn't know the answer, Sir Henry does. Joyce Lampiere, the artist, visited Cornwall more professionally, to find herself painting 'The Bloodstained Pavement'. Miss Marple herself outwits everyone with 'The Thumb Mark of St. Peter'. If you're interested in unabridged recordings or more details about the individual stories, the first 5 appear on the TCM recording, the 6th in BG.In the 'The Blue Geranium', first installment of the second group of stories, Sir Henry Clithering, staying with Colonel and Mrs. Bantry, is asked to suggest a female 6th dinner guest for the evening. Remembering the Tuesday Club of the previous year, he suggests Jane Marple, and explains to Mrs. Bantry how he knows her. Mrs. Bantry suggests trying her on the Colonel's ghost story (\\"The Blue Geranium\\"), since they'd be thankful if she could solve *that*. Afterwards, each of the other attendees, tells a story, albeit each in a different style, beginning with Dr. Lloyd (The Companion) and Sir Henry (The Four Suspects). In 'Never Two Without Three, or, A Christmas Tragedy' (usually known as 'The Christmas Tragedy'), Sir Henry protests that the 3 downtrodden males have been doing all the work, and urges Miss Marple into the breach. Mrs. Bantry, warning everybody that she can't tell a story, turns 'The Herb of Death' into a cross-examination - she tells the very bare bones, but doesn't know how to go on without giving it away. Jane Helier, the ornamental but apparently empty-headed actress, goes last with 'The Affair at the Bungalow'. Again, if you're interested in details / unabridged recording, the first 4 of this group are on BG, while the last 2 and the final story are on the HD recording.The final story, \\"Death by Drowning\\", occurs later in Sir Henry's visit. Learning of a death in the village, Miss Marple not only suspects murder but has identified the killer, and she turns to Sir Henry to ensure that justice is done."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"This 1932 collection was also published as THE TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS. Many of the stories have also appeared separately in other collections.Like THE LABORS OF HERCULES and PARTNERS IN CRIME it is a series of short stories bridged together in an arc. The opening setting is a gathering in St. Mary Mead at Jane Marple's cottage, attended by her nephew writer Raymond West, artist Joyce Lempriere, Sir Henry Clithering - retired Scotlandyard commissioner, Dr. Pender - the local clergyman, and solicitor Mr. Petherick. The group decides to entertain themselves by describing puzzling crimes they have experienced and to challenge the rest of the group to arrive at the solution. The group at first does not plan to include Miss Marple in their game but condescend to do so when she objects. Naturally Aunt Jane arrives at all the answers.The following year Sir Henry Clithering was visiting his friends the Bantrys (THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY), and mentioned his previous trip to St. Mary Mead and Miss Marple. After dinner that evening another evening of curious problems took place. This time the group included Col. and Mrs. Bantry, Dr. Lloyd, actress Jane Helier as well as Sir Henry and Miss Marple. Again Miss Marple had all the answers, including one to a crime that hadn't happened yet.The final problem was presented sometime later when Sir Henry was again visiting his friends, the Bantrys. A village girl, the daughter of the local pub owner, had killed herself the night before, sad but of no particular interest to Sir Henry. No interest that is, until Miss Marple arrived to request that Sir Henry investigate the murder, not suicide, of the girl. She even gave Sir Henry the name of the murderer! Sir Henry agreed to look into matter and.....well, read the storyThe mysteries are all perfect little Christie gems, challenging the reader (with all the clues tucked in among the red herrings) to solve the crime before Miss Marple. The device of linking the stories in post dinner party conversation is charming. It is wonderful to meet characters that will return in other Miss Marple stories: Raymond West and Joyce Lempriere; Col. and Dolly Bantry; and Sir Henry Clithering."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"I'm one of thoes readers who have difficulty sticking with a long and sometimes drawn-out novel. In the busy life style of today it is hard to read a full novel for some people. If you are one of hese, like myself, this is the answer to your need.I find to read a full novel; I must put it down constantly to do other things. I am ashamed to admit that when I do there is an inodinate problem in picking up the threads of where I left off! By this you can tell I am not an avid reader and one who does not read in bed.Dame Agatha has solved this mystry for her readers by presenting these thirteen gems that allow the reader the ability to complete one at a time and at their speed and pace.Out of sufferance to her nephew, the members of the &quot;Tuesday Night Club&quot; agree to permit his elderly aunt, Miss Jane Marple to participate in their challenge to solve the mystery they individually present each week. Only the storyteller, of course knows the answer to their tail of murder, mayhem or just curious tail unsolved by others. It soon becomes clear that contrary to the club member's initial thoughts, this gentle Victorian lady, or is it Edwardian, has more on her mind than knitting. Following the recitation of the individual stories, the club members are astonished at first but soon are full of admiration, forsome with prhaps a little ranker, that the diminutive lady demonstrates shuch prowess in the knowledge of crime and criminals.As she recounts happenings in her little village of Saint Mary Mead regarding people that the club members do not know, nor are are they likely to want to know, she draws the parallels that assist in the solution of their cases. At first they approach her similarities between their story and those of Miss Marple's with distain. Once she demonstrates that her belief that all people are the same and that crime commiuted in her little English village and that perpertrated in the &quot;City&quot; are one and the same, her listeners begin to see that her little stories are not the fatuitous babblings of a senile senior citizen.The reader could be taken in as the club members were it not for their knowledge of this marvelous created character of the one and only Agatha Christie, the Queen of Mystery. I say this with the assuance that there are few in the civilized world that have not heard of Dame Agatha and the multitude of books and short stories penned by her over so many years.A must read for the Christie devotee and to be read again if not already done so."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"Originally published as \\"The Tuesday Club Murders\\", \\"The Thirteen Problems\\" is a collection of Miss Marple stories, mini-mysteries that readers and characters alike are meant to solve. As always, Agatha Christie has a great knack at crafting mysteries that are both ingenious and simple, once solved or explained. \\"The Thirteen Problems\\" is a quick read, each story nicely paced and readily solved.The setup to the collection is a get-together of friends and family for an evening of fun and games. When one guest proposes that each person present a 'problem' for the others to solve, the game is underway. When each little problem is presented, only Miss Marple can see her way through to the solution. These mysteries run the gamut of typical mystery stories, with murder and intrigue at the center of each.Yet several of the stories in \\"The Thirteen Problems\\" are extremely predictable - anyone who has read a fair number of mysteries can spot the answer from the getgo, although there are several that are a bit more puzzling. And at times, the characterization of several key players is stereotypical and rather one-dimensional, an acceptable failing in a short story, but when several stories are collected in one space, it can become rather tiresome. Overall, \\"The Thirteen Problems\\" is a delightful read for any Christie fan."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"In my mind, Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is as good as it gets in the mystery genre. Miss Marple, however, is excellent, too. This volume presents thirteen short mysteries. Most are presented as tales recounted by dinner guests while sitting around the evening fire. The challenge is to see who can tell the most baffling story and who, if anyone, can solve each one. Miss Marple, of course, astounds the others by seeing through each to the solution. Along the way, the reader is treated to a selection of fascinating and enjoyable tales. Some are easy enough for the experienced mystery fan to see through, but all are fun to read nevertheless. THE THIRTEEN PROBLEMS is Agatha Christie at the top of her game and should be a great pleasure for anyone who enjoys a good mystery. I loved it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"This is one of the best books.

Using village parallels and her unique outlook on life, Miss Marple solves a series of mysteries that have stumped more sophisticated guests at various dinner parties in St. Mary's Mead. I love Agatha Christie's novels, and this book is an old favorite that I pull off the shelf when I need a quick hit. If you've never read it, I highly recommend the Tuesday Club Murders."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Problems","review":"Except for the last story, the format for each story is the same: a small group of people entertain themselves, each time they meet, by having one of them tell a mystery and then the others try to solve it before hearing the solution. Unexpectedly, the elderly Miss Marple - better known for her knitting - manages to solve every one.1. Retired Scotland Yard Commissioner, Sir Henry, tells of three who sat down to sup: two became ill - the third died.2. An elderly parish clergyman tells of the death of a woman dressed as a Goddess.3. Miss Marple's nephew tells of a man who may have known too much about the missing gold.4. An artist tells of a scenic fishing village - perfect for painting and for murder.5. A lawyer tells of a rich man who - just before he dies - makes a new will, and now, the new will is missing.6. Miss Marple tells of the time when nearly everyone thought her niece Maple had murdered her husband.7. Col. Bantry tells of the mysterious death of Mrs. Pritchard; curiously, the flowers in her room predicted it.8. A doctor tells of the drowning of an English woman.9. Sir Henry tells a story of former Secret Service agent who had fallen down the stairs.10. Jane Marple tells of Mrs. Sanders being found face down; a sand-filled stocking lay nearby.11. Mrs. Bantry tells of a vivacious girl who dies after supping on a meal featuring duck.12. An actress tells a hazy story ... but it was clear to Miss Marple.13. Miss Marple hands Sir Henry a note with the unlikely name of the murderer; now he is got to prove it.Overall: the stories range from 3 to 5.

If they had not spent so much time repeating the same three things, this book would be only half as long as it is. The actual advice is sound but really you don't need to repeat it over and over (unless you're looking for word count)2. If you're trying to sell me a Cadillac, don't give me a Yugo after I've paid you.

This is good because this is what most people miss when they shave and go through out the day with a crappy feel to there face if not razor burns and cuts. if you are willing to take shaving serious and care for your face then I suggest reading this book. if you are looking for a fast way to get through a basic don't care shave, go to Walgreens.I have just started trying the Art of Shaving products buy purchasing there sample kit. this I say is worth it. you get a $25.00 coupon with it to use for your next purchase. yes it cost you $25.00 to purchase it but once again are you serious about a proper clean close shave.

For example it states why one should shave with the grain first (and not against) and also it explains what type of person should wear a goatee, and how, and also how to trim your sideburns (so as to make sure that they are even). He also recommends to use a facial scrub once or twice a week (on days you aren't shaving), etc. The author also throws in some history at the beginning (like how men used to sharpen flint or sharks teeth to shave). Anyways, it was a nice light and enjoyable read. I think I finished it in about 3 sittings. Some very useful information in a nice package. Only gave it 4 stars because the pictures could have been better/more helpful. Every other page or so has like a random picture of a brush. Why not put something more useful, like the proper blade angle that should be used on the face, or what a proper lather should look like."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"It would not have surprised me if this book was nothing more than a commercial for the products sold at The Art of Shaving shops. Indirectly, that's what it is, with all its emphasis on creams, lotions, gels, soaps, and balms--all sold as the mainstay of the namesake brick and mortar boutiques. Although none of these products are hawked in the book by specific brand. But what did surprise me is the way this book seems to be a commercial for Gillette Mach 3 razors. It's a surprise because the majority of those dedicated to the \\"art\\" of wet shaving generally eschew cartridge systems.I evaluate this book for its textual and photo content. In the early text about the history of barbers, we read \\"Fortunately, over the years, the two roles [of barber as groomsman and surgeon] have become separated, and barbering has become a serious and respected art.\\" (p. 16) What?! Surgery wasn't serious? The book is full of statements of this kind, so take all the text with a grain of salt.As another example of lax quality of content in this book, consider the large \\"Essential Oils Chart\\" on pp. 32-33. The table is riddled with dots to indicate some sort of relationship between 29 kinds of oil and 18 skin types (I'm not sure what \\"tired\\" skin is, or the difference between \\"dry\\" skin and \\"dehydrated.\\"). What the table fails to mention is what the relationships are. To take one data point, there is a dot at the intersection of lavender oil and dry skin. This could indicate that lavender oil causes dry skin, or it should be avoided if you have dry skin, or you should use it if you have dry skin. I think the last is the case, but nothing explicitly says that. The book dedicates two chapters (38 pages) to skin and lotions. And even the chapter on shaving technique is largely dedicated to the same, rather than to the act of shaving. Finally, there is a section titled \\"The Actual Shave,\\" but that is mostly again about lather; its smaller subsection on \\"Shaving Strokes\\" amounts to a couple hundred words.At 6\\" x 6\\", this really is just a miniature coffee-table book, which would be fine. If the text isn't to be taken seriously, at least we should enjoy the pictures. But here we are disappointed too. All the photos are in black and white. While black and white photography as an art form certainly has its place, this is not it. True color is needed to properly convey the subtle difference in the gleam of polished nickel, chrome, silver, or gold plate. Lotions and oils have distinct hues of their own. The tips of badger hairs should be shown as silver, compared to the brown shades of the rest of the hair. Even the slight colors of creams and lathers are lost in these photos. And if you were hoping to see many pictures of many different razors, don't get your hopes up. Almost all the razor pictures are of the same swivel-head Gillette, whether perched in a stand, or being dragged along a man's face. There are only three small partial photos of double-edge (DE) razors, and a handful of straights.The presentation of razors in the \\"Tools\\" chapter is oddly sequenced in reverse chronological order. Many sections in the book cover elements of shaving history in their historical sequence, highlighting the evolution of shaving, so it would have been much more organic to explain the development of shaving tools and their incremental improvements along the way. The only explanation for abandoning that style here is to sell cartridges. Of course it starts out with all the accolades of swivel-head razors, with plenty of hype for the Mach 3 and Sensor by name. Throughout the book these are the only recommended shaving implements, with all others positively denigrated.Fixed-head razors in general are described as \\"uncomfortable,\\" \\"difficult,\\" and \\"always lead to nicks or cuts\\" (pp. 62-63). DE safety razors are described as not safe \\"when compared to swivel-head cartridges\\" (p. 64), but adjustable DE razors offer \\"five blade positions\\". (Merkurs offer five, but vintage Gillettes offer nine positions.) Then a strange recommendation to \\"try to get blades made in Solingen, Germany.\\" While the Solingen shout-out might not be an open recommendation of a particular company, it certainly narrrows the field: It just so happens that Merkur is located in Solingen, and Merkur is the only brand of safety razor sold in The Art of Shaving shops. But in fact, you can get good blades made in Egypt, Israel, Japan, the UK, the USA, and many other places. Finally, on to straight razors, for which we're told to take lessons from a professional, and the honing of which should be done by a professional (pp. 66-67). It's a wonder anyone ever learned to shave himself in the several centuries when straights were the only option.To complete the sales pitch for swivel cartridges, the final chapter is on shaving injuries. Of the three injuries discussed, two are explicitly blamed on not using a swivel-head cartridge razor. Nicks and cuts: \\"the primary culprits are ... razors that don't swivel. [...] So use a razor that has a swiveling head.\\" (p.108) Razor burn: single blade razors tempt you to \\"shave over the same area more than once, unnecessarily removing a layer of skin each time.\\" (p. 104) Yet, most wet-shavers claim that multiple blades remove more skin than do multiple passes with a single blade. They experience less razor burn with a DE than with a cartridge. And the third injury (ingrown hairs) is commonly believed by wet-shavers to be caused or exacerbated by multiple blade cartridges that pull the hair and supposedly cut it below the skin. So two of the three injuries might very well be caused by cartridge razors, despite the claims in this book. And the third (nicks) is more a matter of technique and preparation than of the instrument.Despite the authors' claim that this book is the \\"result of seven years of professional shaving and skin-care expertise,\\" (p. 9) it would seem that the authors have never used a fixed-head razor of any kind.In conclusion, this small volume fails to deliver either convincing text or satisfying photography. It's interesting to pick up and peruse, and for that I give it two stars. But if it's successful at all, it's in selling Art of Shaving lotions, Merkur razors, and Gillette swivel-head razors; all coincidentally available at your neighborhood Art of Shaving store. This book should be handed out free at the store as a promotional brochure, not sold for $17 to people looking for unbiased and factual information.UPDATE: Recently both Gillette and The Art of Shaving chain of shops have been acquired by Proctor and Gamble. The circle is almost complete."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"I found some useful information in this book. However, most of the tips are display in a fairly well done video at the author's website. Just do a google search on \\"The Art of Shaving\\" and view the \\"Perfect Shave\\" video. You will see all of the tips acted out. Like shave after a shower, shave with the grain, use a preshave oil, how to dry afterwards, etc.The book itself is not bad, and a very quick read. The book is not a direct advertisement for the author's products. He actually rarely mentions them in the text. The book is useful no matter who you buy your supplies from."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"Shaving is something most of us men do anyway, so it makes sense to do what we can to change it from a chore (or a butchery) into an enjoyable or even luxurious experience. If you're trying to look professional for a day at work -- or attractive and manly for a night on the town -- why drag a 20-cent disposable blade across your face when there are more rewarding alternatives out there?As part of the fashion and grooming industries' efforts to get men to take as much time preparing themselves for the day as women stereotypically do, Myriam Zaoui and Eric Malka produced this book on shaving that -- wonders! -- happens to have the same name as the store they run and the line of products they sell in it. I have a copy of their store catalog here next to this book, and there is a good deal of overlap, no question. The sorts of products they say a good shave requires just so happen to be the sorts of products they sell. Whether this is a conspiracy to create a need where none exists or their attempt to be helpful and inspire men to share the authors' passion for the topic, depends I suppose on your degree of cynicism.To the extent this book is an infomercial for their shop, you're certainly welcome to keep the info- and disregard the -mercial. I wouldn't throw the razor out with the soapy water and say the book is useless because there's a mercenary element. Every author hopes you'll spend money on his book. You can still learn some useful theory and tips for your morning ritual without having to drop any cash in the authors' store.The essentials of how to get a good shave have been covered countless times, at article-length, in publications like \\"Esquire.\\" You don't really need an entire book on the history and techniques of shaving. The fact that one exists is harmless enough, and men interested in fashion, grooming, or just not going to work with blood on their collars may find it worth a few minutes' reading."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"This book covers a lot on technique, tools, and supplies. Some people might not care about the historical elements of shaving, but I found them interesting. A few elements might seem common sense, but not everyone was taught to shave properly. Some of the tips (like using pre-shave oil) were invaluable. It was nicely compiled and a quick, informative read. The \\"aromatherapy\\" seemes a bit like snake oil selling, but staying away from alcohols and petro-chemicals is good advice.Bottom line, I'm getting better shaves after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"This is a very short book that would be reasonably priced at $5 or below, but really not worth the price it sells for. It has a few useful things, but nearly all of them I'd already seen--free--on various web sites. It fails to go deeply into a few things that could use it, and excessively promotes one particular brand of razor that isn't anything great to begin with. Overall I'm disappointed with the book and would not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"I have been shaving for 40+ years and now realize that I did not know how to do it right! This book is terrific and tells you what you need to know. I'm now enjoying my morning shave as this book has made it into a real pleasure and a small luxury to start the day. Skin looks and feels better, shave is actually closer, and it is a relaxing moment in the day. Yes, there are some commercials for the authors' store, but if you don't like that just skip over those bits and go on the Internet to find alternate supplies (Casewll Massey has some great products too). Buy the BEST badger hair brush you can find and follow the rest of the authors' advice and you will start enjoying the ritual and how you look and feel afterward.

Seems to have been written by someone who A)Has never shaved; B)works for said Art Of Shaving retail store. This book has little to do with wetshaving and everything to do with selling AoS's extremely overpriced, sub-par crap. This thing doesn't deserve one star. It would make an acceptable shim for a short table leg, but that's as useful as this little pamphlet gets."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"This is a handy book for those of us in the man's world who have been shaving for some time with no real idea of how to do it, just our best guess. Some of it might be old hat to the experienced shaver, but some of it won't be, particularly the addition of lotions and a skin care regimen.This is a manual on how to shave, as well as how to care for your skin. We need to get past thinking of these as separate things. They are not. If you do one and not the other you have an inferior product. Take care of your skin prior to and during the shave and half the battle is won. In fact, with proper skin care and proper shaving technique and equipment you will actually look forward to shaving.My only complaint with this book is its adoption of the multi-razor cartridges of today. These expensive and inefficient heads are one of the banes of my existence. I have adopted the older safety razor for my use, which provides a far closer shave and for infinitely less money. Further exploration of this topic would have made the book better, in my opinion, and offered a realistic contrast to the status quo of today.Still, it is a minor quibble with a great little book."},{"Title":"The Art of Shaving","review":"Lots of helpful info for the beginner and cool history but didn't like how even if it wasn't said the pictures suggested a Gillette Mach 3 or fusion be used.

Mar&iacute;a was a remarkable woman, but she was nothing like Julie Andrews in the movie. Their escape was made by train to Italy and then by ship to travel to the USA where they were going to go on a concert tour. Hiking through the Alps to escape certainly would not make much sense for a woman who was at that time pregnant, with two very small children as well!

Did the Captain really use a whistle to summon his children? What happened to their enormous home in Austria?I loved the fiesty side of Maria that came through in her writing, and I chuckled as she relayed her struggles with learning English.Maria also discusses the places she lived and visited in Austria. If you ever get a chance to go to Salzburg, go, go, go! There's nothing like running through the gardens or spinning on the Alps.

I was also horrified at the harshness and reality of the Nazi occupation of Austria. Since then I have learned that although Hollywood produced this remarkable movie, it was not entirely factual. I live in Vermont where the VonTrapp family settled in Stowe after fleeing German Nazi occupied Austria. Maria VonTrapp was not pleased, to put it mildly, with Hollywood's version of their life story. This book is Maria Augusta Trapp's true life story as written and recorded by her. Included is the story of the VonTrapp family's singing career.

Maria Von Trapp also shares the role faith had in sustaining the family through some very difficult times. I recommend this to all who would enjoy a relaxing and positive book. The second half of the book does lag in spots, but the overall reading experience makes the book worthwhile and fun reading for ambitious upper elementary students through adults."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is an easy read. It is interesting and there are many entertaining parts. Inspiring, uplifting? Less so. One soon realizes that Maria is the &quot;Captain&quot; here. Such amibition, enthusiasm and hard work is admirable but it becomes a little tiresome when piously clothed in &quot;the will of God&quot;. Clearly all of this is the will of Maria. Read it for part of the &quot;real&quot; story. See the play and movie to see how great artists can make a story come alive and inspire us to better things."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I'm a huge fan of the movie \\"Sound of Music\\" and finally got around to reading the true story.Now please don't take my next comments badly. I love that she wrote this and was able to get it published. I am. But the writing style I found very distracting. There seemed to be a lot of jumping around and at times almost felt if it were being told by a young child, it was almost like reading a stream of consciousness. That may be just me.There were many places I wanted more detail, more information. For instance, I was hoping to learn - through her eyes - more about the how the Nazis came to power in Austria, that sort of thing. One thing she did touch on was the Nazi's deceitful intent in trying to convince the rest of the world that the Austrians were happy and celebrating the take over (holding people at gun point to ring church bells then playing the bells ringing over a radio broadcast for all to hear the \\"joy\\" in the streets). Makes one think about a group these days that are attempting to infiltrate under the guise of peace and innocence, claiming those who kill in their name are \\"radicals\\".This is definately worth reading, though. A truly amazing family with an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I, too, saw the A&amp;E Biography of the Von Trapp family, which revealed the &quot;real&quot; story. So, while reading Maria's book, I had to be somewhat skeptical when she characterized herself as a decent, noble, loving mother, always ready to do the will of God, (Well, she probably was, at least in part.) Despite this skepticism, I still enjoyed the book. Parts of it are quite humorous, and others are filled with richly detailed descriptions of Austrian folk life and thier celebrations of holidays. Some parts were even a little moving, too. It was nice to hear what really went on, even if Maria left certain things out conveiently. There's no reason why anyone shouldn't read this, especially if they're interested in the story behind The Sound of Music. Even if it isn't the complete true story, it's still throughly engaging. And it's got to be at least half-true, so, oh, well."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"You will enjoy this true story of the \\"Sound of Music\\" family.

But the cover is sign in on the false side. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is the story of the Trapp family as told from Maria's viewpoint. It would be interesting if we could read the honest appraisal of the children. For example, in the 1949 book, Maria tells about meeting the captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to what we saw in the movie. She even tells how the captain used a whistle to call the children.In 1972, however, she wrote a book called &quot;Maria,&quot; in which she states that the captain was not at home when she arrived, and that &quot;Baroness Matilda&quot; introduced her to the children.OK, which was it?I suspect there are deep divisions in this family (as there usually are in second-marriage situations), and so far, the children have been too polite (or too psychologically mixed up) to tell us the real truth. Evidence of the division is found in the fact that the movie does not use the children's names, and mixes up the order of their births (e.g. in real life, the oldest child was a boy, not a girl). Did the children refuse to grant the right to use their names?"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I had a copy of this book as a child and lost it so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.

In spite of her best efforts to adapt to the contemplative life of a sister, she developed health problems that a doctor attributed to the sudden and tremendous change from the active life she had left behind. So Mother Superior decided that the would-be postulant must go back to the world for a time - just on loan, as she put it - as live-in teacher to the invalid daughter of Baron Georg von Trapp. Maria quickly grew to love not only her pupil, but the widowed Baron's other six children. When God asked her to spend the rest of her life with him, as his second wife and stepmother to his brood, it was the last thing in the world she either expected or wanted. Yet it launched her on a long, rich, and intriguing life, one that this book chronicles (up to its 1949 publication, at least).I read this as a girl, and I loved Maria's story so much that I found I could almost quote whole passages decades later when I came across a copy and picked it up again. \\"The Sound of Music\\" is a wonderful musical and a fine film. But this, the story on which it was based, is so much better! The wealthy von Trapps lost first their fortune, and then their home and country, as the Nazis took over Europe. They learned to make their living doing what they did best together, by singing, and they had to do so in a foreign country.

After nine years ~ and continuing the tradition of watching the great classic musical every Thanksgiving ~ my husband is just enamored with the film... So much so that he would get online and research the actors and the movie...This book was a Christmas gift that satisfied so much curiosity for him in ways unforeseen upon purchasing... Within a month he finished the book (which is HUGE since he works 10 to 11 hour days).He loved reading the history of this family through Maria's eyes... As he told me, the movie only touches on a very small part of their lives...but the general premise is true...they're a singing family who really did have to skidaddle out of Austria right under the noses of the Nazi authorities...Here's one thing he told me that really stuck... The Von Trapp family didn't have much money when they got to the States (not going to spoil it so I won't state why). They didn't know where to settle for a little while when a friend had suggested building there...and the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont is their actual former house...the one they built!!

Like so many little girls, I fell in love the 1st time I saw the movie in the movie theater when I was a small girl. I'm 51 now & &#34;in my time&#34;, we didn't have dvd or video. You watched it at the theater & hoped they put it on tv. I watched it every chance I had & was so happy when it came out on vhs. It was a must-see for my kids to see also. I never knew about this book until I found it on Amazon. I never knew what happened to the family after they escaped & I had absolutely no idea they had such a long entertainment history in the US - and I was amazed that they even traveled so close to my childhood home in Arizona when I was young! I absolutely enjoyed reading every page of this book, learning their history, hearing their stories. Reading between the lines, it was obvious there were more to the stories than what was being said, that things were maybe 'bent' as someone else said. But the basic facts are the same. And if Maria was a tough woman, that's probably what saved them & I admire her & all of them even more. Reading the true story & having to grow up & realize my beloved movie was not actual fact in many ways was a bit disappointing. But in no way did reading the book detract from how much I still love the movie, which is what it was made to be after all - entertainment. In fact, I love it more, knowing more about their real lives. I think the book was more special, because my mother's grandfather was an educated man from Austria & he left his family behind when he came to the US as a young man. I've ehard stories about how he lost touch with his sisters during the war & never heard from them again. Reading this book gives me a better idea of what my ancestors must have gone through. And I love the book. Some people don't like it because of the way it's written. You have to realize the book was written by a woman who #1-was not trained as a writer, #2- grew up in an entirely different era & #3 who's main language was not English......so of course the writing style & use of language can be rough at times, but I think that makes it even better because it wasn't handed over to be re-written by a professional, so as to be more acceptable. I would recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in this family, or maybe even the history of that time."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book is a personal family history of the Trapp Family Singers. It begins with Maria's days in the convent, traces the migrations of the family during the War years, and finishes in their family home in Vermont.Ever since seeing The Sound of Music for the first time, I have always been curious about what happened next- -did the entire family manage to safely climb the Alps to freedom? How did they pay for their journey to the US? And what connection do they have to the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont? Maria Trapp answers all of these questions in this book. While the musical version of their life did convey many of the main episodes, the storyline of the musical compressed these episodes so that they seemed to happen one after the other: Maria leaves the convent, teaches the children how to sing, marries their father, and they flee the country at the outbreak of the war, all within 2 hours. Phew! Like the musical, this book also starts with Maria's last day in the convent, but more than a year passed before she and the Baron were married, in 1927. They were married some 12 years and had 2 additional children along the way before leaving Austria. Yes, as unknowns, the family did win a song festival, but that was in 1936, and by the time they fled Austria, they were already quite well-known and had toured Europe as a family singing group. Indeed, one additional reason for leaving the country when they did was that they had been invited to sing at Hitler's birthday.When driving past the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, I have always thought of it as a ritzy place, and assumed that the money to purchase it and develop it had come from the Baron's family fortune. In reading this book, I found that that was not the case at all. The Baron's fortune was lost before the family left Austria, and they arrived in the US on borrowed money. In their new American lives, they had to restart from the very bottom of the social ladder, digging themselves out of debt before they could even begin to think of buying new clothes or a home. For years they dressed in the same simple clothes they had arrived in, and they built their first house in Vermont from the foundation up with their bare hands. That is, the girls did, since the two boys had been drafted into the US army and were fighting in Europe at the time.This book relates all of these details and many more, with a considerable sprinkling of humor. Maria comes across as a determined optimist, a young girl barely out of her teens who arrived on the doorstep of a house filled with grief and dissension. Through her personal character and upbringing, she created a family with strong bonds to each other that was able to withstand remarriage, loss of fortune, becoming refugees, and establishing a home and a livelihood in a distant foreign land. The two elements that were her constant guidance and source of inspiration were her faith and the music. This book is peppered with remarks that ring true even today: \\"The family that sings together, plays together, prays together, and usually stays together.\\" \\"Our age has become so mechanical that this has also affected our recreation. People have gotten used to sitting down and watching a movie, a ball game, a television set. It may be good once in a while, but it certainly is not good all the time. Our own faculties, our imagination, our memory, the ability to do things with our mind and our hands- -they need to be exercised. If we become too passive, we get dissatisfied.\\" The Sound of Music is a great story, but the story presented in this book is much better."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is simply one the most uplifting books I have ever read! I adore the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but this book is even more amazing. The von Trapp family went from immense wealth to poverty in a very short time, but throughout their trials they never lost their faith that God would provide. I was also impressed that they were so easily able to recognize the evil around them (Hitler, etc.) for what it was. My favorite part of the book is when Georg gathers his family together and tells them, &quot;Children, we have a choice now: do we want to keep the material goods we still have. . .our friends, and all the things we are fond of?--then we shall have to give up the spiritual goods: our faith and honor. We can't have both any more.&quot; The family chooses to relinquish their wealth and retain their honor. This is the best example I know of a family that stuck together through thick and thin."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"My mother ran the gift shop at the Trapp Family summer camps in Stowe in the late '40s, and I spent my summers with her when I was three and four, the youngest child there. Agatha, the oldest daughter, appointed herself as my caretaker during those two summers, and I have many clear and wonderful memories of those times - Cor Unum, their home which later became the original Lodge, just completed; singing and dancing all day and evening, indoors and out; hiking Pico Peak singing; the family with their dirndls and braided crowns; and always, the figure of Maria, the Baroness, looming over all, larger than life, laughing and singing and leading the fun.That said, this book was one of my earliest attempts to read a &quot;big people's&quot; book. I loved it - still do! - and the way it captured the characters of the people I knew. But I also recall my mother telling me that while the Baroness was a wonderful raconteur, her book, like all memoirs, was somewhat skewed and biased. She was not the holy innocent who had no idea that the Captain was in love with her and who meekly married him only because it was the will of God. She was an immensely strong-willed woman who knew exactly what was going on and also knew that she was entirely ill-suited to contemplative convent life. Which isn't to say that her account is untrue; light that passes through a prism is still light, although bent, and her account, while similarly bent, is still fundamentally true. There is some truth in all she says, but some of the details have been fluffed up a bit.The family probably wouldn't have survived without her strength, will, and humor, and there is no doubt of her religiousity - she turned to charismatic Catholicism in her later years and was speaking in tongues. As is the case with all strong people, some people, including some in her family, had difficulties with her. And of course, the play and film bear very little resemblance to reality - the very fact that the family names weren't flossy enough for Hollywood tells you that the producers felt a need to tart up the story.But I've always loved this book, and will continue to recommend it - forget the movie!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Though our whole family loves the movie &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; the book -- as usual -- is much better! It includes so much more detail and personal and historical facts to add to the story. The movie covered only the first HALF of this book -- and the second half is the best part! I've often wished they would make a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; to show the wonderful &quot;rest of the story!&quot; This is a great &quot;READ-ALOUD&quot; book for families with even quite young children, an excellent &quot;historical read&quot; for older children, and fine entertainment and inspiration for young and old alike!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is my all time favorite book! I have watched the movie a million times since I was two years old, portrayed Maria von Trapp in the musical play and read this book. I find it extremely engaging and entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud while reading and at other times on the brink of tears. I think it is an uplifting, encouraging story! I reccomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The true, complete story of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is even richer and more riveting than the film. The book goes into much deeper historical detail about Hitler's persecution of believers in God. The book is an excellent primary source for teaching history. When teaching high school students about the Second World War, I always read my classes the sections in the book where Maria describes how the family's life in Austria was changed once the Nazis rose to power. I hope that the publishers will put this gem of a book back in print and back on the shelves of America's bookstores!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I read the 1949 edition of this book, and in doing so I got to share in Maria's heart, her mind, her faith, her family. I feel as if I know them all! Too bad the movie didn't come even close to being as real as this true story. I can't help but feel like America was fed a fluff story of little substance with &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and too bad everyone knows the stars but not the real Trapps! May the remaining original Trapps be blessed and honored, wherever they may be living out their years."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Aside from so many more details than a movie could ever give, this book has other small treasures hidden in it. My favorite part of this book is Maria's humorous relaying of her difficulties with learning a new language- English. Her misuses and others people's misunderstandings had me laughing out loud.Maria also gives details about their family traditions (how they celebrated birthdays and religious holidays, for example), many of which I hope to adopt for my family. Her faith and simple lifestyle inspire me. She has her priorities straight and knows what's really important in this life."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The book was a joy to read, one filled with hope, love, struggle and triumph through faith and hard work. The true value is in learning how different the Trapp family's life was from the Sound of Music and quite different indeed it was.I was unaware of just how musically gifted the family really was, how much of a struggle their early years in America were and just how deep their faith in God was throughout their lives.I would have given it 5 stars but the tale of the romance between the Captain and Maria and their escape from Austria were brief to non-existent . I would have liked to have heard more from Maria on those chapters of their life.On the plus side, her writing is from the heart, and filled with wonder on her part on the goodness of people wherever she went.The path of a family who succeeded by faith, hard work and personal responsibility was a real inspiration.Pick up this book, read their true story, and be inspired."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"...and while I have loved the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; since I first saw it when I was 16 years old (24 years ago), I must say the book is a better story. My 19 year old daughter read this aloud to us a while ago and my 2 younger children (ages 9 and 3) LOVED it and begged to have more than one chapter each night. I love WWII history and so I loved this book for that reason too. We found it very interesting to learn so much about what it was like to be Catholic. It seems this family loved each other very much, and their faith was amazing too. One time they had a need and the family took turns for many days to pray around the clock, each up and praying for an hour I think it was. You could tell they LOVED God very much, and depended on HIM for all things. And He never failed them. Their life was not without trials and heartache. I recommend this book highly as a family read-aloud. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The movie itself is one of my favorites. It was so nice to have a better insight (without the glamour of the movie) of how the family lived."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I read this for the first time in high school and really enjoyed it. I watched the movie again for the first time in probably 8 or 9 years and found myself frustrated because it ends with only part of the story told. The book is written by Maria herself, and goes much farther than them escaping Austria. The movie version is great, but I find myself gong back to the book to get all the fun details and the full story over and over."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Growing up in the 60's, one of my favorite movies was \\"The Sound of Music\\". I've always wanted to read the real story, and now I have. It is quite different from the movie, but I enjoyed thrilling over the adventures just the same. It is an amazing story of a family that had to endure many hardships and overcome many obstacles and still kept on singing. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how to live life for the Lord in spite of the turmoil going on in the world about you."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I've probably watched the movie 20 times but never actually read the real life version of the Von Trapps. This book was very interesting reading, if a bit heavy on the religious references. However, what I learned from this book that I did not know from the movie is that the family actually sang a lot of religious music and not the more folk/showtune music that Broadway/Hollywood made their story famous with. This was apparently a point of discord with the actual Trapp family themselves. Maria Von Trapp, however, was an excellent writer and her story engages. You get the sense that her ability to write a good story is an extension of her interesting, compelling, and strong personality. Several times during the book, I almost laughed out loud. I would have loved to have actually met her. The Austrian history that the book often includes, as a prelude to WWII, is also very interesting as an aside to the Von Trapp story. If you have any interest in this family, the movie, or the historial period, I think you'll enjoy this. It's a relatively easy, engaging read."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This is the original book that was written before \\"The Sound of Music\\" was ever thought of. It is written by Maria von Trapp herself and has the story of their lives before, during and after the period reflected in the film. The energised personality of the writer conmes through clearly, making one think about the difference one's outlook on life can bring to those around you. If you ever wondered what came before and after \\"The Sound of Music\\" this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I enjoyed every page of this book. It's inspiring, interesting and even funny! I was so glad I could buy more copies at amazon to give out as presents, they make an excellent gift!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I had borrowed this book from my local library after having read another book on the same topic by Agathe von Trapp that I purchased at Barnes & Noble with a gift card I received for my birthday. Decided that I wanted a copy of this book for my personal library as well, so ordered it from Amazon. It was excellent and meant a lot to me since I am not only a fan of The Sound of Music but have also visited Salzburg, Austria."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Lovely, inspiring, TRUE story filled with uplifting testimonies about a life lived in faith. I laughed and cried with this one. Then I turned around and recommended it to my entire family. I really enjoyed learning about the romance between Maria and the Captain. I enjoyed the chapter about the family's summer vacation while they were still in Austria. I also enjoyed hearing about their musical tours and how they developed into a successful singing group. Read it and pass it on! This is a great book to share."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"A really wonderful story.A bit disillusioning as the real story is a bit different to the movie,but still an amazing family with an inspiring tale to tell"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"When I received this book I began reading it immediately. I could not put it down until I had finished with it .Hope to visit their home this Aug. When I go to Maine for a month, to visit family."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Along with everyone else who has read this book, I loved \\"The Sound of Music\\" and knew that it was a glossed over account of their real life. I picked up this book, hoping that there would me some truth to it. While I am sure that the majority of the events DID happen, they way they are presented leaves much to be desired. I got the impression reading this book that there was yet a 3rd side to the story that is not presented here.This is the story of the family, as told by Maria. This is the book on which the movie is based. The book leads the reader to believe that everything was sunshine and roses and that whenever anything bad happened, God provided the opportunities. While I am not doubting Maria's faith, I also think that she worked her tail off to get some of the opportunites the family recieved.This book is very moving. Some of the antics of the little kids made me chuckle and the story of Georg's death brought tears to my eyes. I would be interested in finding out what happened later.....I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the movie."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The Trapp Family Singers is high on my list of all time favorite books. I first read it when I was a teenager and have read it probably 20 times since then. About 3 years ago I obtained a new copy, as my old one was totally worn out and I wanted to be able to read this again and again. It is an entertaining story, but more than that it is inspirational. Their faith is tremendous and each time I read it my own faith is strengthened. I love the humor in the book- it leaps out at you in unexpected ways. I related the story of the turtle to my children on the way to church the other day and my family howled with laughter! I am so glad that the book has been reprinted, as it was out of print for several years."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The &quot;Sound of Music&quot; is one of my favorite movies and I've seen it probably over 20 times. But Maria's book made me cry over their pains and their victories. It also reminded me of the saying, &quot;A Family that Prays Together, Stays Together.&quot; They did not only pray, they sang and sang and sang. This book should be in K-12 readings lists. I just turned 9 and I think families will benefit from this book especially with all the trouble around today."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book tells the real story of the Trapp Family Choir, as it started, and ended, the beginning(first couple pages) was slow but picked up speed rappedly, the further you got , the better it got.

When I started to read the first page, I was so cautivated by its contense, that I could hardly stop reading!!!! I also liked it, because I read it when I had already seen the movie and so I could see what was true and what was invented by the producers of the film.What I liked best in this absolutely interesting book is the way Maria starts learning Enlish in the ship American Farmer, because thats really an ingeniouse and funny way of learning a language.I also liked the part when they arrived in America and they saw that the american culture was very different from the european one. In this part it was very easy to understand how lost and confused they surely felt in the first days of being there. But also in this part of the book we can see how brave they were, because although they had a lot of problems, they had success in their lives in the american continent.The part in which I was almost moved to tears was the ending, because there you can see what friends are for and why you have to have some."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"What a wonderful book! I laughed and cried all the way through it. The story of the Trapp family, their adventures, their singing career and their camp were uplifting. And the constant trust in God and the way in which they lived out their Catholic faith were beautifully described. A story full of the joys and sorrows of real life."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Back in the spring of 1965, when the film \\"The Sound of Music\\" was breaking box office records, I was an almost eleven year old in the fifth grade whose teacher simply loved the play and film. The class listened to the Broadway original cast album starring Mary Martin, and learned to sing several of the songs in music class; she told the story of the film before any of us even had a chance to see it. So, being so indoctrinated to \\"The Sound of Music\\" I was excited to learn that my aunt actually knew the real Maria Von Trapp, and that she would be the guest of honor at a charity benefit my aunt was hosting. My mother took me with her, and I was thrilled both at the possibility of meeting my first celebrity, and the thought that I might get some extra credit from my teacher if I \\"interviewed\\" the real life Maria.The big moment arrived and my aunt brought over Maria Von Trapp to introduce her to us. At first glance I was let down, I had expected kind of an amalgamation of Mary Martin and Julie Andrews, this tall, strapping, robust, ruddy complexioned woman clad in an old world peasant style dress with a kerchief tied around iron gray hair looked nothing like either one of them. Also to my eleven-year-old eyes she was \\"really old\\", (she was in fact sixty years old, four years older than my current age!), and she spoke with a heavy Austrian accent. However, she had a beaming smile and twinkling blue eyes as she shook my hand heartily. I will always remember how remarkably attentive and charming Maria was to me, the schoolboy solemnly explaining that I could get extra credit in my school if I could interview her. With the passage of time I mercifully don't remember the questions I asked, fairly inane I'm sure, but she was delightful, patiently answering each one, never rushing me, or patronizing me. Before we parted she had signed a program for me, which is tucked somewhere in my old desk in my parent's home.I had read this book just before I had met her; we had it in our classroom library, naturally. Since then I have read it several times, obviously gaining a deeper appreciation than I did as a callow boy. However the charm of Maria's writing style is that it is simple enough to embrace readers from pre adolescent to adult, but also is an engrossing tale told by a natural storyteller that bridges an age gap. It's very readable, and I think holds the reader's interest from beginning to end, the first time I had reread it after meeting Maria, I felt as if she were chatting with me again recounting stories of her family and herself. Be sure you read the \\"The Chapter Before the First\\" which is really a forward or introduction, but has a engaging little anecdote that is pertinent to the book.For anyone that loved or has an interest in \\"The Sound of Music\\", this is a must, since you will get to know and have a better understanding of the real Trapp Family Singers, and admire them that much more. Also, although most of the basic facts of the film are true, the events portrayed are telescoped and run together, and dramatic license is taken. The timeline in fact from when Maria arrives at the Villa Trapp to the family's fleeing Austria from the Nazi horror is about twelve years, not the several months shown in the film. In that twelve year span, not only do the Captain and Maria marry, but they have two daughters of their own, in addition to the original seven children, lose their fortune, and begin their singing career and start to earn acclaim in Europe. The Captain himself is a kinder, gentler character than the initial frigid autocrat of play and film. Maria is pregnant with their third child when the family departs Austria in a much less dramatic fashion, but they did turn down three lucrative offers from the Nazis and were in peril if they remained in their homeland. Also, they did escape by the skin of their teeth, since the Nazis closed the borders the day after they left. Shortly before they decide to leave Maria recounts a chilling vignette where the Captain and she sit at an adjoining table next to Hitler and his storm troopers in a Munich restaurant and witness firsthand the appalling banality of absolute evil.Happier events are recounted; I especially loved her vivid, enchanting descriptions of the celebrations and customs of an Austrian Christmas and Easter, so different from what we're used to in America. It's disheartening to realize these lovely traditions from the 1920's and 1930's are most likely not widely practiced any more in this nuclear age, so much has been lost in man's march of \\"progress\\". Since my parents emigrated from Ireland in the 1940's, I could identify with the Trapps' immigrant experience as they struggled to assimilate and establish a home and some security in their adopted homeland. Some of the stories that she recounts about other immigrants in addition to her own family's wrestling with the attempt to learn English quickly will give you a good chuckle!The thread running through her memoirs is Maria's strong faith; trust in God's grace, and acceptance of His will, even if it may not seem to be ours at the time, the title of the review is a quote she uses that exemplifies this fact. After Maria's death in 1987, stories came out that she was not as \\"sweet\\" in real life, among other things she was supposed to have a hot, violent temper and be very headstrong and dominating towards her family. That well may be, but I don't think she comes across as a saccharine, shrinking violet in this book; she's a definite force of nature, and her strength and determination are quite apparent. They had to be, the Von Trapp family totaled twelve in all, plus their musical conductor Father Franz Wasner, they had to support themselves. In addition, I read later on that Maria lost her mother as an infant; her father abandoned her to harsh, uncaring relatives who physically abused her during her childhood. Under the circumstances it's amazing she turned out so well. While perhaps the whole story of the Trapp Family Singers is not presented, and this may be a whitewashed version, it is still an absorbing, uplifting biography penned by a remarkable woman.Though our paths never crossed again, I will always have a warm memory of our encounter so long ago. I did visit Salzburg, Austria as a young man and see Nonnberg Abbey where Maria had been a postulant, plus several other sites from the film. I also visited her grave while on vacation at the Trapp Lodge in Stowe, Vermont several years ago, and said a silent prayer for her, remembering her kindness to me. And yes, I did get extra credit from my delighted schoolteacher for my report back to the class and Maria's autograph!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, and I realize now that Maria Von Trapp wrote it in the style of an earlier time in which the main characters look unfailingly noble. While we can admire the family's stand against the Nazis, the details that have been left out, which were recently revealed by A&amp;E's &quot;Biography&quot; make them more human and realistic. For in reality, we learn that Maria was the stern, tempermental, dictatorial one and the Captain the more mild mannered one, and that it was against Maria whom the children had to fight for their independance when they wanted lives outside the singing group. The A&amp;E version also gives a more detailed account of Maria's harsh childhood, that she hadn't always been so religious and in fact had been an atheist at one point, her stepchildren's true feelings about accepting her into the family, and the way Maria took her husband for granted. Her account of their lives resulted in one of the world's greatest musicals, and is a clear monument to virtue in the world, but as part of a modern audience, I don't mind a touch more reality and humanness to such stories. Without it, they seem a little too lofty and untouchable."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"\\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\\" is the wonderful life story of the Trapp family singers. Maria details how she met and married the Baron Georg von Trapp; loved and cared for his children; and went on to have three children of her own. The first half of the book is set against the background of pre-World War II Austria, with charming details of holidays and the annual Salzburg music festival.Then the Baron loses his money; and the family uses their musical talents to earn a living. They become more and more successful, but when the Nazis invade Austria, the von Trapps must choose between material success (on the Nazis' terms) or freedom (and starting over) in America. Their choice proves to be an inspirational one.The second half of the book deals with the von Trapps's new life in America. There are many comical scenes of Maria's struggle to learn English. And they also face the problems of continuing their careers in America, as well as dealing with publicity, agents, etc. But their faith in God sees them through all difficulties.I really found this book inspiring. The von Trapps never gave up, even when they were tempted to, many times. They were --and are-- a strong family."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The Sound of Music is my favorite movie, so I HAD to track this book down and read it.I was not disappointed!Maria inspired me with her faith in God and his help through all the trials of life. She also had SO MANY MORE STORIES TO TELL THAT NEVER MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE. One example: I was interested to know that their mansion in Austria was made into a Nazi Headquarters after the family fled. Once, when Hitler was visiting, he overheard one of the German soldiers whistling a tune which happened to be of Russian origin. Hitler was so enraged that he ordered all the German guards present to be shot.This book is one of the best books that I have ever read.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"It was amazing comparing the book to the Sound of Music and to read what an amazing lives the Von Trapps lived"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Ever wonder about the real story and not the Hollywood one?

Sad when it ended. Wonderful story. Mrs. Trapp had a great take on life. Inspiring, and a fun read many times over the years."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I bought this book at the intermission of the Sound of Music musical I recently attended. I was curious how closely the musical followed the true story. The book quickly covers the material in the musical then focuses primarily on the family's adjustment to America. It covers the years of their touring and their eventual settling in Stowe, VT.The musical, of course, takes some artistic license with the story, in order to heighten the drama and tension. For example, the father isn't really so cold towards the children in real life (but he does use a whistle to call them!). The children's names in the story are different too. The escape from Austria does not involve scaling mountains. Unfortunately, the book barely covers this part at all - in fact, it is covered in a few sentences told in flash back during a family meal on the boat to America. I don't understand why it was written this way when other parts of the story were covered in such detail.The book was very much from Maria's point of view (of course, she wrote it!), and I did not get a strong sense of the personalities of the other family members. Another difference from the musical - Maria and Georg have 3 children of their own for a grand total of 10 children! Maria portrays herself very positively - she is cheerful, pious, optimistic, and indefatigable. She does not cover her past much at all. The book pretty much starts where the musical does.The book, at its core, is an immigrant story. The family was a bit atypical in that Maria and Georg had been rich in Austria (in fact, a Baroness and Baron), and the family was a professional singing group. However, much of the story is similar to other immigrants - the struggles with language, cultural differences, and a lack of money. It is fun to read of their introduction and adjustment to New York City.The Trapp family worked very hard to make it as a singing group - they were by no means an overnight success. The element that was holding them back was a lack of stage presence. Finally, one night a fly flew down Maria's throat during a performance and when she mentioned it to the audience, they burst out laughing and the ice was broken. It was not an easy life traveling with so many children (and so much luggage!). I felt exhausted just reading about all their tours and travels through the U.S. The book covers how they finally settled in Stowe, VT on a farm where they had to build a house almost from scratch. They also established a summer music camp there which was very successful. I enjoyed reading this part because I have been to Stowe and even to the Trapp Lodge.All in all, it was an entertaining story. I got a very positive portrayal of a strong, hardworking family full of love for each other. The family was enterprising with an admirable \\"can-do\\" spirit - a real American success story. One of the daughters wrote a book as well, which I hope to read."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"I just returned from Salzburg, Austria and had to download her book. I previously read &#34;Maria&#34;, and bought a book about the family while I was in Salzburg, but it was not written by her. What a difference! What a remarkable family.

This family had to defy remarkable odds just to get to the USA and even more odds to stay here and earn a living.

This enlarges on an already awesome experience. Graham Stephens, M.D."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The book's always better than the movie, right? Well, in this case I'd say they're both pretty close. This is the true story of Maria Von Trapp - how she met her captain and how the Trapp Family Singers became world famous. Maria is a feisty character. You can see why the beginning of this book became a stage play and the greatest musical of all time. You'll see the differences in the true story versus the movie. You'll wonder why some of the best parts were left out of the movie. You'll laugh out loud and you'll enjoy Maria's singular writing style. If you love \\"The Sound of Music\\", you must read this book!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"When I started this book I expected to discover that the film is very different from the reality of the Trapp family. I was surprised to find that much of the film is accurate. Notable changes/omissions in the film are the children's names, the date of Georg and Maria's marriage, dealings with Hitler and the Nazis, the family's devout religious practices, and the \\"escape\\" from Austria. Much of the book deals with the Trapp family's struggles and triumphs in America. In its Biography of the family, A & E tv implies that Maria paints a rosy picture in this book and glosses over some of the darker chapters in the family's life. I did not find that to be the case. I feel that Maria tells her story, warts and all. You will love learning about Georg's first wife, the true story of leaving Austria, Maria's effort at grasping English, the fascinating religious rituals, and the recurring reality of how music truly saved their lives."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"The Sound of Music is my favourite film I have seen it at least 25 times. But when I read the real story I liked it more. I think Maria was a great woman who kept the family together with her love. It was the most important thing for her. When I am sad and fed up with all the things around me I always read the book /of course only parts of it/ and after reading I always feel better. It is One Of My Favourite Things! I would recommend to everybody to read it. It is about love and history."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"In the late 1960s, when I was maybe 9 years old, my mother let me ditch school to attend a lecture by Maria von Trapp. I'm guessing that the author was promoting a newer edition of her book at the time. She struck me as an opinionated, very strong personality, but one who had twinkling eyes and who encouraged me to continue my piano lessons. The baroness autographed my EZ-Play &quot;Sound of Music&quot; piano book, but sternly made sure that I realized that the movie was not REALLY what her life was about--that it was just Hollywood stuff. When I grew up and became a music teacher myself for 15 years, I wish I'd remembered this book, because I would have recommended it to every student of mine. I just found this copy in an antique shop, but THIS one won't be recycled or resold!What comes through on every page is the dedication to a will and purpose higher than any human's will. This was not meant to be a &quot;religious&quot; book, but a history of a family who made a huge difference in the world by their faithful service to God. Being willing to work hard, submit their discomfort or inconvenience to God's will and have Him turn it into great blessings and lessons for the family and indeed the world, are truly building blocks of faith, hope, love, and encouragement.In addition, the stories of the family's dedication to their profession and the pursuit of excellence are inspiring. To attain such stature and not have one's nose in the clouds is an accomplishment in itself! (Ever meet a music scholar or highly-educated performer? The humble ones are few and far between.)I agree with the other reviewers that Maria probably was the Captain of the family, but look what happened to a country peasant girl who was truly noble, not just assigned the title!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This book was truly an inspiration to read, seeing the hardships the Von Trapps went through after leaving Austria. It reminds us all of what our priorities in life should be. Knowing that this was a true story and not fiction made it all the more inspiring, that a family could go through such hardships and still survive without being bitter."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Okay, \\"War and Peace\\" it ain't, but what it is is a charming rendering of the Trapp Family history. Told in an almost childlike voice, it was refreshing to learn about this amazing woman and her struggles to keep her family afloat during a turbulent time in the world. After hearing so much about Paris Hilton and Tori Spelling these days it was refreshing to come back to reality and see how insipid today's youth can be. Maria was a strong woman who didn't flinch in the face of adversity. I enjoyed hearing about her faith, as well, being a rather lax Catholic, my interest in my own faith has been inspired by reading her book. I enjoyed her exuberance over the simplest things and it made me appreciate everything I have. I would recommend this book to everyone...young, old, religious, atheists, etc. There is something to learn from Maria von Trapp and this delightful book now goes on my short list of \\"All Time Favorites\\". Read this book and share it with someone you love, or better yet, share it with someone you hate."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"This adventure is full of human laughter, tradition, and inspiration. The true story greatly surpasses &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in humor, candor, and joy. You also get the rest of the story: after they flee Nazi Austria, they come to the United States to share their traditions and song, and it would inspire anyone to read how they survive through financial struggles, tour the nation singing, set up a humanitarian organization to aid severely depressed Europe at the end of WWII, and start music camps in Vermont. This is one of my three favorite books"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"One of the best books written of all time.

Please rate my review!"},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Our whole family --six of us, including three teenage boys-- enjoyed this story and have read it several times. And the reason I bought this copy is because we loaned our other one away, and it never came back, and we just had to have it in our home library.We appreciated the author's descriptions of the many celebrations and festivals in their family life that were so closely tied to their devout Catholicism. Being Protestant, we knew little and understood less about the benefits of \\"hand-on\\" reminders and \\"helps\\" to our worship. The knowledge has expanded our thinking.Plus the story is just that --a great story."},{"Title":"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers","review":"Seeing as how this book came out in 1949 and the musical didn't come out until 1959, Maria Augusta Trapp is the one that gave the world the story of \\"The Sound of Music\\". If as other reviewers have pointed out that this was a book not all together truthful, I ask \\"Who Cares?\\"So, maybe we can't believe everything in this book, but why does it matter? The book is a great read. Maria Trapp gave us some of herself in this book. It was a great way to spend the weekend.Besides, the observations about the modern world she made in 1949 are just as meaningful now. I say, take knowing the truth with a grain of salt. I guess if you are historical purist, this book isn't for you. If you want a great read, then this is your book."},{"Title":"The Oxford Treasury of World Stories","review":"I'm a huge fan of Oxford publishing and was looking forward to reading this with my six year old. The first two stories we read were familiar, from Sweden \\"The Tomten and the Fox\\" and from Japan \\"Momotaro the Peach Boy.\\" Both were excellent adaptations. However, he asked to read the story from Egypt, which was violent and about a thief that not only is forced to behead his brother, then sneak back later and retrieve the body for his mother, he goes on steals a corpse's arm to trick the Pharaoh, but gets rewarded for it and becomes a rich bureaucrat. While I think it's noble to not change a story from another culture because it's violent, why include it at all? Surely Egypt has less violent tales?The next story we read was from Australia. This time it was about a bank robber who fooled the cops and didn't recant and also got away with his crime, and his buddies burned alive. What the heck?? Not appropriate or fun to read with your child. I am completely dumbfounded regarding some of these choices.... Even if I somehow misinterpreted this story, there is no way it could be argued as appropriate to read to a little kid. There wasn't any positive message at all."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"John Adams' legacy has not been taught to the extent it should have been and seems downplayed in every other souce I've read to date. This book is a great depiction of the sheer sacrifice of him and his family at the time. this book tells how Adams was far more involved as (1) of our founding fathers than he was ever given credit. As to his analyzing his own faults, this quality proves to be endearing &amp; proves his great character and integrity and love/pride of this great country. Great read !!!!!!"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I really enjoyed this book, especially the personal revealations of a founding father that is too often overlooked. Ellis brings to life the man, much like he did in American Sphinx, and shed new light on a President that often gets a bum wrap from historians. I highly recommend this book and others by Ellis"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis' book portrays Adams in the most flattering light, viewing the second president largely through the charming, if self-serving, forum of his extensive correspondence. This portrait of Adams, as friend, father, husband and intellectual gadfly, is largely sympathetic. Ellis acknowledges, but glosses over, Adams' numerous failings as president (he was a combustible, querulous, ineffectual and frequently AWOL chief executive, with a haughty view of his office, and a poor regard for civil liberties). Ellis' prose is clear and concise, and the book is of quite manageable size, unlike some of the bloated tomes that have been written on Adams. However, it suffers from a disjointed and episodic construction."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I found this to be a rambling expose' of Adams' character, though filled with interesting information about Adams' thinking, his relationships with Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and wife Abigail. It was like navigating a maze. Each time I thought we were on to the next subject, I'd find myself at an impasse. I would have to retrace my steps back through the chapter to find out when Ellis had last discussed the current topic and re-read that page. I could then continue on, re-reading the same material, and hoping that this would lead me to a better understanding of the information further along in the current or following chapters. Presumably, one has to have a thorough knowledge of the dates and events of the American Revolution before reading Ellis' book because he does not provide much background about the events in which Adams was involved. I would suggest reading Ellis' book, &quot;Founding Brothers&quot; or William H. Hallahan's, &quot;The Day the American Revolultion Began&quot;, before tackling &quot;The Passionate Sage&quot;."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis does what he does best once again. Physchoanalyze a historical great, but fortunately no man needs more proding than old man Adams. Ellis simply tries to tell us who Adams was. This book in not by any means a narrative of his life, yet it sheds an incredible amount of light on his life's actions. Now we know how he thought. Adams was an original. No other member of the Founding Fathers had the sagaciosness of the Passionate Sage."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Excellent book. Upfront, I would have wanted to see more on his presidency, and more background on his wife, but that certainly is a minor complaint. Ellis has a great way of making history come alive, and does a good job of searching and presenting his &quot;sauciness&quot; in the favorable light that he deserves."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Currenty, there are many fine books, McCullough's Adams, Founding Brothers, Nagel's book on JQA, etc. Too much to read so I opt for the audio version (unabridged of course) of Passionate Sage to listen to when I can't read or the eyes give out."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Here we have a fugue on what a contrary figuer John Adams was. It is not a chronological narrative of his life--those who may want that must look elsewhere. It is a survey of his ideas beginning, often returning (too often), at his packing to leave Washington after losing his bid for a second term. The ideas explored are not systematically arranged, nor are they looked into with much depth. It tells us how much Adams just did not get along with folks, again, and again-- I can't recommend this book, especially to those of us that like a good biographic narrative, nor to those who like extensive and linearly arranged expositions of a famous thinkers thought. I must say how surprised I am at the high ratings given by many reviewers."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"The book seemed OK , until I discovered that Mr. Ellis had invented his experience as a Vietnam Vet . If somebody does this, what's the value of the book?"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"John Adams, following his death in 1826, has been essentially a non-entity in the eyes of the general American public. While nearly any school child can tell you about George Washington and his cherry tree, and any middle-schooler can tell you about Jefferson and his contention in the Declaration of Independence that ALL men are created equal, Adams remains obscure. In fact most Americans know him as the Founder who by some \\"twist of cosmic fate\\" died on the same day as Thomas Jefferson, exactly fifty years following the Declaration of Independence. Beyond that however, if they know anything, it was that he was a wild and eccentric man, prone to irrational behavior. In writing and language that is equally accessible to the historian and the casual reader, Joseph Ellis reexamines the life of Adams primarily after his retirement to his family home in Quincy, Massachusetts. In doing so, Ellis brings a fresh perspective in understanding the legacy of one of the most misunderstood men of American history; a perspective that can help reform not only the historian's view, but the public's perception as well. Ellis dedicates merely the first chapter to the years that preceded Adams's retirement to Quincy. It is the essential background that one needs to know and understand in order to realize the full extent of the torment and bitterness experienced by Adams in the early years of retirement. During his years as President he suffered bitter attacks from both the High Federalists and the Jeffersonians for his attempts to \\"carve out a centrist political position from which he might better implement policies that served the long-term national interest\\" (Ellis 30). Unfortunately, most of his career as President was characterized by criticisms, just and unjust, of his temperament. It was these attacks, in particular Hamilton's Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq. President of the United State, in addition to what Ellis deems to be \\"an intense mixture of political commitment, palpable ambition, and painful insecurity\\" (Ellis 38) that lead to his bitterness following his failed bid for reelection. In truth, the bitterness following his retirement is what Ellis uses to demonstrate Adams growth through the years, from the impetuousness of character the blighted his political career, to the sagacity of over twenty years of self-analysis and retrospect. During the initial years of his retirement Adams spent time attacking those he felt had done him injury or had treated him unjustly. Through his friendship with Benjamin Rush, Adams was able to reestablish a relationship with Thomas Jefferson, the man who had beat him during his reelection bid. This is the starting point for the rest of what Ellis wants to communicate. He uses the Jefferson-Adams correspondence to establish many of the points he wants to communicate about Adams, and his unique view of the world. Ellis characterizes Adams as, \\"the supreme political realist of the revolutionary generation\\" (Ellis 173). He was a man who, amidst unbridled optimism and hope for the future, was willing to point out the potential pitfalls of society. Ellis states, \\"Even without the benefit of hindsight, Adams had warned Jefferson that individual freedom and social equality were incompatible ideas, that ignoring the conflict only assured the triumph of the privileged, as in fact happened\\" (Ellis 221). The brilliance of Adams was his ability to understand the problems facing fledgling America. According to Ellis his initiatives in foreign policy set the tone for America for the next hundred years (Ellis 42). He saw the precarious situation of the young country, predicted the coming of the War of 1812, the necessity of a strong navy, and a conflict over slavery that would tear the nation asunder. Adams's legacy was denied for many years simply because of its pessimistic nature was a stark contrast to the unbridled idealism of Jefferson and other Founding Fathers. Ellis demonstrates to the historian and the casual reader the greatness of a man who's contribution to American history is more often than not summed up in a few sentences, or one small paragraph. He takes a long look Adams, his beliefs, and his temperament, and elevates it, warts and all, to a level on which he can finally be understood. Ellis is establishing the posterity that has so long been denied to perhaps the greatest mind of the Revolutionary period."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Of all the Founding Fathers, Adams is perhaps the least respected. Washington and Jefferson are safely memorialized on Mount Rushmore and Franklin is regarded by all as the quintessential American. Yet even a cursory reading of a history of the founding of America shows time and again of the importance of Adams. Very early in the debates regarding the future of the colonies, Adams knew reconciliation would be impossible. He worked on over 30 committees of the Continental Congress, was a foreign minister to France and then later served as our second president. Yet popular history has not served him well, something Adams was quite aware of even in his own lifetime.Author Ellis does an admirable job of portaying Adams as probably the most human of the Founding Fathers. Unable to control his temper or hide his true feelings, Adams always seemed to do the right thing yet in such a way that he received no credit for his actions. Ellis points out how Adams seemed to divine the future better than his contemporaries but his personality was such that few could admit he was right.The book is not a biography but a thought provoking character study. The only quibble I have with the book is that the relationship between Adams and his nemesis, Alexander Hamilton is never fully developed. Adams only truly despised one person and even after the death of Hamilton was unable to write about him in any kind of conciliatory manner. I wished this relationship would have been explored further. Otherwise, I gained a great deal of respect for Adams and even began to like him. It is easy to identify with Adams, a work horse who said what he thought, no matter how unpopular. Studies like this will hopefully resurrect his reputation and restore him to his proper place in the history of the United States."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"The felicitously written book has done a great deal to raise John Adams' reputation among the general public. Ellis concentrates on Adams' retirement years with chapters on his political writings, his correspondence with Jefferson, his other friendships, and his family life. While Ellis' goal is to explore Adams' character, this book necessarily covers Adams' remarkable achievements and explains clearly Adams' contributions as a political thinker. Adams was a complex figure; warm-hearted, sometimes vituperative, an unsystematic thinker and writer and thinker with remarkable insights. Adams refusal to accept the somewhat facile conventions of Jeffersonian liberalism made him an anachronism but his skepticism about American exceptionalism proved prescient. Adams was also remarkably accurate in major policy decisions. Over and over again, he made the right choice, even when his choices were unpopular. His pursuit of neutrality during his Presidency, for example, left him politically isolated but was undoubtedly the correct policy. As Ellis points out, Adams' reputation among scholars has risen steadily over the last fifty years. Today, he stands second only to Washington in the Pantheon of the Founders. Ellis's book and the just published biography by David McCullough are boosting awareness of Adams' achievements among the general public. An interesting corollary of this phenomenon is a corresponding fall in the reputation of Adams' political rival, intellectual antagonist, and friend; Thomas Jefferson. To scholars, Jefferson's achievements seem less than they did a generation ago. Pauline Maier summarized this clearly when she described Jefferson not as the author of the Declaration of Independence but rather as its draftsman; emphasizing the collective production of that great document. In the aftermath of the Civil Rights and Womens Movements, a man like Adams, who was able to treat intelligent women with relative equality, is more attractive than a probable sexual exploiter of his slaves like Jefferson. True to his Puritan heritage, Adams felt that reputation and adulation were snares and fatal to true virtue. His conduct towards his contemporaries tended to degrade his reputation. It is clear also that Adams hoped, perhaps expected, that posterity would rate him highly. As with other predictions, Adams appears correct."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I searched this book out after first reading Professor Ellis's outstanding character analysis of Thomas Jefferson in &quot;American Sphinx&quot;. &quot;Passionate Sage&quot; was written before the Jefferson book (which won a National Book Award) and, as a critical analysis of John Adam's character , should be regarded as a companion piece to American Sphinx. The two books tell a similar story, but from the very different perspectives of Jefferson and Adams. With a fluent, gripping and readable style uncommon among professional historians, Professor Ellis makes a compelling case that the eccentric and volatile Adams is seriously underappreciated both for his towering contributions to this nation and for his unconventional yet oddly endearing personality. Anyone who likes American history should not miss this book."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Joseph Ellis has taken upon himself the task of bringing the relatively unknown 2nd President of the United States out of obscurity and making him relevant to today's industrial America. Surprisingly, Ellis finds a way to make this shadowy figure between Washington and Jefferson every bit as memorable and important as his predecessor and successor; no simple task, given that Adams was forcibly shoved from the pantheon of American heroes over a century ago.Passionate Sage reveals Adams as he would have liked: Contrarian in every respect, an irritating mixture of sanguine and volcanic, pessimistic and hopeful, witty and reserved. More importantly, though, Ellis reveals Adams for the master of political thought that he was. No longer is Adams a footnote between the Great Leader and the Republican - in this slim tome, Ellis finds a way to enlighten readers to Adams' unparalleled contributions to Constitutional and American history. As history has shown, few men did more for the American cause than the underappreciated John Adams, and even fewer living Americans are aware of the monumental accomplishments the Sage of Quincy achieved in his nearly nine decades in America.Though Passionate Sage falls victim to the dry definitions of a professional academic, these drudging pages do not occur with great frequency. However, the slim size of this volume does seem cluttered with pedantic and tangential discussions that distract from the subject himself - ironically, the same slight Adams suffered in his own time."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Despite some controversy regarding Ellis's plagiarism from other sources for this book, I love it. I feel the the much more popular McCullough view of Adams is also excellent but would encourage people to t read this book because for me it presented the mind of John Adams much more clearly. I prefer it, despite the protests of my friends and colleagues who do not see what I see in this book, a gem."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis' fine work demonstrates that, unlike Jefferson, John Adams' vision of government still has much to teach us today. While Adams was blessed with a long and productive life, the author's focus on his retirement years deprives us of some insights and perspective on Adams' presidency and his days as an ambivalent leader of the revolutionary movement.I would recommend this book highly; however, if you are only going to read one book on Adams, read John Ferlings' biography, which is broader in scope and just as well written."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Of all the Founders, John Adams is simultaneously one of the most enjoyable and the crankiest. He liked virtually nothing that was taking place in the political scene of his day, and he would certainly have disapproved of nearly everything taking place today. For instance, though he is considered a conservative, he would rail and rant against those on the Religious Right who want to claim that God especially favors the United States (he felt the notion of any Divine Favor on the US was an utter delusion). He would be outraged by the increased role that the economic elite play in today's political process, while at the same time rushing forth to point out that he had predicted its inevitability. He would further be outraged that the president, the part of the government he placed what little hope he had for a more democratic form of government, was not only refusing to fight the economic elite, but fighting for an expansion of its privileges. On the other hand, Adams might take some solace in the end of slavery. But on the whole, he would point out all the ways that the selfish passions of human beings had intruded into American political life.Joseph Ellis, who is the finest popular historian of the Founding Generation currently at work, wrote this exceptional character sketch of John Adams several years before his similar sketch of Jefferson, his group portrait FOUNDING BROTHERS, or his excellent biography of Washington, HIS EXCELLANCY. If one has read FOUNDING BROTHERS, one knows that Adams is possibly Ellis's favorite of the founders. All of the other major Founders remind us more of statues, he points out, than real live flesh and blood human beings. One never makes that mistake with Adams. He is all flesh and blood and more than a little vitriol. Though arguably the most intellectual of the Founders (though Franklin was a practical genius, he wasn't nearly as literate as Adams; in fact, Adams's closest competitor, as in so many things, is Jefferson), he was a man of intense and always expressed passion. He could summon his formidable powers of reason, but only in a cause that inflamed his emotions.Ellis does a great job for the most part of exploring Adams's fascinating character. He is guilty, in my opinion, of minimizing Adams quirks. For instance, Adams was incredibly grudging in any praise of Benjamin Franklin, veing one of the very few people of his age not impressed by the Sage of Philadelphia. Ellis hints at this, but doesn't dweel on it, but the almost pathological need that Adams possessed to denigrate Franklin and others is a major clue to his personality. Ellis dwells more on Adams need to elevate his contribution to the Revolution, or at least to make sure that his very real contributions were not forgotten or underestimated, as they most assuredly have been for most of the past two hundred years.Ellis also does a good job of showing Adams's importance as a political thinker (though I would recommend even more highly John Patrick Diggins's short biography of Adams in this regard--Ellis is more of an historian, while Diggins is a political theorist, and is stronger in this regard). Adams is one of the great political critics in American history, though it is not often appeciated that he was, as so many other political thinkers are (one thinks of Marx or Nietzsche in this regard) better on attack than in contructing. Adams offers a host of trenchant and accurate analyses of the underlying dangers to democracy or any form of government, but despite his wealth of insight offers virtually nothing tempting in the place of what he criticizes. He was brilliant at seeing how things shouldn't be, but a bit vague on how things ought to be. Ellis mentioned but doesn't make graphic just how awful Adams is as a writer. I own and have struggled to read the collection THE POLITICAL WRITINGS OF JOHN ADAMS, edited by George W. Carey. Though I have read Hegel and Spinoza and Heidegger, I found much of this much, much harder going. Adams is frequently a terrifically uninteresting writer. He can lace monumentally dull and impenetrable material with passages laced with terrific insight. All this changes, however, when you turn to the Jefferson-Adams correspondence. Here he comes alive. Ellis does a good job of bringing this out.Ellis makes the mistake, as so many do, of characterizing Adams as a conservative. Given the fact that he would detest virtually every aspect of conservatism today I find this characterization to be incomprehensible. I think he was a conservative by accident. Had the predominant trend of the day been conservative rather than Jeffersonian, I think we would have seen an impassioned Adams rising against what he perceived as the many mistakes of the conservative cause. I honestly don't believe that any government, conservative or liberal, radical or revolutionary, would have contented Adams. I've seen Thoreau characterized as a coyote, too wild for civilized life, destined to howl on the edges of society. I think that fits Adams as well.I thoroughly recommend this biographical sketch (for it is not a true biography) by Ellis, though I would hasten to add that I perhaps like Diggins even briefer book a bit more. Though Adams was neglected for most of the period since his death, these days he has regained much of his deserved stature. Anyone not familiar with him needs to be. Next to Franklin he is probably the most likable of the Founders, and none of them anticipated the dangers facing our republic better than he."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis again does an excellent job of making public figures who are seemingly lost to history real again. While not as flowery and readable as McCullough's work, I believe Ellis' effort to be more substantive. Following only Adams' post-presidency years, Ellis explores Adams' core political principles and beliefs through the struggles and battles of his sunset years.Through Adams' fight with long-time friend Mercy Otis Warren over his legacy, to his arguments with Mary Wollstonecraft in the margins of her own books, Ellis is able to show an aging John Adams at his best (or worst): outspoken, irreverent, fiesty, and more often than not, correct. The reader is led through Adams' opinions on government, law, the French Revolution, and more. The curious reader would do well to compare Adams' and Jefferson's opinions of the French revolutionaries, keeping \\"track of score.\\"I only wish that Ellis could have written more. This book, while dry at times, will hold the reader's attention and leave them wanting more chapters.Recommended to the general reader who has already read through a full-length Adams biography."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Written with wit, charm, and a keen eye for historical detail, this book restores John Adams to his rightful place as one of our most intelligent, prescient forefathers. Dealing primarily with his post-presidential life, the author creates a fascinating image of an aging, yet mentally sound patriarch attempting to rehabilitate his image and settle old scores with former foes. In addition to highlighting the legendary correspondence with Jefferson (where Adams doubled the epistolary output of Mr. Jefferson), the author also brings to light his lengthy disputes with Mary Wollstonecraft and Mercy Otis Warren. Fortunately, Adams is neither belittled nor attacked with the unfairness of hindsight. Instead, he is presented in the fullness of his complexity; often self-righteous, obsessive, and grouchy, yet always believing that the principles of the Revolution were best served by a national, rather than provincial, approach. Few have disputed Adams' eloquence or dignity and now, thanks to Mr. Ellis, we can finally see that Adams just might be one of the most relevant."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Superb History that lays bare insights into of one of the most brilliant and least understood &quot;Founding Fathers.&quot; Ellis does not take a psychodramatic approach. Instead he opens the vault of evidentiary material (i.e. quotes and the ability to weave together the paterns of Adams life) to give us John Adams the man. The intellectual, the tornado, the intuitive man of insight to whom we owe so much."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I too, sought out this book after reading Prof Ellis' fine study of Thomas Jefferson. This study is equally excellent. Surprisingly, I came away with the clear understanding that I would have enjoyed the passionate, pugnacious Adams far more than the reserved, detatched Jefferson."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much- on my scale three stars in well worth reading. The book is very much written from the perspective of the end of Adams' life. Though it looks over much of his life it is not a complete biography- more like a series of interconnected shorts. I see this as a positive since it allows one to study a smaller area well rather than try to take in the entire life of the man. I think the books is at its best in allowing one to see and understand the character and nature of a very interesting and difficult to grasp man. Adams is an especially interesting individual with which to do this. The author has digested his subject well and I believe captures a good portion of the nature of Adams- no mean feat. The quality of the writing is quite good though not of that rare, excellent quality. I'd heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Though I sometimes find Mr. Ellis's writing style somewhat pedantic and his sentence structure occasionally hard-to-follow, I have enjoyed all of his books about the founding fathers. I particularly appreciate the \\"character analysis\\" aspects of the books."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"After reading &#34;American Sphinx&#34; I wanted to know more about the other founding fathers. Ellis is an easy to read author who gives insight to the personal lives and ambitions of these men. I hope to read more and learn more about the thoughts and feeling of these human leaders we lay so much adoration upon."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"John Adams was a Founding Father most of us who went through the American public school system knew little about. He was never given the attention of Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, or even Madison and Hamilton. In this character study Joseph Ellis makes the argument that Adams was truly one of the greatest of the founding fathers, a passionate idealist and visionary, who at the same time was practically wise in leading American first to Independence and then away from possibly disastrous war with France or England. Ellis makes much of Adams wise resistance of the High- Federalist urgings of Alexander Hamilton to go to war with France, or the liberal Jeffersonian approach of distancing oneself from England. Ellis analyzes the character of Adams, a man of tremendous ambition and learning who time and again expressed himself in ways which led to quarrels with others. But Ellis emphasizes the overall wisdom of Adams, his strategic perception of what was in the long- term interest of the United States. This book focuses on the twenty- five years after Adams left the White House. In the first twelve of these Adams engaged in polemical self - defense and self- promotion. In the latter years he mellowed and this was the time in which his correspondance with Jefferson resumed. Ellis shows how complex a figure Adams was and how brilliant in psychological analysis. Adams understand the human need to feel 'superior' to the other and in fact understood this as his own driving passion. He felt that already in his own time his own proper contribution to the Revolution was underplayed and misunderstood. It was he for instance who might have written the 'Declaration of Independence' but who authorized Jefferson to do so. This study aims to restore Adams to his proper place in the pantheon of the Founding Fathers, and brings much evidence in support of its case. The book is enjoyable if somewhat repetitive. I would have enjoyed it even more had it gone into a real analysis of the relationships within the Adams family itself. But as I understand Ellis has taken upon himself this task in other Adams' volumes of his."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis' biography of John Adams, one of the earliest published portraits of the Founding Fathers by the author, is well suited for those who want a shorter, crisper account than the longer ones produced by other biographers (e.g., McCullough). Though it does not include some important material unearthed since its appearance, it honors Adams' essential brilliance and his determinative role in both the success of the American Revolution and the country's endurance while a Federalist president."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"What I liked best about the book was the author's constant urging of the reader to appreciate the differences between Adams and Jefferson, and the importance of getting a balanced idea of the thoughts of both of these men in our understanding of the foundations of our republic. I loved the author's calling for a monument to Adams close to Jefferson's to dramatize the importance of their conflicting but complementary ideas."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I am like dspector -- I searched this book out after reading Ellis's &quot;American Sphinx&quot; on Jefferson. I am now a true John Adams fan. I have also read Ferling's biography of Adams, and agreed that it was more thorough, but not that it was as well written. Ellis has no equal in writing historical biography!I'm now interested in knowing if anyone is working on a John Adams Memorial comparable to the Washington and Jefferson memorials in D.C. Why is he ignored? How about putting him on some of our money???"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Not exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a more chronologicalbiographical story.

I'm still reading but it is a hard book to understand for a novice reader like myself, even though I am a true American history fan"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Joseph Ellis does an excellent job at giving life to the internal mechanisms that were at work inside of John Adams as he formed his political opinions. Focusing almost exclusively on the retirement years of Adams and his writings from his home in Quincy, Ellis makes sense of a man that hated the mythical makings of the Revolutionary generation and yet desired for his own name to be admitted to the pantheon that George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were already sharing. The only shortcoming is that Ellis hasn't quite worked out the fluidity of the language as he has with more recent works (i.e. Founding Brothers) In spite of the occasionally dry wording this is still a good place to start for someone interested in this intriguing character."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"When John Adams began to compile notes for an autobiography, he prefaced his material with a warning to posterity: \\"[T]here is no reason to expect that any sketches I may leave of my own Times [will] be received by the Public with any favour, or read by individuals with much interest\\" (61).Adams wrote more out of a typical self-effacement than modesty, but his prediction has proved accurate. Succeeding generations of Americans have paid relatively little attention to this cantankerous Founding Father. Compared to some of his contemporaries, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, Adams has enjoyed only small bursts of notoriety.In his new work, Passionate Sage: The Character and Legacy of John Adams, historian Joseph J. Ellis explores why Adams \\"remains the most misconstrued and unappreciated \`great man' in American history\\" (12). In his work, Ellis explores the last twenty-five years of Adams's life, spanning from the time he left the White House to the day of his death on July 4, 1826. According to Ellis, it was in this final period that Adams, free from political and social restraints, was able to express fully his personality and reveal his deepest thoughts. It was also during this time that Adams himself began to analyze and comment upon his own role in the American Revolution and the establishment of the United States government.Readers should bear in mind that Ellis's work is not a biography. Those looking for a chronological account of his life and accomplishments will not find it here. Instead, Ellis structures his narrative episodically. Each chapter explores a different facet of Adams's personality, revealing his character and thoughts through his friendships, correspondence, intellectual habits, personal reflections, and hopes for the future of his country.A consistent and entertaining theme throughout Ellis's book is Adams's belligerent yet likeable personality. Adams was never more productive than when challenged; he thrived in the face of conflict. Ellis describes how much in his element Adams felt when, as president, his policies lost him the favor of the Federalist Party:[Adams had] placed himself in the most attractive position imaginable, at least for a man of his disposition: a leader without a party, whose independence [was] unalloyed and whose virtuous motives [could not] be attributed to a crass craving for popularity. (36)Adams even took this personal combativeness into his library. He was an aggressive reader, scribbling furious notes on the pages of his books as a means of debating with the author. This habit is indicative of his mode of intellectual operation: \\"[Adams's] marginalia....constitute dramatic illustrations of the way he defined his own elemental ideas in conflict with opposing versions\\" (89).It was typical of Adams to identify his views according to opposition. Ellis employs this same method of identification to reveal Adams's ideological mindset. He devotes a significant amount of his text to the famous correspondence between Adams and his colleague, Thomas Jefferson. Citing Benjamin Rush, who once dubbed Adams and Jefferson, \\"the North and South Poles of the American Revolution,\\" Ellis juxtaposes the two Founders, demonstrating how Adams sharpened his opinions by pitting them against Jefferson's (134). It was within this context of private communication that Adams was best able to articulate his views: \\"the episodic character of a conversation matched nicely with his impulsive, hit-or-miss...mode of thinking\\" (144).While the structure of Ellis's work is refreshing in its originality, it suffers at times from rough transitions. He divides his analysis so sharply into different categories that some chapters read like independent essays. This lack of structural unity requires him to repeat information, unnecessarily burdening the reader. Twice, for example, he discusses Adams's criticism of Mary Wollstonecraft's writings (101, 185).The lack of connection between sections also produces an aesthetic imbalance in Ellis's work. Some chapters, such as the one dwelling on Adams and Jefferson's correspondence, are full of delightful anecdotes; others, such as Chapter 5, \\"Erudite Effusions,\\" are sufficiently heavy with political theory so as to alienate readers in search of lighter fare.However, for Adams enthusiasts, Ellis's analysis provides a fresh and original look at an oft-neglected Father. Ellis's heartfelt treatment conveys an unusual appreciation for the Sage of Quincy. By portraying Adams transparently-warts and all-he succeeds in conveying to readers a sense of the Founder's humanity. \\"In effect,\\" says Ellis, \\"though [Adams] belongs on Mount Rushmore, we would need to devise a way to replace the granite with flesh and blood\\" (6)."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"The author has written a handful of very good books on America's Founding Fathers. These are not conventional biographies per se, i.e. birth to death chronologies, but rather focus on the formative years/events in the founding of the republic, including the historical figures involved or vice versa, focusing on a specific historical figure and his impact on these critical times and his legacy. These books are somewhat cerebral - thoughts vs. actions - but are not dry intellectual tomes - a credit to the author.Passionate Sage is the latter - chronicling Adams' life after his \\"retirement\\" from the Presidency, (1801), to his death on July 4th, 1826 in Massachusetts - fifty years after the \\"signing\\" of the Declaration of Independence - and the same day, in an almost fictional quirk of history, that Thomas Jefferson died at Monticello in Virginia. (Note - This book was written before McCullough's biography.) We are privy to much of Adams' thoughts and memories during this time because of his prolific letter writing - most notably with Thomas Jefferson but with many others - and because these letters have been thankfully preserved. Also Mr. Adams - who read a lot during his retirement - had the interesting habit of arguing with the books he read by leaving notes in the margins - Another fascinating facet of his personality.The topics covered are wide and varied - including theories on government, critical decisions, and historical personalities - and being John Adams, he usually brings these written discussions around to himself and his thoughts and actions. This last bit is what makes Adams human and therefore fascinating. Washington and Jefferson have been put on historical pedestals, consciously so; Adams is one of us - albeit a very intelligent one of us.The only caveat here is that the book assumes some previous knowledge of Adams and his times - but otherwise is a fascinating and engaging read. It also makes for an excellent sequel to Catherine Drinker Bowen's book on Adams' formative years - John Adams and The American Revolution and also a great supplement to David McCullough's excellent Adams biography."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I thought the energy, mischevious wit and intellectual excitement of Adam's mind was wonderfully brought to life with this book. Though not an A to Z life story - it generally focuses on his later life - it still manages to give you a sense of the whole man and the challenges of his times. I wish Ellis would have written a more comprehensive life story, perhaps he will yet."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"I'm a huge fan of Joseph Ellis, and this one is just as good as his other, more famous books. Just an incredible read."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Wise old John Adams is the least appreciated genuis from the colonial era. He is also (with only Ben Franklin ranked above him) the most human of the founders. Adams was vain, egomanical and short tempered. He was also funny, honest, very smart, and a great man who contributed enormously to the creation of our country. Ellis' book is a wonderful portrait of this amazing man. It is a real shame that there is no national monument to John Adams. He deserves one. Until that oversight is corrected, &quot;Passionate Sage&quot; will have to serve as his monument. A great read."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"John Adams, you may want to consider Joseph Ellis's fine work, &quot;Passionate Sage&quot;. Mr. Ellis does not dwell on Adams childhood or early years &amp; that is fine. Not really that extraordinary for his time. Adams biggest problem was &amp; is that he has never had the armies of p.r. men that have promoted Washington, Franklin &amp; Jefferson thru the years. Adams knew this yet respected &amp; envied them. He also knew his intellectual gifts surpassed the big three of the revolutionary generation. His integrity &amp; forthrightness made him a most disagreeable person. He rationalized his unpopularity, feeling that virtue with fame is no virtue at all. His unpleasantness mellowed in his later years but not his brillant mind. In their last 14 years he pursued a lively correspondence with Thomas Jefferson. This may be his best legacy."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Ellis' work focuses on the latter part of Adams' life. While it makes no claim to be a complete biography, the book serves as an excellent foundation for those seeking to learn more about our most underappreciated founding father. Through detailed comparisons with Jefferson - Adams' rival and close friend who has been treated more kindly by America's collective consciousness - Ellis begins to illuminate many levels of the New Englander's character. In doing so, he helps us understand why Adams was not, and probably never will be, adored by the nation he helped to create"},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"This book by Joseph Ellis covers the post-presidential years of John Adam. It discusses his renewed correspondence with Thomas Jefferson after many years of silence because of partisan politics. It reveals a picture of a brillant but misunderstood founding father who Ellis calls \\"the voice of the Revolution\\" and Jefferson \\"the pen of the Revolution.\\" A well-written and insightful book! A must read especially for those who read McCullouch's book on Adams."},{"Title":"Passionate Sage","review":"Little would John Adams know that the 2000's would see the re-birth of the Adams legacy. First, there was the David McCullough book chronicling his life, and then the HBO award winning series taken from that book. There has been a continuing push to get an Adams memorial on the Mall in Washington. All this would have made John Adams immensely satisfied, because as he died he correctly predicted that Thomas Jefferson's conception of America would live on, and his would be relegated to the backwaters of history. But in the 200 years since Adams lived and wrote, America does not find itself in the liberal paradise that Mr. Jefferson imagined, nor does it find itself the financial-industrial-military state that Hamilton envisioned, because as I write this review, that state is in ruins. Adams and his writings remain as brilliant cautionary warnings about ideology, untrammeled patriotism, religious fervor and unbridled greed. Basically, the credo that most Americans took for granted, has broken down. Ellis does not follow a straight narrative in his book, but instead focuses on Adams as he leaves the Presidency as the Revolution of 1800 beckons.His writings in the period after the presidency strike the reader as lacking any kind of ideology, but rather concentrate on the way things are. Even as a young man, Adams had the notable, albeit impolitic, way of speaking the truth no matter whom the audience was. On religion: \\"After listening to an argument in behalf of the divinity of Jesus Christ that concluded with the unknowability of it all, Adams jotted down his own conclusion: \`Thus Mystery is made a convenient Cover for absurdity.' On his chosen profession: \\"the chief problem with the lawyer was that \`he often forments more quarrels then he composes, and inriches himself at the expense of impoverishing others more honest than himself.\\" While these polemics can be explained as an angry young man (he wrote them in the 1750's) they still are important, because none of the others founders spoke like this.But as the Revolution came and went, and his Presidency, Adams again railed against ideologues from Europe saying that: \\"Equality is one of those equivocal words which the philosophy of the 18th Century has made fraudulent...in the last twenty five years it has cheated millions out of their lives and tens of millions out of their property.\\" Adams, unlike most current Presidents who constantly quote God as \`on our side', never thought that America was a chosen nation: \\"There is no special providence..we must and we shall go the way of all earth.\\"Not exactly, the kinds of words that you would expect to hear at a 4th of July celebration. But just because Adams was a cynic does not mean that he didn't appreciate the validity of the cause of American independence. His main line of thinking saw the Revolution as a necessary evil, and did everything in his power as ambassador and as President to preserve it, so the Spirit of 1776 would not devolve into the flames of a counterrevolution or a Reign of Terror. I for one, am glad that America is rediscovering the Adams legacy of public service coupled with a healthy dose of pragmatism. We should do well to remember this as a new decade and a new Presidency begins."},{"Title":"First Flight : The Story of Tom Tate & the Wright Brothers (I Can Read Chapter Bks.)","review":"I chose this book from the local library for my 7 year old daughter.

Let us take a more detailed look at this odd literary form. The edisonade is a kind of breathless adventure featuring a brilliant young inventor-as-hero, who uses his ingenuity to get out of tight spots (Clute, 1993). Usually the hero is male, but a few edisonades feature a girl inventor. The edisonade flourished in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It sometimes featured real-life inventors as heroes. Two examples of this are Garrett P. Serviss's _Edison's Conquest of Mars_ (1898), an unauthorized sequel to _The War of the Worlds_, and Weldon Cobb's _To Mars With Tesla_ (1901).Edward S. Ellis's dime novel _The Huge Hunter, The Steam Man of the Prairies_ (1868) is generally credited as being the first edisonade. Other dime novels followed. The Frank Reade, Jr. series ran from 1876 to 1939. Many of these stories were written by the prolific Luis P. Senarens under the pseudonym of \\"Noname\\". Many of the inventions in this series were variations of the steam robot. Another popular series was the Tom Edison, Jr. stories by Philip Reade, which ran from 1891 to 1892. The hero, we are told, is not directly related to the historical Edison. But we are meant to see similarities. Robert T. Toombs's Electric Bob series had a much shorter run-- only five stories in 1893-- but afictionados value them for their wit and originality.In genre science fiction, E.E. Smith blended the conventions of the edisonade with those of the western in _The Skylark of Space_ (1928). There were sequels and imitations; but by 1950, genre sf had largely moved beyond the edisonade.Except for the universe of Tom Swift. The original Tom Swift books (written mostly by Howard R. Garis of _Uncle Wiggly_ fame) ran from 1910 to 1938 to a total of 38 titles. The Tom Swift, Jr. books are an extension of the original series. Tom Sr. grows up, marries his childhood sweetheart, has two children, and directs the gargantuan Swift Enterprises. The perpetually eighteen-year old Tom Swift, Jr. is a second generation inventor. The Tom Swift, Jr. series ran from 1954 to 1971, for a total of 33 titles.Books twenty-one through twenty-five are: _Tom Swift and the Asteroid Pirates_ (1963), _Tom Swift and his Repelatron Skyway_ (1963), Tom Swift and his Aquotomic Tracker_ (1964), _Tom Swift and his 3D Telejector_ (1964), and _Tom Swift and his Polar-Ray Dynasphere_ (1965). All five books were written to formula by James Duncan Lawrence, that champion TSJ author. Charles Brey illustrated the first book, while Edward Moritz ilustrated the last four. There is not much difference between the styles of the two artists. I would argue that the _Repelatron Skyway_ has the most spectacular cover.Many of the conventions of the edisonade may be seen in these stories. The hero develops an invention-- usually a transportation or communication device. This invention allows the hero to (in the words of Huck Finn) \\"light out for the territory\\"-- go to outer space, under the sea, or to a foreign country. When in these foreign settings, the hero uses his invention to master the forces of nature and to overcome villainous enemies. (_The Asteroid Pirates_ and _The 3D Telejector_ have particularly formidable villains.) If Tom does not actually become the ruler of a foreign country, he becomes a kind of CEO.Tom Swift, Jr. does not engage in genocide. This may seem like an odd virtue to cite. But earlier edisonade heroes routinely slaughtered enemies by the hundreds-- or even by the thousands. In Garrett Serviss's novel, Thomas Edison slaughters Martians to near extinction. In _The Skylark of Space_, Dick Seaton cheerfully exterminates aliens \\"root and branch\\" who are deemed \\"unfit\\". And Frank Reade mows down \\"chinks,\\" \\"greasers,\\" and Indians by the hundred with a gatling gun. One critic states that he feels a need to take a shower whenever he rereads the Frank Reade, Jr. stories.To appreciate edisonades, you must not look too hard for dazzling writing; few edisonades are well-written. But they can sometimes have a certain amount of innocent charm and a certain degree of imaginative dash. The Tom Swift, Jr. books maintain the more entertaining traditions of the edisonade and eliminate some of the more repulsive ones. Surely that is worth a few points."},{"Title":"Using God's power: New, pointed, practical scriptural sermons","review":"This book by Henry \\"H.D.\\" Davis Coffey is an excellent compilation of sermons by the late great Disciples of Christ Evangelist.

Lisa Bingham's _Call of the Wild_ was really more silly than funny and Nellie, the gorilla, has more romantic dates than Alana, the main female character in the story, but, for the most part it was okay. I have the feeling that people who know more about gorillas than I do would cringe at reading the story, but the tension between Alana and Jake was fun to read. Susan Peterson's _Everything But Anchovies_ was my favorite of the two stories, although even it had its problems. Josh, the handsome supercop, gets partnered with Quinby, a rookie who keeps messing up and who has an incredibly long resume. Quinby was great and I loved Josh, but it felt like Peterson had some problems with Harlequin's page number restrictions. For example, it's mentioned that Josh's ex-wife wants to take their son far away from him, something which bothers Josh a great deal, but this issue is never actually resolved. It felt like the son was only in the story in order to cause a little temporary tension in Josh and maybe to add a cuteness factor."},{"Title":"Call of the Wild / Everything but Anchovies (Duets 2-In-1, 49)","review":"delightful, funny... a bit of a mystery! really enjoy this book, sue has a wonderful talent with words story flows so nicely. hope to see more books by her soon!"},{"Title":"Call of the Wild / Everything but Anchovies (Duets 2-In-1, 49)","review":"I can't say enough good things about Susan Peterson's EVERYTHING BUT ANCHOVIES.

Like a previous reviewer, I wish the author would write a bigger book--I'd sure like to stay with her characters longer. I'm in the middle of CALL OF THE WILD, and I have to say, it's also quite original and well-written. All in all, this Duets is one of the freshest category romances I've read in awhile."},{"Title":"Call of the Wild / Everything but Anchovies (Duets 2-In-1, 49)","review":"Unfortunately, although Bingham shows she can write, the heroine in \\"Call of the Wild\\" is one of those romance heroines whose lives come to a halt when they meet A Man and suddenly the entire universe revolves around him with no room for the heroine to shine on her own. (And frankly, this Man doesn't seem worth it.) The setting held great promise with the fascinating premise of gorilla behavior contrasted to the life of a radio relationships advisor, but unfortunately fell flat when that premise was given a simplified, saccharine and sexist coating.However, Susan Peterson's entry is wonderful, well worth the price of the book and then some. Funny, romantic, heartwarming, and down-to-earth. The only negative thing about it is that it was too short and the father sub-plot was resolved off-camera, the son sub-plot was unresolved (unless the dance with the ex was supposed to signal in some way that it had been resolved), and the unusual foster family was not examined more closely.That was the main problem. A great read like \\"Anchovies\\" cried out for a longer book where we could really dig into the characters of these diverse, fascinating and funny people."},{"Title":"Call of the Wild / Everything but Anchovies (Duets 2-In-1, 49)","review":"\\"Call of the Wild\\" by Lisa Bingham. When Nellie the gorilla rejected her eleventh suitor in two years, Dr. Wilhelmina Bush, owner of the Maratonga Behavioral Institute and Zoological Park decides a change is needed. She informs researcher Jake Grisholm that she hired radio sex therapist Alana Childe to assist. Alana learns the hard way that her client the \\"goddaughter\\" is a gorilla, but even more difficult is that Jake is the one man whose seduction years ago remains implanted in her heart and soul. Likewise that night of ecstasy is Jake's dream moment. With a gorilla and her godmother interceding, how can this couple fail to mate? A gorillas in the midst of a relationship turns this work into a charmingly humorous tale.\\"Everything but Anchovies\\" by Susan Peterson. Between filling in at the restaurant making and delivering pizza and working as a tyro police officer on the Bracket City, New York force, Quinby Parker has no social life. Part of her problem is a lack of time, but a major dilemma is that no one wants to date a cop. However, Sergeant Josh Reed, the most decorated cop on the force, sure looks good to the female rookie, but the supercop has a kid and besides why would he date a klutzy police officer like Quinby unless love sentences both of them to a lifetime together. Two cops and a pizza are the right ingredients for a jocular romantic story.Once again, the two stories in the Duet line are fun and amusing, as readers will enjoy the latest Duets.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Call of the Wild / Everything but Anchovies (Duets 2-In-1, 49)","review":"Quinby Parker has a way with pizza and with jobs...lots and lots of jobs.

The whole notion of \\"spectacle\\" as the dominant mode of capitalist/consumerist society is by no means original to Kellner. His analysis seems inspired in part by the philosophy of Guy Debord (Society of the Spectacle, 1967), and by the American historian/philosopher Daniel Boorstin, whose provocative 1961 book \\"The Image\\" is an earlier and more accessible exposition of the same ideas. Boorstin referred to \\"pseudo-events\\" and famously defined the celebrity as one who is \\"known for his well-knownness.\\"What is refreshing about Boorstin is his apolitical, objective, yet passionate analysis, which Debord vehemently rejects as apologetic and naive. Kellner, like Debord and his Frankfurt School predecessors, reads contemporary culture as the subjugation of the masses by a \\"culture industry\\"--an all-powerful imperious collusion of dominant media and the shadowy controllers of the means of production. He seems bent on placing blame for what he perceives as the excesses of consumerism. Boorstin, on the other hand, believes it far more productive to look within ourselves, rather than to blame a nefarious conspiracy: \\"Daring not to admit we may be our own deceivers, we anxiously seek someone to accuse of deceiving us.\\"Kellner does not disguise his political beliefs, referring repeatedly in this work to George H.W. Bush as \\"Bush Daddy,\\" to that president's agenda as \\"hardright and utterly corrupt,\\" to the \\"Bush-Cheney gang,\\" and proclaiming that the younger Bush \\"stole the presidency\\" (the topic of another recent Kellner book)..There is certainly nothing \\"wrong\\" with interpreting culture through a particular political perspective. Indeed Debord, Adorno and the others did the same, although with greater originality. I agree entirely with Kellner's assessments and characterizations of Bush p&egrave;re et fils, but wish he would focus more in this work on promoting an understanding of culture and communication than on advancing his own political agenda. After all, he describes his goal as to \\"teach students and citizens how to read their culture,\\" and that is a disingenuous characterization of his apparent intent. He seems rather more devoted to teaching WHAT to read in culture than HOW to make one's own informed analysis.Kellner has written or edited two dozen books and published more than two hundred articles on critical theory, culture, and society. Perhaps it would be difficult for one so prolific to avoid becoming self-referential, but the bibliography in \\"Media Spectacle\\" lists 18 of Kellner's own works and the text and notes refer to those works at least 98 times. By this time, he seems to be repeating himself.Indeed, the redundancies within this work itself are aggravating. Discussing a character in \\"The X-Files,\\" Kellner reports that, \\"Mulder typically takes charge, provides the explanations, and is more often than not proven correct.\\" And only two paragraphs later writes that \\"Mulder is the senior partner, who usually gives orders and who often-but not always-has the more correct analysis.\\" He reiterates several times and in great detail how Michael Jordan's image reflects US cultural values and mythology. He tells us repeatedly, with slight variations in vocabulary, that O.J. Simpson, \\" was a well known sports star and media figure.\\" This is a book in desperate need of a good editor.Finally, Kellner certainly makes the valid point that the public needs to be aware that corporations and individuals should be judged critically--and that they often manipulate public opinion and perceptions. His examples, though, are all so well known as to be trite. McDonald's serves fatty foods? Michael Jordan avoids politics? O.J. Simpson's trial was a circus? The X-Files is popular because people don't trust the government? George W. Bush stole the election? Kellner should either provide some new insight into these \\"spectacles\\" or tackle something a little more difficult--a set of phenomena about which we don't already have grave suspicions--and shed some light in those places where the motives behind spectacles still lurk in the darkness.In the end, the reader is left with important questions unanswered: What are the elements of spectacle? What has created a culture of spectacle? How and why does spectacle communicate to us? What messages do spectacles present? If the answers are here, they are buried under mounds of verbiage. And they were far more cogently addressed by Daniel Boorstin more than 40 years ago."},{"Title":"Index to Waite's \\"the Book of Black Magic & of Pacts\\"","review":"If, by clawing out my own eyes, I could reverse the damage I have wrought to the multiverse with this wretched, monstrous tome I would gladly tear these accursed orbs from my skull!

The book was copyrighted in 1992 and published by Viking Pegasus in 1994, but Graham Greene (GG) had died in 1991. The contents stem from a diary of over 800 pages, kept between 1965-1989. The Foreword by Yvonne Cloetta, GG's last mistress, and GG's own Introduction provide good starts on a Review. The book consists of XIX rather brief chapters, but before looking at some of these, we must try to learn something about the personality of this complex man. GG often used the words \\"conscious\\" and \\"subconscious.\\" We can begin with GG's father's subjecting GG to psychoanalysis, but we never learn why. GG liked his analyst, but when transference did occur, it was directed to the analyst's lovely wife! Dream analysis, of course, has been of interest since Antiquity and was a major concern of analysts like Freud, Jung, and Adler.

I met a beautiful brunette imbued with \\"Mozartian qualities,\\" but there was no mention of terms like symphony, movement, or compositional key, or names like Don Giovanni and Jupiter Symphony. Later I was sadly sitting on a seat in an A/C awaiting takeoff when my Mozartian friend was seated beside me. Apparently, we flew off into eternal happiness. GG always had pencil and paper on a bedside table. For years he recorded his dreams and then transcribed them into an ever more voluminous diary. GG's subconscious played a big role in his writing. GG reread his daily writing just before bed, thus overcoming blockage and giving new ideas for writing. Examples include \\"It's a Battlefield,\\" \\"The Honorary Consul,\\" and \\"A Burnt Out Case.\\" The last in particular showed GG's personal influence on the character Querry. GG regarded \\"The Power and the Glory\\" to be his best book. Many of GG's dreams were of a warning nature, leaving him depressed for hours afterwards. At age 7, GG dreamed of a shipwreck the night the \\"Titanic\\" sank. In \\"A Sort of Life,\\" GG describes mixed feelings toward his father (v.s.). Indeed, GG had a strenuous inner life! However, his dreams contained little erotic material. His dreams could show fear but never terror or nightmare. Many of his dreams seem to have a biblical flavor. Would I recommend this book? He refers too often to Robert Louis Stevenson. Many of the chapters are rather boring. Perhaps, the term \\"His Last Bow\\" that Conan-Doyle applied to the end of Sherlock Holmes's cases might fit in well here. Finally, here are a few examples of chapters and the dream characters inhabiting them. IV, in \\"Statesmen and Politicians,\\" GG meets Mr Wilson, General de Gaulle, Khrushchev, Omar Torrijos (see \\"Getting to Know the General\\"), Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Edward Heath, Yuri Andropov, Francois Mitterrand, Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, and Oliver Cromwell (!). VIII, in \\"Brief Contacts with Royalty,' GG meets King Leopold, Queen Elizabeth, King Ibn Saud, and An Unknown Princess. XI, in Travels GG goes to West Africa, Arabia, China, Syria, Australia, Liberia, The U.S.S.R., and Cuba. XVIII, in \\"Animals Who Talk.\\" GG writes favorably of cats and dogs (in some of my other reviews, I have expressed amazement that in this animal-rich world of ours, GG seems oblivious to their existence). If you're a real GG fan and not a dilettante, go ahead and buy GG's Dream Diary. The more of GG we read, the better we understand one of the greatest English-language writers of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"A World of My Own: A Dream Diary","review":"This book is a good example as to why most people care so little to listen to friends talking about their dreams: dreams are so specific in time and place to the dreamer that they only come alive in the dreamer's mind. Greene's accounts usually consist mostly of the raw details about the dream (the who, what, and where), but provide few vivid details that might bring the characters or events alive to the reader. This very short book, only about 120 pages of total text in somewhat large print, was published in 1992, the year after Greene died in 1991. His friend and publisher Max Reinhardt was starting a new imprint and Greene offered this minor work up for his friend. Greene states the book is extracted from more than 800 pages of dream diaries he kept from 1965 through 1989. Unfortunately this work covers the second half of Greene's lengthy writing career, from the period after his earlier great works. Most of the dreams discussed are in very short paragraphs and few run more than a page. While some dreams have short introductions, most don't. The book suffers greatly since we don't know the date of each dream. Greene choose to organize them by subject (e.g., War, Religion, Travel) rather than chronologically. If only he would have had a date with each dream and a brief introduction giving some idea as to why he choose the specific dream out of all the material. While Greene claimed to use dream material in his writings, so few of these dreams have direct relevance to anything he wrote in his later years. Only a few are directly mentioned or specifically shown as having been used in his writings. Few reveal much about the inner Greene. The best thing about the book is his six-page introduction which discusses the real world in relation to the dream world and vice versa. Greene's imagination and his life are far better on display in his novels and short stories."},{"Title":"A World of My Own: A Dream Diary","review":"Greene sets down the contents of his dreaming world with the lucidity of his reportage and fiction. You can see the connection now when reading the fiction and travel writing with the tumultuous subconscious life he led. These journals begin in 1965 so it's a question for another day what effect keeping such journals had on his subsequent writing. Perhaps most striking is how clear the images are, and how clearly he sets forth his dreams but also his process of dreaming and recording those dreams."},{"Title":"The Psychological Treatment of Depression","review":"It's very early in the development of COGNITIVE THERAPY.

There were proper villians with uniforms and armies, and a wall to seperate our world from theirs. This story pays homage to the great titans of the realist spy fiction genre: John Le Carre, Len Deighton and the like. Rucka's writing reaches and surpasses the high mark set by the regular Queen &amp; Country series. The tension of the chase scenes is masterfully constructed. Brian Hurtt's artwork in this collection is less heavily inked than in his contribution to the regular series, &quot;Operation: Morningstar&quot;, and this creates cleaner lines and better showcases his artistic detail. An exciting, emotional story that hits all the right notes, this collection is a must-have for spy fiction fans of any medium."},{"Title":"Queen & Country: Declassified","review":"\\"Declassified\\": This three-issue miniseries is the first volume of Greg Rucka's \\"Queen And Country\\" to delve into the backstory of the Special Operations division, telling the story of Operation Landslide, a botched mission that was alluded to in an earlier graphic novel (\\"Operation Stormfront\\")The story is brisk and action-packed, and it's fun to learn more of the Special Ops leader Paul Crocker's history. However, I was a little disappointed in the plot -- the present-day Crocker's heavy emotional investment in what had happened during this 1986 escapade wasn't entirely borne out in this brief story arc. I mean, it was a good read, but it didn't entirely blow me away. Maybe Crocker's character just wasn't fleshed out that well: author Greg Rucka does tend to minimize his men of action when they are young and physically daring; it's when they are older and battle-weary that the interesting bits come out.Anyway, this was a fun comic, but other Q&C; stories have been better."},{"Title":"Queen & Country: Declassified","review":"I have been warming up to the Q&C series, but this one made me a fan. I loved the first collection, went lukewarm on Morningstar, hated the art in Crystal Ball (liked the story though), and really liked Blackwall (the first collection to give the reader a real sense of Tara Chace's dedication to the job and friends and what it takes to protect both). Declassified features the return of Brian Hurtt from the Morningstar arc. The inking is less heavy-handed here than that storyline and the story, already a very tense thriller, sparkles because of it. I won't divulge what happens as Crockett travels to communist Europe as a Minder, but a lot happens! A very well-defined page turning story with great artwork - what more can one ask for from a great book?

In addition the art is wonderful, plus it has covers by Scott Morse."},{"Title":"The Viking Children's World Atlas","review":"ISBN 0670217913 - Printed in Great Britain. Age range not stated. Pictorial hardcover, no dustjacket, 47 pages. Published by The Viking Press in 1983. By Jacqueline Tivers and Michael Day.Sarah and Simon are going globetrotting. Beginning with their home, then their street, then the town they live in, the reader is shown an ever-expanding view of the world. Once the view reaches the level of a map of the world, a legend is introduced, showing crops, animals, industry and holiday locations, among other things. On the pages that follow, Simon and Sarah visit countries all around the world and the legend helps the reader to know more about those countries. Small photos and captions throughout add interesting tidbits of information. The tour of the countries of the world is followed by a look at the polar regions before the continues the original ever-expanding view of the world and the reader gets to see the world from space and, finally, Earth's place as an itty-bitty speck in the solar system. The book ends with a look at the ages of life on Earth, captured in just a few short sentences and going back 500 million years.I love the idea of sharing this information through a pair of kids seeing the world, which is veryWhere On Earth is Carmen Sandiego?. In addition, I was a little blown away to realize that there's one way that this book was far ahead of its time. The idea of \\"zooming out\\" from Sarah and Simon's home until you're looking at the entire solar system is SO Google-map-ish that I had to pause my reading to check the copyright date.So, clearly, the whackadoodle parents who think the planet is 6,000 years old won't like this book, or at least that 500 million years part. Normal people won't mind the age of Earth but might have other issues, mostly time. Things change in time, but the text in a book doesn't - so West Germany and Germany exist in this book. So does Czechoslovakia, Zaire, and the Soviet Union. Whatever the world looked like in the early-mid 1980s, it looks like inside this book. I find those changes fascinating and interesting, but it might be tough for a kid who's just learning to learn from this book because some things will have to be un-learned and replaced with current information. The types of animals and crops you'll find throughout the world are pretty much the same as they were, and much of the information remains at least somewhat relevant, but if you're considering buying this book, at least you now know what to expect! I really, really like this book, so I'm giving it 4 stars but mentioning that, for the outdated-ness, it might warrant three.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The One-Nighter","review":"A powerful and passionate story of lust and innocence lost.

Bolitho is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Hyperion, and he is also trying to adjust the rest of his life to his open liaison with another man's wife - Lady Catherine Somervell, who now waits for him in the Bolitho home in Falmouth. Meanwhile, Bolitho's legal wife, Belinda, lives in style in London; and Bolitho never sees his only child, their small daughter. His dearest friend, Vice Admiral Thomas Herrick, cannot accept Bolitho's relationship with Catherine. Nor can Felicity, the Bolitho sister who now returns a widow after decades spent with her soldier husband in India; nor can many others. Yet Bolitho is necessary enough to the war so that his superiors protect him, and continue to use him. His loyalty to his life's work remains unswerving, but he worries about Catherine and he fears learning the truth about what will eventually happen to his damaged eye. Can he carry on and lead those under his command as effectively as ever, in spite of these personal difficulties? Which soon include a nephew, Felicity's son, serving aboard his flagship and not exactly bringing glory to his uncle's name.This is a more introspective book than many of the other Bolitho novels, but it still has plenty of adventure and some gripping sea battles. It is far more a character study, though, and it does an interesting job of testing Bolitho the man against the customs and constraints of his time in English history. An affecting read for Bolitho fans, although I do wonder what reaction it might get from a reader not already familiar with the character.--Reviewed by Nina M.

The owner said, \\"Have you read any of Alexander Kent?\\" I had not, and that began a wonderful new adventure. Kent writes naval stories about the same historical time period as O'Brian, but Kent often has more action scenes, which I thoroughly enjoy. If you like O'Brian, you will love Kent.Prentice Kinser III, D.Min., Author of:Limitless Living, A Guide to Unconventional Spiritual Exploration and Growth"},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"This is by far the longest book in Kent's Bolitho series. Unlike most books earlier in the series Bolitho spends considerable time on shore iintimately nvolved with his illicit love, Catherine, and then when he is at sea again passionately longing for her. The brave stories of a scared little midshipman who eventually finds his courage, or the lieutenant who excels despite having lost half his face are nearly lost behind Bolitho's obsessive anxieties over his separation from the bold Catherine. Bolitho, now half blinded, is showing signs of tiring and retiring. The series has become a study in the accumulated effects of endless time at sea and in fighting sharp and desperate actions. Bolitho, always deeply concerned with his men, has progressively lost the closest colleagues on whom he had depended, &quot;we happy few,&quot; an' that's no error. Still there are flashes of the old outer heroics while fighting the Dutch for Cape Town, on a secret mission to Copenhagen, and coming to the rescue of his troubled friend Herrick at sea."},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"I read the first 16 or 17 Bolitho books in a hurry, 4 or 5 years ago, and enjoyed them quite a bit. Recently I picked up this one and was very disappointed. Rather than a good story of action and history, that I had come to expect from the author, this recent edition was dedicated almost entirely to Bolitho and Catherine mooning about each other and lamenting their separations."},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"I have read the Hornblower series twice and the Aubrey/Maturin series three times and I looked forward to reading another Britanic Naval series when I began Kent's Bolitho series. The series began strong but towards the end (somewhere around &quot;Success to the Brave&quot;) the series started running out of gas. It appeared to me that the publishers requested Kent to pad the books with inane story lines (or they themselves committed the sin) in order to extend the series (at nearly US$15/book) to increase their profit. I got to the point that when I read the one of many over used phrases, such as &quot;blood ran from the scuppers as if the ship itself was mortally wounded&quot;, I put the book down in disgust. Futhermore, I would occasionally read a few pages that reminded me of the better written books that began the series, affirming my belief that a much less talented individual had a hand in the completion of the series. I suggest to anyone looking for another Aubrey/Maturin series to pick up O'Brian's &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and reread that series. However, if you do pick up the Bolitho series stop investing in the books when it becomes obvious to you that the publishers are padding the stories."},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"The story takes place four months after the battle of Trafalgar and the death of Lord Nelson. The main character is Vice Admiral Richard Bolitho, an aristocrat and one of the rising stars in the British navy. Bolitho is a complicated and compelling figure; with a heart as big as one of his ships of the line, he is also a ruthless and calculating warrior/officer ,seemingly capable of any action that will accomplish the mission. Bolitho is in society's disfavor because of his open liason with a married woman,( an obvious parallel with Nelson's obsession with Lady Hamilton) he is protected by his superior officers , at least professionally, because he gets results. This is the inner tension of the story and Kent handles the love interest with taste and flair. The supporting characters are fleshed out with the same detail as Bolitho, and are never predictable. Like most military leaders of that age, Bolitho leads by the strength of his personality, and no one is neutral in their feelings about him: they love him and will follow him into the worst hell or they will hate and envy him. Bolitho for his part is portrayed as almost the ideal of a best friend, you know he will literally die for you if neccessary. Having said this, Bolitho is also aware of his effect on others and is human enough to manipulate them if that will bring success to the mission. The battle scenes describing the almost point blank range these ships fought at are some of the best ever written (however, both O'brian and Kent are outdistanced by Forrester's single word picture of Hornblower frantically &quot;striking&quot; his colors after a battle in which 75% of his crew is killed; thats tops) and Kent's historical accuracy goes along way to put you there. The author is a member of the British upper class and the precision with which he speaks to us (even across the social spectrum from Vice Admiral to the most common &quot;tar&quot; ) has the other two main competitors O'brian and Forrester beat. The audio version of this title read by Michael Jayston is the perfect union of author and narrator. Jayston has that George Sanders type of inflection to his accent (slightly sinister ?) that transports you to Feb.1806. Most of these titles were written in the sixties and have been long out of print. Resurected with new interest, many are available through &quot; MCBOOKS&quot; in an elegant but expensive format. If your budgit allows it, these are fine produtions and easy to read (when I read all these books in the sixties and seventies I did not need glasses!). 5 stars for the book. 6 stars for the Audio version with Michael Jayston.....happy reading Cal Caligiuri"},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"It's right after Trafalgar and the British admiralty appears to be concerned that Richard Bolitho is becoming another Nelson. Not only does he fight and win, he earns that admiration of his colleagues and subordinates, and he does not care about the love affair that is consuming him, leaving his wife and his lover's husband out in the cold. Oh, the scandal!So, to remove the admiral from the poisoned looks and talk, they send him to support the invasion of South Africa. Of course, Bolitho takes a very active role in it and only barely stops himself from leading the attach in a fire ship launched from a schooner - this from a 50 year old vice admiral!!! Once that mission is over, he comes back to England, spends time with his love, and is again sent out. This time he goes to Denmark on a mission that is completely unclear. I understand why a diplomat is sent out, but why send Bolitho - a fighting admiral - to this place with nothing to command or fight? Oh, did I forget to mention that there is a battle that takes place when he leaves Copenhagen?Another interlude at home, and then Bolitho gets to his new flagship and is out supporting the invasion of Denmark as a subordinate. So, of course he goes off and manages to pick up a sea fight against a stronger ship. This marks the only plot line that is resolved from the series as a whole as the ship he meets up with is the same ship that sunk his beloved Hyperion.The majority of the book is concerned with Bolitho's love affair and how great it is. Unfortunately, the rest of society has different opinions on it and the turmoil extends to Bolitho's family. We have side stories of an abused midshipman who is rescued by acts of heroism taken by him and by those around him; a disfigured Lieutenant whose career is revived by Bolitho; and references to several other minor characters; Even Tom Herrick makes a comeback and he is still conflicted about his relationship with Bolitho and the ending of the book implies that the rift between these two best of friends is now complete and maybe cannot be mended.All in all, this was a different book than most as there was little real action. The focus is on Bolitho's love affair and the three short action stories that are folded into this one book are really not a part of the story arc. Could it be that this was originally a compendium of short stories that were pulled together? Or, maybe the author is still figuring out how to write love stories in a naval setting so he added the action sequences to ensure that he does not lose his core constituency?If I had not read the other books in the series, this one would have turned me off it altogether. As it is, I will probably read the next ones to see if they start improving."},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"I follow all Bolitho books....they are well written and give perspective of the countries, the people and very good descriptions of the ships that are involved."},{"Title":"The Only Victor (Windsor Large Print Series)","review":"Great!

They drove around the square seven times in the small, heavily armoured vehicles in which they'd fought their way across North Africa, Italy, and were to travel on to Austria. At the head of this curious band was a man who sported a hook for a hand, and a nom de guerre which was similarly incongruous for a 48 year old Major in the British army. Vladimir Peniakoff, or &quot;Popski&quot; as he became known, was the enigmatic Belgian born son of White Russian emigres, who had until recent years &quot;pursued the ordinary activities of industry&quot; as a discontented sugar refiner in Egypt. Having tutored himself, alone in the Sand Sea but for the navigational instruments of antiquity, he emerged from the wilderness to train the men who accompanied him through the years of turmoil to this long dreamt of moment of victory. &quot;Private Army&quot; is one of the finest military memoirs I have read, and ranks alongside Fitzroy McLean's &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; and TE Lawrence's &quot;The Mint&quot;. This is the authoritative work on Popski's Private Army, but is much more than a Regimental history. This is a superb piece of literature which you will not quickly forget. Read also &quot;With Popski's Private Army&quot; by Ben Owen, a superb companion book to the above."},{"Title":"Popski's private army","review":"Very readable narrative account of long range desert operations behind enemy lines, in some extremely severe conditions.

This very readable account of his exploits in the desert and Italy show the romance of the warmonger, not only of Popski himself but off the PPA as well. The most intriguing parts of the book to me are the parts that show the craft of the warrior, like celestial navigation, trickery Sun Tzu would be proud off, and the romance of forming and leading commandoes. To anyone interested in the very beginings of desert warfare, this is a must read. Tactics formed by Bagnold and Easonsmith are still very relevant today. Plus Popski's adventures with his &quot;Pisspot&quot; give land celestial navigation a face. If you were going to read books about the &quot;Navy Seals&quot; or &quot;Marine Force Recon&quot; ect. read this one, It's very entertaining."},{"Title":"Popski's private army","review":"I came upon the title character in this book, Vladimir Peniakoff, by reading Pressman's novel \\"Killing Rommel.\\" Like the novel, this book is a bit deceptive; it is a war memoir but both books are more about intelligent men solving very complex problems under stress- war- rather than being blood-thirsty shoot-em-ups or war-glorifying page turners. Peniakoff -\\"Popski\\"- was a multi-lingual Russian expatriate living in Egypt when WWII broke out; he had done quite a bit of desert exploration in an old Ford Model T and despite being in his middle forties, a bit pudgy and with high-blood pressure he wheedled his way into the British Army and then into the Long Range Desert Group. He eventually formed his own \\"army\\" within an army and began leading recon and intelligence patrols behind German and Italian lines in jeeps and Chevy trucks. The details of these patrols, how they found their way across the endless desert to scattered oasis and supply dumps, as well as the history of the areas they were in and the behaviors of the local Arabs is fascinating. Even more fascinating is Peniakoff's ability to unravel the tangled problems of his missions; the need to communicate and inspire the local Arabs, the need to evade German and Italian patrols sent out to find and kill him and his men, the need to secure fuel, water, food etc. makes for absolutely absorbing reading. The story of his casual stroll, in uniform, through a town crawling with enemy troops, or his \\"walk\\" with his men through 150 miles of hostile Arab territory in Tunisia after German aircraft shot up his trucks are worth the price of admission alone.I thought the book's style seemed slightly stilted at first; Peniakoff was clearly a formal person in many ways, and he avoids histrionics or drama, but as I kept reading I found I couldn't put the book down. This book is fascinating on many levels: war memoir, history and culture of North Africa and the Arab populations, pre-war perspective on the colonists in Egypt and the rest of North Africa, the character of the men in the 8th Army in Egypt, and insight into what must have been a truly unique man and the men who were in his unit.A must-read!"},{"Title":"Popski's private army","review":"This book is hard to find but well worth the effort.

In the next paragraph, he'll tell how they attacked a convoy of enemy vehicles simply because they felt the need for some action before heading back to base.He complains about the Italian gentry exploiting the peasantry and the next minute, he's eating a seven course meal with them.That's just a couple of examples; the book is loaded with similar incidents.Still, it's a good read, and shows how intelligence is gathered during wartime (sometimes you just get on the phone and call ahead!)."},{"Title":"Popski's private army","review":"Is a little complicate to the reader of another linguage, and has &#34;lesser actions&#34;.

With numbers never exceeding 50, in jeeps with machine guns, in 78 days in Italy, they cleared 1600 sq miles of mountains, forced several thousand German troops back, killed over 300, and lost one man themselves. They operated with the SAS and LRDG in North Africa. This book is funny. His unit was bedded down for the night, and then 2 German tank units also bedded down, on either side. He knew his jeeps were no match for tanks; so he loaded up his vehicles, and popped off what he had, as they drove out at high speed. he got the German units shooting at each other. They adopted captured soldiers into their unit. Interesting read, especially the part where he talked the British doctor into giving him A1 physical status, so he could get into the British army, though he was far from that."},{"Title":"Popski's private army","review":"This book is an amazing story of courage, ingenuity and survival in WWII. So what makes this book different from the other hundreds of books that would fit this description? For starters the majority of this story is based in North Africa, which is not an area covered nearly as comprehensively as other areas of WWII. It is about an amazing individual who leads a group of men in some of the earliest forms of 'behind-the-line' guerilla type fighting. Working with local people and the limited resources of the desert to create some significant hindrances to the German thrust into North Africa. Something that even guerilla warfare could learn from in present day. There is an array of courageous, if not plain crazy, feats of tactical genius and reconnaissance.The end of the book leads them through the beginning of the closing of the war through Italy and up against some incredible odds behind German lines.Popski was an incredible pioneer in guerilla warfare and negotiation.

This is one of those books. The WW2 British unit known as Popski's Private Army (PPA) operated in North Africa and Italy. Written by its founder, Vladimir Peniakoff (Popski), the book covers the units contributuion to the war effort. Using machinegun armed Jeeps like the later fictional TV Rat Patrol, this small united operated behind the German and Italian lines. The PPA did not beat Nazi Germany by itself, but its contribution far exceeded its small size.

In this book \\"Wireless and Mobile All-IP Networks\\", Lin and Pang focus on the third generation (3G) and the beyond 3G all-IP networks for advanced mobile applications. I found the book to be very informative and well laid out for use as a reference. It has been a life saver in giving a good background on each technology."},{"Title":"Wireless and Mobile All-IP Networks","review":"This book is an excellent reference book on state-of-the-art technologies for integrating wireless and mobile networks with the Internet core networks. It focuses on the networking issues, i.e., higher layers network design including architecture, protocols, and services. It provides comprehensive details on implementing mobility management, session management, billing, security guarantees, etc. in third-generation (3G) and beyond 3G (B3G) networks. The book also covers many new technologies such as VoIP, mobile multimedia messaging, session initiation protocol, mobile number portability, integration of WLAN and cellular networks, etc. The extensive bibliography contains all the relevant standards, IETF documents, and research papers on 3G all-IP networks. The book is very informative and timely.If you are doing research in mobile all-IP networks, this is an excellent book for you by providing a clear system picture and broad details of 3G and B3G networks. If you want to expand your knowledge but are afraid of reading tons of lengthy standards and technical articles, the book is a perfect systematic reference book. It explains each concept in a very clear manner yet with sufficient depth. It is very easy to read and understand. The book is also good for teaching in wireless networking at an advance level. The exercises at the end of each chapter give a good review and focal points of the chapter. They may also help readers/students better understand the concepts and clear their doubts."},{"Title":"Wireless and Mobile All-IP Networks","review":"This book describes All-IP approaches for mobile telecommunication such as IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) that is considered as the heart of converging fixed and mobile networks.

It's suspenseful and character-driven, and both aspects of the novel are equally absorbing.Tor has unfortunately let this one go out of print; hopefully, it's on their short list for reintroduction to the market.

It's a very interesting tale with a well thoughtout plot line. There's a subplot with a marriage falling apart which doesn't seem to work as well as the general plot-line, yet it was interesting to read.. Almost two tales in one.In conclusion, anyone who has lived or been interested in Lacaster County culture OR who likes a good private eye tale will be amused, entertained and captivated."},{"Title":"The Reflexology Manual: An Easy-to-Use Illustrated Guide to the Healing Zones of the Hands and Feet","review":"I bought this book for my wife, but was a little unsure of what I was going to get, because the description is a little lacking.It turned out to be pretty good, though.

Remarkably, these beliefs were taught and adopted with the best of intentions, to protect and guide us. When we lack the necessary awareness, though, we can not see the harm these beliefs do in our lives.Kaufman introduces a set of attitudes to consider along with a simple system of inquiry which he calls the Option Process. He presents many actual dialogues he has had using the Option Process with a variety of individuals beset by a wide range of serious challenges. The dialogues are a powerful way of identifying beliefs which do not serve us, or upon conscious examination, do not seem to make sense. In reading through these dialogues, I was amazed at how quickly many of these individuals were able to emerge from their stuck states, let go of beliefs that did not serve them, and move on to more constructive perspectives and actions. While participants no doubt benefited from Kaufman's questions, the process can also be practiced on one's own.Even though this book was written a number of years ago (1977), it in no way comes across as dated. In a number of respects, it reminds me of the process subsequently and independently developed by Byron Katie known as the Work. For this reader, though, the Option Process is much more accessible and straightforward.For information about other books and programs, visit the website of the Option Institute at www.option.org/"},{"Title":"To Love Is To Be Happy With","review":"Incredibly simple yet packed full of insightsinto how we think and behave in relationships.Mr. Kaufman shines a light on all the beliefs wehold about love and relationships, and how thosebeliefs lead us to fear, anxiety, distance, confusion,and distrust.

The explanations gave me the background to understand the new ideas. The dialogue sections were easy and fun to read, and made each section crystal clear.

This one is my favorite of Kaufman's books."},{"Title":"To Love Is To Be Happy With","review":"Most people would rather be right than happy. Too bad.For those people (which of course includes me, far more often than I would like), I recommend this book, which teaches ways to defuse stress and thrive with all of life's challenges.Barry Neil Kaufman, therapist, author, motivational speaker, and co-founder of the Option Institute, observes that - despite disappointments, illnesses, and physical and emotional problems - we can all be happy. He shows us how to change our lives without pain (the only overlooked major point is that it does require focus and repetition to change how our brains work).I read hundreds of books every year but, if I were forced to choose just one, this would probably be it. It created such a positive impact on the quality of my life! Only quibble - this is the book that should have been called \\"Happiness is a Choice\\" but Kaufman had already used this title for a previous book.[Later note: \\"The Longevity Project\\" by Friedman and Martin is a groundbreaking 80-year overview on what is really directly linked to happiness and health.I am also impressed with \\"The Healing Code by Lloyd - an amazing process for emotional clearing.

Happy reading!"},{"Title":"To Love Is To Be Happy With","review":"The book is easy to read, with many examples and case studies. It tries to give you a 'receipt for happiness', based on the idea that happiness is a state of mind, and we are all responsible for our own happiness.The main problem I have with this book is that, the same arguments that can be used to 'enhance' your happiness may be used as a justification to hurt others: since none of us is resposible for the others' happiness, as the book promotes, then we can betray and lie and hurt the others without consequences. For example, it's not our responsability if we get bored with husband/wife and cheat; if this is according to our 'belief' system, then cheating is OK, because no matter what we do, we can absolve ourselves of guilt by thinking that each person is resposible for his/her own happiness.I found it disturbing to read this philosophy; it seems there is no use for sacrifice for the good of others (children, spouses, friends, parents), since we are not to be held responsible for the 'happiness' and 'well-being' of the others."},{"Title":"To Love Is To Be Happy With","review":"It wasn't the original book i thought i was purchasing.

It enables the user to generate stable geometry that is conducive to changes. There is a focus on change because change reflects innovation. The more changes you can make, the more business you can handle. Graphs pop up during PLM presentations that show product development as an area under a curve. The curve slopes upward reflecting an increasing part maturity as time goes by. The methods described in this book steepen that curve. This book exceeds simple function description. It will improve your engineering. I have taken classes for CATIA V5 from this gentleman and am impressed with his methods. I am a satisfied customer.

I used the book on both CATIA R12 and R13 and it helped a lot transitioning between the releases. I tried learning from many catia books of how to design parts for current projects as well as make them to be stable and modifiable in the future. No other book cover the topics in such detail and practical samples as Nowak does in his book.I lerned ways of organizing the CATIA tree, and designing with future part modification in mind.All the lessons are step-by-step instructions that show you how to draw a certain sketch or part. The steps provide elaborate explanation of why are they chosen against some other optional approaches. In addition, every step is accompanied by a b&w; image that shows the resulting state, so there is no confusion in the process.It is a student edition, so there are two parts in the book: examples (tutorials) and assignments. The assigments are additional task for advanced CATIA user that make you display the knowledge learned from this book. They are bit complicated than the examples, so it makes the student think of ways to analyse, design and build the parts using Nowak's methods.The bottom line is, if you already have certain knowledge of CATIA V5, get this book! It's an excellent 'why and how-to do stuff in catia', not just 'here, this is catia...'."},{"Title":"Texas Organic Gardening","review":"Howard Garret has provided an easy reading, informative view aimed toward those of us in Texas that prefer the natural, organic methods of gardening.

A great man is a man who gives history a turn without which it scarcely could have taken without him.\\"\\"The purpose of Zionism is normalization; the creation of conditions in which the Jews could live as a nation,like the others. Alexander Kojeve whom I spoke of before once said to me.\\" The Jews have the most interesting history of any people. Yet now they want to be what? Albania? How can they?\\" I said \\"For the Jews to be like Albania constitutesprogress. 600,000 Jews in Romania were victims- before the Nazis.They tried to escape. But 600,000 Jews in Palestine did not leave because Rommel was at their door. That is the difference. They considered Palestine to be their own country, and if they had to die they would die not like trapped animals but for the country.\\"\\" I believe there is nothing more destructive of human lives than fanatical conviction about the perfect life,allied to political or military power.Our century affords terrible evidence of this truth.I believe in working for a minimally decent society.If we can go beyond this to a wider life, so much the better.But even a minimum of decency is more than we have in some countries.\\"\\"But not every genius is like one's image of a genius.Pasternak was such a one.

The book is based on a series of largely unstructured conversations with Berlin about his personal past and better known works, as well as some of his views on others' famous works and ideas on philosophy. The interviewer, Ramin Jahanbegloo, cannot be faulted for his brief and often open-ended questions as he is clearly prodding Berlin to speak his mind. Berlin does seem to 'correct' the errors of his interviewer but this is to be expected from such a reknowned and learned philosopher. For those already familiar with Berlin, the responses are far from shocking: Hobbes and Machiavelli are, in fact, ethical thinkers; do be weary of those who propose rational, 100% 'final solutions'; 'total liberty can be dreadful, total equality can be equally frightful'; philosophy, if properly taught, allows one to see through 'bad arguments, deceptions, fumisme, verbal fog..'; etc. That said, it is a lighter read than any one of Berlin's books and, for anyone who is curious about Berlin's views on things, it just might a good place to start."},{"Title":"Conversations With Isaiah Berlin","review":"A very random set of interviews wandering thorought topics the interviewer found interesting.

Although, as Luc Sante states in his introduction, Riis' sole purpose for writing this book is to \\"call attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City and insist on reform\\" (p ix), Riis also presents another underlying theme by unequivocally proving that the more people isolate themselves from the rest of the world, the better chance there is for gross victimization of those less fortunate: simplistically speaking, the rich get richer; the poor get poorer; the wider the gap grows in between (dispersion of our so-called middle class.)Riis' talent lies in his use of poetically descriptive language, saturated with metaphor and alliteration, alongside contrasting factual accounts of harsh reality. The reader is mesmerized by the rhythmic sound of lines such as \\"Down near the Battery the West Side emerald would be soiled by a dirty stain, spreading rapidly like a splash of ink on a sheet of blotting paper\\" (p 25), but then shocked by the stark conditions of tenement life as given in the form of personal stories, photographs, legislation, statistics, and blueprints. Riis writes about the windowless, airless rooms and the unbelievably filthy crowded living conditions. He recounts stories of bitter violence toward children and between the races, as well as degradation and oppression among women, the old, and the infirm. The reader is sickened with wretched stories of infanticide and mortality rates among the children.Riis unapologetically interjects his novel with stereotypical remarks and his own bigoted opinions of the people inhabiting the various ethnically divided \\"wards.\\" Some of his include those such as \\"between the dull gray of the Jew, his favorite color, and the Italian red, would be seen squeezed in on the map a sharp streak of yellow, marking the narrow boundaries of Chinatown\\" (p 24), and \\"poverty, abuse, and injustice alike the negro accepts with imperturbable cheerfulness...He loves fine clothes and good living a good deal more than he does a bank account\\" (p 117).Through the obviously prejudicial film that covers Riis' novel from beginning to end, the reader is able to perceive a sense of his true passion of wanting to make a positive difference in society. His previous stereotypical remarks about African Americans are somewhat softened when he later comments on the injustice towards them:\\"...when the account is made up between the races, it shall be claimed that he falls short of the result to be expected from twenty-five years of freedom, it may be well to turn to the other side of the ledger and see how much of the blame is borne by the prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" (p 119).Riis is an example of a pioneer whose work, sacrifice, and commitment have shaped our country and our world. By educating the public through his journalistic indictments, he provided the catalyst for the ensuing slow process of reform. What places Riis on a higher level than others who have written expos&eacute;s is the fact that he not only provided what he thought to be the main causes for the deplorable situation of tenement life, but also provided an outline of a well thought out plan for improvement that included detailed legislation, floor plans for remodeling, and sound economical postulations. Luc Sante states that Riis does not \\"inquire very deeply into the causes of the conditions he describes\\" (p xi), but one can logically infer very plainly many individual causes and effects that ultimately affect the whole, such as greed, gross lack of education of a whole segment of society, a government and society who chose not to care (or may have felt it did not have the time or resource to care,) growth of nation that was infinitely more vast than expected, depression, oppression, and inertia (on both ends of the class spectrum.)Riis' book is not only a ghost from the past, but also a ghost from the present that haunts our country and our world today. One can still see economically imbalanced conditions that contribute to the growing lower class. Insightful remarks made over one hundred years ago make one disgusted to realize that seemingly little has been learned:\\"Nothing is now better understood than that the rescue of the children is the key to the problem of city poverty, as presented for our solution to-day; that a character may be formed where to reform it would be a hopeless task\\" (p 139).This book should be read for the beauty of the prose, the horror of the content, and the insight to be gained from both. Riis succeeds in showing the reader that our world is a unit existing of one: indeed one world. Riis presents an inarguably complete and comprehensive exposition of \\"how the other half lives.\\""},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob Riis, with Introduction by Luc Sante, is a book that paints a picture of tenement neighborhoods in New York City in 1890. Riis, himself an immigrant, made his living as a journalist. It is his gift of words that brings the slums to life, and transports the reader to the very spot that he describes. Riis was the first to include photographs to vividly capture what his words portray. His writing and photographs were forerunners to investigative reporting and documentaries. Sante referred to Riis' agenda as being restricted to the mundane because he wanted immediate achievable results that would better the lives of the other half. Although his plans were simple; proper housing, sanitary conditions, parks, and schools; they were considered revolutionary. When he left the newspaper business in 1901 he became a lecturer speaking on this topic of reform that was so dear to his heart. He made headway and convinced influential people such as Theodore Roosevelt to join his cause.I think Riis was extremely successful in his mission to make people aware of the conditions in the tenements. Since this book was reprinted in 1997 and the introduction was added at that time, I think it would have increased the value of the book to include a section that briefly described the current condition of the tenements in today's light, and review, with a timeline, the reforms achieved since 1890. It would be interesting because Sante says \\"It [the book] haunts us because so much of it remains true\\" (p.xiii). This book created reforms, but if after 116 years, much of it is still true, we must be missing something. Then again, perhaps not, since Riis says the poor will always be with us, and we can never get rid of either the pauper or the tenement (p.xi).Riis was a firm believer that education alone could make \\"the other half's\\" lives better, but he also knew their need to work long hours to have a roof over their head and food to eat made the chance of education a far flung dream (pp.95, 105, 111, 136). Without the ability to speak English they are unable to change careers. Another solution he had was to focus on the children as a way to reduce city poverty (p.139). Riis preached that besides charitable donations there needed to be people willing to step into action (pp.145, 213).I think the book was well written and is very descriptive. At times I thought his words tended to be racial, blunt, and opinionated, but that was his true style, even in his journalistic works (p.xvi). Even though I didn't like to read the racist words, I believe he accurately presented the views of the slums. Just as Walter Isaacson fills his readers with awe at the accomplishments of Ben Franklin in his book Ben Franklin, An American Life, Riis fills us with an ache for the immigrants coming to America to make a better life for themselves and finding it hard to do. I think anyone interested in history or the life of an immigrant would find this an informative book. It isn't one I would find on an educational reading list in terms of contributions to education, but it does give insight into living conditions in the late nineteenth century and gives a plug for a connection between education (or lack of) and living conditions within the largest city in America."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Like books by Steinbeck, How the other half lives is a eye opening expose of life for the have-nots in the late 19th century.

RiisThis book is a \\"classic\\", most people have heard about it but few have read it. [The word \\"tenement\\" is a legal term for property holdings, usually housing that is not owner-occupied.] Riis was a newspaper reporter, this book was first published in 1890 to document housing in New York city. Riis came from Denmark at age 21. Arriving in NY he first worked as a carpenter, later he became a police reporter for newspapers. He walked down Mulberry Street in the early mornings. Slum housing was the result of \\"public neglect and private greed\\". [The big landowners of New York controlled politics since the 18th century.] Riis believed that education was most important for new immigrants. This book lacks the photographs that illustrated the original book. Riis' \`Introduction' says slum housing causes criminals. They are also a source of epidemics. Was this distress caused by drunkenness? The slums generated a 40% yearly return on the investment!The rapid expansion of NY after the War of 1812 saw the rise of rear houses, tenant-houses built to house the maximum number of people in the smallest area (Chapter 1). The threat of cholera led to a \\"Tenement-House Act\\" in 1867 (Chapter 2). Rooms had to have windows for light and air. Most tenement dwellers were immigrants (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes \\"The Down-Town Back Alleys\\" where large houses were subdivided into tiny rooms. Riis describes the living conditions. Chapter 5 tells about the Italians in New York. Chapter 6 tells about \\"The Bend\\" of Mulberry Street near the Five Points, the heart of the slum district. These vile properties are owned by \\"an honored family\\". Chapter 7 tells of a police raid on stale-beer dives (unpasteurized beer). Chapter 8 describes the cheap lodging-houses \\"nurseries of crime\\". Riis describes Chinatown in Chapter 9. Some houses are opium dens with \\"white slaves\\". The Chinaman is \\"as clean as a cat\\".Chapter 10 describes the Hebrew quarter, the most densely populated neighborhood. Most of the ready-made clothes sold in the big stores are sewn here. Chapter 11 tells of the \\"sweaters\\", the middleman or subcontractor, who hires people in the tenements for unregulated labor. They work hard and save to send for their families. Chapter 12 describes the Bohemian cigar-makers who live in tenements owned by their employers. Chapter 13 discusses the \\"Color Line\\", the segregated areas where Negroes are allowed to live at higher prices. Tenement houses do not have a locked front door (Chapter 14). A respectable tenement neighborhood has few saloons. Flowers improve tenements, so too small parks. The heat of July and August create hardship and death for children. Newer buildings with proper sanitation had lower mortality rates. Death from starvation was common. Poverty created madness. Chapter 15 describes \\"The Problem of the Children\\" and what needs to be done to save them.The abandoned children put in the Foundling Asylum do not last long (Chapter 16). The Sisters of Charity have a good record. Worst of all are the \\"baby farms\\". Chapter 17 tells of the \\"Street Arabs\\", homeless boys who live on the street due to poverty at home. The Children's Aid Society provide good housing and character. Trade schools educate the older boys. There are about ten saloons to every church (Chapter 18). Gangs are endemic to New York (Chapter 19). They can terrorize a neighborhood. People walking the street could be robbed, such as a stranger asking for directions. Their \\"social clubs\\" often use blackmail. Chapter 20 tells of the oppression experienced by working girls in NY from low wages. Chapter 21 is about \\"Pauperism\\", families and individuals who applied for relief. Riis suggested setting up a labor bureau to match workers to jobs. Chapter 22 tells about the \\"Wrecks\\" in the workhouse, the almshouse (some are old people abandoned by their children), and the lunatic asylum. The worst tenements do not look bad; they are not old enough (Chapter 23). Chapter 24 tells what has been done to solve tenement-house problems. Chapter 25 lists what can be done with modern tenement-houses. Riis suggested tax rebates or licensing to regulate tenements."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"The overall presentation of the book is fine.

He finds himself stunned and appalled that we as a people could allow our compatriots to live in such squalor. At the same time he drags out all of the tired stereotypes of the day about the different ethnic groups then living in the city (mostly: Jewish, Irish and Italian).Riis' upper-class lifestyle and upbringing are apparent throughout the book, and some of the passages would offend many of our sensibilities today, but the general point of the book is what's important here. The upper-class lives in comfortable ignorance while a significant number of Americans have to wonder where their next meal is coming from and what they'd do should they, god forbid, fall ill.A good book if you're looking for a more modern perspective on this problem is Barbra Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed.\\""},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I had to chose a book to read for my AP History Class, and I thouhgt this book would be very interesting; and it was.

You can almost smell the stench and see the depravity of life in the black and white photographs. Even with light, there is darkness in those photographs. The residents are trying to have a better life in their new country but they soon realized how merciless and unforgiving life can be in a foreign land.While Riis's writings have some obvious prejudice and stereotypes, it is consistent to the times of the 1890s. Despite his own prejudices, he is obviously aware of the grim situation in the tenements. The overcrowding, the poverty, crime, lack of basic human necessities, poor working conditions, and the corruption is studied here thoroughly.This book is a must read for those readers interested in the time period as well as the impact of this book's reaction and action to make amends."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I recently read How the... in an effort to assist a tutee of mine who had been assigned the book as a summer read.

The evidence that supports that conclusion is embedded in his book, now a classic of muck-raking and a key player in the history of social reform in America. The fascinating thing was the reformers were fought tooth and nail not only by the slum landlords but by the poor themselves. That is just one of many items that make this story compelling reading, especially in view of the official facts and figures displayed and the pictures that go with those facts and figures. Wow! 27 people living in a room with two beds. 28,000 babies abandoned to the Sisters of Charity crib in one year. Massive deaths of children from, of all things, measles. The most common diagnosis made by the Summer Doctors (a corps of physicians from the New York City Department of Health) was \\"improper nourishment\\", none other than our malnutrition, but translated to that place and time meaning starvation. And yet milk was 2 cents a quart, a meal of soup, meat stew, bread, vegetables, and a stein of beer cost 13 cents. Add a cigar and another beer and it's 15 cents. Hence, the poor could have survived on minimal amounts of money, which, unfortunately, they did not have. The past is a different country said LP Hartley. He was right. They did things differently there. A word of caution: Riis in his zeal does protest too much. Some of the pictures are doctored to look worse than the reality. Many pictures are posed and probably paid for. Look at the one on the cover. The boy on the left is awake and smirking. The ash on his right shoulder has been sprinkled there for effect. The boy in the middle is not sleeping either as it is impossible to sleep with your head balanced on your fist like that. Why would he do that anyway when he could rest his head normally like the rest of us? He is posed and in that position so that Riis can get all three boys in the picture. Another example of hyperbole: On page 54 we are told that the child's temperature is 115 F. That is medically impossible as human enzymes and cellular energy systems stop working at 110. By the time a temperature reaches 110, the patient is dead, has to be dead. 115 is possible if and only if they are on fire or heated by a source outside their body and then they still would be dead. As has been pointed out many times, Riis displays remarkable personal and cultural prejudices. His main fault is over generalization based on the assumption that every Jew is alike, every Irishman the same. Not every Italian is a gambler. Nor is every Irishman a drunk. Some Chinese do not smoke opium and at least some Jews are not misers. Because a person is not Christian doesn't automatically make them immoral as Riis would have us believe. Yes, the author has many faults. But most of them in this historical context are trivial. The results of his work are not trivial and speak for themselves: massive reform of wages, hours of work, living conditions, sanitation, social and personal hygiene, Public Health, and most importantly, public supervision of private greed and public modification of private greed by law."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Although this book, How the Other Half Lives, was originally published in 1890 the images created still haunt the reader today because we sense that much has not changed in the last one hundred years.The author, Jacob Riis was born in 1849 in Denmark, the third of fifteen children. His family was poor, but respectable. (Riis, xiv) For economic reasons, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States. Quickly running out of money, he was forced to take odd jobs, sleep in doorways and accept handouts for food. Eventually finding employment as a journalist, Riis developed his own style of writing. He violated traditional newspaper style by \\"inserting editorial commentary into his stories.\\" (Riis, xvi) This style became known as muckraking.In his writings, Riis focused on issues of housing reform. He found that merely describing the conditions with words was not convincing enough, so he began to use photography. In the Introduction to the book, Luc Sante reports that Riis' \\"flash awoke sleepers and momentarily blinded drinkers and workers and nursing mothers, pinning them in their surroundings and shocking them into submission to the lens.\\" (Riis, xvii)As an immigrant, Riis knew first hand what it was like to live in poverty. When he was younger, out of money and unable to find steady employment, he often spent the night in police station lodging houses to escape from the cold. This book explores the living conditions of the American immigrant in the tenements of New York City. Riis' writing is full of the sights and sounds of the forgotten or ignored people living in the Lower East Side.This writing is unique in that it takes you directly into the tenements. The reader's skin crawls from the thought of the filth, the nose wrinkles from the imagined smells and the feeling of darkness hangs like a cloud from the first page until the last. Rather than providing us with a list of impersonal statistics, Riis gives us a glimpse into the lives of human beings. The reader experiences the sights and sounds of even the most austere little room shared by what seems like multitudes of people. The pictures verify the human condition that Riis describes.Riis writes as if he were talking to the reader as they were walking down the streets and alleys of the tenements. \\"Take a look into this Roosevelt Street alley; just about one step wide, with a five-story house on one side that gets its air and light - God help us for pitiful mockery! - from this slit between the walls,\\" he writes. (Riis, 35)Throughout the book Riis mentions the lack of sunlight, lack of clean air and filth that are part of the everyday lives of those living in the tenements. But, \\"when the sun shines the entire population seeks the street, carrying on its household work, its bargaining, its lovemaking on street or sidewalk, or idling there when it has nothing better to do.\\" (Riis, 47) Unfortunately these rays of sunshine are not often found in Riis' description of life in the tenements.Riis blames the tenement problem on both the rich and the poor. He writes \\"...the vilest and worst tenement property to be found anywhere, stood associated...with the name of an honored family, one of the \`oldest and best', rich in possessions and in influence.\\" (Riis, 53) The rich oppressed the immigrants through high rents, preventing them from climbing the social ladder.But Riis also blames the poor for their plight. He was troubled by the fact that many did not make an effort to learn English and other skills necessary in America. Riis attempts to hold these immigrants to the standards he held for himself. He believed that it was important for immigrants to engage in business and to assimilate into their new surroundings. Riis did not appreciate immigrants who insisted on holding onto their traditional language and culture.Riis walks the reader through the different sections of the tenement, describing the various ethnic groups with his unique editorial commentary: the Italians, Chinese, Jews, Bohemians, Blacks and Arabs. The descriptions are not what the reader would consider politically correct in this day and age. According to Riis he is being candid and reporting what he observes, but these comments are no longer acceptable, regardless of the intent.Riis also describes the plight of children. According to him, many of the children have been put out on the streets by their families who are no longer able to support them. Riis takes the readers into the ten-cent lodging houses where the children often sleep and are introduced to a life of crime, prostitution and drugs as they fall victim to those ready to take advantage of their lack of funds and family support.This book was written and published to garner public support. It accomplished the goal. According to Luc Sante, in his introduction, Riis' book had an immediate impact and reform was undertaken to improve the conditions of the poor in New York City. How the Other Half Lives was instrumental in shining the light on the tenements so that the upper and middle class could no longer ignore the plight of the poor and pretend they did not exist. The book also brought to light the effects the tenement and sweatshop owners were having on these oppressed people.As Riis takes the reader on this journey, which covers a period of time, he tells the readers of the changes that are being made. He mentions the parks that have been built, buildings that have been torn down and replaced by new buildings that have better designs, and the enactment of child-labor laws. Specifically, during the time of Riis' writing the airshaft was introduced into the design of the tenement. This allowed for air to circulate in the buildings, lowering the spread of disease. Through this book the reader actually senses the evolution of the tenement.One can't help but wonder that if Riis were walking the streets of New York City or another major city in America today, if he wouldn't be just as discouraged with what he would still find to write about and photograph. Unfortunately even the sweatshop is still a deplorable condition for immigrants one hundred years later. Fortunately, we still have journalists who are concerned enough to shed light on these conditions and continue to bring the plight of the poor and homeless to the attention of the middle and upper class, lest they be forgotten again."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"How did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers (and great-great, I suppose) survive immigration and the slums? What was life like on the Lower East Side of New York? For those of us whose family has only been in the US for a few generations, this is a must-read. Whether Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese or Polish, German, Russian, hordes of refugees ended up in New York on the promise of a better life.Reading Riis' book reads like the newspaper in some ways; entrepreneurs lured poor people from Eastern Europe and contracted out their labor in sweat shops in the US. Sound familiar? But what is not so familiar are the living conditions in the tenements, dark, unventilated cages in blocks of buildings that rented for a surprising high rent to people who died by the thousands in the unsanitary conditions. Farm animals had it better. Why was rent so high? Supply and demand. Cheaper rent was to be had in Brooklyn and the outlying (as yet unincorporated) boroughs, but the WORK was in Manhattan, where you could get by as a tailor, a seamstress, a peddler or in some illegitimate activity.The conditions will make you cry; the story of foundling babies (abandoned newborns) is astonishing. A cradle was put outside a Catholic Church and instead of a baby each night, racks of babies appeared. The Church had to establish foundling hospitals run by nuns, who persuaded the unwed or impoverished mothers to nurse the baby they gave up, plus another baby (women can usually nurse two, though these malnourished women must have been hard-pressed.) The child mortality rate, especially in the \\"back tenements\\" or buildings built on to the back of others (dark and airless) was incredible.I wish the plates in the book were of better quality; Riis took many photographs, but the reproduction here is poor and they are hard to see. I recommend that if you are interested in this subject from seeing \\"The Gangs of New York\\" or for genealogical reasons, that you visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself.

And this new genre, like the first movies and radio programs, fascinated its audience. Riis' sharp essays are matched only by his sharp eye for photography. I don't know which made more of an impact on me: the text or the pictures of unspeakable misery. But I think it's a safe bet to say that Riis' contemporaries were fixated more on the photographs. (After all, Riis turned to photography AFTER his published essays seemed to have little effect.) In any event, the result, then as now, is a provocative, compassionate, and angry work that exposed to the middle and upper classes of his time the effects of their indifference, at best, or the effects of their roles as slumlords and sweatshop owners, at worst.The only jarring aspect of the book is Riis' use of ethnic stereotyping. He makes several not-nice remarks about Jews, Chinamen, Italians, etc. However, we must not impose our early 21st Century values on a late 19th Century man. These types of remarks were commonplace back in the pre-politically correct times. In any event, Riis' overall intention was to help these people get out of their horrid conditions and not to slur their heritages.One last note, Luc Sante's introduction is brilliant and serves the book very well.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a Novel"},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"This is an extremely important work that is often difficult to find at local libraries.

He used his writing and photography to publicize the lifestyles of the lower classes in New York City in the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. In How the Other Half Lives, Riis described the inherent injustices and terrible living conditions of New York City tenements. He exposed the public to the evils of tenement life, portraying New York City living conditions of the lower classes for what they truly were. He successfully accomplished his goal of attracting attention to a dire situation.Riis wrote How the Other Half Lives to evoke sympathy to awaken the masses to the poverty in their backyards. Through his writings and photographs Riis knew people would become aware and respond to the living conditions in New York slums. Tenements were large buildings that overflowed with families living under miserable conditions. People representing many different nationalities lived in New York City tenements, and the population of immigrants grew incredibly during this time of emigration. It quickly became the most heterogeneous city in the country, and the different Europeans lived together under terrible conditions. Some immigrant groups of the same nationality lived in small separate communities together. Most settled on the East Side of New York, where the New York aristocracy had lived. The contrast between the days when the aristocracy lived on the East Side and when the immigrants moved there is quite apparent.Jacob Riis stated, &quot;Homes had ceased to be sufficiently separate, decent, and desirable to afford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and family.&quot; Tenements were overcrowded, dark, and unsanitary. Riis felt nobody should live in these conditions, and he called people to recognize the horrors of immigrant life. The homes of these immigrants were described in this way, &quot;Large rooms were partitioned into several smaller ones, without regard to light or ventilation, the rate of rent being lower in proportion to space or height from the street; and they soon became filled from cellar to garret with a class of tenantry living from hand to mouth, loose in morals, improvident in habits, degraded, and squalid as beggary itself.&quot; One of Riis's photographs, &quot;In Poverty Gap, West Twenty-Fourth Street An English Coal Heaver's Home&quot; depicts a typical poor immigrant family who obviously had very little materially and lived in a dilapidated tenement. The family seems very hardened in emotion, as if they are not even real. The combination of poignant quotes and photographs such as these led people to challenge the status quo.One of Riis's major tasks was to distinguish the difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; of New York City by comparing the immigrants with the few rich. There was very little social mobility for tenement immigrants, who made up the majority of the population. He appealed to the consciousness of the rich by saying, &quot;As business increased, and the city grew with rapid strides, the necessities of the poor became the opportunity of their wealthier neighbors.&quot; This points out the exploitation of immigrants by the wealthy class that Riis felt existed. No matter how hard they worked, there seemed to be no way out for the immigrants. &quot;Knee Pants at Forty-Five Cents a Dozen - a Ludlow Street Sweater's Shop&quot; is a photograph that shows an entire family working diligently in their confined tenement. This illustrates that there was no hope for immigrant families; they kept working but reaped no benefits. Riis blamed the tenement living conditions for the crimes and unethical behavior he saw among the immigrants. He blamed their poor standard of living for the abundance of crime and other abuses in immigrant neighborhoods. &quot;A Downtown Morgue&quot; presents us with drinking, one of the vices of the immigrants, but implies that they had nothing to encourage them to stay away from it. The photograph also reinforces the poverty and hopelessness, suggesting the immigrants had nothing to live for so they wasted their lives away on alcohol. Riis took a special interest in children because he saw them as innocent people who had become so jaded by their surroundings that they became criminals. &quot;Prayer Time in the Nursery, Five Points House of Industry&quot; portrays young children praying, probably indicating Riis's dream that all children would be set on the right path and stay there throughout their lives.A major criticism to Riis's work is that he was prejudiced and writing from a biased point of view. Riis reflected the view of the upper classes toward the immigrants and poorer classes, and readers can pick up on this through the biases in his work. He could not fully understand the plight of the people he studied because he was not one of them. Riis used terms that were crude and unflattering to the nationalities of those whom he was describing. He describes the &quot;Chinaman&quot; in the following way, &quot;Ages of senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship, have left him without the essential qualities for appreciating the gentle teachings of a faith whose motive and unselfish spirit are alike beyond his grasp.&quot; He also referred to the Chinese as a &quot;terrible menace to society&quot; because of their marijuana smoking. Riis wrote that &quot;lower class&quot; Italians were foreign, different, and therefore separate from others. Other examples of vivid language Riis used were, &quot;the tramps, peddlers, hags, rude swains, and the really pretty girls.&quot; Since he was an outsider due to his class, he could not possibly relate to the people he was describing."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"\\"The business of housing the poor, if it is to amount to anything, must be business, as it was business with our fathers to put them where they are. As charity, pastime, or fad, it will miserably fail, always and everywhere\\" (p. 201). Jacob A. Riis, in his book, How the Other Half Lives, vividly describes the human condition of the tenements of New York during the late 1800's. The author provides not only a physical description of the tenement buildings but delves deeper into the people who live there and why they don't leave the pits of filth and despair.Jacob Riis, presents a compelling account of the intricate business of managing the slums of New York and maintaining the status quo among the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to America to seek a new and prosperous life. After arriving they found they were trapped in a life of high rents and low wages with little hope for improvement of their circumstances. What little help was available seemed to be in the form of charity that couldn't sustain the prideful immigrants desire to succeed in this country.The reader is taken on a tour of the slums and introduced to the groups of immigrants nationality by nationality and given a full account of the author's stereotypical ideas about their good and bad points. Of the Italian Riis says he only spends time indoors when it's raining or he is sick. When the sun shines the entire population seeks the streets carrying on all facets of life (p. 47). He further says the Italian is a born gambler (p 44) and learns slowly, if at all (p. 42) so that his job of working the ash carts is simply suited for him. On the positive side Riis says the Italian is as honest as he is hot-headed (p. 45).The Chinese are a stealth and secretive group with all activities going on behind closed doors (p75). They are also attributed with stealing the women of the white man and leading them into the grip of opium giving them up only to the Charity Hospital or the Potter's Field (p76). On the positive side the Chinese are noted for their scrupulous neatness (p 78).The Bohemians are an honest group but rumored as being anarchists. They are fond of beer and will live at the highest means available thus they have nothing saved for a rainy day (105). He is caught in a tough position of working for poor wages and facing rising rents with no way out. For if he rebels against low wages and high rent he loses his home and job; the two are connected as cigar making takes place in the home utilizing supplies provided by the landlords.To the Jews money is their God and they work in the tenements crowding the area of Ludlow Street more densely than the crowding of Old London (p 83). They are suited to baking as bread is cheap and their love of money and the saving of it is suited to eating bread. They are also known for their work in the clothing industry. Of the Blacks, Riis stereotypes them as cleaner and better tenants but none-the-less they pay higher rents for no one else will live in a tenement after the black man has. While much of the reading is based on the stereotypes formed by the author it still provides a vivid picture of the human condition including the live's of tramps in stale beer dives and the thugs who cause fear and trouble in the streets. Both tramps and toughs profess that the world owes them a living (p64). The author also relates the degree to which the upper class try to distort the reality of life in the tenements, classifying starvation as \\"improper nourishment\\". In one case starvation led one poor man to thoughts of murdering his own children. In his madness he had only one conscious thought: that the town should not take the children. \\"Better that I take care of them myself ,\\" he repeated to himself as he ground the axe to an edge.(p 127).Due to this book, Riis was able to draw public attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City, and to insist on reform. The reforms he recommended were largely undertaken, although it was a very gradual process (p. ix). This may be partially attributed to political factors relating to the fact that political contests were won in the areas with the fully packed lodging houses (p 71). With this writing Riis does not allow the world to forget easily, what it does not like to remember (p196)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Riis's work is an amazing picture of life in the New York slums. While the text in itself is quite interesting, the photos are perhaps the most gripping aspect of the book. To see the tiny, crowded rooms populated by unreal numbers of people and the eyes of hungry children that stare out of the picture and are still imploring a century later is a powerful experience; Riis's book allows one to get very close to the misery these people felt. This book is not for the soft-hearted, as it is a very grim depection of life, such as it was for these immigrants."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Jacob Riis' first and most influential book, How the Other Half Lives details the lives of the impoverished of New York City's slums at the end of the 19th century. His expose was highly influential and brought about a number of reforms within the City, yet the tome is filled with almost comical stereotypes and prejudices about the various races and cultures found within the domain of the tenements, sidestreets and alleyways that the poor called, for lack of a better word, home. Despite this massive shortcoming (a sign of the times Riis lived in), Other Half is an engaging read and showcases the severe plight too many endured during this period in history, moreso than the most depressingly dour of Dickensian prose."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Few books in American history have had the social impact that Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives had. Riis spent years crawling through the slums of New York's Lower East Side in the later half of the nineteenth-century, always with a local guide sympathetic to his cause. He hoped, through the evolving technological advances of photography and his published, emotional plea, to rouse the well-to-do citizens of New York into helping the millions of poor and impoverished, native and immigrant alike, which continued to swell the city's population. In order for them to have had the chance of becoming productive American citizens, they must first have been given the opportunity at a fair start, which the abject state of the tenement buildings were unable to provide.The first problem was the tenement itself. Usually a building, four to six stories high, intended for the occupancy of just a few families, soon had over a hundred people packed into every nook that could fill a human body. Most interior rooms never saw the light of day. Fresh air was a rare commodity, leaving most residents to breathe the same stale air day and night. The maze of tight, blind passageways created to fit each family made it impossible for firemen to reach helpless victims trapped on the upper floors, compounded by the fact that most fire escapes were blocked with residents' furniture, trapping more even still. Overall, the filth of the structures proved most offensive to the senses. One such building was so dubbed the \\"Dirty Spoon\\" because the grime on the walls had effectively made it fire proof (Riis 30). Rear tenements, built in empty courts behind the street buildings, were usually worse, little more than dilapidated hovels cut off from light by the surrounding structures.Despite this vision of abject poverty, and indeed starvation was prevalent, many in the tenements were not what would have been considered poor. Some, in fact, earned a decently living for the era. So why didn't they move? The real question to be asked is, to where would they move? Tenement houses were the norm in New York, each as good (or lousy) as the next. Additionally, the rents paid by most of these residents (especially blacks) were very high, often amounting to more than a week's wage. Only the abundantly wealthy could afford better, while the middle and lower classes were left to the stink of places like \\"The Bend\\" on Mulberry Street, which Riis considers the heart of slum depravity.Predictably, these conditions bred all types of criminal activity. Faced with constant hunger and only the streets to call home, many resorted to gang violence or controlled substance dependency. Children, who sometimes never saw beyond their squalid block, with a family that could not provide for their basic needs, soon created gangs of their own, making their way as they could. Other children toiled with their families in the sweatshops, for which the tenements were the main housing. Perhaps the most regrettable victims of the tenements were the infants, who were regularly victims of abandonment, left on wealthy doorsteps with vain hopes by desperate parents, or given up to \\"Baby-farms\\" where they were left to starve to death (Riis 148). These conditions Riis blames squarely on tenements: \\"The product is our own\\" (Riis 171).However, all hope was not lost to Riis. Already airshafts had been implemented in new building designs to allow ventilation (to what effect can be debated) and new windows punched into walls, so that \\"air and sunlight\\" could \\"have a legal claim\\" (Riis 211). Rear tenements, too, were quickly disappearing. He felt that by writing How the Other Half Lives, the wealthy and influential of the city would come to the aid (Riis 131). In this respect he was correct, when through his book he found an ally in Theodore Roosevelt, who began implementing many of the suggestions that Riis proposed. He urged people to look beyond the building facades (which were admittedly nice on some buildings) to the teeming filth that they masked (Riis 209). Perhaps the most intimidating argument for his more fortunate peers was the possibility of spreading disease, for to him public sentiment had \\"slumbered peacefully until... a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door\\" (Riis 212). He called for laws to be imposed against the current tenement conditions, for the buildings to be renovated or new \\"model tenements\\" built in their place (Riis 223). Likewise, tenants should have received the quality accommodations their high rents were entitling them to. Riis endorsed the park system (City-Beautiful influence?) as a way of relieving crime in congested districts, for reasons such as this elegant observation: \\"I have seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than a policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle appeal\\" (Riis 138). Children, Riis felt, were the \\"key\\" to rescuing the city from poverty and corruption (Riis 143).The other contribution for which Riis has been immortalized, and no doubt thanked repeatedly by modern historians, is the treasure trove of photos he took while on his outings, one hundred of which are found in the Dover edition. (His original publication did not include the photos for technological reasons). The impact of the strikingly bleak images caught on film far outweighs any of the emotional condemnations he wrote. The reader, thankfully, is also treated to many of the stories behind these images, adding yet another dimension, such as the young paupers on page 157 who claimed that they \\"Didn't live nowhere.\\" Another, probably unintentional, effective element to the photos is the pained grimace on many faces (like the \\"Street Arab\\" on page 152), as though they are writhing in agony from hunger, although it is no doubt just a reaction from the camera's blinding flash in dark quarters. The street dwellers and criminals, even those presumably embarrassed by their situations, seem willing to have their pictures taken. Perhaps it is the only such opportunity many had.Despite Riis's commendable crusading and fight for the underprivileged, he was still in many ways a man of his time. The modern reader cannot help but be struck by the prejudices running through his commentary. The groups that receive the most of the brunt are the Italians and Polish Jews. The Chinese also pay a price for their differences, and Riis tells us that his \\"senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship\\" have made nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused\\" (Riis 77) and speaks of opium addiction as a form of white slavery (Riis 80). At least he commends them for being clean. Surprisingly, however, he looks fondly on African-Americans (along with Bohemians), who he treats with sympathetic respect. He sees their hardships, and the causes (ironically), that \\"the blame is born by prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" under those circumstances. That after only twenty-five years of freedom, he \\"may be seen to advance much farther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, with fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned fellow-citizens\\" (Riis 119). When he wished, it seems, Riis was quite able to see beyond differences.Riis, through How the Other Half Lives, awakened a society that had once turned a blind eye to the hardships prevalent in the tenements. He showed them effectively that the struggle was not theirs alone, but that its reach was felt for many miles in ways not readily apparent. His photographic images, forever capturing the lowest moments in people's lives, begged for intervention. Whatever Riis's shortcomings, future generations in New York and cities around the country would be better off because of what he did, and benefit from the experiences of those who did not live long enough to see those changes occur. Unfortunately, the images in Riis's work are still a common sight in many developing countries, making his century-old ideas of relevant, present power."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I used this book along with another Riis book for a U.S. History project at school. Both this book and Low Life were an incredible help. The pictures are incredible. Riis was the first to show this side of life in NYC during the first part of the century. His books are by far the best pictoral records of the time. I highly recomend this book for anyone interested in the early part of the century or anyone who needs information for school projects."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"In How the Other Half Lives (originally published in 1890), Jacob Riis gives an astounding account of 19th century life in the tenements of New York City, where poverty, filth, disease, alcoholism, theft, and darkness prevail. Through his writing, statistics, and photography, Riis draws attention to unthinkable living conditions ignored too long by those better off than the tenants occupying New York's slums.In Luc Sante's introduction to the book, he summarizes Riis' view as, \\"the poor were victims rather than makers of their fate\\" (Riis, 1997). How this rings true as one reads through the pages. Riis gives the reader a better understanding of why generations of tenement occupants are trapped in a rut of constant strife and struggle, without education or means to rise above. The dense immigrant population of New York's tenements led to a very limited and low-paying job market, typically that of sweatshop labor. With the problems of the tenements came saloons, gangs, thieves, orphaned babies and other societal issues. The conditions of the tenements expanded the divide between New York's classes of citizens.Many of New York City's poor worked from dusk till midnight daily, only to earn starving wages which barely allowed them to feed and clothe their families or pay overpriced rent to wealthy landlords. Their circumstances did not afford them time for learning, particularly the English language. Without learning, financial savings, or often a job, these impoverished families could not escape the tenement properties and their resulting miserable way of life. Riis describes it best as \\"the poor are what the tenements have made them\\" (Riis, 1997).Riis provides several proven recommendations for improving New York's poverty situation caused by the tenements such as remodeling or building new tenements and instituting \\"fair play between landlord and tenant\\" (1997). He cites a few examples of landlords who reformed their properties and worked collaboratively with their tenants to successfully improve their lives.Riis' answer to the problems of the tenements is \\"all a matter of education,\\" education of landlords, of tenant families, of the public and elite, and of politicians (1997). In a more uplifting chapter, Riis describes a successful rescue program through the Children's Aid Society which instilled self-help and effectively educated young, troubled boys, the \\"Street Arabs.\\" Many of these young boys (and girls in other Children's Aid Society programs) learned trades and skills that would help them overcome the entrapping cycle of poverty.By writing this book, Riis played a major role in his plight for education about and of the tenements. According to Sante's introduction, Riis was successful in changing the status and structure of the tenements through publication of How the Other Half Lives. Riis concludes, \\"I know of but one bridge that will carry us over safe, a bridge founded upon justice and built of human hearts (1997).\\"Although this book was written during the industrialization period in the late 1890's to address issues faced by victims of New York's tenements, much of it is still applicable to the cycle of poverty still prevalent in America today, in the 21st century. As Riis believed, education plays an important part of breaking this cycle and closing the gap between the rich and poor. Benjamin Franklin, writing a century before Riis' time that education should not be a privilege only for the elite, would have agreed with his value of education as a resolution for tenement poverty (Isaacson, 2003).This book opened my eyes to just how cyclical poverty is. It can be a downward spiral for many generations. Any one interested in having a better understanding of poverty, especially of immigrants or the uneducated, should read How the Other Half Lives. I have a greater appreciation for the opportunities and fortune many of us have. Riis has inspired me to further my contributions toward education. In support of Franklin and Riis' values of education, I think the opportunity of education should be available for all to help break this cycle. I think Riis is right...until the bridge of justice built of human hearts he speaks of is fully constructed, situations of poverty will continue.ReferencesIsaacson, W. (2003).

This book serves as a Historical context of the conditions of early American immigrants. Riis is a perfect candidate to write this novel because he knows what it is like to be an immigrant, and live in poverty. Riis was the third of Fifteen children and emigrated to the U.S. in 1870. According to his biography on http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAriis.htmRiis \\"was often forced to spend the night in police station lodging houses.\\" due to lack of money. It was not until three years later that Riis found work inside a news bureau.Prehaps because Riis was able to escape proverty, he was easy to critic those that give up with out putting up a fight. Riis clearly blames the slum tenement problem on both the rich and the poor through his harsh racial comments. The rich oppresses the immigrants through high rents to prevent them from moving up in the social ladder while most of the poor do no make an effort to learn English and other skills to survive in America.This is a good book to have but it's not a very relaxing book to read. Most of the pictures are not very high quality, considering the time period it was taken, but it really does not do justice to that era. I also find Riis's writing style very dull and lengthy. (I guess some call that poetic)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I'm in agreement with other reviewers on the terrible quality of this edition!

The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s. He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart. Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \\"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \\"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \\"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\\"How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem. \\"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \\"education\\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \\"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\\" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity. \\"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards, Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City\`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"I needed to buy this book for school, and decided to get the kindle edition because it was cheaper.

First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid. \\"To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them\\" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities. \\"As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business.\\" (Riis, p. 21) Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well.The next theme to emerge was that of work. In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women \\"kept house\\" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys. \\"The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows.\\" (Riis, p. 49) Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people. \\"Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job. They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their \`hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed. If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent. The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits.\\" (Riis, p 94)Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements. \\"Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death.\\" (Riis, p. xvii) People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate. The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader. And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today. It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity. Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down. \\"The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements., In many ways, as in the \`College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives.\\" (Riis, p. 207) Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless. \\"The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers. It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme.\\" (Riis, p. 205)Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section. Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements. The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work. Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house. \\"Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights. Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work.\\" (Riis, p. 105) But how did people in this situation become educated to work? \\"The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements. Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered. In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him. Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him. Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals. Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways.\\" (Riis, p. 136)Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader. In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place. Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response. Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told. For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy. The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements. \\"Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own.\\" (Riis, p. xiii)I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people. He very much accomplished his purpose. By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this. Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination. The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended. The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving.The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world. The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults. I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need. When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action. I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard. This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"Yes, the stories in this book are depressing. Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so. And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions. Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"No one should download this version to their Kindle because it is a complete mess.

(1997). How the Other Half Lives. New York: PenguinIn the distance, the Statue of Liberty echoes the refrain--Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses. This invitation was extended to millions of immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. Men, women, and children of varying nationalities and ethnicities made the journey to America. Consequently, they sought freedom from oppression and new opportunity in the land of plenty. However, the promises of a better life often proved unrealistic. In the late 19th century, a news writer, Jacob Riis investigated and exposed the slums of New York City. In his book, How the Other Half Lives, author Jacob Riis explores New York City's underclass. Furthermore, the graphic portrayal of the worst that life offers begins and ends with a shocking tour of the slums of New York City.Consequently, before starting on a journey through the slums of the Lower East Side of New York City, Riis reminds the reader of the cold, hard truth; the poor will always be with us (Intro-xi). However, the express intention of the author is to reveal the horrendous living conditions of the poor to public attention. The journey begins with visits to tenements. Multi-story, poorly constructed buildings crowd lots. Ethnic groups, with their idiosyncratic characteristics, specifically the Jews, Italians, Irish, Bohemians, Blacks, and Chinese, exist in the squalid, intensely overcrowded, disease ridden, poorly ventilated firetraps. Examples of the living conditions include statistics citing the world's greatest concentration of humans per square mile, an alarming death rate among young children, and the frequent deaths of men and specifically women and children in fires, where there is little chance for escape.Additionally, further trepidations are evident in the lives of the masses of humanity. In the street and alleys of the Bend, the tramps; the skulks of the slums, unclean beasts of dishonest idleness, certify their presence as the dregs of society (46). Moral depravity becomes evident as opium is constantly abused, the evils of rum disenfranchise the slum dweller, and stale beer dives appeal to the prurient interests of the frugally immoral.In addition, the color line in New York City is highlighted by the prejudice of landlords as they bilk the black man out of his hard earned wages. Furthermore, the criminality perpetrated by the gangs infects the slum with fear and lawlessness. Other crimes tear at the heart, specifically, the heinous starving to death of babies. Also, women are disadvantaged at a young age for their propensity to work for the family. They walk a fine line between the rigors of work and the temptations of selling their very body for gain. In all, the journey through the desolation of the slums is not for the faint of heart.At the close of the book, Riis offers his assessment of steps performed to alleviate the problems in the slums. These include tentative solutions involving the wealthy classes, the landlords, and the tenants. Living conditions must be improved, despite the apathy of the wealthy classes, the exorbitant greed of the landlords or the lack of resolve and interest by the tenants. Some improvements have been made, however significant strides need accomplished. The words of Riis literally plead for a call to action and progress, the reform of a city beset with human degradation and suffering.Moreover, How the Other Half Lives, fulfills the purposes of the author. It brings to the light of the public eye, an awareness of life in the slums. By means of his vigilant journey through lives of the poor and forgotten, the stories of thousands are revealed. Additionally, the book achieved a supplementary purpose. It's achievements of muckraking, caused the book to be a forerunner of investigative journalism. Furthermore, the intent of the book is not only to expose the degradation of the slums, but to provide an impetus to appropriate action. The author excelled in touching both the heart and soul of the reader.Furthermore, Jacob Riis, in How the Other Half Lives, transmits a message of Social Reformation. This message seeks relief for the disparaging poor of the slums. Additionally, the book illustrates the disparity of value systems and a defeated spirit of self consciousness. In an 1897 paper, John Dewey, states \\"education is a regulation of a process of coming to share in the social consciousness: and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of reconstruction\\" (Dewey, 1897). The people of the slums: men, women, and children needed the advantages of educational opportunities. Jacob Riis documents the misery of the slums of New York City. Coincidentally, the poor, along with drug dealers, crack whores, the homeless, and gangs still live in the crowded slums of New York City. How do we raise the social consciousness and provide educational initiatives for the slum dwellers of today?Subsequently, the book is a must read for all manners of people. The eye opening, jaw dropping revelations of the New York City slums provoke both anguish and compassion. Yes, as we students sit sipping our second cup of cappuccino, relaxing upon a plush couch, watching our big screen television, we may enjoy reading How the Other Half Lives.ReferencesDewey, J.

That's part of it's 'charm.'The problem, though, is this specific edition--many images are left out, and the images really make the book; after all, Jacob Riis was one of the first muckraking photojournalists... wouldn't you want to see those pictures? They add incredible depth to the story. Luckily I had to read this for a class, and didn't mind it, but... for someone reading it for personal purposes, spend the few extra dollars for an edition with photographs. It is SO worth it."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"As others have noted, this book was the beginning of photojournalism, and remains an accurate but depressing look into the lives of poor New Yorkers in the early part of the 20th century.This book never fails to amaze me. I read it in college, then ordered it for someone else recently.If you have never read it - or, if you have not read it recently, give it a look.In these times when the rich are increasingly wealthier than they've been since the 19th Century - the middle class is shrinking - and the poor are becoming poorer, it is wise to look and remember how socially aware and socially responsible we must be."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"In his book, How the Other Half Lives, Jacob A. Riis gives the reader a front row view of life in the tenements of New York City at the end of the 19th century. Please consider the time period in which Riis wrote his book to put the ethnic, racial, class, and gender biases inherent in his work into the proper historical context. Personally, I found this offensive, but I aimed to not condemn the messenger without hearing the message first.Riis tells the story of millions of lives marked by never-ending hard labor, lack of adequate nourishment and housing, violence, abuse, addiction, and disease. Many of these people living in the tenements were first-generation immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy. The push/pull of migration to the United States ends in the New York tenements in a million shattered dreams. Rather than finding the land of opportunity, immigrants were exploited for their cheap labor.Despite Riis' biases as a journalist and observer, he was motivated by charity and goodwill to investigate the living conditions of the poor and expose the harsh reality to the world. By doing so, Riis intended to bring about social change. The reality of his expose is heart wrenching more than a century after its writing. Riis main thesis is an argument for changing the living conditions of the poor. He calls for improved housing and renovated neighborhoods as a means to improve the lives of the tenement dwellers. However, Riis does not directly make a call for educating the poor, but his writing brings the salient absence of education to bear and he does make note of attempts by church groups to educate the poor.Down in the Tenth Ward on Ludlow Street, Riis meets Polish and Russian Jews who manufacture clothing is sweltering, cramped tenements that serve both as home and factory to its inhabitants. In the chapter, entitled The Sweaters of Jewtown, an entire family works eighteen hours a day, in unhealthy, dangerous conditions to produce 1,440 pairs of knickerbockers for a mere $8.40 a week. Sweaters are to clothing manufacturing what slumlords are to housing. These migrants are exploited in many ways. The sweater gets a shocking low price for production because the workers, who rarely speak English, must underbid unions and other immigrant workers just to have work. The landlord, sometimes also the sweater, takes the exploitation one step further down toward hell and charges the highest rent he can, and requires the workers to purchase raw materials and tools. This is textbook exploitation of the disadvantaged. After all that, workers barely earn enough money to keep starvation at bay. The working and living conditions for families who are supported by the work of women fair far worse than families who have a male head of household due to the grotesque inequity in pay between males and females.Riis' story of the family living on Mott Street was far too common and representative of Riis' overall description of life in the tenements. The Mott Street family was worse off than the Jewish family he met on Ludlow Street mostly because they could not work. Without social welfare programs and medical care, they had no alternative but to suffer through their cruel fate. The doctor had been called because the baby was gravely ill. The diagnosis was \\"improper nourishment\\" (Riis, p. 126). In other words, the baby was dying from starvation. The father could no longer work because his hands were deformed from lead poisoning and because the family did not have medical care, an infectious eye condition had nearly blinded the children and the mother.If one is not moved by an ethical responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the poor and work to eradicate poverty, the Mott Street family demonstrates that poverty kills and is contagious; therefore, poverty is a public health issue. In a Jewish community, Riis notes that: \\"Typhus fever and small-pox are bread here, and help solve the question what to do with him.\\" (Riis, p. 85) This statement could be viewed as a rather anti-Semitic notion, but what Riis is really saying is that poverty is a matter of public health and infectious diseases pose a serious health threat. These two examples show how Riis wanted to shock the nation with the truth.While middle class boys were off to school, children in the tenements lived a hard life. Riis also tells us how poor children were exploited and abused. The story of \\"Edward Mulhearn, fourteen years old, had run away from his home in Jersey City\\" (Riis, p. 68) was not an isolated case. Edward was \\"employed\\" by a hustler who forced him to beg for money. To insure that Edward would solicit the most sympathy, thus bring in more money, he was burned with a hot iron and then acid was poured into the open wound.An entire essay could be written on the conditions of women and girls living in the tenements, but there is not time for that here. Let it suffice to say that females were at the very bottom of the social hierarchy and made the perfect victims. So were African Americans. Despite Riis' obvious racism and gender biases, he seems to have a special affinity and genuine fondness for women and African Americans. Riis recognized that the working skills that African Americans had used in the South became obsolete once they migrated to Northern urban areas and that employable skills were needed to promote the advancement of Blacks in society. He blamed bigotry and lack of education for their place in society. Riis recognizes that African Americans needed new job skills in order to gain employment. Today, call that workforce development and community education. At a time when African Americas were the receivers of a lot of racial animosity in the urbanized North, Riis points the finger at those who put the Black man and woman out of work by taking over his and her jobs and preventing entry into other jobs. \\"Even the colored barber is rapidly getting to be a thing of the past.\\" (Riis, p. 114)In the chapter entitled \\"The Street Arab,\\" Riis demonstrates the non-formal education that homeless boys received from the Children's Aid Society. The boys were allowed to help themselves and as long as they followed the rules, they could stay at the Society lodging house. This \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" attitude is evident in the largess bestowed on the street boys. A boy could be outfitted with a black boot kit to work the city streets shining shoes, but the boy has to purchase his trade tools on an installment plan. There were not any formal trades open to these poor kids or to their parents. The tenements of New York needed one of Franklin's free libraries and Junto organizations, but they first would need to be fed and taught to read and write.What ever formal or non-formal education the Society was able to offer these boys was contingent on first convincing the boys that their charity was not a \\"Sunday-school racket,\\" which is a reference to the missionary attempts to teach people to read to better serve God. This long-standing Protestant tradition was the hallmark of early American educational movements and the theoretical basis for literacy. The debate between the religious and secular virtues of education was an inheritance from Colonial times. Riis, like Benjamin Franklin over a century earlier, thought education was important to civil society, rather than a means to glorify God. Walter Isaacson notes in his masterful autobiography Benjamin Franklin: An American Life that the...\\"Great Awakeners sought to recommit America to the anguished spirituality Puritanism, whereas Franklin sought to bring it into an Enlightenment era that exalted tolerance, individual merit, civic virtue, good deeds, and rationality. (Isaacson, p. 109)Riis recognizes the futility in trying to convert people who are starving, homeless, and suffering when he writes: \\"How shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man?\\" (Riis, p.198) Riis calls for civil reformation that involves fair play in everything from controlled housing prices, opening trades and unions to the marginalized, ethical business practices, and laws that promote equal opportunities.Riis shows us that poverty and lack of education go hand in hand: it's a reciprocal process and one influences the other. This book was a hard read for me on several levels, but it is a lesson in compassion and a salient reminder of how lucky most of us truly are. Riis book show us that education was at a crisis stage in the urban U.S. in the late 19th century, and something had to give, or the nation would not survive in a changing world. I am grateful to of had the opportunity to read this book, and I would recommend it for reading to anyone interested in issues of race, class, and gender. Riis' book is a dark window into what life in an American city can be like when education is not an option. This book is of utmost importance to the social historian, child advocate, and social worker."},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"This book is a MUST for everybody who is interested in New York City and its history!It is the perfect preparation before a tour of the tenement museum!Read it!"},{"Title":"How the other half lives; studies among the tenements of New York,","review":"If you read this you'll be done and what's really sad the same game is going on today.

Its been COMPLETELY AMERICANIZED .Also simply adding a pinch of \\"garam masala\\" to american soups and italian pasta dont turn the soups into \\"authentic Indian cuisine \\"!!!! thats an insult to the readers intelligence.when I saw the title , I expected a book which would help me cook indian cuisine with the grains and greens available in the US and offer good subsitutions for many vegetables that are not widely available here. and this book completely failed in that respect. Quite a number of the recipes are hashed up new world recipes with a pinch of curry powder thrown in to make them \\"indian\\".If you are looking for a good indian cookbook with AUTHENTIC Indian recipes , this would be a bad investment.

The problems I've had with the book appear to me to be oversights or perhaps a lock of proper proof reading.For example in one receipe (sweet pea and potato curry) the potatoes need to be cooked prior to adding to the other ingredients, the author does not mention this. The other thing that bothered me was the use of unit measures, for example &quot;two tomatoes&quot; or &quot;five potatoes&quot;.

All of the ingredients I either found at the local grocery or at the Indian Spice store. I made Spinach Paneer, Fritters, and Cilantro Chutney and even my discriminating Indian husband thought it was very tasty. One thing I would like to see in the next edition is having each recipe on one page, or on facing pages. It was very difficult to cook and flip pages back and forth between ingredients and instructions--especially since I was using a cookbook holder. Good vegetarian books are difficult to find that will appeal to beginning cooks like me. I am thankful to Ms. Prasad for providing a good resource."},{"Title":"Indian Vegetarian Cooking From an American Kitchen","review":"I gave this book four stars because I expected more traditional recipes.

The latter does wonders with vegetables, believe me.That said, everything I cooked so far (spicy potato soup, mulligatawny, navrathna korma, potato and black-eyed pea curry, spinach and lentils, parathas, cilantro chapatis, etc.) has been pretty simple and tasty. I recommend it to anyone who likes vegetables and spice.

There's also a very good mix of South and North Indian foods and all recipes come with calorie counters and a breakdown (protein/carb/fat per serving).

So to say, the simple proposition that spatial sensations are elaborated in our consciousness to distillate geometric objects is worked out here and there, highlighting every time different topics of the subject which makes the book an interesting conglomerate of subtle insights about how our brain perceives and imagines the physical space and builds geometric theories. It contains also a short account of the historical development of non-euclidean geometries. (Several of the book's ideas are developed in a deeper way in the previous book \\"Analysis of the Sensations\\" by E.Mach itself).At the end of the book Mach writes an impressive paragraph:\\"But the physicist can derive in another direction substantial assistance from the labours of geometers. Our geometry refers always to objects of sensuous experience. But the moment we begin to operate with mere things of thought like atoms and molecules, which from their very nature can never be made the objects of sensuous contemplation, we are under no obligation whatever to think of them as standing in spatial relationships which are peculiar to the Euclidean three-dimensional space of our sensuous experience. This may be recommended to the special attention of thinkers who deem atomistic speculations indispensable.\\"Written about 1900, it announces the turn that physics was to get several years later. Take this example as a measure of the stature of Mach as natural philosophy thinker.If you are interested in science philosophy and physic history this is an excellent piece for your library."},{"Title":"Winning with the Trompowsky (Batsford Chess Book)","review":"Aside from being a strong opening in itself, the Trompowsky lets White avoid Black's pet Indian defenses and can be frustrating.

There's a lot of clear explanations for lower-rated players as well as enough innovative lines that even GMs will need this book to tackle the Tromp. In fact, Jeremy Silman has called this work &quot;magnificent&quot; and described it as simply the best opening text he's ever seen.A question for me remains why the opening is so under-represented in MCO 14. It's covered in about three pages.By the way, look at Wells' other opening books too: The Complete Semi-Slave and The Complete Richter-Rauzer.

The dark squares and bishop pair will usually give black a position in which he is anything but worse. Then there's also the problem with what to play against moves like 1...d5, 1...f5, 1...e6, and 1...c6. In the latter two you could transpose to e4 openings, but then why are you playing d4? And in the first two, what do you play? Either the main lines, which you're trying to avoid by playing the trompowsky, or some system like the London or Stonewall in which your opponent can just copy your moves and draw. I don't even recommend this opening as a secondary weapon, because you must have knowledge of benoni, open sicilian, and french advance structures to play the Tromp, and that's a lot of work for a surprise opening that isn't even that good."},{"Title":"Steam Detectives (Volume 1)","review":"Steam Detectives suffers from the simplicity of its stories. Although it's not quite on the Scooby Doo level of simplicity, it's not nearly far enough above it. The villains are of the masked variety, with nonsensical schemes and goals. The steampunk--high technology based on steam power--setting is interesting enough (if derivative, considering the recent wave of steampunk stories), but it's really wasted. It's not so much that the stories here are bad; rather, there just isn't enough to them.The art can either save this book or harm it. I've never been a big fan of Kia Asamiya's artwork--the noses of his characters are just too big for their faces (in length and width), and it doesn't appeal to me. Steam Detectives doesn't suffer this nearly so much as other stories (Silent Moebius, for one), but the artwork is also simpler and more stylized.

This is his translation of the &quot;Four Books&quot; and three of the &quot;Five Classics.&quot; The translations are dated, and Legge's interpretations of the texts are often old-fashioned, but these are still important and useful translations.Of the &quot;Five Classics,&quot; Legge translates the Book of Documents (a collection of historical texts), the Spring and Autumn Annals (another historical work; Legge also includes his translation of the Tso Commentary on this), and the Book of Odes. (The other two of the five are the Record of Rites and the I Ching, which Legge also translated, but which are not in this collection.) The &quot;Five Classics&quot; have been central texts of Confucianism since about the time of Christ.The &quot;Four Books&quot; are the Great Learning, the Analects of Confucius, the sayings of the later Confucian Mencius, and the Doctrine of the Mean. These texts are all quite old, but they were grouped together, and made the basis of the Confucian educational curriculum, around the 12th century A.D.Part of what makes Legge's translations so helpful is that he includes the Chinese text, along with extensive interpretive notes, introductions, and glossaries. This can be a little overwhelming for the beginner, but it's fun to have all the information in one place.One caution: This set is normally in 5 volumes. I assume that this edition has combined the 1st and 2nd volumes (the &quot;Four Books&quot;) into one volume, but it is possible that this edition does not include all that I think it does."},{"Title":"The Chinese classics;","review":"I purchased the Kindle edition of this book. Or so I thought. I have all of Legge's introductory material, but not the actual translations - which is what I thought I was paying for. It is the hamburger without the beef, Hamlet without the Prince, it is not a different way of buying the same book, but a way of buying a much shorter and less useful book."},{"Title":"Business Darwinism Evolve or Dissolve: Adaptive Strategies for the Information Age","review":"Compelling insight on the importance of technology-driven business strategy. The only book that addresses this approach in a completely comprehensive way, challenging business leaders to rethink their approach to strategy and change.

The Darwin, and other evolution analogies that the author selected, as well as the attention-grabbing timelines and events makes for an interesting read. He very nicely positions the IT importance intelligently at the center of the corporate model without overstated importance, and supports it with well-built logic as to why it works.

The author demonstrates that while thinking might be organic or hollistic, the IT organization lacks woefully behind due to its structure and the lack of generative planning that accompanies regular business chaos.The book makes a conscious effort to stop at theory and frameworks, hopefully to be continued with a plan to action and tools for the implementation in subsequent publications."},{"Title":"Business Darwinism Evolve or Dissolve: Adaptive Strategies for the Information Age","review":"IT is on the verge of becoming a commodity and an integral part of our every day life. Information is now on our finger tips. Unfortunately, most businesses still don't have good visibility to their operations. In this book, Eric makes the argumaent that all businesses, large or small, must make real-time information part of their daily decision making process. He calls this concept Information-Based Business Modeling or Information Mastery. He discusses at length how companies can leverage real-time intelligence internally as well as with their customers and partners. Marks supports his reasoning exceptionally well with many real life examples. Eric's concepts are based on many years of first hand experience in implementing IT solutions. Business executives will greatly benefit from the concepts presented in this book."},{"Title":"Business Darwinism Evolve or Dissolve: Adaptive Strategies for the Information Age","review":"This book was a great help in determining the strategy required in a business turnaround situation.

Are you predisposed to this? Did you cheat in previous relationships? Did you feel that you could always have everything? and what about the out-bursts? He says to refrain from angry out-burst, they are Love Busters. They are necessary! The betrayed spouse needs to get this stuff of his/her chest. His/her life has just been shattered into a million pieces I was very disappointed. Dr. Harley's job is to get people back together, no matter what. I would not recommend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book is very accurate in its portrayal of the causes and aftermath of an affair and offers some tools and a pathway back from a very dark place, if you chose to. A must read for all couples."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I've read several books on surviving the pain and confusion of an affair and Dr. Harley's book clearly stands out.If you or someone you know is suffering from the effects of an affair, I highly encourage you to get this book for them.This book helped my wife and I significantly."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This is an excellent, very practical book designed to help you end an affair and rebuild your marriage. The authors are very experienced marriage counselors who believe that you can follow their guidelines and stay in your marriage.There is an explanation of their concept of the &quot;Love Bank&quot; into which you can deposit or withdraw &quot;love units&quot; as you meet or fail to meet your partner's emotional needs. These emotional needsare also explored. Finally, the book focuses on marital recovery and the steps needed to accomplish &quot;an integrated lifestyle that guarantees mutual love...&quot; I recommend this book to both couples and therapists. To learn more about this and other books by these authors, you can visit Dr.Harley's web site."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I didn't think it was possible for me to ever begin to trust my husband again, and then I read this book. This book illustrates that by commiting to and applying some common-sense rules, there is hope for relationship repair and even growth. The examples used from the author's experience and practice are amazing, and served to keep me engaged and reading through to the practical part. I found many ideas helpful, especially the concept that men and women, although they will list similar top 10 needs, usually pick a different top 5. This book makes sense and helps you to pick up and actually do something for yourself and for your relationship in the face of the overwhelming emotions you experience when your spouse has an affair."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I found this book a year after discovering my husband had an affair. We were well on our way to healing at that time, but I wish I had had this book to help me through the first year. The affair was the most devastating thing that ever happened to me. And the only area of the book I question is the presumed guilt of the innocent spouse. At the time of his affair (and before), I was working extremely hard at the marriage and if anyone had an excuse to have an affair (based on needs) it would have been me!! Regardless though, this book has been a great stimulous to help me HELP HIM see the pitfalls that caused the problems in our marriage and how we can work at avoiding them in the future. I recommend this book to anyone facing the same situation or who has a friend in that situation."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Harley has a firm stance on making marriages last at all costs. Sometimes the memories can be so haunting that it may be best to move on. There are several points in the book where he tells one member of the couple what to do. This is in opposition to most (individual) counseling sessions where self exploration is key, and where the client ultimately determines what they should do. I think there are some good points in the book, and it's a quick simple read. I also don't particularly like that his theories are not backed by research. It seems like he is pulling the four rules to marital recovery out of thin air just because they may sound like they work. I recently purchased His Needs, Her needs by Harley to get a better understanding of his style but after reading this book I'm not looking forward to reading that one. Overall this book is 2 stars and I would recommend it. I hope to find better books on this subject."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"After experiencing being on the side of being cheated on 4 times I finally got wise and decided to try and learn how to do it right. I read His Needs/Her Needs 13 years earlier before we were married and understood we needed to meet each others needs but what this book did is bring into perspective how the human heart works and how easily it can be swayed if appropriate boundaries are not in place. This book helped me to understand how I had been depleting my wifes love bank through love busters and not understanding her needs and how to meet them the way that was most fulfilling to her. The only thing that really saved our relationship was both of us being willing to work at implementing the tools taught in the book and learning to express our feelings not thoughts to each other. We followed Dr. Harley's advice as best we could and over 2 year period learned to stop love bustering and continue to learn how best to meet each others needs. We still stumble but are ready to admit, say we are sorry and provide forgiveness, and with that, we no longer drag around the heavy anchors we see so many couples continue to struggle with."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I recently believed that my spouse was having an affair. I came across this book at the library, and when I got in to reading it, knew that an affair was in progress. As I got further into the book, I learned what love is all about, why affairs occur, and understood that I was as much to blame for the affair as my spouse. I also had alot of hope that if I could get my spouse to understand the book, that our marriage could be saved and made much stronger then it had ever been. The concepts in the book also helped me to understand most relationships I had in my life and where conflicts with relationships come from. For me the key to understanding this is that people are simply different. People are not wrong or right, they are just different. Once I understood this, I also understood some of the concepts discussed in other books I have read like &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;, &quot;The Bible&quot;, &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Succesful People&quot;, etc. I think the book has helped my spouse and I to remain married and go on with what I hope will be a wonderful life together or apart."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This is a good book with alot of valid points. I bought it in an attempt to save my marriage after my husband left and had an affair. Unfortunately, I tried plan A, then went to plan B. Because I used Dr Harvey's plans, it pushed my husband to file divorce papers. It doesn't say in the book what to do if that happens. I'm back to square one now trying to figure out what to do to rescue my marriage from divorce and put my family back together. Dr Harvey's book is great for those who are just dealing with a partner who had an affair and hasn't left home. I am now looking for other ways of trying to save my marriage."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book disgusted me. Not only did it justify the cheating spouse's behavior but it placed the majority of the blame for the affair and responsibility for repairing the marriage on the betrayed spouse! I purchased this book at a Christian bookstore, therefore was very dissappointed in the approach taken. The approach taken in this book discourages guilt on the part of the infidel and encourages tolerance on the part of the betrayed spouse. The \\"prescription\\" for recovery outlined in this books requires the betrayed spouse to show no anger and walk on eggshells in an effort to prevent upsetting the cheating spouse and forcing him or her back into the affair. It makes me feel like this book was an effort to justify the author's own actions and has only added to the depression and dissappointment I am already experiencing due to my husband's infidelity. Thank God, my husband is repentant and not as callous as the infidels given as examples in this book or we wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of restoring our marriage."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Whether you are male or female, married or divorced, if you or your spouse have been through an affair, this book is a resource that can bring help, healing, hope, and best of all, recovery for your marriage.Dr. Harley demonstrates practical steps regarding all aspects of an affair: before, during, after, who, what, why, when, where, etc. You'll be amazed at how simple marriage can be after you and your spouse have worked through this material. It is truly life changing.Don't be in agony any longer. Get this resource and end the suffering today."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It inappropriately places blame for an affair on the wounded spouse. While it is true that both spouses bear the blame for a marriage that is vulnerable to an affair, only the spouse who choses to be unfaithful bears the blame for the affair. I found this book to be very incomplete regarding good advice for dealing with the very real physiological, emotional, and mental effects of the discovery of an affair. It seemed to be more focused on making the unfaithful spouse feel comfortable than on dealing with the issues that must be dealt with to salvage and rebuild a marriage. I think there are more helpful books on the market."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I found this book shortly after I discovered my husband's affair. What a great book. It really helped us through a dark time and helped my husband extricate himself from his affair. It also helped make it possible for us to begin healing. I do not know if we will manage to stay together, but if we do then this book will really have contributed to the effort. Please look for Dr. Harley's other books as well, as they are also quite good and were helpful to us. Especially his book &quot;His Needs, Her Needs, How to Affair Proof Your Marriage.&quot; Sure wish we had found that one sooner."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I can see why people miss the point of this book. Some people are looking for fluff and validation. While others want to know how to fix and restore their marriage. This book is a fix-it book...no fluff here. How refreshing! I've got a library of fluff and none of them helped me figure out what to do. Sure, they helped me blame everyone else...but, my marriage was still in a tail spin. This one, on the other hand, helped me do amazing things with my marriage. A MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book is so awesome!!! It has so much great info in it. It is a book that is so easy to read before you know it your done. It makes you really think about your relationship prior affair and after affair. What went wrong and were it went wrong at. It offers so many was to open up communication and how to talk to one another without fighting. There isnt enough things to say how AWESOME this book is. Must have for anyone in a bad situation. It has a questionnaire at the end that both partners can do and an agreement for both partners to read and sign. It helps lift your spirit and makes you think that this isnt the end of the world and that you can make it through. I have a new found hope for my marriage and a new attitude towards everything. I am looking at the bigger picture and the brighter side of things. I am alive and I still have my family and my husband. We go to thearpy and with all the great info in this book just put what we have learned into action and hopefully great results will be the outcome. Get this book you wont regret it!!!!"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"It may be too early in my husband's affair time line to do a fair review of this book, but I still wish I could get my money back. The book has good information about both partners in the marraige who are invovled in an affair, but the case study with the wife having the affair was too bizarre! The poor, cheated on husband should be up for sainthood! The man took crap for almost two years and gave his wife every thing she wanted to make it easy for her. He wasn't allowed to express his anger or even TALK about the affair, just do every thing he could to make her feel &quot;secure&quot;. Sorry, the wife made a mistake, a very BIG mistake, and according to this book, she was punished more by her lover (who eventually dumped her) than by her forgiving husband. I believe BOTH partners are to blame for a troubled marriage, but nobody forced her into bed with the other man. After all the pain and trouble of patching up their marriage, the ending is really anticlimatic (pardon the pun). We just hear that they stayed together, are severely in dept, and learned how to communicate with each other. Definitely a book to check out at the library, but not buy."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I found this book shortly after I discovered my husband's affair. What a great book.

My spouse and I are both military he was deployed for six months and had a \\"sexual affair\\" with another woman. I on the other hand, got \\"too close\\" to a male friend who was here to help out while my husband was gone. When he returned it was pretty obvious that \\"He\\" had ruined our marriage he had sex with another woman. I on the other hand thought that I was totally innocent.....until trying to save our marriage and reading this book and realized we were this couple in the book and I too had messed up and had an all out \\"Emotional Affair.\\" Prior to this I had no idea such a thing existed. This was not the only answer to saving our marriage but going through counseling etc, it helped my husband and I find US again and we are actually stronger now than we have been in the past five years. If you would have asked me that just a few months ago I would have never thought but this book was a valuable resource for us. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I credit Harley's theory on affairs, and his action plan of exposure as the catalyst that saved my marriage. I will forever be grateful for that. Exposing the affair, bringing it out in the sunshine, and bringing reality into the situation stopped the mess. I will easily say- after much hard work, our marriage is happily recovered. Harley does a good job of explaining what happens in the affair, and how you can stop it.I take issue with his theories on what causes affairs- because he does tend to blame the betrayed spouse. He is careful to state that the wayward spouse is 100% responsible for the decision to have the affair. But then he lays a pretty good dose of blame at the feet of the betrayed spouse for not meeting enough needs and leaving the wayward vulnerable.It would be an awesome theory- because then, the argument would follow, you can keep your spouse from cheating! You can find out what they value most in a mate, and become all of those things, all the time, and prevent affairs.Yeah. Well. Notsomuch. There is excellent research out there ( Shirley Glass, et al) that indicates that the partner most likely to cheat in the marriage is the overbenefitted partner. The person who is getting all their needs met. The person filling all the needs? Is usually the one who is being shorted.You cannot control another person's behavior. You cannot make a list of rules, and agree on everything from what lettuce to buy at the gorcery store to what kind of haircut you are allowed to cut ( the concept Harley endorses at Policy of Joint Agreement), and control another person into loving you. It does not work that way.So- I have read this book at least ten times. I used to participate in the forums started in support of Harley's books. I would endorse this book only as an action plan for ending the affair. When it's time to recover, I would go elsewhere ( Not Just Friends, by Shirley Glass is the best).Also- Harley is a proponent of reparative gay therapy, and has testified in public against gay marriage, stating that gay marriage will change the neural pathways and cause homosexuality. I was unaware of this when I first read his books. So if this is an issue that bothers you ( and it bothers me greatly that he would take this stance), you should be warned.[...]"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"The book was in great shape.

The vast majority of people that have worked Willard's plans to recover from adultery fail to regain their marriage. Even his own estimates are that 20% of the people that use the MB plans actually get their marriage back.Discussing this information on his site is darn near impossible as he employs a lot of moderators to stifle any discussions that suggest the plans are less than stellar.Do an Internet search for \\"Marriage Builders & waste of money\\" and see what you come up with. Far too many people have coughed up too much money for \\"coaching\\" and direction from the Harley's. Willard doesn't even do the coaching now...this has become the \\"family\\" business and in many ways it is run like the \\"family.\\"As MBers has become a cash cow for the Harley's don't expect them to relinquish the crown without a fight.All that being said, Harley DOES have good ideas on how to make some marriages better.

Excellent read and a must have."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"First I want to say the writers of the book are very knowledgable about the subject of adultery. However, my big issue with this book is that it follows mostly 1 couple's affair (another one is talked about) THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. Both give examples of an extremely difficult situation to over come, the other not so difficult. This is a good contrast I guess, but for me, my wayward spouses affair/situation was right in the middle. A few things I read made me feel as though it would be impossible to get past my own husband's affair. I do think it has some good tools to use, meaning having all your \\"love banks\\" filled. With that said, there were times I just couldn't wrap my brain around getting over the affair then having to do all this work? It is probably best if one reads this book when away from the situation and a little more over the affair. But for me, I got very tired of reading over and over about \\"John and Sue's\\" situation....continually throughout the book."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Harley's approach and insight is top notch. As a physician myself I'm pretty skeptical of &#34;self help&#34; books and counseling in general. My wife and I have had all the usual trials in a long marriage and this past year friends of ours recommended Dr. Harley's book &#34;His Needs, Her Needs.&#34; I can frankly say it was instrumental in saving our relationship. We have made a commitment to read it out loud together every Thanksgiving. Surviving an Affair is a more targeted subject matter with some necessary overlap to HNHN. In my personal and professional opinion his book should be read by all couples to gain better insight of their relationship needs. Harley is admittedly a devout Christian but if that isn't your orientation don't fear. This isn't a &#34;God will solve all&#34; approach that is common in this genre. Harley's approach is quite frank and perhaps even raw. At times I was a little uncomfortable reading it with my wife and her reaction was the same. We are better for getting through the discomfort though and understand each other and ourselves better."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"The book was good, marriage not so good.

The book goes through and explains both sides of an affair and then goes to explain how to avoid it in the future. I recommend both you and your spouse read the book to get the most benefit out of it. It also finishes up nicely with ways you can make your marriage even better than before the affair. It is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Read this \\"life after a broken heart\\" book with removable marker tabs or yellow marker in hand as you will want to easily re-locate the profound statements. This is an obvious sequel to Harley's book,His Needs, Her Needs: Building an Affair-Proof Marriage, but both are eye opening prevention tools. The Emotional Needs Questionnair explores 10 basic needs of a couple and will promote deep, provoking thought. The questionnair, the needs meter,is worth the price of the book.

Both of you must be aware of each others needs and become professionals at meeting them better than anyone else can. I know what it is like to feel betrayed - I survived it and my marriage is fortified for having had the experience. I have read the negative reviews here on this book, and I must tell you that I understand their frustration and they are due their pain and anger, but not at this book, it's authors or the power it has to bring your life back to a place where you can live it with your spouse. I never thought I'd find an ordinary world again, but with counseling, understanding, knowledge and the teachings of Dr. Harley (see his other books too!) I did, my wife did, and we hold each other closer than we ever have before. I'm sorry there is a reason for you to look into this book, but have hope - you will feel better when you learn what it teaches you about your spouse's needs and how a marriage must function to maintain those needs. The book also will NOT make the cheating spouse feel like a criminal, and posts many insights from their point of view. This is something those of us cheated ON will perhaps not have much sympathy for but there is A LOT for us to learn from it. The affair is a drug in the cheater's blood - they are prisoners in a cycle that people have fallen victim to since marriage began. They will eventually see the light, but they must do this with their own eyes. By following Harley's advice you can create the best environment for this."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I suvived my ordeal by following the advice in Dr. Harley's book as well as on his web site www.marriagebuilder.com. I had an affair several months ago. I was totally confused, devastated, depressed, and thought about suicide. I tried looking for help but most people are not sympathetic toward the wayward spouse. I learned about Dr. Harley and was comforted to know that he understands the wayward spouse's feeling and point of view. I followed his advice regarding total separation from my lover valuable- it was the hardest thing in the world to do- I loved him and the thought of never communicating with him devastated me. But I am so glad in retrospect that I lived throught the withdrawel. I now have a better relationship with my husband, and after three months of not communicating with my lover, I can now see the affiar for the mistake that it was. I am very grateful to Dr. Harley- his iron-clad policy regarding total separation with my lover was absolutely right!I highly recommend this book especailly if, like myself, you are having an affair and would like advice on what to do next. I understand your pain and struggle. Trust me, buy this book, or at least go to his website and read the articles. You might think that total separtion from your lover is impossible. Trust me, the pain was excruciating, but it was it. I saved my marriage and my life. And you can save yours."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book offers a structured, detailed, step-wise approach to rebuilding a marriage after an affair. It's discussion of the causes of an affair is not as well-developed as &quot;Affairs&quot; (Brown), but the marriage rebuilding process is very well developed. The authors bat about the term &quot;in love&quot; fairly loosely without really exploring what it means, and their admonition to not dwell on details of the affair but to focus on the present is in conflict with their demand for total openness and honesty. This book will not offer a betrayed spouse much help in understanding that all-important &quot;why?&quot; nor in working through the agonizing pain of betrayal, nor will it really help a betraying spouse closely examine their history and psyche to identify why they had an affair, but it will offer both betrayed and betraying spouses good advice on moving forward."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Surviving an Affair is the description of a trip from how a seemingly \`OK' marriage can deteriorate to a full-blown affair, and it provides a detailed roadmap of how to survive the affair and eventually recover, hopefully with the renewal of the marriage. This book encompasses the behavioral approaches that Dr. Harley and Dr. Chalmers have successfully used to save marriages, and applies them directly to the affair. The elements that are covered in some of Dr. Harley's other works (\`Give and Take' and \`Love Busters') are included here. This book presents a balanced viewpoint of the betrayer's view as well as the betrayed (and even presents the view of the other man/woman).If you're in an affair, either as the betrayed spouse or the betrayer; I strongly recommend this book. It explains the atmosphere that leads up to an affair, and it vividly illustrates how an affair SHOULD end. Most affairs don't end this way; instead, they linger on with the spouse having the affair unable to make a decision. All the while, the betrayed spouse and the children suffer tremendously. But there is hope. This book gives a great deal of insight in to the mechanics of the affair, and it describes how the \`betrayed' can hang on through the worse experience of their life to eventually come to a point where reconciliation is possible.The recovery process outlined in this book is also very detailed. Some of it seems \`silly' or trivial at times, but it is important and it really can work (I'm in a marriage that is proof of that).An affair is Hell. This is a roadmap to get back from Hell."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book deals strictly with couples who are both ready to commit to change once the cheating spouse has stopped seeing the other. Although it helped provide some insight into the matter, I found it really did not help if both weren't ready to move forward."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This is a great book to read for married couples that want to stay together after an affair. My husband who had an intimacy issue said he learned more about relationships from this one book than he did in his entire life.I learned alot also, especially about Love Busters (my main problem). I recommend this to anyone trying to deal with the pain of an affair. I also recommend his other books for those in a marriage or serious relationship that want to prevent this kind of pain.My husband and I are planning our future and loving each other. He is now the type of husband I always dreamed he could be."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I discovered five days ago that my wife has formed what she calls 'an emotional attachment' to a man she works with. She went to work one night, I called there innocently, and was told she was not there. She was dancing with her friend.From the first sentence this book seems to ring true : an affair is the emotional roller coaster of your life. I feel as if my father has just died, but he continues to die every few days.I haven't had time to even read the whole book but am encouraged that the authors think healing (and forming a better marriage after an affair) is very, very possible. Because of this book -- and because of my intuition about not pushing my wife away -- I am not displaying a lot of anger about the relationship, and am even trying to show her affection. My wife and I have had three long heartfelt conversations about this; it is amazing we are talking what I consider to be honestly. Focusing on something other than the anger and jealousy has been healing to me, even now when I'm not sure my wife wants to break off her 'friendship.'Even with my deep hurt, I'm glad we can talk. The scenarios about the feelings of the three (!) participants in these hurtful, stressful situations is providing at least some rock in the storm to hold onto whenever my deep hurt and confusion comes up."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book put in easy descriptions why people fall in love and how important it is to spend time with your mate or else they will be spending time with someone else..My mate didnt read the book but just my reading it is enough for me to slowly change my ways and he is beginning to notice the change and to respond favoriably. Great book if you are looking for insite on why affairs start and how to end them completly"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Going through this process is devastating, however, this book offers hope for the marriage (which is an opinion that is often difficult to find in therapy arenas and among peers) and solid, practical steps to get you out of despair and into healing. This book would be excellent reading for any couple, in this situation or not, as it hits on things so many take for granted until you get to a place of seemingly no return where distrust and pain overshadow any positive feelings and memories. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"As a former betrayed spouse, this book was responsible for protracting extreme pain and agony. I watched my spouse cheat and cheat, and I pretended to \\"understand.\\" I didn't lovebust. Until finally, I kicked him out of the house and severed all communications. He came back, only to do it again - same woman. Once again, I tossed him out, only this time, I moved on with my own life. He finally came back for good. But I can tell you, I could have saved a lot of time and heartache if I would have just kicked him out when I first found out. No one, but *NO ONE* should have to live under the same roof as a cheater. No one wants a doormat! No one wants someone they disrespect. If you were cheating on someone and they were all nicey-nicey and let you stick around, wouldn't you think they were an incredible simp? Of course you would! Would you ever really respect them? Heck, no!OTOH, the advice to the cheaters is excellent, particularly the method in which the affair is to be terminated. The goodbye letter should be a template for every person getting out of an affair, as well as the subsequent behavior (no contact with the ex-lover, moving if necessary, taking a new job if the ex-lover is in the workplace). Harley's advice on that count was absolutely flawless. If you can get it used or at the library, this book is worth it, to see how a cheater *should* make it up to his spouse."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"I bought this book because I have no less than THREE different friends whose marriages are suffering the effects of affairs--all of them emotional, not physical. Some of the other reviews cite that the examples are unrealistic, but I found that many, many of the details (including the long-suffering faithful husband) are exactly what my friends are experiencing. Furthermore, this book helped me gain a little insight into why two of the cheating spouses have expressed no regret--that the faithful spouse needs to honestly assess how he/she may have contributed to the marriage being vulnerable in the first place. This book has been helpful as I have sought to help my friends, for different parts have been directly applicable to their situations and have provided practical help. There are no happy endings--yet--but the clear advice in this book is helping them to gain some sense of clarity as they hear that there are others with similar situations, feelings and struggles. It is also helping them gain stability as the book gives specific suggestions on steps to take. Note that at no point in the book do the authors guarantee that a marriage will be rebuilt. It is a given assumption throughout the book that a marriage can only be rebuilt if both husband and wife are willing to try."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"From the 18-page Personal History Questionnaire to the sample good-bye letter, Dr. Harley again demonstrates his expertise in the area of helping couples. This is a step-by-step guide about how to recover as a couple and by yourself. I'm happy to say that my wife and I are in love again...and not by chance."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Sorry, this is not a review. I'm looking for a book that helps with dealing with an affair AFTER you've been dumped, divorced, whatever. It seems as though most books that cover affairs deal with working on the future of the relationship, not with betrayed people trying to put their lives together after being cheated on and left for the other person. There's divorce books, and affair books, but is their a book that covers both?"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book uses an extremely arrogant affair as the scenario to base its assumptions and rebuilding on. It places too much blame/stress on the spouse that wasn't cheating to heal the relationship and doesn't let the hurt spouse acknowledge his/her feelings. (In this scenario, it's the wife that did the cheating and will not/does not want to end the affair.) In addition, it uses trite phrases such as \\"Love Busters\\" in order to rebuild the relationship. I do not recommend this book unless you are in the same scenario as this couple. I have found other books to be more instructive for both parties involved that present more realistic and varied scenarios to base advice on."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This was one of the best books on helping me understand they dynamics of an affair. I don't think it places the blame on the betrayed spouse, but it helps one understand that both parties play a role in creating an atmosphere where an affair is possible. It is a great book and I would highly recommend it to anyone in a committed relationship, whether it is in turmoil or not because it teaches a lot of principles that would be helpful in either case."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book should be required reading for all people who are married or even contemplating getting married. It was surprising - but I can see where it is true - that these authors who are seasoned counselors - say that every marriage has a great possibility of experiencing an affair. So, if you don't want to go through that pain - read this book. If you have been told by your marriage partner that he/she is leaving you, and/or asking for a divorce, and/or just needs to get away to think, it is very possible that that partner is already in an affair. READ THIS BOOK. It may help you survive the affair, or at very least, let you know what to expect in the days ahead.READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"Affairs are one of the hardest things any couple could ever go through. This book is an excellent guide as to how to rebuild a marriage after an affair. The main area I see this book lacking, however, is the rebuilding of self-esteem in the betrayed spouse."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book offers some useful advice about coping with a spouse's affair, and is easy-to-read. However, I disagree with a lot of the authors' approach. One of their recommendations for &quot;affair-proofing&quot; a marriage (a concept I don't believe in) is to spend every waking moment together. That's not realistic for most people; everyone needs alone time, and a lot of couples don't share enough interests to make this idea work. And the whole notion of &quot;drop an activity if your partner doesn't want to share it with you&quot; is ludicrous. I also object to their case studies, which are entirely too tidy and orderly to be drawn from real life. The most useful part is the Marital Recovery Agreement in the index, which makes you stop and think about how you treat your partner and how they treat you. If the two of you can't manage the basic kindness and consideration in the agreement, it's a big sign that things aren't going to work."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"This book should be considered the Bible for dealing with and healing from Infidelity in a marriage. I personally know of at least 20 couples whose marriages have been saved by using this book as a guide, although there are 1000s more as evidenced on the marriagebuilders.com forums. The support there is an added bonus to reading and using Dr. Harley's books and coaching services."},{"Title":"Surviving an Affair","review":"The author gives a very clear understanding of the emotional needs (not feelings) being sought after by those involved in an affair. The reading is concise and easy. An excellent book for counseling people who want to rebuild a marriage, despite an affair. An excellent resource for Christian counselors."},{"Title":"MCSE NT Server 4 in the Enterprise Exam Cram Personal Trainer (Exam: 70-068)","review":"First off I have to say that I have used exam cram to pass my last 3 exams so I know that they are very useful.The problem I have is not with the book but with the personal trainer part which to me seems like nothing more than an electronic version of everything that is in the book.It goes chapter to chapter along with the book ,The only thing good about it was the test questions.They should have offered the book with a disk of tests not with the same thing I just read."},{"Title":"When Michael Calls","review":"When Michael Calls, by John Farris, is is a quick little thriller, set in a small Midwestern town. The action starts when an antiques dealer is plagued by calls from her (long-dead) nephew.These disturbing prank calls soon escalate to violence - and a spate of local authority figures are all killed in bizarre and unpredictable ways. Fortunately for all, a homicide-cop-with-a-tragic-past is also local to the area, and is happy to poke around for a solution.The solution, like the rest of the book, is entirely unpredictable. Of the book's many flaws, the most aggravating is a repeated reliance on completely unannounced surprises. The detective, Doremus, derives his insight from hints and clues that all occur 'off-screen' - making it completely impossible for the reader to keep up. Although this isn't a particularly complicated thriller (there are only five characters), the post-rationalization of the detective work is an annoying literary device.As soon as it became apparent that, as a reader, I wouldn't have a chance at the actual 'mystery', the book quickly lost what little appeal it had. The characters are like little shavings of lettuce - thin, transparent and completely without substance. Doremus is a sad shadow of a quirky detective - his particular low point is when, entirely unprompted, he recounts the sorry tale of his wife's murder to a horrified housewife. Not only is there no reason (or importance) to this, it is such a strikingly abnormal thing to do that the character drops any semblance of being anything besides a plot treadmill.This laziness continues throughout the book. Although Farris keeps the clues to himself, he bizarrely compensates for the lack of character development with irritating glimpses of insight. Farris doesn't show us anything about Amy (or Doremus) (or Craig) (or Peter), instead he tells us her entire story through the occasional biographical monologue.Farris is a particularly prolific author, but he's a long way from a hack. The Fury is oft-forgotten, but a horror staple and the author's series of goofy Harrison High j.d. books show occasional glimpses of comic genius and quirky social insight. When Michael Calls, however, is a particularly depressed low point. With its paper-thin character development, unexpected twists and lazy language, it feels like Farris got away with binding and printing the first draft to a short story."},{"Title":"When Michael Calls","review":"Don't answer the phone because Micheal knows your number.Helen Connolly's young nephew died in a tragic weather-related accident 16 years ago.

I am working on my vet tech degree and thought it would be a 'good read' but didn't think one day it would be a lucky thing I got it. As if heaven sent, this book did me a great deal of a favor. Thanks to this very helpful information I was able to successfully care for a baby Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker, a type of woodpecker. It was the holidays and Xmas time, and the rehabber I called couldn't make it, so I was stuck with the bird on my own & was in charge of caring for it. It never missed a meal & got fed the appropiate diet for woodpeckers & its size. It was released on Xmas morning & Twiggy can be seen gathering food & has built a home of his own. I have seen him with other birds in the neighbor's yard in a tree hunting for food and going rrheeeee his little call. He has grown a great deal too. He was my first bird to rehabilitate though I'm not a licensed rehabber. But always find one at all costs and keep trying until you do, though sometimes the holidays doesn't help & then you must take action. All his care needs were met thanks to this book & time, money, and extra research. It turned out he was, in fact, a valuable migratory bird to the environment & I was glad to help him survive on his own & free him after his 3rd day of care when he got full use of his wings.

His major works includeTempo and Mode in Evolution (Columbia Classics in Evolution Series.)andThe Major Features of Evolution. This book was first written in 1949, then substantially revised/updated in 1967.He states in the Prologue, \\"I take it as now self-evident, requiring no further special discussion, that evolution and TRUE religion are compatible. It is also sufficiently clear that science, alone, does not reach all truths, plumb all mysteries, or exhaust all values and that the place and need for true religion is still very much with us.\\"He observes, \\"New major sorts of organisms have arisen, as a rule, not as more effective followers of ways of life already occupied but as groups extending into and eventually filling new ways.\\" He adds later, \\"It is noteworthy that such replacement is usually an approximate, not an exact, duplication of earlier ways of life. Conditions change and groups of later origin are never quite like those of earlier ages. Bats are only broadly, and not closely similar in habits to some, and not to all, pterodactyls.\\"Concerning the evolution of the eye, he states, \\"In fact, representative stages at every gradually different level happen to have survived, from diffuse photosensitivity of the whole body through scattered photosensitive cells to cell plates, basins, basins and vesicles plus lenses, and so on to the fully developed image-forming eye with lens, iris, and its other complexities. These photoreceptors function splendidly at every level and do not wait to start working until the final stage is reached. They simply enlarge, refine, and to some extent change their functions as they become more complex.\\"He muses, \\"it is quickly evident that there is no criterion of progress by which progress can be considered a universal phenomenon of evolution ... To find that progress is universal would certainly be far more surprising than to find that it is only occasional.\\" He suggests, \\"Man has risen, not fallen. He can choose to develop his capacities as the highest animal and to try to rise still farther, or he can choose otherwise. The choice is his responsibility, and his alone.... Evolution has no purpose; man must supply this for himself.\\" He concludes the book on the note, \\"It is another unique quality of man that he, for the first time in the history of life, has increasing power to choose his course and to influence his own future evolution ... Responsibility for defining and for seeking that end belongs to all of us.\\""},{"Title":"Sketchbook/Black lizard cover 8 1/4 x 11\\"","review":"pretty boring book. i couldn't really get into it. it didn't have all that much to say. maybe it was too subtle and i didn't get it. john cage fans may like it though."},{"Title":"Sketchbook/Black lizard cover 8 1/4 x 11\\"","review":"I'm a minimalist.

I bought it as a used paperback and based on its title and cover, I expected a &quot;pulpy&quot; style blood and guts novel. Once I looked at it closer, I realized it was a true story. And once I read it, I realized it was an exceptionally well-conceived and well-written book.The book is in two parts - the first part being about the tour of duty in Vietnam for an infantryman and the second nominally being about &quot;The World&quot;. I thought the first part did a fine job of describing the physical and mental hardships imposed on the grunts by the climate, the terrain and the unpredictable boredom/terror nature of the conflict. Following that, Part Two takes the reader through what I believe is the material that really distinguishes this book as one that anyone who studies the Vietnam war should read. Anderson presents a thoughtful and straightforward discussion about the attitudes of Americans who served and those who did not and the forces that shaped those attitudes. He does a great job of relating these to the struggles the servicemen faced in reentering civilian life and to the struggles they faced in dealing with Vietnamese society and their own combat leaders. Placing the veterans' homecoming adjustments, atrocities and fraggings in this context was what moved this book from the very good to the extraordinary class.Easy to read, hard to put down. Read it - you'll enjoy it and you'll learn some interesting things."},{"Title":"The Grunts","review":"Written history, in particular the written history of any war, is made up of small pieces. No one person can possibly give a good account of an entire battle, even a small one, much less an entire war. We therefore need many written pictures, many pieces of the puzzle, many views, in order to have some understanding of just what went on and why. In this work by Charles Anderson we have another of those hundreds of word pictures we need. This is a very small view of a very small part of the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of one Marine. This makes it a rather important work. Without first hand accounts such as this, much of the history of this particular war will be lost forever. As a participant of this particular war (certainly nothing in comparison to Anderson's experiences, far, far from it), I appreciate another's view, an account of another's experiences. This is a well written work, quite frank, quite to the point. It is a pity this one apparently is no longer in print. If you can find a copy, grab it for it is certainly a good addition to your library. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Grunts","review":"&quot;Andy&quot;, as we knew him, is right on the money with this book. He has covered the experiences of the Vietnam War as only a participant could. He was not a &quot;journalist&quot; who went along to get some good material for a book he was planning. He was just another &quot;grunt&quot; who was clever enough to document his experiences and put them together in a book later. It sure brought back some memories to read this book. The account of the pallet of ammo exploding hit home, even though I was not on that hill. I remember the event as if it was yesterday.If anyone would like to know how it was being a grunt in Vietnam just read this book. I know from talking with combat veterans of different branches of service and from different areas in Vietnam that things were different according to where you fought and who you were with. I can assure you that things in the &quot;Northern I Corps&quot; and with 1/3 (First Battalion/Third Marines) were exactly as they are represented in this book. To be able to do his part in every way while serving with 1/3 and to still come up with a book like this says a lot for Andy. He was liked by all who served with him and is now appreciated by them for documenting what they could not or would not talk about. Only Jim Webb's &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; can compare in authenticity with this superb account of the Vietnam Experience.Bill Bratton, USM"},{"Title":"The Grunts","review":"I served with &quot;Andy&quot; in Vietnam in 1969 in the First Battalion Third Marines. He was a friend to everyone and paid very close attention to things around him knowing he would write this book. Many of the stories in the book are based on actual happenings. The pallet of mortar rounds exploding really happened and it was a wonder more Marines weren't killed. This book ranks along with Jim Web's &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; as two of the most realistic Vietnam combat accounts. A friend of mine served under Jim Web and lost his right arm just below the shoulder. He and Mr. Web still stay in touch and continue the bond that can only be formed in combat.

I read Anderson's book before I joined the Corps. Since then I've read all the big names in this genre; Sassoon, Graves, Owen, Mailer, Jones, Caputo, O'brien, Webb. I guess I tend to identify more with Caputo's, Webb's, and Anderson's books since they're Marines.

The out of balance system will crave food, but the food (if eating lean meat only) will escalate the digestive system problems. I applied this to my own diet and realized that I needed to eat more pizza to compensate for the quantity of low fat foods.What wild creature is the most dangerous? Many animals have become accustomed to humans and will move toward rather than away from the curious two legged beings invading their space. Wolves and bears and wild cats -- oh my. No, insects are the real danger. Mosquitoes, bees, and black flies in large swarms can kill a healthy man who does not know how to protect himself. Good information -- better information is that there are ways to find shelter and be safe from the swarms. . . right here in this book.In writing a story the tips within this book enhance creative imagination. My view of camping out is being in a cozy hotel with room service. However, my heroes and villains must have better survival skills to be interesting.Because there are no color photographs and the drawings are crude pencil ones, I give it four stars."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I bought this 2001 hardcover copy of the book because I had checked out a copy of the 1998 paperback from the library, and I really wanted a copy for myself. The hardcover not only has an interesting textured cover, but features new illustrations by Jack Doherty. There is a new comprehensive (it's not all over the book) Edible Vegetation Identification Guide with detailed color pictures (compared to the simple line, black and white ones). The only reason I'm giving this item a 4 and not a 5 is because it's a great basic information book for living and surviving in the woods with a minimalist mind set, but is not an updated and fully comprehensive survival guide. I will say the hardcover is definitely worth it if you're going to get the book anyway."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"The new version has a rigid spine and was coming apart before I read it through once. I ordered this older version to take along in the woods. Don't buy the new version."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"First off, it's important for the potential buyer to realize that this book was written in the 1950's.This is a handy book - if you already have some experience with the out-of-doors. The author assumes some familiarity with roughing it on the part of the reader, and does not give in-depth instructions on some survival skills such as procuring food - making this book less than ideal for the rank beginner. However, there are plenty of valuable tips and skills outlined in this book that it would be good for the beginner to learn - and this book can serve as a starting point for figuring out which skills you need to learn more about! This book is not nearly as in-depth as the U.S. Army Survival Manual - it's not designed for anything like the same purpose, however. The author stresses preparedness, common sense, and choosing the proper gear to carry with you while trekking in the wilderness. This book is more of an overview of important things to consider for your survival, not an instruction manual.This book was written in the 1950's, so some of the instructions (particularly for medical supplies and other kit) are a bit out of date, but there is plenty of timeless, common sense advice at hand. I found the information on finding one's direction and not getting lost in the first place to be quite useful - but understand that this book was written in a different time, and for a different audience than today's casual hiker or vacationer.This book focuses mainly on survival in the North - i.e. the Canadian wilderness, but there are some tips on survival in desert climates, as well.There are probably better manuals out there for practical survival skills, and this book suffers from a lack of clear illustrations and step-by-step instructions, But much of this lore comes straight from those who truly DID have to survive in the woods - trappers, prospectors, and the independent spirits who simply wanted a simpler way of life. I think this book is mainly useful as a general work on the subject of survival - and it does give you an interesting insight into how old-timers managed to live off the land in days gone by.But with a little brains and common sense most of the tricks in this book can be adapted to different types of terrain, vegetation, and climate, and outdated survival kit items can be substituted with more modern ones.Not a must-have book, in my opinion, as there are better survival guides out there these days, but it was an interesting read and does contain some solid tips for survival, I think."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"This book was originally published in 1956 under the title Living Off the Country: How to Stay Alive in the Woods. The copy my review is based upon was printed in 1969.The author's intention is to explain how to survive in the wilderness under dire circumstances. Game laws and cultural or personal taboos might need be to be set aside. You eat what you can to survive. You start a fire and build a shelter from the materials at hand.The book is divided into four parts: sustenance, warmth, orientation, and safety. The most enduringly useful section is, I believe, part three, on orientation. The first two chapters of safety precautions in part four are also good. In the final two chapters of the book, the author discusses the value and contents of a \\"survival kit\\", which, although motivated by somewhat different concerns, is very similar to the current notion of the \\"bug out bag\\" (BOB) widely discussed in various online forums.If you enjoy older books in this genre, as I do, this is probably a classic of its kind. But if you're looking for comprehensive or current advise and instruction on wilderness survival or primitive living skills, this book is not a good choice."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Not loaded down with extra junk, this book describes the necessary survival methods of finding food, shelter and finding your way.

Pretty unique touch."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I bought this to help me get ready for my first planned camping/backpacking trip incase something was to go wrong I would like to say it is an older printed book but is very helpful. I aint a city feller and have some exsperince in the whole outdoors stuff, but I wanted this to give me some ideas incase something went wrong and I had to try and survive out there alone or with a hurt friend maybe and it is great for what I neede it for I was exspecting alittle morer but it is a paperback andwith that in mind I cant ask much more from it. I now have an idea of how to capture game with several different types of traps and also shelters out the wazzuh. I am going to find a book about the different types of plants and vegitation that grows arounfd my home so I can know what to look for and want poision myself. As I read this I wondered if the guys on the Discovery channel read these books before they get started because if you have watched any of them (Surviorman and etc.)there are so many of the thing they say do and build in this book its unreal, anyway I like the book and it has alot of helpful ideas if you are really wanting to be prepared for anything that could happen."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"You won't believe the skills you'll pick up from this handbook on survival in the wild.

It's great."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I needed this information. It is very empowering to know that you can develop the skills necessary to survive the elements. This book is an excellent source of info."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Like most people who have read this book, I received it as a gift. Perhaps some innate mountain man spirit or boy scout tendencies of mine made somebody think this was an appropriate present to give me around the holidays. Anyways, I appreciated the gift and have only recently gotten around to reading and reviewing it. In this edition of the book the cover is bound in olive drab, grip rubber, not unlike a basketball. This unique cover material makes the book a handsome and manly looking piece of literature if there ever was one.So what about the content? Well, as a former soldier, I found much of the material consistent with standard military survival manuals, particularly when it comes to woodland survival. The language of the writing is classic 1950's American English, not too removed from those elitist publications put out by the East Coast gentry who cranked out books on every subject following the war. It is, however, not pretentious or condescending, Bradford Angier genuinely has written a book he hopes will assist the stranded, starvation-bound \\"Average Joe American (or Canadian).\\"A fun and attractive book to read with at least a little insight into roughing it, either deliberately or not.REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, AUTHORS, READERS AND PUBLISHERS DESERVE YOUR HONEST OPINIONS."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I have searched and got many books on survival and outdoors skills, but this my friends, is truly the best!

The only problem is that the pictures of the plants are not of the best quality. i would advise geting a edible wild plant book also. other than that is was great."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Pretty general in nature and not specific enough to be of any value. Any Boy Scout learns more about survival in his early years than is told in this book. As far as I am concerned this is a waste of time in reading. It has just enough information to make a person dangerous to themselves in any life threatening situation."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"This book is NOT the one you should pick, regardless of your background. For the inexperienced suburban/urban wilderness lover, it has some outdated info and simply isn't that useful without any pictures. For the more experienced survivalist, the packaging alone will be enough to turn you off (a bit too &quot;Martha Stewart meets the woods&quot;), not to mention the overly-simplified approach it takes to basic survivalist skills. As someone who has spent time on a mountain rescue crew, I can attest to the role books such as this play in getting people WAY over the heads in the great outdoors. If you insist on getting a survival manual, keep looking."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"We were passing this book around in the days following Christmas when we noticed that the inner back binding was torn. There is no flexure in the spine of the book. My son went home with book that was falling apart.The other comments regarding the outdated writing are right on the money. Nevertheless, I am going to try and find a paperback version if one exists."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Although there is a good deal of information to be gained from this book, some of the information is a tad outdated. I have read through several similar books and in my opinion the US Army Survival manual as well as Wilderness Survival by Gregory Davenport does a much better job in helping a camper/hiker feel comfortable in knowing how to take care of themselves or others should the situation arise.The initial copyright on the book is 1956; the writing style and information show their age... The discussion of wool being the best bet for cold weather seems a bit outdated. The writing style is unique and not the easiest to read. I wouldn't be comfortable if the only survival information I had were Angiers instructions and illustrations. I found that many of the other \\"survival\\" books do a much better job in explaining how to do a given task with step by step information. The illustrations leave much to be desired as I couldn't tell most of the edible plant illustrations from the poisonous ones, and I doubt I could match an illustration to an actual plant if my life depended on it...In my opinion your best bet would be the two other books I mentioned before you considered this one..."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Angier's book, How to Stay Alive in the Woods, is a must for all outdoor people. It describes, in detail, how to overcome almost any backwoods disaster. Those who like to take overnight hikes into wilderness areas should be prepared for anything, and this book does just that; it prepares you for everything. I have spent numerous weeks at a time trekking through Alaska, Northern Canada, and the Rockies and have read many books. This is the best wilderness survival book out there."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Having read an earlier book by Mr. Angier many years ago I looked forward to a revised and updated version of the tips offered decades ago. Unfortunately I was dissapointed. While many things have not changed in the wilderness, clothing, emergency suplies, and first aid techniques certainly have. Saying that only wool is good enough to keep one warm and to advocate the outdated use of snake bite kits and iodine are examples. I suggest that today's survivalist look for a more modern guide."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I have never had to use any of the information contained in this book in a susrvival situation but as a kid I did use the information about trapping and snares to catch rabbits in Alaska as a kid (I'm using the third printing 1966 version.) I also built snow shelters to play in. Everything I tried from this book worked."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"You are stranded in the woods, alone and scared. Bradford Angier's &quot;How to Stay Alive in the Woods: A Complete Guide to Food, Shelter and Self-Preservation Anywhere&quot; very well may save your life. Throughout the book, Angier gives important information which is also quite interesting. He covers main topics which are the focal point if each chapter. Most ideas and tactics are generally understandable, although the illustrations are downright ridiculous at times. The moments that leave you thinking \\"that was a brilliant idea\\" are often interrupted with common sense tips that make you wonder what age group the book is intended for. Detailed explanations of practical knowledge draw attention from several parts of the book, which results in numerous low points. In conclusion, this book makes for a decent read, but lacks the qualities which would make it a book that you would like to own."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"This book is primarily focused on survival in the northwestern United States and Canada. The pictures leave something to be desired, but Angier's descriptions are excellent. The book a bit dated, but for theoose looking to go back to simpler times, the lack of GPS systems and Gore-Tex may be just the thing."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it is a little outdated, but the ideas are just as valid today. This is written by a writer who lived off the land and knew exactly how to survive in situations that others would give up on. The fact that this was written before the GPS came around doesn't make it any less valuable a resource.How on earth do you start a fire with only a piece of ice? Read the book! (And yes, I really don't think I could start such a fire even with the book in front of me, but it's nice to know that it is possible...)How do you create a fish trap out of sticks? How do you create a snare? How do you find civilization if you are lost? How do you find water? What type of things do you need to bring with you on camping trips? What is safe to eat, and what is not? These types of things are all answered inside.I've read it cover to cover several times and I believe it is the perfect type of book to give to an outdoorsman or to keep down at a cabin for a little light winter reading...Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"This book is written in a much more literate style than any of the other wilderness survival guides. With some exceptions, it reads well and is interesting and entertaining. If this were a work of fiction, I would probably give it four stars.However, there are parts of the book that are rife with incorrect information. A verbatim example:\\"Being able to identify Polaris, a.k.a the North Star, is of crucial importance in the wilderness. It is typically the brightest star visible to the human eye and can be located after discerning in the solar system the location on an easily recognizable constellation: the Big Dipper\\"Passing over the less important fact that no part of the Big Dipper is in the solar system, Polaris is NOT the brightest star. Not even close. It is of middling, unimpressive brightness (and was actually slightly DIMMER in 1956 when this was first written). The falsehood of the statement in the book can be determined by anyone with normal vision who goes outside on a clear night in the Northern Hemisphere. For it to have survived in various printings and editions over the past 50+ years is egregious.Another example: \\"The constellation Cassiopeia is better known to most as Orion\\" This absurd untruth is then compounded by an illustration of \\"Cassiopeia\\" that is distorted in shape so that it resembles Orion!!!This makes me wonder just how many nights the author has spent out under the stars. (Perhaps I should give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is very nearsighted? Naaah..). If someone follows the \\"brightest star\\", that is pointed to by Orion in the manner shown in the illustration, they will be following Sirius, and very definitely not going North (in the Northern Hemisphere, in any case). This horrible misinformation could get people LOST and subsequently DEAD.Given these easy to disprove examples, I would feel safer taking up flaming chainsaw juggling than trusting that the edible plant information included is better than the celestial navigation chapter."},{"Title":"How to Stay Alive in the Woods","review":"Not only does this book give you the confidence to set off on your own, but it is immensely pleasureable to read.

Toxic Food Choices3. Portion Distortion4. Sedentary Lifestyle5. No Regular Exercise6. StressAnd certain \\"Phenotypes\\" lean toward certain behaviors that cause you to gain weight. The assessments are to identify your particular leanings.An okay approach, but I didn't find it highly motivating or insightful.I did find some information very helpful. The fact that some body chemistry types don't process pleasure signals properly. Thus, in order to get the sensation of pleasure from food, these types tend to overload their systems to get pleasure to trigger. This intellectual understanding is very helpful and does provide a reasoning behind waiting a bit for those pleasure signals to make it through before continuing on a binge.In the end though, the basics of eating well, having an active and energized life will get you where you want to be.

When I was really frustrated about losing my post-pregnancy weight, this helped me tremendously and I never actually \\"dieted.\\" It helped me to identify in which areas I needed to improve and gave me great suggestions on minor dietary changes that made a huge difference. For example, since my type is hormonal, eating more low-fat dairy (which was really easy for me) was all I needed to do and I started to see/feel improvements immediately. I really liked what an easy read it was, too. . .determine what your type is, read that section and you're off!

Granted, there are a few grammar errors - but the book is written in early 20th century and much of the language, speech and mannerisms of the time come through in the writing. I found this style entertaining and easy to read.The book also refers to many of the social norms of this era such as discussing only \\"men\\" in business.

Ogilvy even claimed it changed his life (in advertising anyway, but who knows, advertising is Ogilvy's life). The book is amazing in both its simple and direct approach. It's relatively short, yet packed with information of use to anyone interested in advertising.Hopkins essentially invented many of the concepts that so many advertisers take for granted today, chief among them what seems like a simple idea: the coupon. And even today, many advertisers fail to get results when they stray from his teachings.One of the most famous examples of failing to follow his teachings: the \\"Got Milk\\" campaign. Sure, it seems clever and it's definitely high profile, but from a marketing standpoint, it's a flop. Milk sales have not moved upward at all despite the fact that milk producers are now several years into the campaign. Want to know why it failed? Read Hopkins's book.Whether you are an individual considering a career in advertising or an businessperson trying to figure out how best to market your business, start with Hopkins and then move onto the rest.All advertising before \\"Scientific Advertising\\" flows into it; and all advertising after \\"Scientific Advertising\\" flows out of it."},{"Title":"Scientific Advertising","review":"Claude Hopkins invented test marketing, sampling technology and the concept of pre-emptive advertising.

David Ogilvy was another one of these pioneers, and he said, \\"no one should be in advertising that has not read Scientific Advertising at least seven times.\\" If you study any of the notable marketing gurus today (e.g. - Dan Kennedy), they are just positioning what Claude has said in a contemporary format.

In his day, Claude Hopkins revolutionized the world with his ideas on marketing. In particular, he created the science of marketing by applying the scientific principle to advertising.

Most of his books focus on the american west and how mountain men, pioneers, indians and adventure seekers pushed out into the unknown to see what was there and experience new things. This book takes a different approach, about a man who wanders east into europe and eventualy asia, but has the same themes. Bound to his family above all else, but with a desire to see new things and experience the world take the main character on an journey across the known world.

L'amour has the Moors using scimitars which didn't come into use by the Muslims until the Mongol invasions about 50 years later than the date the book takes place. He calls the land of the Franks Gaul like the Roman empire was still around. Kerbouchard knows quite a bit about the ancient Egyptians, but people then knew next to nothing about them, thinking Genies responsible for the pyramids. He depicts the Moorish women as having more freedom than that of the Franks, the exact opposite was true. The story is repetitive with a damsel and arch villian in each adventure. All that being said it is worth a read. Also recommended is his best western \\"Conagher\\"."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"...and I loved it!

The responses that I have received from my students have been exactly what I would have wished as a history teacher. In spite of the fact that the book was thoroughly researched and packed full of the kind of historical information that I cover in my classes, the students seem to forget that it is a book that is outstanding nourishment for the brain cells.

It is a sweeping vision of a time that is little touched upon in most history courses. The best part of the book are the wonderful descriptions of Muslim Spain and the section inside the Assassins' stronghold. L'Amour's style is clear and he depicts his characters as very human but as heroic humans. I highly recommend it. It is especially good reading for high schoolers."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'Amour has always captivated my utmost attention and the Walking Drum is perhaps my favorite book by him. I have read this book about twice a year for the last decade and the story never grows old. L'Amour typically wrote westerns with an occassional break-off into another genre (usually crime, or short stories) but the Walking Drum is his attempt to bring to life the early 11th century and succedes in bringing another captivating tale to indulge us. It still has his &quot;coming of age&quot; theme that is found in many of his westerns and the story and theme actually are rooted with lots of historical references. The writer may be dead, but his work will endure due to such amazing stories, and in my opinion the Walking Drum is by far his best work ever. It is an easy reading book and can be enjoyed by many from jr. high on up. I highly recommend this book to anyone, as it is a wonderful journey that no one should miss."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is an engrossing adventure which should be made into a movie. I seldom read novels. This one I couldn't put down. Moreover, I was fascinated by the contrast between the culture of the Muslim world of southern Spain and Persia and that of Europe which in the 12th century was 200 years behind the Muslim world. The novel not only entertains but, as the author states in his &quot;Authors's Note&quot;, gives the reader an understanding of the culture of the Muslim world whose &quot;enormous contribution&quot; to our civilization is &quot;unhappily&quot; virtually ignored in history as presented in our schools. The Muslim world, along with China and India, are &quot;now powers with which we must deal both today and tomorrow, and which it would be well for us to understand.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"\\"The Walking Drum\\" resounds with L'Amour's enthusiasm. His Author's Note says: \\"I have been fascinating by [this] period of history... and have so enjoyed the writing and researching of this story...Unhappily, history as presented in our schools virtually ignore [the contributions of] China, India and the Moslem world.\\" Sadly, L'Amour did not live long enough to compose the next two books in his planned trilogy, which would have sojourned through China and India.The first half of this novel delights again and again, as the wonders of 12th century Moorish Spain shimmer in the mind's eye. L'Amour praises Moorish Spain for its tolerance \\"to all creeds, especially Christians and Jews, known [in the Qur'an] as People of the Book because they, too, followed the Old Testament. [Muslim Spain] welcomed scholars from everywhere\\" -- implicitly condemning both 15th century Spanish and contemporary Islamic Inquisitions. (My later readings indicate Moorish \\"tolerance\\" was hardly \\"freedom of religion\\": public display of non-Islamic religiousity and proselytization were prohibited even during the \\"golden era\\".)The half-dozen other L'Amour novels (Westerns) I've read rarely reference religion, and then positively only for American Aborigines. L'Amour's avatar in Walking Drum, named Kerbouchard, is born a Celtic Druid, and conveniently adopts the veneer of local religions as necessary while venturing across medieval Europe, describing himself as a \\"seeker after knowledge.\\"The second half mars the novel: Kerbouchard aphorizes that he needs but \\"a sword in the hand, a horse between his knees, and the woman he loves at the battle's end.\\" However, his succession of superficial lovers implies that his practice reverses the position of the latter two."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'Amour writes great westerns but how many people know he writes anything else. I didn't until I got this book. Instead of L'Amour's regular 19th century American west, it is now 12th century Europe and Asia. A slight change? I think so, but one for the better.The book follows the heroic Kerbouchard as he works for vengeance, love, and, unlike most heroes, knowledge. He is not that much different than L'Amour's western heroes. In fact, the book is just as good as his shorter westerns and maybe even more filling, since he does use a couple hundred more pages. And although it is not a traditional one of his, it is definitely one of his best."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I am 15 and I read alot.

It sounded like the sort of historical fiction I enjoy. I had never read L'Amour before. I think I now see why. The book was mildly enjoyable but not much beyond that. I found myself skimming sections after the first third of the book - you can easiy see what is happening and the writing style made it easy to fast-forward through the action. The greatest flaw in this book is the main character. He is not particularly sympathetic because he is too unbelievabley competent to ever really be in danger or too fail. He starts out as a possessor of secret Druidic lore and a sailor and progresses from there to master swordsmanship, Latin, Greek, Arabic, Persian and other languages, learn astronomy, alchemy and medicine, dicover the lost Chinese formula for gunpowder...well, you see the problem. There is no book that he reads that he doesn't memorize totally (part of that secret Druidic lore) and everything he turns his hand to, he masters. Naturally, every woman eventually falls for this superman in medieval clothing.The book passed the time and I don't regret reading it but it is so unrealistic as to be almost cartoonish. If this is an example of the writer's style, I will not be picking up any of his other books. However, if you have time on your hands or need a book for the beach, this might be it."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Walking Drum is one of the best books I've ever read.

I recommend to anyone, middle school and above. This book is in comparison to the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I'm actually a fan of Louis L'Amour and his westerns, so I was pretty excited about the idea of him writing a medieval adventure novel. However, I was very disappointed with &quot;The Walking Drum&quot;. The book is basically a series of repetitive adventures involving Kerbouchard (another of L'Amour's supermen)getting into trouble and getting back out again. Repeat, ad finitum. The only thing that seems to change is the backdrop. That L'Amour knew the places and histories he was writing about firsthand is obvious. He was always good at making the settings of his books very vivid and living parts of his books. But the actual structure of the novel's plot -- well, here it's just a hodgepodge. By the time Kerbouchard rescued his father I just wanted to get the darn book finished already. Definitely not one of his best."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"this book was incredible.

I would really like to know if Louis L'Amour wrote more after this one to find out if Kerbouchard went to India to find Sundari...Can you tell me this? I read it in less than 1 week it was so great! Thanks."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I have read many L\\"Amour titles and enjoy them a great deal. The Sackett series is my favorite. Consequently, I start with high expectations for the author. Walking Drum is definitely different in theme and period (12th century) and that is why I was attracted. The early Sackett stories take place in Europe. The story starts out intriguing and in dramatic fashion in Brittany. For the first few chapters the rapid pace and changing settings are interesting. However after a while there are frequent and abrupt changes of settings, scenes and characters with little or no transition. Some characters are introduced in a flash with no effort to build their background or role. The chase across Europe becomes chaotic and the storyline is muddled. Unlike other main characters, Kerbouchard is not completely likeable as he is portrayed in extremely arrogant fashion and has the idea every woman in the world is immediately infatuated with him, even in circumstances where he is disgusting. The constant attention of rich, powerful and beautiful woman to Kerbouchard is unbelievable, except in the author's mind. Near the end so many different female love interests are introduced it is preposterous. A few are not even explained or developed. To a certain extent, the story line is similar to some modern Hollywood movies where they figure as long as they have special effects and beautiful people the story is not important. One final complaint is the ongoing cheerleading by the author of Islam almost in preaching fashion. Instead of simply mentioning positive contributions, he goes overboard to the point of demeaning the non-Islamic and Christian world - again, out of place in an action novel. This could have used a huge amount of editing."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"In 1971 I was on the &quot;USS Manley&quot; sailing somewhere in the Atlantic. I was home sick and lonely, lying in my bunk. I picked up a paper back western book another sailor had been reading. On the first page there was a gunfight in my home town, Uvalde, Texas. Louis L'Amour hooked me from that day on. The Walking Drum is one of my favorite books, along with Last of the Breed. And of course, the Sacketts became part of my family. Even more unsusual was one of the real characters in some of his novels was Theo Pico, past Governer of California. I met a girl in San Antonio, Texas who was a desendant of his and she was amazed I even knew of him. I have learned that sometimes his fictional stories have more fact than fiction. I also have wondered about a sequel of both The Walking Drum and the Last of the Breed. If anyone knows if there are sequels, please let me know."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"What a book! I'm a big fan of the late Louise L'Amour. I've read 7 Westerns and the Sci Fi story The Haunted Mesa by him and almost all were 5 stars. This book is no exception.The Walking Drum is a page burner with no boring parts. The reader wants to read on. I read it in 3 days and paced myself to enjoy it more.As usual L'Amour is fantastic with character development and scenery description. There is LOTS of action, battles, fighting, descriptive escapes, slavery and many beautiful woman our hero Mathurin Kerbouchard falls in love with. We see him as a Druid descendant teenager. He has a developed photographic memory. His mother is savagely killed and his home burned by an evil Baron. His father is a strong, skilled respected pirate who is captured and sold into slavery.The story is set around 1175 AD in the Arab, Moslem's, Spanish Moor World. Even though this book is fiction I really appreciated the factional play/description that the Arab world at the time was much more advanced in the Sciences, Astronomy, Literature, Medicine and much more than Europe. Even though the characters and story are fictional there is a good general description of basic history of the period in the Arab, Moslem's, Spanish Moor world. fascinating...I appreciated that.We see Mat Kerbouchard growing up and becoming good with a sword and dagger. He avenges his mother's death by killing the evil Baron. Lots of action, at sea adventures, advanced training and more. Mat through years of study and much book learning becomes a scholar and a physician. He also becomes a soldier/merchant in a huge caravan. He listens to the Walking Drum to keep pace in the Caravan.We see the beautiful woman he falls in love with. He is hurt in battle, later captured, starved and escapes. We see his plan to save his captured father. Mat has powerful enemies and becomes friends with an Emperor.I wont ruin the ending for you. Just say if you want an action packed, non stop adventure story with very interesting tidbits about the 1175AD Arab, Moslem's, Spanish Moor world this is the book for you. Try to savor it a few days and give yourself a little time with it to enjoy this great book more. Highest rating and recommended 5 plus stars."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Seems to be L'Amour's homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs' multi-novel JOHN CARTER OF MARS series since it uses many of the same plot devices as well as structure. Heros of both works of fiction become almost mythic world figures, masters of the sword and superheroes on their respective primitive planets, rescuing an endless list of princesses from horrific dungeons and towers and evil villains in what can best be described as a serial of short stories more than a linear novel. The popularity of Burrough's work speaks for itself and considering George Lucas lifted much of the original Star Wars trilogy from JOHN CARTER OF MARS its not surprising that L'Amour give it a whirl next. Both did pretty well. If you like one you'll certainly like the others. One must appreciate the genre however. You can't read a mystery and not like it because its a mystery. This is pulp fiction action-adventure. The science-fiction of Burrough's is replaced here with a close-up view of life in 12-century Europe and Middle East so some nice bits of history are taught along the way (and a bit of history trivia). The novel is also high on ethics (do what's right despite it all), high on adventure, and as can be expected from this type of novel, a whole lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"In spite of having read hundreds of books beyond this one in the last decade, The Walking Drum is a book that I repeatedly come back to read each year in order to immerse myself within the ancient world that L'amour has spun for us. In this tale, you follow a man from a young age after his home has been destroyed, to watching him grow throughout the years, hardened by battle, intellect through studies, and a cheeky tongue by the women he meets. This book takes you on a wild ride through history, and is so full of it you feel as though you're part of it. Every little bit is believable, breath taking.I agree whole heartedly with many of the other reviewers- this book is not for the person who has something to do in the next couple of hours, or even days, depending on how you write. Because at the end of each chapter, each paragraph, each sentence, is the strong desire to continue on reading.This book will always remain on my list of recommendations for anyone to read. My own copy of this book has been comfortably worn down into a classic look of its own, and I encourage that you buy your own copy in order to do the same."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book is full of adventure and suspense. The hero is an adventurer, yet a philosopher and a seeker of knowledge. I loved the historical era this book was set in, because it is a time not much written about in fiction. It was the perfect balance of adventure and thought provoking philosophy, with a hint of romance to boot."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I had to read this book my sophomore year in high school. I am so glad my teacher assigned this! It is very well-written. You truly feel as though you are actually experiencing everything in the book. I found it to be very accurate and very rich in detail. I wish the author had been able to write a sequel."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"If you enjoy reading books full of adventure, intrigue, and suspense, with a medieval flair, this is it. I first became aware of Louis L'Amour by reading this particular novel, and I was blown away. Mr. L'Amour's gift of storytelling is magnificent. Buy the book; you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Adventure deep into the early development of trade routes to the East during the late middle ages. Adventure into the romance saga a the great libraries of the ancient world. Adventure deep into the territory of the assassins of Iraq and Afghanistan as describe in THE LIFE OF OMAR KYHAN by Charles Lamb, 1932 and Marco Polo.Louis L'Amour leaves of the saga of the American West and leaves us wishing there had been time in his life for a sequel to THE WALKING DRUM.It doesn't matter what your favorite genre, adventure, thriller, suspense, or mystery this epic has it all between the covers.THE WALKING DRUM is one you don't want to miss.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelGuns Across the Rio: A Texas Ranger in Old MexicoNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil WarUnder the Liberty Oak"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"A friend gave me this book and raved about it. It has been a rollercoaster reading experience. The Walking Drum takes place in a time and place not written about much in popular Western fiction: the world of Moorish Spain in the 12th century, then across France and into the Byzantine world. Really fascinating time period and great historical descriptions of everything from weapons to medicine. It was like reading a history book but with no boring parts. Great philosophizing on the roguish hero's part as the boy becomes a man.I was just a tad disappointed in the ending, which seemed a bit rushed to me. L'Amour could have decreased some of his cliff-hanger ending earlier chapters and concentrated a little more on the climax and denouement for full reader satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I love adventure stories, and this is a good one. I did not understand all the historical background but enjoyed the book anyway. L'Amour knows his westerns, but he definitely did a lot of research to write this book as well. I've also read Last of the Breed which is excellent.In the \\"Author's Note\\" at the end of the book, which was written in 1984, L'Amour notes that in school we are taught little of China, India and the Moslem world, but \\"they are now powers with which we must deal both today and tomorrow, and which it would be well for us to understand.\\" He called that one right."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"A Great history lesson. Unlike most of L'Amour's books, this one has a middle ages theme. The adventure takes you around the world and through many cultures with a focus on the history and impact of various peoples and nations.Highly recomended for great entertainment along with some education."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"IT WAS GOOD, HELD MY INTEREST AT ALL TIMES. AT THE CLOSE OF THE BOOK LOUIS SPOKE OF TWO MORE BOOKS FOLLOWING KERBOUCHARD, DID HE EVER WRITE THEM? IF SO WHAT ARE THE TITLES?"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Book was received in a very timely manner and in the condition stated on the screen when purchased."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I really liked the book The Walking Drum. It has a lot of guy kinda things in it. Its dated back in the early 1100's. Its about a man who gets in trouble and discisess himself as a merchant. He also almost gets killed a bunch of times. I rated this as 5 stars because it is a very good book. It has parts for men and women both. I really enjoyed this book and I think you would to."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"...but not a good story. I don't want to sound like at 11-and-a-half year old person that wrote a review to Emma or whatever, but the peroid this book was set in, is a great time. It had all of the makings of a good book, but it was just too slow for my liking. If you like high paced books set in the Middle Ages, this book has some moments like that, but not enough."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"walking drum is way too long, i mean i had to read it for required reading for my school and it was painful how long it took... kind of predictable and cliched too, which didn't help it's cause...."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"this book in my opinion is simply horrid. i usually adore reading, and have probably thousands of books in my home. If action and romance are all you want, then this book can supply short intervals of that. If you are more of a person who treasures symbolism and learning about human nature, then this book will utterly bore you."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Those who enjoy reading of medieval Europe, a lively adventure and historical accuracy will love this book. Don't be fooled though; this no tale of knights in armor! L'Amour is an excellent writer, and this work of his shows off just how much research he did on the subject before taking pen to paper. Add to this the realistic adventure he cooks up and the book is nearly impossible to put down! I recommend it to all my friends. -tk"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I really liked the book The Walking Drum. It has a lot of guy kinda things in it. Its dated back in the early 1100's.

At first it was unfamiliar country, but by the end of the book you know the land as well as Kerbouchard. It moves you through the story as if you were him. All of his adventures were astounding (however unlikely), but that made the story great how everything turns to a new threat within seconds, or a new lover, making you concentrate on keeping up with Kerbouchard, and keeping you from setting it down. I loved this book and like everyone else I want to find the sequel. It's driving me nuts!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book takes you all over Eurpoe. The setting is perfect.

It encompasses so many aspects of the time in history which it takes place. There is just so much to this book, It's great. YOU MUST READ IT!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I just finished \\"The Walking Drum\\" - I have been reading all the L'Amour books I can find, and this one disappointed me.I enjoyed the change of scenery from the typical L'Amour' American West setting to one in far off Asia, but found the book to be too cliched and and the plot simply unbelievable. The hero is just too handsome and heroic, and the events too full of convenient coincidences, busty babes and wondrous escapes.I felt that L'Amour wrote this book as a pot boiler to earn cash rather than as serious work of historical fiction. If you really want an engrossing read, try Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Archer's Tale\\" trilogy, which takes place a couple of centuries later."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"There is many different places and characters that the main character encounters on his journey. Most of them have long and unpronounceable names. I recommend if you read this book to keep a pad of sticky notes and write down important characters and places in the book. This book is a very informational book that captures your magination and keeps you yearning to read more."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"One of the few books written by the great western author Louie L'amour that was not set in the old west. It tells of the trials and voyages that transforms a 3rd century English boy into a warrior-sage who was traveled the world and discovered the secrets of knowledge, kings and women. This book starts in the moors of Britain and ends in the mountains of Afghanistan, tracing the steps of young man searching for his long lost father. It wheels you throught the ancient streets of Paris, Toledo, and Constantinople, where the hero Kerchebroad, gains knowledge and nobility in everyway imaginable. His many adventures include the fairs of ancient Europe and the political intrigue of the Byzantium empire. Do not be fooled by the serious theme for it is written with the same mastery of character, plot and setting that any other L'amour book would have taken. It promises never to bore yet contains an air of freedom and truth that will make you long for the days of a good horse beneath you nad the sea-spary in your face."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I've always enjoyed historical novels such as Michener and Joyce and Steinbeck, so it was a very pleasant surprise when I picked up \\"The Walking Drum\\" by Louis LaMour.I like LaMour's western novels because of the detail and descriptions of early America and his ability to \\"weave\\" fiction and fact. But his \\"Drum\\" blew me away with the historical detail of capitalism in its infancy.I had no idea of circumstances in Europe and Asia in the 11th & 12th centuries and the role muslims played in the orgins of commmerce. Wow!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I have read ALL of Louis LAmour's books, and a few twice. The Walking Drum is the best book I have read by 'any' author I will no doubt read it again, God willing. And I love to give it as gifts. I am honored to give this book my only \\"5-star plus\\" review ever.Thank you for asking.Most Sincerely and with blessings,William (Bill) McBride1.757.774.1603"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"A book that captivates at page one and absorbs you in adventures until the last. Quite a lesson in history as well."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Great historical backdrop, great adventure writing. Enough intrigue for 10 books (if disjointed).Unfortunately, the main charactar spends half of the book talking about how great he is and how his greatness affects his view of the world for about half of the book. It seems like way more than half. If the dreadful monolog were deleted, it would be a normal-length book.Surprisingly, the women charactars are all unbeleivable and hard to respect.As always, Louis L'amour is a spectacular writer. He could really have been helped by a good editor on this one.Unique, Delightful, Infuriating, Disappointing, Exciting, Tedious"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I first read this book when i was about 12 and it made a lasting impression. This is absolutely L'Amour at his best."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"1 of Louis L'Amours best books great story line full of history always keeps you wanting to read on great book"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Overall this is a fantastic novel for an amateur history buff. The story is good and the setting is tremendous. At times the reader can get a bit lost among the various characters that come in and out of the story-line, especially if you take more than a week or so to read the whole thing.Also, this is likely a product of the time in which the book was written, but L'Amour can get pretty preachy about Islamic Spain being more progressive and &#34;enlightened&#34; than the rest of Christian Europe. No doubt that there is a lot of truth to this, but it seems like every other chapter the author takes a page or so to just talk about what a steaming pile of crap Christian Europe was at the time. It doesn't take much history knowledge to know that all of Europe, Christian and Islamic, was a bloodbath for most of the middle ages."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"A trip through Spain and western Aisa of near 1,000 years ago. The main character is engaging and a man of character and purpose. I wish there were more books in this series. I think it is one of Loius' very best works and if you know L'amour then you know that is saying a LOT. Louis wrote mostly western and early American novels. Of course those are very good too, especially the first few books in the Sacketts series. This is a book not to be missed. I bought it at a used book sale from the local public library... why they would sell such a reat work is beyond me but I am glad they did. I sat on my Kindle one too many times and broke the screen. Once I got my new Paperwhite I bought this book for Kindle. I was about 1/3 through with it, I finished it on the Kindle. I am very pleased with the Paperwhite too! I am now reading LAST OF THE BREED. I heard of it while reading reviews of this book... it is another book not to be missed! So long for now... and happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"A great story and it helps one to understand history. There are ample referrences for futher study. I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I've read this book before and it was a pleasure to do it again! Too bad no sequels that I've ever seen."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"IT WOULD TAKE YEARS OF RESEARCH TO COMPILE THE HISTORY IN THIS BOOK. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A LIKABLE GUIDE THROUGH THIS PERIOD IN HISTORY AND A GREAT READ."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I first read this book about twenty years ago, when I was in highschool. I since have reread it at least a dozen times andits still hard to put down once you start reading it."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"As a mother who still tries to screen everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, it is not often I end up forcing said daughter to sit down with a book: most of the time, if I found a book to be inappropriate due to age or subject matter, or if it was just plain dull, said daughter is spared my agony. In the case of \\"The Walking Drum\\", however, I have to agree with most of said daughter's sentiments. Mind, the sentiments below express her *immediate* sentiments upon completion of a L-O-N-G trek alongside the hero.The problems with this very ambitious and laudable work: I have not read Louis L'Amour's other books, but although I fought against it, the hero in \\"The Walking Drum\\" *never* changes from the first page to the last. He is Captain Kirk and the Lone Ranger, Ronald Reagan and John Wayne, Roger Moore and Sean Connery as James Bond and Julio Iglesias (not Enrique) rolled into one. By the end of the book, he is mysticism, Christian, Muslim and on-the-way-to-being-Hindu - all without the insightfulness of Pi (\\"Story of Pi\\", previously reviewed), depending on which beautiful woman he just met. At times - many times - the book reads like a textbook. At other times, there's just so much first-person writing - with total disdain for third persons and second persons in the narrative. It takes itself way too seriously. It plods.So why would I still consider this book so important to her library?For one thing, Louis L'Amour was a favourite author of said husband, whose other favourite books were the \\"Encyclopaedia Brown\\" series. Secondly, Louis L'Amour was a popular and prolific writer in his day, and this was his last book, published about four years before he died in his 80s. Thirdly, the span of the book and the Author's Notes at the end of the book illustrates an extraordinarily clear view of history - especially middle school history - that, although peppered somewhat with 1970s political correctness, reminds us that human interaction throughout Time is not divided into sections in a textbook, to be studied in a course of, what, three years. People from different countries and cultures did travel and meet each other, and any divisions they might have had were due to language, rather than skin colour.If a reader can get past the trials and tribulations of this spiritually-confused-cowboy-disguised-as-Middle-Ages-adventurer, it makes for a very good resource for the historical drama classroom. For easier-to-digest adventures of a similar time period, I would recommend Avi's \\"Crispin: the Cross of Lead\\" series, and, if you'd like a touch of magic with your equally-long quest, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" the first book of \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles\\" by Patrick Rothfuss. The second book is a little adult for under-15s, so say I, the conservative parent.So, yes, this book has a 4-star rating, because I do see the value of it. (It makes also for a very good resource in a class on American literature of the 1970s and early 1980s). And I am totally unapologetic in investing both my time and said daughter's! Said daughter's review follows:\\"'The Walking Drum' by Louis L'Amour was a rather boring adventure.\\"Okay, I can*not* believe I'm saying/writing this, but...\\"I hate this book. So. Much.\\"The plot is simple - guy is an English version of Hercules. A regular muscle man, with the skinny waist, giant torso, long hair that always looks *just right*, fabulous at e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, and of course, has girls falling over themselves just for a smile, or heck, even a confused glance from him.\\"Kerbouchard (because that is Hercules' English name), is driven out of his village after his pirate dad is reported missing, and pirate dad's right-hand man kills Kerbouchard's mum, and steals all their gold, etc. So Kerbouchard runs off and gets conned into becoming a slave. He then manages to become captain of the (rather) dense crew and sells *them* as slaves.\\"Meanwhile (naturally), he falls in love with a curvy, drop-dead gorgeous girl who is engaged to another guy. He 'lets' her escape before continuing to travel around the world, looking for his father and wisdom (which, trust me, he needs).\\"In every country he goes to, the story is the same: Every. Single. Time. Through no fault of his own, Kerbouchard ends up with some enemies, falls in love with drop-dead-gorgeous women who also fall in love with him, Kerbouchard kills the enemies, says farewell to love-stricken women, remembers he is looking for his dad, and goes off to another country, where, amazingly, the same thing happens.\\"Yeah.\\"So, maybe it's your cup of tea (after all, Louis L'Amour is my dad's absolute favorite author), but it sure as heck isn't mine. I'd give it three stars, at most - two for the effort it must have taken to write a 423-page book and one out of pity. Other then that, I think I'll stick to 'War and Peace' and 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians.'\\""},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'amour has always been one of my favorite authors, and I would have to say this is his best book. I read this one years ago and recently purchased the Kindle version to read it again.This is one of those novels that you sit down and start reading and look up to find that three hours have somehow passed. It has a perfect blend of action, wit, and romance, set in well-researched, historical places in Europe. It is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager. I pick it up again about every 5 years or so and read it again.

I truly miss his skill as a story teller."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is just one of the many books that Louis L'amour has written, this is not a dramatized version it is just n actor reading the book word for word, to me thats the best way to listen to one.... this is a must buy novel."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"One of Lamour's best.

Louis L'Amour! Wonderful historical research went into this story of the 12th century. Known for his ability to capture the spirit and drama of the authentic American West, L'Amour here turns his attention to Islamic Spain where our hero becomes one of the scholars in the famous school of translators, before moving on across Europe to the Russian steppes and through the Byzantine wonders of Constantinople to the impregnable fortress of the Valley of the Assassins!Teachers/Librarians: here is the language arts piece for 9th-12th grades social studies coverage of Islam/Middle Ages! An absolutely wonderful way to learn history.

Look for it!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I've looked high and low for a version of this book, other than the mass market paperback edition.

My husband and I both loved it"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"If you like a well told tale. If you like history and if you like a book you will not be able to put down, then this one is for you. I have always enjoyed Louis L'Amour's work and I am not even a big western fan. This work is a departure for this author and was well worth his time. I have always been fascinated with this time period (the time the story took place) and the author's story telling ability brings it to like. Unlike some of his work, the character development is this story is absolutely outstanding. I would suggest you buy your own copy though as you will probably give this one a reread..I know I have - several times. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This a great, swashbuckling historical epic! For those who know L'Amour as only a Western author, this book comes as a shock. He goes back to his French roots and produces a grand novel of a heroic, larger than life young man overcoming great challenges physically while developing intellectually. He does this in a little known period of history (1200 A.D.), giving great respect to the European Muslim and Middle Eastern worlds. Simply great entertainment from a master storyteller! I've wished many times he would have written at least two sequels."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I love Louis L'amour westerns and I had great hopes that this non-western &quot;WALKING DRUM&quot; would equal the excellence of his westerns--and it did for several chapters. After awhile, however, the book became so repetitive that you could anticipate what would happen next. I gave the book 2 stars only because it did keep my interest for a few chapters."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Slipping away from his normal Western genre, L'Amour really hooks you into the story here. You won't be able to put this down, and I have a better appreciation for him as an author - this isn't one of his typical read it in two horus westerns, but will take you a good while to read it. The Kindle version is under $5 (well, it is at the time I am typing this review), and you will get $20 worth of value for that five bucks!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"In my mind, this is one of the best Lamour novels. I have read it twice and found it equally entertaining each time. Love the history and research that went into The Walking Drum."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum, by Louis L'Amour, is, unlike almost all of his books, it isn't a Western, but is rather a historical book set many centuries ago in what is now modern Europe.The main character, Kerbouchard, is just a boy when we first meet him. Like all of L'Amour's books, this one is just packed with action and excitement, and like most of his work, this one too is full of interesting history. I am reviewing The Walking Drum because I'd like to encourage all of you who have read his Westerns to read this one too. It is a big, full book, and it is completely fun and entertaining in all respects.I am a writer myself (I have five published books now) and the more I read of Louis L'Amour, the more I admire how well he tells a tall tale, how rich his books are in historical fact, how clear and refreshing his characters are, and especially how totally adept Louis L'Amour was at writing books that keep his millions of readers turning the pages.Louis L'Amour wrote many marvelous books and The Walking Drum is easily one of his very finest. Check it out; I predict you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Up untill the time I read Louis L'Amore's \\"The Walking Drum,\\" I thought he had written only westerns. This historical adventure is my favorite book by him. I felt as if I was there with Kerbouchard and experianced each adventure along with him. I was able to see the Byzantine Empire and Constantinople with L'Amour's discriptive detail. The plot is woven into a romantic adventure I wish could have continued. I had hoped that there would be second book about Kerbouchard's journey to India, but I was never able to find it. This book is a keeper, and I plan to read it again."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This was a very gripping book i couldn't put it down its my favorite book i recommened it to anyone get this book now!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'Amour breaks from his tradition of writing fantastic western stories in The Walking Drum.Our hero, Mathurin Kerbouchard, embarks on a quest to rescue his father from the dangerous and evil rulers of the Fortress of Alamut.On the way, Kerbouchard meets many new friends, as well as making many new enemies. He becomes not only a scholar and a warrior, but also a lover, becoming close to many beautiful women.This is a very satisfying book - I was actually forced into reading it with school, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is the only book I have EVER given 5 stars.

Not a western, but true L'Amour."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I enjoyed this book but it was very easy to see that it was written some time ago. I was worth reading for the history that was revealed."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Louis L'Amour and it is fascinating! I thought he wrote only westerns so it really surprised me to find this historical novel which takes place in the 12th century and provides a learning experience about that era. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction. It takes a while to become accustomed to the high flying prose, but the details provided well compensate for that writing style."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Fantastic book full of European history that may not be as well known as it should. It's a great read from cover to cover and you will wish at the end that Louis L'Amour had lived just a little longer to write the sequel to it."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is a departure from most of Louis L'Amour's writings; however it is a book I have read four times. The history and grandeur of the epic is one I will return to again and again. The main character is captivating and the writer uses him to take the reader through both history (albeit with some liberties) and adventures for everyone. WELL DONE, Mr. L'Amour - I only wish you had written the sequel."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I read Louis L'amour books to my four boys at night ranging ages 5 to 12. They love the westerns. This is not a western and they liked this book best of all the L'amour books. The research is incredible, the story line is addictive, and the action is not lacking one bit even without any guns. The author's note stated he intended to write two more in this series. My boys were disappointed Mr. L'amour was unable to do that before his death."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I read this book as a high school requirement but remembered little about it. It is a nonstop adventure and one l'll likely read again."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I have owned this book for several years. I remember I was, at first, hesitant to read a Louis L'Amour novel that was not a Western. I am so glad I finally picked it up and read it. I drew me in and held me captive. It is a book I go back to time and time again... especially lately, when everything seems to be a vampire romance. It is a book I have and continue to recommend to friends and family. I even wrote Lionhead Studios, suggesting they use this book as a bases for an Assassin's Creed-esque game. :)"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book opened my eyes. I am 24 years old, and I am the product of today's public education system. This book made me aware that the western world sees itself, and it's history, as the most important in the world. I should be imbarrassed to say that I did not know that the moorish people ruled over most of Spain for over 700 years. In fact, I had never heard of the moorish, nor had I had much data about Arabs place in history. This has started me on a research of history. My lack of education is apparent. I must do research on my own, though history books, and inspiration from writers like Louis L'Amour. Thank You Mr. L'Amour for the revolation."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is a wonderfully imaginative historical fiction.It is equal parts swashbuckling adventure and history text. L'amourwrites with great enthusiasm and passion for the period before therenaissance in Europe. Rich in detail and action and will not disappointfans of L'amour's westerns"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"As with most people, I became a L'Amour fan through his westerns. In fact, it was a couple years after receiving \\"The Walking Drum\\" as a gift before I actually cracked the cover; the 12th century just didn't interest me that much. But when I finally did dive in, it was hard to put down. While in one sense this is vintage L'Amour--a lone hero fighting his way out of one bind after another with more strength and wit than anyone could truly possess--in another sense it is much deeper than the author's many westerns. The entire story--plot, characters, setting, history, etc.--is far more developed than L'Amour's typical writings. It is long, but worth the read."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I have been an avid reader of L'amour's Westerns and, aside from Sackett's Land (which isn't completely non-western), I had never read any of his non-western titles until I read this. Louis L'amour did a fantastic job on The Walking Drum with so many intricate plots working at once with the coming of age of Mat Kerbouchard, his never-ending quest for his father, all the side romance plots, not to mention his yearning for learning. No type of story-telling is forgotten. A masterful work indeed!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is simply a must read. It has everything one would want in a novel. Page turning suspense, great quotes, unstoppable action, and lots of romance. The book shows one of the least known about historical periods in history in a whole new way and with all of the granduer possible. I also like the refrences to great writings of that time period; I've already read 2 of them since. One question, Where's the sequels L'amour was planning to write? I've never been able to find one. This book is on and will always be on my top 5 list."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"While I enjoyed the setting and characters of the book, not to mention the historical aspects, it was just too predictable. Kerbouchard was a likeable character most of the time, except when it came to the women in the story. Each \\"love\\" interest he meets becomes a damsel in distress that owes him much favor. He becomes separated from them, and forgets them long enough to venture on to the next adventure. Towards the end of the book, he boldly professes that he loved them all. The most absurd rendezvous was that of Sundari. They met, and within the following hours, fell deeply in love with one another. The book was a really good read with the exception of the romantic aspect. I would advise reading it, but don't get too wrapped up in Kerbouchard's current love interest, because she won't be around very long."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Hey don't get me wrong he's a great author but if you read one of his westerns you have read them all.Not so with this book it is an above average old fashioned swashbuckler adventure. Just fantastically good stuff if you like Historical Fiction."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I'm on my third read of this book. This book has a touch of everything ... great humour, philosophy, accurate history, romance, bravery. It's probably L'Amour's best novel. It was his first book I read, and it left such a sweet taste in me that I haven't really enjoyed any of his other books. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old. I read it for the first time after high school, and I'm reading it for the third time several years after college.I'm inspired by Kerbouchard -- brave warrior, philosopher, scholar, lover -- as skilled with his sword as he is with his mind and his tongue.I was a bit disappointed by the ending though -- the build-up and anticipation was so great that I don't think the ending did enough justice to the whole novel."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"this was a really fun read, and a lot of good historical information is interspersed as well, without making it boring. another recommendation of a similar type of book would be the farseer series by robin hobb, but if you haven't yet read &quot;the walking drum&quot; then get it today! you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"An amazing story filled with adventure, Its just a shame the other 2 books were never written. I have read this book 8 times now, and its still an awesome mental journey. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"One word to sum up this book. Addictive. Totally, completely, amazingly addictive. I was up till 1:00 am because I HAD TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT! It just gets better with each reading. The period detail is fantastic. History teachers could certainly pick worse assignments although be warned, you may stand up your prom date because as stated before this book is impossible to put down!Read it if you love any of the following:History cool characters Love Swashbuckling Funny dialogue Fiendish villains (The guy at the end gets the prize as nastiest villain of ALL TIME)Read it, you will never regret it although your prom date might."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I was given this book for my twelveth birthday, and since then I have read it at least once a year. As a history major, I love to find books that reflect the truth of history in a beautiful and realistic way. Kerbouchard is a truly renaissance man who is on a quest to find his father, who may or may not be dead. In this quest, he travels mideval Europe, from the Christian lands of France to the Muslim lands of Spain and East to the steeps of Russia. What amazed me when I read this was that the middle ages were only the dark ages for western Europe; the Muslim lands were bright and alive and unoppressive. Kerbouchard's philosophy in life of learning for learning's sake is one I have adopted in my own travels through life."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is the story of Mathurin Kerbouchard, a sailor/druid/horseman/student (most of all...lol) and defender of all that is good in Moorish Spain (Very interesting period in itself.) and elsewhere.I find the story very similar to others that L'amour has done (some of them quite well) but this is the best. The all encompasing man view that he likes to have about his characters is even more interesting in this, where knowledge, if anything, is more of a tool even than skill with \\"a blade.\\"This will bring to bud within you a desire to read, to contemplate, to sit in a tea house in the streets of Cordoba and enjoy thoughs...to rage across a plain on a beautiful Arabian mare, characteristic of the most precious breeding of any age...decend deep into ancient underground staircases seeking an escape from hunters...even relish the taste of water on lips almost too long parched, believing (perhaps truthfully) that you have never enjoyed something more...Anotherwards, It's a good read! Nothing too heavy, it had much the same effect on me as the Harry Potter series: just wanted to read it, nothing more. There isn't a wealth of knowledge here, just enough to make it rather interesting.Oh, yes, I particularly liked the part where the Bedouin boy speaks to Kerbouchard about the Syrian(?) camels. These are creatures much too forgoten in fiction. The camel is a creature just as worthy (or more) than a horse.It's better than three stars, but four was a bit of a stretch...Other recommended readings by this author: West from Singapore (Short stories about sailor/Captain \\"Ponga\\" Jim Mayo), The Haunted Mesa (about Anasazi mythology...very interesting. Here, according to my aunts who spent several years working for a native Anasazi, L'amour does his homework), and The Last of the Breed (about an American (Irish-Soux) pilot captured on a test flight, believed dead, and forced to attempt to flee a USSR prison and the brutalities of the Siberian climate alone). These are the four best L'amour books, in my and my family's opinion."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Wonderful Historical detail meshed seamlessly with an exciting story line. This is one of my all time favorite books. My dad started reading it to me every night when I was 10 years old, and it was this book that made me truly love history and urged me to love and learn languages. It's just an absolutly fascinating portrayal of 11th century life.Meghan"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"WELL, I WAS IN STATE PRISON AND I CAN TELL YOU.

IT WAS THE BEST, EVERY BODY HAD TO SIGN A LIST, AND WAIT IN ORDER LIKE GROWN MEN. THANK YOU."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is the first historical fiction book that I've read. I was very impressed. I had read other books by L'Amour (the westerns), but decided they weren't my thing. When a friend recomended &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; to me, well... I cringed. But I eventually acted on faith. I am now a beliver.The great adventures of Kerbourchard kept me in suspence all the way through. I would finish a chapter, and be too excited to see whay happened next to sleep!Mr. L'Amour did an excellent job fleshing out the charecters as well as setting the scenes and moods. I enjoyed his attenton to detail, especially: the correct foods and titles of nobility. Geographical references were also a plus. I was able to trace in my head where Kerbouchard was traveling- enjoying the ride along.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in culture, history, fiction and fantasy.Excelent!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"In this best-selling historical novel, L'Amour plots an epic adventure story with furious action and intrigue. He departs from his renowned Western setting in order to paint a story on the rich canvas of Medieval Europe. The colorful backdrop of characters includes Goths, Persians, Greeks, Normans, Jews, Syrians, Slavs, Arabas, Franks, Moors, Saxons and Englanders, with a myriad of vocations (artisans, cobblers, weavers, potters, armorers and innkeepers), from a variety of classes, including nobility (barons, lords, and clergymen) ruffians and vagabonds (archers, swordsman) and performers (jugglers, magicians and acrobats). The scope of this novel is enormous, and covers territory including Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Turkey.The main character is Kerbouchard, who meets action a plenty as he seeks to avenge the death of his mother and rescue his captured father. Kerbouchard's aim is to find his father, a fortune and a beautiful female friend, and his vast experiences give him a large measure of success on all accounts.Kerbouchard is a portrayed as a warrior, lover and scholar, and it is his ability to adapt to a variety of roles that ensures his survival: from seafarer, to galley slave, to soldier, to scholar, to linguist, to vagabond, to merchant, to physician. Brash, brazen and arrogant, he is not always loveable, but in the complex medieval world in which he is placed, it is these qualities that enable him to succeed. The medieval era in which he lives is one where the sword speaks more than words, where fighting comes first and questions come later. Yet from the outset, he is equipped with the maxim of an experienced man: &quot;Trust to your wits, boy, and to your good right hand.&quot; (p.2) Kerbouchard comes to appreciate the value of both a sharp sword and a sharp mind (p.76). One both accounts he is a rather larger-than-life hero, since his accomplishments with both sword and mind are so vast as to defy the imagination.It is especially to the latter that Kerbouchard devotes his attention, convinced that &quot;knowledge might be power, but it was also the key to survival.&quot; He rejects both Christianity and the Moslem religion, the dominant religions of the day, in favor of an open quest for truth, since knowledge and learning are better than money or health and strength (p.66). Here L'Amour glorifies the &quot;spirit of inquiry&quot; and thirst for learning, as Kerbouchard hungrily pursues knowledge of physics, astronomy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, astrology, medicine, logic, religion, politics, law, natural sciences, necromancy, drama, poetry, military tactics, navigation, history, and chemistry.Does &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; have any deeper significance beyond a racing plot set on a rich historical tapestry? Consider this: Is Kerbouchard a mouthpiece for L'Amour when he confesses his paganism, and quest for truth over against the great institutions of learning, when he says &quot;I have reverence for all who ask questions and seek honest answers... I suspect all who claim to have THE truth&quot; (p.245) and &quot;dogma is invariably wrong, as knowledge is always in a state of transition.&quot; (p.255)? Certainly his espousal of the philosophy of self-determination is typical L'Amour: &quot;Up to a point a man's life is shaped by environment, heredity, and movements and changes in the world about him; then there comes a time when it lies within his grasp to shape the clay of his life into the sort of thing he wishes to be. Only the weak blame parents, their race, their times, lack of good fortune, or the quirks of fate. Everyone has it within his power to say, this I am today, that I shall be tomorrow. The wish, however, must be implemented by deeds.&quot; (p.373)Certainly this novel does raise questions about the truth of such a philosophy, as well as the importance of a personal quest for learning. One does not have to agree with Kerbouchard to find value in the discussion of these philosophical questions. But ultimately this book is not a book about philosophy - it's a historical novel. L'Amour is convinced that too little attention is given in Western society to the significant contribution of the Chinese, Indian and Moslem world to our civilization, and he wishes to correct this by introducing readers to a more balanced history of this era by means of a historical novel. The dark ages may have been dark for Western Europe, but it is L'Amour's contention that in the Moslem world of the East it was time of prosperity and growth.There can be little doubt that L'Amour succeeds in achieving this aim. But even where he doesn't, there is no doubt that he's made his own unique and satisfying contribution to the piles of enjoyable adventure novels. If you're looking for depth or for perceptive insights about human nature, you won't find it in &quot;The Walking Drum.&quot; This is not literature. But it is a great and swashbuckling adventure story, well-researched and rich in historical detail, with just the right blend of suspense, adventure, romance and history. And those elements make it a story that you won't regret reading."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is an instant classic.Having read the book many times at different ages from a teenager to an adult. I have found it to be full of life, passion and adventure. This book makes you want to see the places in Spain and go to the library in Cordoba, to see the statue at Cadiz. You actually want to read and learn about great things, to become a scholar, or in our day a professor or an author.Louis L'amour brings you into the time and carries you on this adventure making you not want to put down the book.It's Just a great Book."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The classic L'Amour novel, unlike anything he's ever done before or since. For those who dismiss L'Amour as being a mere western writer this great book will change forever your opinion of him. It's filled with engaging charactors, facinating detail, and some of the best writing this wordsmith ever commited to paper. My only gripe is this; Back in the sixties when this book was first proposed L'Amour was faced with such resistance by his publisher that he shelved it for more than a decade. Originally it was to be the first book in a trilogy that would continue Kerbauchard's adventures. Unfortunatly L'Amour went on to that ranch in the heavens before he could do it. Still we have this one."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'Amour's novel of the twelvth century is fast paced with lots of action. His writing creates vivid pictures of the early merchant caravans and what life was like in those times. I've loved \\"Down the Long Hills\\" since I was a kid, but this is probably my other favorite. I wrote to Mr. L'Amour years ago and he very kindly wrote back. In his letter, he mentioned that he was working on a new novel called \\"The Walking Drum\\" and I think that might be the main reason that I love it so much. But don't get the idea that it isn't a great story on it's own. Like all of L'Amour's books, the research on it is awesome and the story is interesting at the least and often riveting. He had a great feel for history, and not just of the Old West. I can't say that I enjoy the fight scenes all that much, but he definitely writes a book that is action packed. I've read it several times, though, and I always feel that he intended a sequel that he didn't get to write, and that always make me feel sad."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This is not your typical Louis Lamour western it is set in the middle ages and has a great story about a lad growing to manhood while he looks for his missing pirate father. I know Lamour claims to be very accurate in his writing about the facts in history that he relates so I hope that what he describes in the story is true, but if not it still makes for a fun time and great adventure."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Its a long book, but, one I was anxious to continue reading. L'Amour's varied life experiences gave him expanded perspectives of values and life that come through his many novels. \\"The Walking Drum\\" is a departure from the western novels and chronicles a time in Europe when dynamic changes were happening. In many ways, it is a visceral history lesson, but, one that is exciting to read and follow. It has certainly earned a top shelf location with my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"To sum it up quickly, The Walking Drum is what you call a page turner. It is truly a book you can't put down. So be warned and be sure to set aside plenty of time for this one.There are many reviews already written but I just had to express myself here and I will try to be brief. The best quality this book has is its historical setting and L'Amour's obvious expertise on the subject matter. Not only are you taken to crystal clear recreations of Crusade era lands, cities, societies, religions and cultures but it is done in such a way where you actually learn a thing or two. The attention to detail is amazing and accurate.Even a page turner such as this has its downsides though. Still a must read, but it is hard to grow attached to the main character. If there ever was a Renaissance man, this is it. Forget Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, Kerbouchard outshines them both combined. He is a Navigator, Astronomer, Physician, Philosopher, Geographer, Druid, Pirate, Scholar, Soldier, Gentleman and Ladies Man all in one. The reader can understand why others in the book are jealous of him! His qualifications are almost comical. The only thing he can't do is write poetry, but he certainly tries to talk like a poet. You will not relate to this man due to his omnipotence but at the same time you learn much about the historical world through him. The narrative is in first person and this all knowing being brings every aspect of his world to life. The author could have used multiple characters to have a similar effect. Instead of one there could have been two or three brothers who each sought skills in specific areas to help in the search of their father (this search being the central plot). One could have been the Adventurer, one the Scholar and another a Scoundrel; each seeking out different paths of knowledge to later put together as one. Having multiple points of view may have slowed down the pace of the novel but at least we would have had more sympathetic and realistic protaganists.At times the monologues are a little long winded with philosophical preaching. I found myself drudging through extended soliloquies ready to smack the pages and scream, \\"all right I get it already, you're smooth with words!\\" One of these speeches he gives to a beautiful woman who the author would have you believe is enthralled with every word but you will be convinced her eyes have glazed over with boredom.Other than these two gripes, this is an excellent read. It has its flaws but in the end you will be satisfied if not hungering for more. Sadly the author died before any sequels could be written but this novel stands alone just fine."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"My father read this book to my sister and I when I was about ten, so naturally I have a lot of sentimental attachment to the romantic hero, Mathurin Kerbouchard, and his quest. The book also sparked an interest in medieval European and imperial Arab history, before I even entered high school. I re-read this book every-so-often, and find Kebouchard's adventures don't get tiresome with repetition."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book is a nice departure for Louis L'Amour, who wrote primarily westerns during his prolific writing career. The Walking Drum is set in medieval Europe and Asia in the 12th century. It tells the story of Kerbouchard, a native of Brittany who is on a life-long quest for knowledge and romance. He's also trying to save his father from a castle in medieval Persia.The book is rather improbable. Kerbouchard seems to be a cross between Conan the Barbarian (the Robert E Howeard character), and Horatio Alger. He's broke but gains audiences with emperors and kings. The book also compares to a John Jakes novel with interaction between real life historical figures.I do not recommend reading this book if all you want is history of medieval times. L'Amour certainly researched a lot of details of places and events and people, but keep in mind these are just his interpretations as they are convenient for his story. But I do recommend this book if you want action and adventure. It really isn't that much of a difference from his many westerns (there are good guys and bad guys, and pretty girls just appear out of nowhere) and it has action and suspense. The book runs longer thanmost two of his books combined, but it is a really enjoyable story."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"L'Amour offers an exciting adventure story in The Walking Drum and also provides readers with a vivid history lesson. The era of this story, the Middle Ages, covers events and times that I have been unaware of for the most part. L'Amour shares events, leaders, and cultures of the historical era that bring it alive to readers.The story brings about one adventure, conflict and romance after another. The story's hero Kerbouchard is perhaps too ideal, being a warrior, scholar, theologian, medical specialist, and ladies man, but he does suffer defeats and routs. He always finds his way to get back on top and outface his enemies of which he makes many.The story builds steam to the climax and leaves the reader wanting more. L'Amour throws in a bit of philosophy and life lessons into the mix as well."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book is, without a doubt, Louis L'Amour's crowning achievement. Kerbouchard is the classic adventurer. &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; is one of the greatest pieces of fiction you will ever read. &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; defies description...I can only say that I actually cheered when I finished it.Louis L'Amour was working on the sequel when he died...such a shame that we had to lose such a great fiction writer."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"What IS a turtle back edition???? Wish there was a sequel, but apparently I've read the whole saga of the Walking Drum. It's funny how a book out of the blue will turn out to be so good. Just picked this up at a yard sale out of a whole box of westerns. Very interesting, would like to find other books about this time period and setting."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"As a lover of ancient history and cultures, The Walking Drum, by Louis L'moure truely opened my mind to fascinating lands of the past. I have read many history books and documentaraies, but none bring to life this particular time period as The Walking Drum. I never get tired of reading it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"To anyone out there who loves romance, adventure, insight, learning, poetry... this book was written for you. There is nothing I can say that will do this book justice. It simply must be read to be appreciated in full. I test my relationships with this book- people who connect with this book usually connect with me. Read it, love it, read it again."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book is probably one of my favorites from louis l'amour. It's not the typical western that he usually wrote.

I don't consider this one of his best.. but I find the history extremely interesting"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows how to read.

Only regret is the sequels by author were not done."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Is the Walking Drum a very long book? - YES! Is it a very complicated book? Oh yes. Is it historical - you bet. Even the title is somewhat of a mystery till the last of the book but you'll keep on going chapter after chapter to see what comes next. You will surely learn about twelfth century people, places, politics and even clothing and fashion. I surely recommend taking the time to read this book but be warned - - it is NOT the usual Louis LaMour novel."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Because of all the good reviews this book had, I bought and read it. Disappointed. L'Amour's heroes are always bigger than life, but this one is excessively so. However, I did read it almost straight through.I would probably have bought a sequel if one ever came out. His best book was \\"Last of the Breed.\\""},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis is one of my favorite writers and I have read all his books many times over. The Walking Drum just happens to be my favorite book of his. His attention to detail and the research done for this particular book is amazing.

I would rank it with Steve Berry, James Mitchner, and Andrew Thom as my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"As is usual with Louis Lamour, there is a true element of events and geography. I found this very interesting, aside from the story line. Lamour is one of my favorite authors, but this book is not about cowboys and growth of the West. For anyone who depends on historical accuracy, Lamour always delivers. A book not for speed reading, but more for relishing of a different and ancient time."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"Louis L'Amour is a wonderful story teller. His historical research adds detail and validity to the story. I hated for it to end! I highly recommend this wonderful saga!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I recommend this book for anyone. I have read it eight times now and just started to read it again this morning. Awesome classic."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is one of the best books I ever read. The non-fictional setting in a fictional account is true L'Amour, except this book was written with more passion. Louis L'Amour studied the middle ages. Following the caravan with \\"the drummers beat\\", and the accompanying stories was truly educational and interesting. This book gives a non-western view into history while the Moors controlled Southern Europe. The Walking Drum is a must read for anyone seeking varied perspectives to that historical era."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I grew up on Louis L'Amour. He is THE storyteller in my memory. This book is like that in many ways. It has the ultimate man stud main character and the strong tempered worthy female counterparts. His storytelling is enthralling and drags a person in. His characters a bit predicting and infallible. This is my favorite book he has written and I am very saddened, first that he died, and second that he died before he could finish what he started here. Louis' main character is always that of a medieval hero, and here is no different, but in this book he really presents some of his philosophy that does not appear in the cereal westerns. This is an adventure and is awesome to read. It is only after my further maturity in literature that I look at his writing as somewhat less. Either way it is always fun and this is his best. I give it a 4.5 but still love the book and round down due to black and white characterization. I would recommend any of his novels to young men in particular to see what a man should be like. Not the deepest writer but an old school excellent storryteller at his finest."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum, by Louis L'Amour, is, unlike almost all of his books, it isn't a Western, but is rather a historical book set many centuries ago in what is now modern Europe.The main character, Kerbouchard, is just a boy when we first meet him. Like all of L'Amour's books, this one is just packed with action and excitement, and like most of his work, this one too is full of interesting history. I am reviewing The Walking Drum because I'd like to encourage all of you who have read his Westerns to read this one too. It is a big, full book, and it is completely fun and entertaining in all respects.I am a writer myself (I have five published books now) and the more I read of Louis L'Amour, the more I admire how well he tells a tall tale, how rich his books are in historical fact, how clear and refreshing his characters are, and especially how totally adept Louis L'Amour was at writing books that keep his millions of readers turning the pages.Louis L'Amour wrote many marvelous books and The Walking Drum is easily one of his very finest. Check it out; I predict you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"The Walking Drum is filled with all of the bravery, courage, raw emotions, and romance that you might expect from L'AMOUR, but in a period he did not otherwise explore. Clashing steel replaces the smell of gunsmoke as Kerbouchard flies across Europe in the pursuit of his father. From slave to hero, Kerbouchard has the ability to ignite grand visions of power and nobility in any man Ladies look out, this flamboyant swordsman has stolen many hearts along the way.Although L'AMOUR is known for his &quot;Westerns&quot;, he outdid himself on this work. It is truly a shame that the master of storytelling did not live to continue with a series based on this historical period. Read it once or read it a hundred times, The Walking Drum is alive with flair and excitment."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I own about 100 L'Amour books, and rank THE WALKING DRUM next to JUBAL SACKETT and LAST OF THE BREED (set in the Soviet Union!)and SITKA (set in Alaska, Russia, the Far East, and the halls of the U.S. Capital!) as my favorite. Clearly, Kerbouchard is L'Amour's greatest hero ever, and the setting is absolutely stunning.I have long tried to convince friends that L'Amour is a &quot;frontier&quot; writer, not a &quot;Western&quot; writer, with little avail. That is, most people are aware of his books about the American West, about cowboys, ranchers, settlers and the like. Yet, his work encompasses much more than that. From fen-men to pirates, from early continental settlers to sailors, from the East Coast to the West Coast, from trips to Singapore to trips to Alaska, from crossing Imperial Russia to crossing the whole of Eurasia, L'Amour's characters are always on a frontier somewhere.And in THE WALKING DRUM, the entire world is frontier. To Kerbouchard, each place he goes, he learns something new, sees things that are exotic to his eyes, considers thinking by wise and venerable individuals, and reconsiders his entire view of the world.One particularly interesting note is that we see the source of the term &quot;Robber Baron.&quot; Far from being a term coined to describe American industrialist, we see Kerbouchard actually battle local nobles and feudal lords who use their power to loot and steal from travelers and traders -- that is, he battles barons who are robbers, or &quot;robber barons.&quot; In learning more about the past, we can better understand the present, and seek the future.As Kerbouchard says, &quot;Yol Bolson!&quot; May there be a road...."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"This book was fantastic, one i couldn't put down until the end. i read it in three days, then read it again! i am working on a paper for my humanities class, and this is the book i read. it was a real page turner, with romance, surprise around every corner, and great detail that added to the suspence and adventure. i give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I've also read _Last of the Breed_ by Mr. L'Amour, but hardly any of his westerns (that may change!). I thought both books were grand, and would easily rank them together, but the crucial question for me is: did he ever intend to write a sequel to _The Walking Drum_, and if he had, where is it?! He had left us on such a cliff-hanger (seemingly, though it may have only been my desire not to have it end) that I was sure there would be more..."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"If you like action, historical teaching presented in dramatic style, larger than life heroes, and a good paced plot, this novel is for you. If L'Amour occasionally makes his protagonist Kerbouchard so knowledgeable and skillful as to be unbelievable, it is understandable, given the high number of things L'Amour teaches the reader on all kinds of subjects. Fun reading, action packed, and well researched, this is a fine book."},{"Title":"The Walking Drum","review":"I have read at least 40 L'Amour books and this is by far his worst. ALthough an interesting setting and a nice change for Mr. L'Amour, the character was most annoying. He spent the majority of the book talking about how great he was and how smart he was and how smart people keep their mouth shut. Every single person the character met he ends up saying something that makes the person want to kill him. By the end of the book, there's about 4,000 people who want to kill him. I couldn't stand reading this book. It hurts me to be this hard on Mr. L'Amour, but this book was horrible."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"This is the first book I have read in this series. I thought I'd really like it, but I was extremely disappointed. It was dull and predictable. The vocabulary seemed odd like a person from other than the gold coast was speaking. Either the vocabualry was overworked or the author is British. It just didn't fit with the setting.After reading other reviews, I am not giving up on the series, (I have already bought 3 others)Maybe the rest will be better."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"I usually enjoy this series a lot, but this installment just didn't do it for me.Helen just took up with Phil in the last book, and already they're declaring their undying love for each other. Not once, but twice, Helen jumps to the wrong conclusion about Phil and his ex-wife and comes off as near-suicidal. It was just way too much too soon after the start of the romance.I also thought the plot was weak. Mother of the bride deaths are being done way too much lately. The characters come across as one-dimensional and unlikeable. Add that to a thin plot and this just wasn't as enjoyable as other installments of the series."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"Helen Hawthorne's new job is at Millicent's Bridal Salon. Somehow Helen thought a Bridal Salon would be a nice place to work. Happy brides wanting to make their special day perfect.That was before she met a running stream of Bridezilla's and their mothers. The worse is Desiree Shenrad, a true mouse and her tyrannical, rich and obnoxious mother Kiki, who not only makes all the decisions on the wedding, but seems to have even picked out the groom.It doesn't seem that big of a loss when Kiki winds up dead, stuffed in a closet at the wedding. Except that Helen's fingerprints seem to be all over the place and the police are giving her a second look.To prevent them from finding out who she is, Helen decides to investigate and discover who really wanted this mother-of-the-bride dead. Her ex-husband, her daughter, the prospective son-in-law, an actor that she wouldn't let take a part because it was degrading? What about Millicent, the bridal shop owner who had threatened her, or the chauffeur who thought she was leaving him a lot of money in her will, but was actually getting ready to dump him.With this list of suspects, Helen hoped it wouldn't take too long to find the killer, or the police may just uncover her hidden identity first.Highlights:The mystery was pretty good, a lot of suspects and Helen does actually investigate and finds clues which lead her to the killer.The romance of Margery - Helen's landlady and new resident Warren who teaches dancing.We didn't have to read the long drawn out version of why Helen's hiding.Lowlights.This series has been improving since the first book which I disliked, but this one is a set-back.The mystery was ok, but not only is Kiki such a horrible person that you don't care that she gets killed, you also don't care about anyone else. I hated them all.Phil - formerly Phil the pothead whose true identity came out in the last book and is now Helen's new boyfriend. I think Phil was a better character when he was unseen and only talked about.Why do so many people in these books always have to be ridiculously polite, Phil letting his ex-wife, who is trying to get him back move in with him while she's in town, even though he knows it upsets Helen and he can hear her crying about it. \\"She doesn't have anywhere to stay, so I have to let her stay here.\\" In real life you'd tell her to get a hotel and maybe, just maybe pay for a few nights there if she's pleading poverty.I'm hoping that the next book will be better."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"When Helen Hawthorne saw her husband having sex with another woman, she became so mad she smashed his car to pieces. The judge ordered them to split to the income when they sell their house equally and ordered Helen to pay alimony because supposedly he supposedly supported her career by being a house husband. Rather than give him a dime, Helen runs down to Ft. Lauderdale, going from a six figure job to a series of dead end positions that she receives remittance for under the table.Her latest job is as a salesperson at the posh Millicent's Bridal Salon but Helen discovers that weddings bring out the worst in people. Kiki is a rich mother of the bride who is determined to out shine her daughter on her wedding day. Kiki makes enemies wherever she goes as she believes her money insulates her from taking responsibility for her actions. On the day of the wedding Kiki is found murdered in a closet and Helen has to find out who the killer is because she is the police's number one suspect.JUST MURDERED is a hilarious chick-lit mystery where the bride and groom get married despite the fact that Kiki fails to attend. When her body is discovered, there are a host of suspects who would have liked to kill Kiki from the chauffer who was used as a stud to the owner of the bridal store who hasn't been paid for the gowns, accessories and the daughter who despised her mother. Readers will find themselves laughing out loud when Helen subtly tries to question the suspects, all of whom look at her as the hired help.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"Many years ago I enjoyed Elaine Viets' columns in the local St. Louis newspaper and I was delighted to find her talents had expanded into fun mystery fiction. The \\"dead-end jobs\\" series is funny and engaging and always good for a quick read. This, the 4th in the series i think, has really developed. The characters are more real and believable and because of that I care more about them. I'm looking forward to the next!"},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"These lite-mystery series books are a delightful change of pace from the usual books I read. This book moved along swiftly with just the right balance of intrigue and humor. I really enjoyed this story, felt sorry for Desiree, and did not figure out the crime until the solution was revealed!"},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"Just Murdered finds Helen now working at a bridal boutique and neck deep in all the drama that the wedding dress selection entails. While reading this, I found myself visualizing a television program I have enjoyed watching called \\"Say Yes to the Dress.\\" Several times on this show, the bride's mother (usually) moves Heaven and Earth to try to upstage the bride. A lot of fighting and arguments ensue, sometimes shouting matches even, and always lots of tears. The same can be said of this book. But unlike the TV show, the mother of the bride is murdered and the murder weapon is none other than a bridal gown!Sadly, out of all the tears that are shed, none are for the victim. I have to say, I wasn't crying over her demise either. The victim is a rich, arrogant tramp who makes out with her chauffeur on the street in plain sight of anyone walking by. She's condescending to Helen and her employer, Millicent. She's rude to just about everyone. She's cold and cruel to her daughter. She's vindictive to her ex-husband. Personally, I expected a horde of people lining up to kill this woman. Unfortunately for Helen, the police seem to be focused on her as their prime suspect since her fingerprints are all over the wedding gown. Frankly, the law enforcement element in this book leaves a lot to be desired. I found myself thinking throughout the book, \\"Hello, Detective, OF COURSE Helen's fingerprints are on the gown, you nit-wit, she works for the bridal boutique and is helping to dress the bride!\\" Helen even emphasizes this fact to them, but they seem to be a few sandwiches short of a picnic, so of course, Helen is going to have to figure out who the killer is on her own.Helen's new man in her life won't be much help either. Apparently, his wife that nobody, especially Helen, knew about has shown up for an unexpected visit and Helen is livid. I thought she handled the entire situation poorly. If she would have taken 5 minutes to listen to him, the entire mess could have been resolved. There is an interesting scene where Helen finds herself on the receiving end of some embarrassment when she tries to surprise Phil but his wife one-ups her. Frankly, I could have done without this story line. Helen's luck with relationships is a big fat zero so to my way of thinking, she should just focus on keeping her rent paid and feeding herself and her cat, Thumbs. Helen's near obsession with the whole thing was over the top and was distracting her from focusing on finding out who the killer is. Since I'm not all that thrilled with the Phil relationship anyway, I couldn't care less if he's married. Helen shouldn't be throwing rocks from inside her glass house anyway. She's got lots of secrets herself that she hasn't been forthcoming with anyone about. Pot and kettle and all that.I'm still invested in this series, though I'm not sure why. Maybe Phil will grow on me and Helen might actually get herself on track and get her past resolved so she can focus on a smooth future. In the meantime, she manages to muddle her way through, finds the killer without getting herself killed or at the very least, seriously hurt. There are currently eleven books in this series, so I haven't even gotten halfway through yet. A lot can happen between now and then. I can say with absolute certainty that I enjoyed this dead-end job better than her last one. Helen's next job is at a pet boutique so I'm hopeful that this series hasn't yet gone to the dogs."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"This may be the 5th or 6th of the Helen Hawthorne series that I've read so far. I love the characters and the humor in each book. So I was looking forward to \\"Just Murdered\\". Since there were so many elaborately written reviews I will touch on a few highlights.Unfortunately, this book did not measure up to the standard set in the previous books by Elaine Viets. I found it a bit uninteresting and routine. Who the murderer could be was quite a line up since Kiki (mother of the bride) was hideously awful.I did not enjoy Phil (Helen's beau) allowing his ex-wife to move into his apartment. It was totally unrealistic since he had been an undercover agent for so long-Phil was definitely presented as the last person that could be taken advantage of by an ex.Thankfully, Helen's landlady, Margery, remained as colorful both in words and wardrobe as before. She's one of the characters I look forward to.The con artists that move into apartment 2C is getting old. It may be time to create another scenario.I have 2 other books in the Dead End series that I will be reading and hoping that I can get back to the interesting pace that this series held before for me.Ellen"},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"I am a mother of the bride for the third (and last!) time, and I didn't recognize ANY of the brides or the mothers with the exception of LaTonya & Dorcas. Five days ago my daughter, her sisters (the bridesmaids), and I went to Priscilla of Boston, as her gown had come in and her sisters needed to be measured. Everything went smoothly and beautifully. There were other brides there, but I didn't hear a single angry word or any irrational demands (like the matching carpet!). Maybe that's because this was McLean, VA, and not FL. However, my experiences with all three were nothing like any of the ones described, except for LaTonya & her mother Dorcas (I did NOT break out into song, however!).Aside from that, I enjoyed the book. I think Phil was stupid to let Kendra stay with him. I think Margery is great--wish I had a friend like her. I'm not sure why they chose Richard III as the play--Luke should have been Romeo or Benedick or a romantic hero--even Hamlet.And I don't understand why Helen doesn't open up to Sarah. She's a true friend who would understand & help her. I don't see why she thinks she'll be brought back to St. Louis in handcuffs, either.However, I do enjoy these books. I've read all of the Mystery Shopper and all of the earlier Dead End Jobs, and I've enjoyed them. I am about to start Murder Unleashed. I just think that there's too much suspension of disbelief asked for here. And not all brides are Bridezillas--none of my daughters were (nor Platinum Brides, for that matter)."},{"Title":"Just Murdered (Dead-End Job Mystery)","review":"In this latest Dead-End Job installment, series heroine, Helen Hawthorne, finds herself up to her neck in trouble when she ends up, horrors of horrors, on the suspect list of South Florida's latest society murder.Helen's latest dead-end job is at an upscale bridal boutique, Millicent's Bridal Salon. For once, Helen's boss turns out to be not only a savvy businesswoman, but also a relatively nice one that Helen can admire. The same, however, cannot be said for most of the clients that frequent the store, and the hateful mother of the bride-to-be, Kiki Shenrad, in particular. Obnoxious, demanding, attention grabbing and a sex maniac, Kiki wants the best -- not for her only daughter (the mousy and chinless Desiree) -- but for herself. As Helen watches with fascinated horror, Kiki manages to offend everyone from Helen's boss, Millicent, to the groom-to-be, to Kiki's ex-husband (and Desiree's father), to Helen herself; but the last thing Helen expected was to come across Kiki dead body stuffed in a closet at the church on the very day of the wedding, the day after Kiki had threatened to have Helen fired. With her fingerprints at the scene of the crime, and the police taking more than a casual interest in her, Helen knows that she has to solve this murder before the police can uncover the secret past she's running from...I enjoyed \\"Just Married\\" even though it was not, in my opinion the best Dead-End installment. And this was not because \\"Just Married\\" possessed a boring storyline or was badly written. To the contrary. I just thought that the author had spent too much time on Helen's problem with her boy friend, Phil. And while I appreciated that this added to the texture of the novel, and allowed us to understand better how much Helen had gone through before her momentous move from St. Louis, and how much she had suffered, and everything had just made a little leery about trusting men too much, I really wanted for Helen to buckle down, follow the clues and question the many suspects alibis and motives.

Several reviewers have complained about this as a defect in the dictionary, so it is worth pointing out that in Old English the eth and thorn characters are used interchangeably. The phonetic quality of each is determined not by the character used, but by its placement in the word. For instance, at the beginning or end of a word, it is voiceless, but it is voiced when falling between other voiced sounds. (Here the other reviewers were, perhaps, confusing things with Old Norse, in which eth does always = voiced \\"th,\\" and thorn = its voiceless counterpart.)Now, one may say that the dictionary editors might have been more charitable by standardizing the eth and thorn characters, one each for voiced and voiceless \\"th\\" (as some editors do) to aid in pronunciation, and that would be a fair statement; on the other hand, it would be equally fair to assert that students of (or even dabblers in) Old English are expected to be able to tell the difference without the editors' help.

Clark Hall dictionary was published in the 1890s and there have been 3 subsequent editions (1916, 1930ish, and most recently, around 1964). This book appears to be a scanned version of the 1890s edition, meaning that it is not only lacking the updates of more recent editions, it is also barely legible, because the original font has been condensed and darkened to the extent that it's almost impossible to discern the difference between some Anglo-Saxon characters and Modern English characters. Since this is a dictionary, the importance of being able to tell how something is spelled is quite obvious. Further, the definitions themselves are not much easier to read - the text itself is less thick but it's often broken off mid-letter.

However, as a student (two semesters so far) of OE, as opposed to a research scholar, I find it very adequate to my needs, and a useful supplement to glossaries found in textbooks and editions. Handy and economical, it's great for what it is, and more useful than the online resources I've found so far."},{"Title":"A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary","review":"I was taking a course in Old English last year and bought the dictionary for that.

The Five serie is about four teenagers and their dog who encounter adventures everywhere they go. It is the ultimate teen fantasy because these guys are on their own under the permission of their parents, traveling through England on their summer vacations, staying in cool places (such as castles, mansions, farms, open country, deserted islands, etc.) while defeating bandits and thiefs. The personalities of each character are very defined and the guest characters are equally awesome.

I guess that I am just used to reading love stories, and not adventure stories.I love to read, but when I was reading this, I was not interested, and my mind wondered instead of actually getting into the book. I just thought that it was written poor, and not exactly thought about clearly. That is just my opinion though, I did not like Treasure Island, I thought that it was very uninteresting.

What, asks Silverberg, if the Roman Empire had never really collapsed but instead endured and prospered? Silverberg proceeds to answer this question by highlighting a series of 10 historical moments in such an alternative history that could mark key turning points in such an Empire. The vignettes themselves are often absorbing and Silverberg mixes in just enough actual history to make the venture worthwhile. Human nature, one sees, remains the same irrespective of ruler or system of government. The Empire parallels with real history like the bloody purges of Robespierre and the colonial voyages that subjugated (often brutally) the Orient and the New World. For all its ponderous bureaucratic inertia and the sheer logistic barriers, the Empire is pervasive and powerful enough to crush any attempt at true democracy - brief flickers of a \\"Republic\\" which is more an oligarchy or merchant aristocracy are as far as we go. In the end, a band of Hebrews seeks to escape to another plant as the only alternative to Rome's crushing embrace.Bold as this attempt at alternative history is, Silverberg strangely falters thereafter. His examination of the circumstances in each of the 10 events is disappointingly shallow and the ending in particular seems highly contrived. A map of the world using the Roman names for various countries and a parallel timeline linking the Roman dates with the AD calendar would have made things easier for the reader as well. Having read several of Silverberg's masterpieces. I expected better from him. I started reading this book as if sitting down to a delicious meal; by the end, it was as if the food had been but an illusion and my hunger remained unappeased."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Three characteristics recommended this book to me: 1) I am a fan of Roman history 2) I love SF short stories 3) Robert Silverberg is one of my favorite authors. With this combination, I figured I couldn't go wrong and bought this book on a whim without looking at Amazon's ratings, which I have come to rely on increasingly. I'll detail why all 3 of these characteristics failed this book and forced me to rate it 1 star, the lowest rating I have ever given a book. Normally, I don't finish books that bad but my mistake was to take too few books with me on my 3 week vacation (which was a Danube river cruise followed by a week in Constantinople/Istanbul since my hobby is visiting all the current countries that made up the Roman Empire at it's greatest extent). Therefore, I didn't have enough books to read and, once I finished everything else, I had to read this book or nothing during my cruise.1) I expected Silverberg to be more knowledgeable about Roman history. Reading this book, my illusion disappeared quickly but as I plowed through this incessant book, I expected that he would delve further into Roman history than tossing off a few place names and the barest outlines of the empire's history. Ostensibly, Silverberg visited a few well-known Roman sites like Tivoli and Capri since he constantly refers to them but the problem with that is he, well, constantly refers to them.2) The SF extrapolations and even simple plot elements are virtually non-existent. These \\"stories\\" are more vignettes with the last few pages wrapping up what plot elements there are.3) Silverberg's writing is well-crafted but his characterization is thin and his plots, as I mentioned above, don't exist.If you like Silverberg, I strongly recommend avoiding this book and buying some of his excellent work such as Nightwings, Dying Inside, At Winter's End, Kingdoms of the Wall, etc. If you like Roman History, read Tacitus, Suetonius, and even Procopius. If you like Alternate History about the Roman Empire, read Harry Turtledove's Krispos Trilogy, Videssos series, or Agent of Byzantium. Turtledove is a professor of Byzantine/Roman history and a master of alternative history. His worst efforts look good next to this mess."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"I have to admit to a soft spot in my heart for anything by Robert Silverberg, since he's written some of the books that most moved me over the years. From Thorns to Shaderach in the Furnace to Up the Line, he has written an amazing number of classic novels and shorter fare. Despite the fact that he's written many pure SF novels, he also has a fondness and penchant for writing about the ancient world.Here we get a set of short stories (which is not clear from the cover: bad publisher, no biscuit!) which display the unique tone and amazing attention to detail that characterizes much of his work. The quality is a bit uneven, with some of the stories being somewhat unreadable, but the majority of them are quite good and one or two are very good indeed.For example, the first story after the front matter (\\"With Caesar in the Underworld\\") bears the plot of Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, with a lead character of Faustus (\\"Falstaff\\"), set in the wonderfully decadent ancient Rome of this alternate history. There are little sparkly details throughout that make the story bump along, teasing you with both the puzzles that form the alternate history bits and the tidbits of fun (parallels with the lifted Shakespeare plot, for example). It... tickles.Other reviewers have complained that Silverberg doesn't dive as deeply into the history part, that the stories are all little \\"what if...\\" one-trick ponies. But I think those reviewers are missing the fact that in virtually all of these character driven stories, there is at least one other \\"angle\\" that Silverberg is playing with. Once I recognized what he was doing, it was a lot of fun to both read the stories as straight AH yarns and also be watching for the sly games.This isn't the Silverberg of the great early 70's novels. Nor does it quite match his lovely time-travel novel \\"Up the Line\\" (if you've not read that, get it with this). It's just that no one except possibly Gene Wolfe quite matches his style and careful, multi-layered craftsmanship. I enjoyed this collection (despite, as noted, some warts) and, if you like alternate history, you probably will too."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Robert Silverberg's \\"Roma Eterna\\" is actually a collection of short stories he wrote between 1989 and 2003 detailing a Roman Empire that never fell. While each story is a stand-alone tale within the alternate history of the world, taken together, they read much like another recent alternate history that details a radically different history of Euroe and Asia: Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Years of Rice and Salt\\".It becomes apparent very early in the book that Silverberg envisions not merely one but a chain of events as being necessary for Rome to not fall: a failed Jewish Exodus, Christianity never arising, a strong Emperor heading off the Third Century crisis, a definitive destruction of the Northern barbarians and Persia and an assassination of Mohammed before he could spread the word of Allah. In the context of world history we as we know it, the chain is a pretty fragile one, but it does make for an interesting exercise in history - much like the entire book. Some of his ideas have a very real ring of possibility to them: a Rome squandering the military might of a generation on an unsuccessful attempt at invading the Americas, Eastern and Western Empires that eventually fall on each other in a series of Civil Wars, a Rome grown fat and decadent on trade throughout the world that breeds emperors even more insane and bizarre than those known historically. However, for each of these interesting and realistic twists, he allows himself more than a few historical parallels: the World Wars, Leonardo da Vinci, the French Revolution - and his modern Rome (of 1970) bears a great deal of resemblance to a modern Europe under a traditional Roman hegemony.In all, though, I really liked this book, although I suspect it's not for everyone. In fact, I would direct scholars or fans of Roman and Byzantine history towards it before I would the average sci-fi/fantasy/alternate history fan. He knows his Roman history well, and he's not afraid to make obscure use of it. Sometimes this makes for neat touches (like having the Eastern Empire fall to the West in 1453, the year the Eastern Empire in actuality fell to the Ottomans), and sometimes it just makes for a lot of names and dates. The book is basically one great conceit to the 'what if' bundled inside an extensive history. If that's your sort of thing (and it certainly is mine), you'll love it. Otherwise, you may find youself rapidly bored or confused."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"A collection of short stories that, alas, should probably have stayed short stories. Grouped together like this, the niggling little problems with each one amass into one or two huge glaring headaches.The premise of this book, of course, is that the Roman Empire never fell. Unlike most alternative history, this involves not just one point of departure, but a series of highly improbable occurrences that would allow the Empire - indeed, any empire - to last over 2500 years. If you can swallow that premise, you shouldn't have much trouble with any of the other stories in this book, give or take a few historical howlers.The stories are interesting historical fiction, but not until the end do they become good alternate history. 90% of the book could conceivably have taken place during the actual time of the Roman Empire, and didn't need to be set in the 14th or 19th centuries at all.The stories are told from an interesting perspective, all of them narrated by someone close to the Imperial throne but usually lacking any real power or influence. Unfortunately, there is no continuity in the characters from one chapter to the next. Kim Stanley Robinson achieved this masterfully in \\"The Years of Rice and Salt\\"; given the many comparisons to his book I wish Silverburg could have done the same. With no main character to root for, the chapters remain a set of disjointed short stories - enjoyable in and of themselves, but I wish a bit more work had gone into turning them into a full-length novel."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Honestly, I had to try to start this book three times before I was able to \\"get into\\" it. The apparent strangeness of Silverberg's Roman moral values and place names made it difficult to comprehend at first, but once I dug down and decided to finish it, I was extremely pleased by its twists and turns.What other reviewers have found bothersome about this book I found to be its greatest strengths. When writing an alternative history, what are the rules? Why shouldn't we have a Renaissance (of sorts), or similar language development? Silverberg (I have always thought) is a SciFi author, so why not include elements of that genre? Not being of the Jewish faith, I cannot speak for the \\"offensiveness\\" of those elements of the story, but I can't help but think that someone would bring it up; like it or not, the histories of Jerusalem and Rome are intertwined, and with a name like Silverberg, how could he not make use of those themes?I loved it. It took some time to get used to this different type of storytelling, but it was worth every penny."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"If it hadn't been for our home computer acting up, I might not have ever finished reading this book.It's an interesting premise: Silverberg posits a world where the Roman Empire never fell. It just kept on going. And yet the way Silverberg tried to tell this story fell flat in so many ways.First of all, there's the structure. Rather than pick one time period and stick with it, Silverberg keeps jumping through time. The book is essentially a series of unconnected short stories, the only thing in common being the setting. Just when you're starting to care about the characters in the story, that story ends and they're never mentioned again. Or, if they are, it's an off-handed reference that really doesn't go anywhere.Second, there's the repetitious nature of Silverberg's backstory. If he told me one more time that Maximilianus III subdued the barbarians once and for all, I'm pretty sure I would have torn my hair out. He did this time after time after time. And I kept thinking, I know, I know, you told me this ten pages ago!.That's another problem. Lots of telling, not a lot of showing. It made for weak storytelling.But the thing that really bothered me the most was Silverberg's point of historical departure. He posited that the reason why the Roman Empire never fell is because Christianity never existed. Now I've got theological problems with that that I won't go into here simply because those reasons aren't the reason why my suspended disbelief kept trying to unsuspend itself. I know that historians have suggested that Christianity brought about the fall of the Roman Empire. Given that possibility, it's within the realm of reason to believe that a lack of Christianity would mean a longer lasting Empire. The merits of the argument are beyond the scope of this book review and I leave that particular debate to people with more abbreviations behind their names than I.No, there are two major reasons why I didn't like this point of departure. The first has to do with the idea of trajectory. Silverberg removes Christianity from the historical scene by having the Exodus fail. No Exodus, he reasons, no Isreal. No Isreal, no Jews. No Jews, no Christianity.So that might work, but my problem here is that that leaves 1,200 years (at least) where things would be substantially different. No Exodus, no kingdom of Israel, right? Well, that leaves a power vacuum in the ancient world that would have to be filled. Who knows what might have arisen in the land of Canaan. A Philistine Empire? Would Egypt, who was the nominal overlords of the region at the time, maintained their hold, thus allowing them to resist the Assyrians and Babylonians? Who knows?Silverberg's premise of removing the Exodus and only removing Christianity is far-fetched to the point of ridiculousness. It's entirely possible that by undoing the Exodus, the Roman Empire might never have arisen. The butterfly theory and all that.The second reason why this point of departure is so ridiculous to me is because of what Silverberg does in his introduction. He has two Roman historians meet and discuss ancient history and one of them says something along these lines: \\"Well, what if that Moses guy had succeeded? Well, then, a religion may have arisen, based on resurrection, that would have appealed to Roman society and radically changed our society.\\"Um, excuse me? That's an awfully big intellectual leap for someone to make. Too big of one, if you ask me. Sure, Silverberg is trying to explain what's missing, but that could have been made pretty clear in short order rather than with the ham-fisted way he did.According to Silverberg's biography, he's an award-winning author. Quite frankly, based on this book, I can't imagine why and I don't really care to learn. For me, if I want to see some good counterfactual storytelling in this same vein, I'll re-read Harry Turtledove's Agent of Byzantium. Much better and not quite so ludicrous."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"When I saw this book at the library and read the synopsis on the book jacket, I thought it looked like a really interesting concept. I was expecting a story set roughly in the present in a vast all-encompassing Roman Empire that never fell. I wanted to see the differences of culture an technology and how they would be different in modern life if they had evolved out of such a mighty empire. However, what I got instead were several short stories set in a constantly decaying, but never quite falling, Roman Empire.Despite being a little disappointed that this was a book of short stories, instead of what I had expected, I still thought it might be interesting to see some of the things that I mentioned above, as the Empire evolves. However, while a couple of the stories were pretty good, most were just ok, and a couple (including the last) were terrible. Instead of telling stories about the greatness of the Empire and how it expands throughout the years, and the technology that comes along with it, the stories are more about how the Empire just barely hangs on (or doesn't, temporarily) despite many factors that threaten it. And the technology that I thought would be particulary interesting was barely mentioned at all. There are passing mentions of a printing press and picture postcards, and some talk of building an elevator that is never realized, but no discussion of how technological advancements were made in this alternate version of history. I was also particularly disappointed by the fact that the technology that was mentioned in the stories pretty much corresponded to when those things came about in actual history. But I would have thought, that if the Roman Empire never fell, technology would have progressed at a slightly faster, if not much faster rate, especially considering how advanced the Romans seemed to be in such things. Also without the Dark Ages that followed the Empire's collapse, I would think things would have progressed further in that time. Finally, the most annoying thing about the book was that the last story did not seem to belong at all. It was not a story about the Empire, aside from being set in it, and was completely different from all the others in the book. It was also one of the shortest and probably the worst of the stories in the book.I wouldn't recommend this book, although if you know what to expect going into it, you may enjoy it more then I did."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Years ago, Marvel Comics put forth a series of books called \\"What If?\\" These comics speculated on alternate realities caused by a key event in Marvel history occurring in a different manner than actually depicted (such as what if Peter Parker's Uncle Ben had not been killed). Sometimes things would be happier, sometimes much graver. This was my introduction to the concept of alternate histories, which is a healthy subgenre of science fiction. Robert Silverberg's \\"what if\\" scenario deals with Rome: what if the Roman Empire never fell?In Roma Eterna, the key event actually takes place even before the founding of Rome. The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt never succeeded, therefore Judaism never became more than a minor cult. Christianity would never develop and Islam would hardly ever get off the ground. The full impact on Rome would not be felt, however, until the time of Constantine the Great, after which real history and speculative history diverge.The book is reminiscent of James Michener-style historical novels where there the only real character is the place. We are given episodes over a fourteen hundred year period that show the trials the Empire would face from civil wars to rebellions. The human characters come and go, but Rome remains.If there is a theme in this book, it deals with the inevitability of certain historic events. Even though the exact details are different, there are events that distinctly parallel that of the real world: the discovery of the New World, the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution. Technological development seems rather slow considering there were no \\"Dark Ages\\" to slow down innovation, but then again, there are also indications that the continued existence of the Empire has created intellectual stagnation.There is no real plot in Roma Eterna; the book is more like a biography, albeit one about a nation rather than a person. Silverberg's a veteran writer (he's been writing for half a century or so), and his experienced touch is definitely evident in this book, earning it a high four stars. This will be an enjoyable book for either fans of alternative histories or Roman history."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"I read this book because the plot idea, an alternative history ofthe world without the fall of Rome, sounded interesting. Eachchapter is a snapshot in history, using the Roman dating system.I would have liked to see a modern date as a reference to help mekeep track of my world vs the ficitonal world. I also had adifficult time keeping track of all the characters.Some things I didn't like about the plot:Why was their a medieval period and a renaissance when there wasno dark ages?What drove industrialization? Trains and automobiles justappear, with no explanation of where or when they were invented.The thing that kept me reading to the end:The whole premise was interesting. How would the world bedifferent if Rome had not fallen? It is interesting to thinkand read about."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"The premise of this book is: what would have happened to the history of the world if the Roman Empire had never fallen? Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt: rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do. However, because of that most people wouldn't try it.The book would have been better as a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a story in itself, and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are, clearly, dead. Another annoying thing about this method is that each chapter he has one of the characters recap the entire history of the Roman Empire, including all the chapters that you just finished reading.Silverberg is also pretty inconsistent in certain things. First, he tries to Romanize all the place names in the beginning to the point that sometimes you don't know where he's talking about. But then on the next page he mentions the German boarder. Not only that, but when they discover the New World (a.k.a., Nova Roma) they come across Mexico and Peru. Also, later in the book he talks about how \\"Londin and Parisi\\" were major cities. I'm not that up on Roman history, but were those really the names of those cities during the Roman Empire?There's also a bunch of historical inconsistencies. He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell, but yet there is still a \\"medieval\\" period (complete with knighthood) and a Renaissance. The Renaissance doesn't make sense because if there was no real \\"Dark Ages,\\" how can they have a Renaissance? However, if I recall correctly, the whole concept of knighthood was part of the feudal system that arose as a form of organization once the Roman Empire fell. WWI and WWII also happen around the same times, but under the names of the First and Second Wars of Reunificantion. However, he's also somewhat inconsistent about what these wars refer to, having the Second War of Reunification refer first to subduing fights in the outer provinces and in the next chapter having it refer to the founding of the Second Republic. He's also inconsistent in the numbering of Emperors. For example, all of a sudden he has Trajan VII who is from Hispania and yet somehow even though it's special enough to mention that he's from Hispania, his name is still the same as six other Emperors before him, also you cannot seem to figure out when these people ever ruled. Not to mention my annoyance at the fact that the languages in Europe develop in exactly the same way that they did, which I'm not entirely sure would have happened if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen.A big part of my annoyance comes from his treatment of the Hebrews. First of all, Silverberg is clearly of the belief that the Roman Empire fell because of the Christians. So how can he make Christianity not start in the first place? Well, clearly by having the Exodus fail and the Hebrews remain slaves in Egypt. Of course something that I realized toward the end of the book is that he refers to the Hebrews having followed the Law. If they never left Egypt, how did they get this Law? Not only that but I found it offensice that he portrays the Hebrews as being greedy and miserly with their money. He says that the Hebrews have a \\"knack for finance\\" (87) and one of the Hebrew characters in the first chapter is the only one \\"who kept the strings of his purse drawn tight\\" (28) while others are giving money to street entertainers. That stereotype arose in the Middle Ages because the Church restricted Jews to being moneylenders. However, (a) that's after the point in the story that the book starts at and (b) the stereotype would not have have been created if the the Roman Empire hadn't fallen. Yet Silverberg treats that stereotype as truth, and I find that offensive."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Yawn..............I used to enjoy Silverberg's books and stories.

I had to order it from the used booksellers here, and it turned out to be an expensive purchase, but when it arrived I was just so very excited to get it. That lasted just about as long as reading the dust jacket blurb.....which was basically the evil Roman empire had kept the Jewish people in bondage for thousands of years and now they were going to finally escape in spacecraft. Oh no. No, no, no......I nearly didn't read the book after that, but, as it turns out, this isn't an evil Roman empire book at all and the blurb was just about as misleading a one as I have ever read in my life.No, this book has it's problems, but it certainly isn't about Romans persecuting Jews for thousands of years as implied by the cover. The problems I had with the book are that it is not a novel but a series of short stories showing an alternate hsitory in which Rome does not fall. The short story approach creates a very choppy narrative and overall I didn't find the alternative history all that plausible or the writing that compelling. The book is OK, and I have enjoyed Silverberg as a writer in the past, but I was left fairly disappointed with this work. Part of the problem I think is that Silverberg never considered this as a novel...it just a series a different ideas he had at different times and created short stories out of. Then they are all strung together to make this tale. I'd love to read an alternative Roman history work where the author sat down and figured out the big picture first and then colored in all the details later. Robert Conroy did a good job of this in his \\"1901\\" which I found fascinating. My overall recommendation: you won't miss anything if you don't read this one."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"This is not a novel but a series of vignettes about a Roman Empire that never fell. Therefore, we do not have a singular location (except occasionally Rome), no set of major characters and no common theme. Still, some of the individual stories are good, a few are well-written.But the flaws are everywhere. There's the names. Every individual has three or more L-O-N-G names (\\"Germanicus Romulus Laedaerius\\"). I found myself skimming over Consuls, guards, Senators, etc. It was like reading an ancient Roman phone book. And those not so cute historical references. Alternate history is either like Tutledove - the same characters appear despite huge historical changes (dumb) - or an entirely new world is created (DUNE). Silverberg chose the former.Muhammed is consumed with Allah despite his unfamiliarity with Judaism and Christianity from whence Islam emerged. The blurb spoke of Romans cruelly conquering the Mayans yet all I read were failed attempts. And where is the \\"astounding technology\\" advertised? Unless it refers to the horrid last chapter and the rocket ship ludicrously built by a few Jews in Egypt. When it explodes, an onlooker suddenly screams that Moses, the man aboard, was God's son - despite the fact that children of a God is anathema to Jews. Did someone held a gun to the author's head and force him to finish it in 5 minutes?The treatment of Jews was simultaneously expected, trite and awful. Are we to belief that after 2,500 years only 20,000 are around? And how come the Roman government structure remains unchanged for 2,600 years? How does Rome launch an Industrial Revolution with the Protestant Reformation and private capital? Where is China all this time? My Grade - D+"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Like other reviewers, I found the ending rather awkward, however the majority of the book contains some of Mr. Silverberg's strongest writing in many years. The characters are varied and unique, and while many of them are duplicitious and scheming, they make for interesting plot twists. The story is well fleshed-out with eloquent descriptions that immersed me deeply in this alternate history.I must mention here in defense of the author, and reviewer complaints of stereotyping of Jews, that the author is himself Jewish. Events are told through the eyes of the characters, and most sophisticated readers will know better than to assume the opinions and perceptions of the characters represent objective \\"truths\\" in that fictional world or actual prejudices on the part of the author in our own. The real Roman empire was in fact beset with prejudices against various groups. Had anyone somehow missed all that, the ending should clear it up.Not Silverberg's best book, but relatively high on the list. The premise is ambitious, and he fulfills it well, with a humanism rare in alternate histories."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"&quot;Roma Eterna&quot; is a collection of 10 different short stories masquerading as a novel, that raises some tantalizing questions to answer the central, overarching question in this book: What if the Roman Empire never fell, but not only survived, but endured to the present as the foremost empire on the globe? It is not Silverberg's best work of fiction (His finest works include early novels such as &quot;Shadrach in the Furnace&quot; and his critically acclaimed series, &quot;The Majipoor Chronicles&quot; which began with &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot;.), and yet remains a compelling collection of tales which should interest alternative history fans. The best tales include &quot;Waiting for the End&quot;, where a Romanicized Greek bureaucrat awaits the conquest of the Eternal City by Greek Byzantine forces sent from Constantinople, attempting to unify the divided Latin and Greek halves of the empire, &quot;Via Roma&quot;, where a young aristocratic Celtic Briton witnesses in Rome the bloody downfall of the Empire and the rise of the &quot;Second Republic&quot;, and &quot;Tales from the Venia Woods&quot;, where two Teutonic children unknowingly reveal the hiding place of the last of the Caesars, the last Roman emperor. The final tale, &quot;To the Promised Land&quot;, about Hebrews building spaceships to escape Earth and an inevitable collapse of the Second Republic is among the least effective in this collection. And yet, to Robert Silverberg's credit, he has written a future history almost as compelling as Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot;."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Robert Silverberg is my favorite author of sci-fi/fantasy/alternate history, and Rome is one of my favorite fictional subjects. I was, therefore, quite disappointed with this sporadically interesting compilation of previously published short stories as a single work.Given its origin, &quot;Roma Eterna&quot; is not so much a novel as a series of sometimes interrelated, more or less grand tableaux of incidents in the history of Roman civilization continuing unbroken to contemporary times.Some episodes are more interesting than others: Waiting for the End and Via Roma, for example, are often suffused with an autumnal glow of nostalgia which is very enticing and convincing. Getting to Know the Dragon, on the other hand, is simply boring, while the final segment, To the Promised Land, is just plain silly.I find two main problems with the book: 1) Silverberg violates a key ingredient in any successful alternate history by following the Point of Departure (the slaughter of the Hebrews by the shores of the Red Sea in mid-Exodus) by usually slavish imitation of real historical events between then and now. In a first-rate alternate history, the Point of Departure leads us to an entirely new world. 2) Since the book was originally short stories, every has the nature of a simple vignette, largely without any character development.And there's a certain sameness about it all, which gets stale after a while.As a history buff, I have other criticisms which may be irrelevant to some readers. For example, Silverberg apparently hasn't researched Rome enough to get proper names correctly -- he consistently mixes up surnames, clan names and personal names, which were logically ordered in Roman Latin and which this author mixes and matches without any order whatsoever. He should correspond with writers who really know Rome -- such as Lindsay Davis or Steven Saylor -- before attempting this sort of thing again. And then there are anachronisms, as in the final episode when the protagonist has a dream of the slaughter of his ancestors by the armies of Pharoah, while Moses holds aloft the tablets of the Law. However, the Law was given to Moses on Mt. Sinai AFTER the crossing of the Red Sea, so how could it exist in Egypt? Call me picky, but that's just sloppy writing and bad editing.So, forget Roma Eterna. If you want to know what Silverboerg can accomplish in the full flood of his enormous talent, read the never-surpassed Majipoor Chronicles."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Roma Eterna starts with an interesting concept: The Exodus failed, so there is no Jesus; Without the Christian church, the Roman Empire stands for all time (or at least until the end of the book). The book is chopped up into several short stories, and I found it to be very hard to put down initally. The writing is gripping, even if keeping dates and names straight can be a little tough.However, the book seems to run out of steam for the final 80 pages or so, starting with \\"Via Roma\\". This incredibly boring short story takes four pages worth of material and stretches it into fifty. Reading the book at this point became a chore. The story after Via Roma is better, but it and the final story don't really connect the way the first seven do.I wish I could give this book a 3.5, but since you can't do that, I've rounded it up to a four. Despite the disappointing final stretch, this is a good book. Recommended if you're something of a roman history buff. Those without much knowledge or interest in ancient Rome will probably want to pass."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Basically a series of vignettes, not a cohesive story at all, Roma Eterna falls victim to a couple of mistaken assumptions. The first of these is that without Judaeo-Christianity and Islam the Empire would have stood. The empire fell more from its own weight than any \\"outside\\" influences. The second, and, for me, much more glaring one, is Silverberg's assumption of an industrial revolution without any of the pre-conditions necessary for one. As stated by S.M. Stirling in his review of another work, without the Aquinan worldview adopted by post-medieval Christianity, there is no scientific or industrial revolution. The Romans were notoriously incurious about what made the world around them tick and their system of gods and goddesses had no rationality. Without those two elements, you have no reason or basis for the kind of systematic research which led to our world of today and simply cannot have the last third of the book. Still a nice read, but not anywhere close to Silverberg's best"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"The Exodus failed to take the Jews from Egypt into the Promised Land. Thus Christianity never surfaces as the Jewish people remain enslaved in Egypt. Still Rome rises to defeat the neighboring Barbarians. The rest is history (at least alternative) as key global events fostered by ROMA ETERNA starting in A.U.C. 1203 (A.D. 405 our time) into the next fifteen centuries occur as the Roman Empire ebbs and grows.Robert Silverberg rewrites several of his related short stories into an epic alternative historical novel that engages the reader with intriguing theories of how much different the world would be if one pivotal event (albeit Moses leading the Jews) had a different ending. Though entertaining and easily hooking the audience, the tale still feels more like a short story collection as none of the characters (over the fifteen hundred years) feel fully developed. Still sub-genre readers will relish this fascinating saga of a seemingly eternal Roman Empire as each subsequent chapter builds off of events that chronologically (and literally) preceded it.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"This is a fun book: just suppose the Roman empire had continued for another 1500 years...? The stories are light and are written with the shallow depth of a young writer (which Silverberg is not). The chapters are a series of short stories, many previously published but recast here with dollops of cross-references. Silverberg takes the charming tack of seeing everything from slightly below, from noble Romans near the Emperor but on the outs in obscure places: an historian (for the key displacement event, of course: no intolerant Christians), an adventurer in the Roman Underworld (literally), an exile in Arabia (Mecca in the 7th century...), an underofficer in an army attempting to invade the Yucatan once more, a Greek translator to a cowardly emperor, etc. This device allows Silverberg to \\"sneak up on\\" key historic events and perhaps surprise the reader as well. He turns each chapter into something of a mystery: where is this chapter going? Besides Romans and Greeks, Silverberg is inordinately fond of Hebrews, a peculiar little holier-than-thou sect that pops up here and there.I was disappointed in my expectations. This book is not a more thorough projection of how a Roman empire could have continued and evolved. Silverberg merely adapts as somehow Roman several of the major trends and innovations of actual Western history to our present. The focus is mostly politics and religion, but written without developing significant change in ancient Roman belief and practices. He is forced to reference true ancient Romans as the heroic exemplars for his characters because only historical figures will carry moral weight to the reader&#65533;yet are most likely to have been forgotten by the lowly characters in the stories set a thousand years on. Nothing is too serious&#65533;there's little about what happened to slavery, to provincial government, the evolution of modern languages, or how they dovetail with technological developments. Because the chapters are set a century or two apart, there can be no continuity and development of his characters. Finally, the conclusion is a limp apotheosis. These may be my problems with the book rather than yours."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Hmm, well I have been a great admirer of Silverberg's short stories in the past, and there are one or two more than decent ones here. It does not however seem to have occured to the author that the idea of the roman empire persisting for 2000 years, rather than fascinating, could actually be quite dull if not handled very imaginatively. The problem with attemping this sort of thing is that the real history of the period in question is usually a lot more interesting than the alternate.It may be a a minor and idiosyncratic gripe, but abandoning the common english versions of names for the ubiquitous -us latin suffix, eg Hadrianus, Diocletianus etc etc etc, added noticeably to the sometimes pervasive sense of dullness for me at least."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Maybe I should have had my knowledge of history refreshed a little more before I read this book. Or maybe the diversions from our real history should have been made a little clearer. Either way, there was a lot of wasted potential in this book. The way the story is told is probably the most appropriate but I honestly don't care for it too much. It looks more like a collection of old short stories that have been tied together by connecting or non-connecting pieces. There is no doubt that the scope is epic as advertised on the back cover, but the separate parts don't really come together for me. Again, maybe this a lack of historical background on my side - or maybe I just don't agree with the weighing of the different parts of the story. The discovery of the New World is interesting and then somewhat abandoned. The \\"French\\" revolution is dragging along and I am still waiting for some sort of enlightenment here. I would have wished that the story was told from a smaller perspective with more emphasis on the technical advancements also.

Lately his writing seems to be an exercise in sleepwalking. He can write so well that he doesn't need to put things in such as plot or characterization. He's done this in Alien Years and half a dozen recent books. Roma Eterna has two to three good novellas in them; the rest is blather. In fact, two of the middle stories (published in Asimov's no less) have no real science fictional content and are basically expository: someone is telling the reader of a story someone told _them_. There is little dialogue in this collection; mostly it's just Silverberg adroitly peppering his narrative with details he's gleaned from books about ancient Rome. Time and time again Silverberg seems to crank out passable stories and novels that will get published just because of his name's cachet. (Like Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card and Harry Turtledove, three more lazy writers.)Having said all this, you can't beat the Silverberg of the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Man, he was good back then. He wrote novels that were quirky and new . . . and now he just coasts.

To me, the best stories were the analog of the French Revolution, the story of the last Emperor, and the very last vignette about the Jews and their second Exodus.There's no Christianity, and there's no Islam. I wish Silverberg would have given us his theories on why no religions developed to replace them. He was also vague about how the Western Roman Empire didn't fall in the third or fourth centuries A.D. He just mentioned that there were some emperors who were good generals and fought off the Huns, Visigoths and Germans. I thought at first that this was too simple, that the Roman Empire would have fallen no matter what, but then I thought about men like George Washington and Winston Churchill, who probably changed world history."},{"Title":"Roma Eterna (Gollancz Sf S.)","review":"Several reviews I've read online of Silverberg's latest work compare it to Bruce Sterling's recent _Years of Rice and Salt,_ implying that somehow Silverberg \\"stole\\" Bruce's idea of a grand alternate history progressing from ancient times to our (alternate) present. This is simply silly, since all of these stories except the \\"Prologue\\" were published previously, several in anthologies, though most of them are somewhat changed in this volume to aid the historical and narrative flow. I very much enjoyed Bruce's book, but neither of these guys has to lift ideas from the other, believe me. Anyway. The Point of Departure -- as Alt Hist buffs refer to the crucial dividing line between our \\"real\\" history and what might plausibly have happened -- is the failure of the Hebrews to escape from Eqypt under the leadership of Moses. Which means no chance for Christianity to develop. (I'm sure the fundamentalists out there will accordingly regard this book as blasphemous. . . .) Silverberg takes this to mean that Rome has the opportunity to continue as a world power indefinitely. Not that the Empire doesn't have its ups and downs, though, its good and bad centuries. After Constantine founds Constantinople and divides the Empire between Western and Eastern emperors, the stage is set for a Latin-Greek tug-of-war that will last for two millennia and several of the stories are about various stages in that rivalry. The best of these, I think, is \\"Waiting for the End,\\" in which Rome, having wasted its substance on a disasterous series of attempts to conquer the New World, is simply outflanked by the Byzantines and the final, but quiet, fall of the Urbs Roma is witnessed by a Romanized Greek bureaucrat and his girlfriend. \\"Via Roma,\\" about the bloody establishment of a Second Roman Republic, is also very good, and so is \\"A Hero of the Empire,\\" in which a minor Roman official in Arabia Deserta has to decide what to do about a potentially dangerous rabble-rouser named Mahmoud. But there's a problem with setting stories in the far future of a world in which the Point of Departure occured in its distant past: Much of the enjoyment in reading stories like this is in seeing what happened to figures from our own timeline had circumstances been even a bit different. (E.g., Lincoln survives the assassination attempt, is later impeached, and retires to Chicago.) Once you get a few centuries down the line, though, the divergence is so great that all the characters are pure fiction with no connection to our own world, and you lose much of the \\"alternate history\\" aspect. That's what happens with most of the later stories in this volume.

The most valuable part of this book, in my opinion, is how to build the frame. The frame is built from square section steel tubing and welding equipment is required. Parts like the nosecone, windscreen, etc. can be fabricated or bought. There are quite a few Seven clone manufacturers around the world. The 'for as little as..' part may be a slightly incorrect but its much cheaper than most kit cars.

So what does the book tell us? Everything we need to know to build a very desirable ('very', in this context, is supreme understatement) road-registered sports/racing car in the UK. Since the first edition of BYOSC, clubs, race teams, 'E'groups and individual websites have formed, all sharing experiences, helping source parts, find answers to builders' questions, and, for builders elsewhere, advise on variations or plan modifications required to comply with design regulations wherever you decide you've gotta have one. This co-operative system is well supported by the second edition book, which list's organisations, books, and specialists who can provide project support. It has been particularly helpful where different market conditions, environmental or legal requirements make sourcing of donor vehicles and parts as specified in 'the book' somewhat difficult.

The strengths of this book are that Mr. Saddington (1) discusses the use digital media, and (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout. The user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point, especially for artists who are new or novices at photography, or visually oriented (i.e., no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures). Mr. Saddington's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure/photograph, and provides a concise explanation for these results, and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure/photograph. He also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing. The weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately, Mr. Saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... I base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called &quot;Photographing Your Artwork&quot; by Russell Hart. If you buy Mr. Saddington's book, I'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of Mr. Hart's book. The two books complement each other. Where Mr. Saddington's book lacks in details, Mr. Hart's book fills in the information gaps. On the other hand, Mr. Hart's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person, Mr. Saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process. Again, Mr. Saddington's book is decent, but it should be used as a supplemental reference, especially for the visually-oriented person."},{"Title":"The Quick & Easy Guide to Photographing Your Artwork","review":"Although the information given was essentially correct, it was not up to date regarding use of digital cameras.This book should have been thoroughly updated before being reprinted.Regards,Gregg Puckett"},{"Title":"The Quick & Easy Guide to Photographing Your Artwork","review":"Actually I give this book zero stars.

Whitman. Mine is the hardcover edition published in 1962 in New York by Hastings House. It's well-illustrated by Nick Eggenhofer's black-and-white sketches and it includes a bibliography and an index.Whitman was \\"an Army brat\\" who grew up on the Cavalry Posts of the American West and who developed an abiding interest in the men who'd served on the Frontier. After serving in WW II, Whitman wrote four novels about the cavalry and all of them were published.His style of writing is unaffected and easy to read which makes THE TROOPERS a delight to read compared to more academic studies. Whitman's goal is to reconstruct what it was like for the average trooper during the post-Civil War period.Don Rickey, Jr., did the same thing a year later in FORTY MILES A DAY ON BEANS AND HAY: THE ENLISTED SOLDIER FIGHTING THE INDIAN WARS and that's probably why we don't hear more about Whitman's TROOPERS. That's too bad, because Whitman's book is an overlooked gem.If you're interested in the Old Army and the Frontier, you'll enjoy THE TROOPERS and it appears to be widely available at competitive prices.I like the book and gave it five stars. I keep my copy right next to Rickey's excellent book."},{"Title":"The Troopers;: An informal history of the Plains Cavalry, 1865-1890","review":"Sidney Whitman was an army brat and though he was born about the turn of the 20th century, he grew up in the remaining cavalry posts of the West. He also served as an infantry private in World War I and as a middle-aged platoon sergeant in World War II, and then, in the '50s, produced a number of adventure novels about the Plains cavalry. With this background, it's not surprising he's so knowledgeable about the mobile U.S. Army during the twenty-five years of the Indian Wars. The Army had already begun the mission of subduing the native population in the western territories in the 1840s and '50s, but with the end of the Civil War things moved into high gear. In 1865, there were large numbers of volunteer officers and men who wanted to stay in uniform, and a great many of them dropped way down in rank to do it. In the 1870s, it was not uncommon for a captain commanding a troop to have been a colonel commanding a regiment during the War, and for his subordinate officers and many of his senior noncoms to also possess vast experience and previously higher rank. Congress was determined to cut the Army down to peacetime size, though, and in 1874 the total finally settled at 25,000 for all branches. The cavalry comprised ten regiments, the first two being descended from the old dragoons and the last two being black -- the Buffalo Soldiers.In fifteen chapters, Whitman leads the reader through a thoroughly fascinating cram course on the life of the mounted Army, with discussions of the officer corps (mostly well educated gentlemen), the men they led (mostly riff-raff and scum -- at least at the beginning, when recruiters accepted any man with two legs), the nature of leadership and management in such circumstances (some things don't change, really), pay and pensions (appallingly low), promotion and advancement (appalling slow), crime and punishment (common and brutal), recreation and amusement (nearly always inadequate), the experiences of officers' families on post (which included being \\"ranked out of quarters\\"), medicine (the health of the men was only slightly more important than the condition of the indispensible mule), the use of the Army as a force in civil affairs on the frontier (especially as a posse comitatus -- always a very touchy matter), weapons and uniforms, and the horses without which the cavalryman would be just another pedestrian. He obviously has done a great deal of reading, as well as specific research (he even details the dimensions of the Studebaker escort wagon), and the result is -- usually -- both very informative and very entertaining. A book like this would have benefited from a great many more illustrations, though.The author likes to point out (with a certain amount of gleeful superiority) how Hollywood so often gets it wrong, with a sergeant-major driving a wagon (he wouldn't be caught dead doing such work except in an emergency, especially since the wagon-driver of the 1870s usually rode postillion on the near-wheeler, not on a seat on the wagon itself), carbines stuck down in saddle boots (actually, the carbine was carried over the shoulder on a sling, so if you lost your horse you still had your weapon), isolated posts always surrounded by stockades of pointed logs (only very early and temporarily, to be quickly replaced by an open-plan design), officers' wives wandering around the post in male dress and riding astride a McClellan saddle (no, these were ladies, always in proper dresses and bonnets, and when they rode they did it sidesaddle), and a troop all wearing matching yellow scarves (no, the men bought their own ordinary red and blue neckerchiefs from the post store -- though the jacket illustration of this book shows a troop all with \\"yellow ribbons\\"!).On the other hand, Whitman is himself guilty of gross clich&eacute;-mongering, especially when it comes to describing the \\"natural traits\\" of the Irish (superstitious but all good horsemen), Germans (all strict disciplinarians), Italians (good musicians), and civilian horse-dealers (all thieves), not to mention the Indians themselves -- uniformly fierce warriors but always savage, nave about white civilization, sneaky and untrustworthy, and obviously (though he doesn't quite say the words) better off dead in the cause of Manifest Destiny. The author does, however, point out that the black soldiers of the 9th and 10th Cavalry were generally better disciplined, more apt to abide by regulations, and healthier -- including less likely to be troubled by VD than white troopers. He ascribes this operational superiority, however, to the careful preliminary screening of both black recruits and their white officers.This cavalier attitude mostly shows only that Whitman is a product of his own time; he's roughly the same generation as my own grandparents, and shared the same sort of social and cultural experiences. I suspect that if he had been born fifty years later and was writing this book today, his views would be a good deal more sophisticated -- but then he wouldn't be as close to his subject. In any case, *bleep* over the ethnic slurs if they bother you , but if you have any interest whatever in the American West or in U.S. military history, this volume is a must-read."},{"Title":"Dr. Chill's Project","review":"I read this a few years ago and loved it.

Once we get to Modern Man the book dives into stone tool development, the use of DNA to trace our family tree and the spread of man throughout the world. Yet it is careful to define every term or explain every theory that pops up. From there we follow mankind as they go from hunter-gathers to early farmers, from tribes to chiefdoms and, finally, from city-states to the first civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus valley.The book gives the reader LOTS of information in the form of great photos, maps, timelines and graphs, all designed to make the text easier to follow.

I am a betrayed spouse who's husband's affair produced a child. There are a few good books dealing with recovery from an affair, but none specifically about dealing with an other child. Maybe that's because it's still such a taboo topic. I was happy to hear that someone had actually addressed this topic, but didn't find the book helpful. Mostly what I read were betrayed spouses accounts of how the affairs destroyed their marriages. This not only is not always the case, but this is something I can read on a forum addressing this subject.The title is not only misleading, thinking it would be addressing how to affectively deal with an other child in your life, if possible, or talking about the affects all of this had on the other children themselves.Maybe with more case studies, someone will address this subject more objectively. Yes, an infidelity can destroy a marriage, but it can also strengthen some marriages if dealt with honestly. Children of affairs happen more than we care to think about and it would be nice if someone would give a voice to these innocent children and tell what did or did not work for the people involved or how the children were affected."},{"Title":"The Other Child: Children Of Affairs","review":"This book is a case study book, meaning it is a book of personal stories.

But when activities areinitiated that corrode this very concept, everyone suffers. Sometimeswhen a mate strays, it goes undetected, and sometimes though it issuspected it cannot be proven. In most instances all of the emphasisis placed on the participating individuals.Laura Giles is an expert in extra-marital families, her counselingfocuses on working with couples, victims of domestic violence, andvictims of sexual assault. But for the first time, with THE OTHER CHILDshe looks at someone other than the participants. She focuses on thepain, the struggle and the survival that is born from living with anextra-marital family. Although children of affairs are not a newphenomenon; there is a long history of its occurrence, it is notsomething society is inclined to talk much about. And she asks thequestion why?The stories are real, and each is different yet the same. The voices ofthe wronged spouses range from anger, to hurt, to hope, but at leastthey were all driven to give their emotions a voice. The focus of thisbook is a sad reminder of who the real victims are when commitments arecompromised.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Other Child: Children Of Affairs","review":"This book is a case study book, in other words it is a collection of people's stories. 8 of the 13 stories are written from a betrayed wife whose husband had a child with another women.

Hopefully this book will get attention and a book with advice from professional child councelors, psychologists, ect can get written. This book was very much like reading a message board found on the internet, personal feelings no professional advice."},{"Title":"The Other Child: Children Of Affairs","review":"The Other Child: Children of Affairs, by Laura Giles, is a non-fiction compilation of short stories. Each story is written by spouses, lovers, perpetrators of affairs and the children which are a result of them. In The Other Child: Children of Affairs, each writer gives an account of the devastation experienced when children are produced as a result of infidelity.In my opinion, the contents of the book differed from the title. I found the majority of the stories to be more about women scorned rather than about the other children produced from their mate's unfaithfulness. Some of the stories were well-written, and some were incoherent ravings. Although the characters in each story slightly differed, the contents in almost all of the stories were the same; hatred of the spouse, hatred of the other man/woman, and hatred of the other child. While some of the people that shared their stories were able to move on, the majority were not.If you are the other child, and you are looking for a book which explores how others in your situation feel, this book may not be helpful. Only a handful of the stories were written by the actual other children, which may prove disappointing if you interested in hearing their stories versus their parents'. On the other hand, if you are going through a relationship where a mate has been unfaithful, this book may prove helpful.T. RHYTHM KNIGHTAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"A work of great literature, this book is not. An entertaining diversion while on vacation, it definitely is. I especially enjoyed some of the characters (e.g., doctor's wife who is a Christian Scientist and also magician), and the plot had some ingenious elements. But much of the story seemed hurried. The characters were not as fully developed as they should have been, which, at times, made it difficult to understand their motives. To expand upon this point and to highlight a few technical flaws, I must disclose some elements of the plot. So, read no further if you don't want to know how the story ends.For example, we never learn what drove Dr. McQuade to inflict himself with a wound on Peleliu, beyond the general trauma of the war. It would have been nice if, when he confessed this to his son, if he had explained in greater detail what drove him to do this. And, with respect to the story's credibility, it is almost impossible to believe that a surgeon, seeking to inflict himself with a wound, would choose to shoot himself in the hand.You also have to suspend disbelief when reading the account of David's big trial at the end of the story. He and one of his associates freely exchange e-mails that contain open admissions of unethical and criminal behavior, as does the Governor of California. No politician or litigator with a half a brain would ever commit such things to writing.But, like I said at the beginning, apart from these flaws, this is an entertaining book. But, in my opinion, it is not much more."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"I had planned to read Peter Baird's novel for an hour or two yesterday.........I ended up finishing the book during the wee hours of this morning.

When I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Beyond Peleliu's characters are rich, they are vibrant, they are rounded and they are terribly flawed. In other words, they are real. The story centers on a father and a son who both measure themselves by their professional success and who both \\"succeed\\" in neglecting and hurting those who they love, and who they need, the most. We watch these characters' lives come full circle as the helpless little boy and the all-powerful father reverse roles in a climax that is both stunning and heart-wrenching. As I read the book, I was exhilerated by the characters' successes, crushed by their tragedies, angered by their self-inflicted mistakes and always hopeful for their resurections. But, above all else, I cared about them and I needed--really needed--to know what was going to happen to them. The story, and the characters, were ever-present in my thoughts long after I read the last page. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"If you are looking for an intelligently written novel that is both riveting and insightful, you should read Beyond Peleliu. The author, Peter Baird, explores many facets of human behavior and misbehavior primarily through the lives of a physician and his son, who does not follow in his father's footsteps but becomes a wealthy trial lawyer. The book is great on two levels. First, it is a great story. For me, that's the most important requirement for a good novel. Second, it raises some profound issues about human behavior. For example, why do people with so much talent and potential do things that are so self destructive? Beyond Peleliu is a provocative, well-written book that features characters that all of us can relate to. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Wow! I am at a near loss for words. I received Beyond Peleliu 2 days ago from Amazon and finished it last night. I must say that I had a hard time sleeping after finishing the book. Obviously, the book touched me in a very meaningful way, as I'm sure it has other readers, based on the reviews.Reading this book is a life-affirming event. The pain endured by the McQuades is so genuine it drew tears from the eyes of this (usually) unsentimental reader. And if you happen to be a lawyer (or fan of quality legal story-telling) the chapters dealing with David McQuade's trial and aftermath overwhelm with authenticity and genuine drama.In less capable hands this multi-generational saga could have ballooned into a 500-700 page \\"epic.\\" But Baird's writing is so concise and powerful, one feels that each word was chosen with care.In short, this is a masterful novel. That it is a \\"first\\" is all the more astounding. One can only hope that Peter Baird will put his massive talent to use on another novel. If you don't buy another book this year, buy Beyond Peleliu."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Being the daughter of the Author allows certain priviledges. One of which is that I had the pleasure of reading the \\"official\\" beginnings of this novel. I remember receiving a bulky envelope in the mail, containing a loose leaf stack of type written pages, which was Peter's finished manuscript. I read it--none stop--beginning to end. I was impressed by the depth of the story. I could immediately envision this novel being published, being picked up and made into a screne play... I knew this was a story worth knowing and that many others would feel just as I did (even though they weren't related!).Months past... and I hear that Peter has made some changes to the novel, and that it is going to be published, and that it has a different title... and my response to this was \\"I need to read it again!\\". So, I did... I received another bulky envelope--this time with a bound stack of pages inside--and I read the first page (which was different) and I got chills. This first page transformed the novel into something even more real, more personal, more moving than it was before. I continued on reading the book (after calling Peter and telling him my reaction and impressions about the first page)... and I was swept into the world of the McQuades once more... affectionately listening and watching (reading) the story unfold, from a more personal viewpoint....It's been ann amazing experience... witnessing the process of manuscript to publishing. But an even more amazing experience is in the reading and absorbing the story of the McQuades... because all of us have the effects of war running through our families---from generations ago and through those to come.This novel imparts an awareness of this fact... and so it is that this story becomes personal to all who read."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Beyond Peleliu by Peter Baird (Ravenhawk Books-June 2006) is a powerful book that follows the McQuade family through the years since World War II to the present. Though Tom, who served as the prime story teller through the eyes of his son, faced a lot of adversity from early in his life, he demonstrated that not only could he overcome the adversity but that it helped shape him. Helped him to be the person he wanted to become. We saw his daily challenges--from questioning the safety of vaccines to dealing with loss. And right from the title you see the effects of the War on the family--it's not just Peleliu, it goes beyond that. It's their life.However this story was not just Tom's tale. It showed how the experiences of one person can filter through and have ramifications for their family and friends for generations to come. At the same time we were able to see David's curiosity as he learnt more about his father's life--what made his father the man he was. This was key in light of his father's current struggles--the dementia might have made it hard for David to see his father as this man who went through and saw so much. It may have helped David to see that he wasn't as different from his father as he might seem. When he got the call from Dr. Roberts, he knew something was up but he accepted it in a realistic way--he needed to do things on his own time. He couldn't rush but at the same time, he knew he didn't have forever.The writing was tight and that served this story well--it allowed us to \`hear' each story as a separate section of the elder McQuade's life, which was what I believe the author intended. Each chapter could have stood alone as a short story of what Tom had gone through, however, this didn't keep the stories from being viewed as parts of one long life story. It was easy to see how these stories built upon one another and taught the family in a way no school book ever could.By the time I finished the book, just a short time after I'd started it, I felt as if I knew the McQuade family."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Beyond Peleliu is an amazing and courageous first novel. The action works, the storyline works, and the characters are real people. Using email for dialogue is satisfyingly contemporary and an accurate representation of how no place to hide our lives have become with laptops, cell phones, and perpetual multi-tasking. Anyone who is an only child will certainly relate to David's unrelenting, driven, and sometimes gut wrenching need to prove himself over and over again until the reason is lost and the adult is left with an unquenchable need to self-validate. The long reaching, multi-generational effects of war as portrayed in this novel are thought provoking as well. And yet all of this is not why I call this novel amazing and courageous. The author has bravely put both feet and obviously much heart into one of society's greatest ethical dilemmas - what is the humane response to the terror and devastating loss of Alzheimer's and similar diseases. While we pat ourselves on the back because we have one more new memory drug, the quality of countless lives is destroyed! Elemental human dignity is wiped out! Family members are left with nightmarish memories and cruel thoughts about their own aging process. Peter Baird puts this issue right out on the table and the result is not an easy read, but a disquieting statement that will stay with you long after you close this book for the last time."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"This was a good read.

Left untold is the cost that was borne by that Generation's families, and the price in human terms for those sacrifices. One of the most intense and horrific episodes of that war, (macabrely known as \\"Operation Stalemate,\\") yet one barely known, was the week in 1944 when American Marines landed on the small Pacific island of Peleliu, thought to be abandoned by the Japanese army. Tragically, it was a trap - the Japanese had actually hidden inside a maze of caves on the island, and the landing cost many American lives. The famous drawing of the \`thousand-mile stare' of a battle-stunned GI was inspired by the psychological trauma suffered by those brave Americans.In Beyond Peleliu, author Peter Baird has peeled away the wrapping-paper of what that campaign meant to those who were there, as well as to their loved ones and their legacies. Baird's story is compelling, and it speaks especially to practicing lawyers in evoking their deep, common, vivid nightmares.Today's lawyer lives and works in a world that is constantly delivering mixed messages. The costs of attending law school are huge, so the financial pressure on new graduates is enormous and the need to earn enough for debt service is overwhelming. To be a super lawyer (a lofty sounding designation, perhaps, but one that actually carries no more cachet than the message \\"You May Already Be a Winner\\" from sweepstakes companies) requires long hours, nights and weekends. Where does the time come from? Take a guess.Everyone - even lawyers - wants and needs a personal life. Some lawyers get married, some have long-term significant others and some have even gone so far as to breed. As time-management consultants remind us constantly, everyone gets the same 24 hours every day; the only discretion is how to spend them. When the demands for billable hours escalate, or the client insists that the project be done today, or the Judge won't grant a stipulation for a continuance, every lawyer is left with a decision to make: what can be cut from the schedule? How can we know what we are giving up, and what we are gaining from participating in this Moebius strip existence? Baird has created a work that permits the reader to contemplate these essential questions; indeed, the book virtually forces lawyer-readers to confront aspects of themselves that most would prefer to ignore, if not deny.Weaving together a family's story from the Depression era to the present, Baird draws heavily on psychology, family dynamics and the nature of friendship. In Book One, we follow the father through his young adulthood, culminating in a most promising medical education, but veering into the horror that was the ground war in the South Pacific. His ordeal under fire scars him physically and mentally; both will cause reverberations for years to come. Standing alone, the father's story is a compelling one but the author examines the reverberations as well - particularly how they effect his son, who grows up to be a trial lawyer.In Book Two, Baird tells the son's story, and this novel rises above the level of a \`good read' and becomes important. The son is a successful litigator at a big firm, with a huge trial fast approaching. As with so many such individuals, these professional successes have come at significant personal costs; boom-and-bust relationships, ex-spouses and children who are now manifesting the symptoms of having had an absentee father. The trial lawyer who has encountered tough cases, tough clients and tough trials while trying to have a balance in his or her life will recognize these dilemmas. On top of them, the son receives word that his father - living in a geriatric center in Utah - is slipping into Alzheimer's, and needs to see him, whether he likes it or not. Any reader who has wrestled with the competing demands of family and career will find the story gripping and, perhaps, too close for comfort.Equally penetrating is the portrayal of the son's relation with his kids. Seeing our parents as people like us - with strengths and weaknesses, with abilities and shortcomings, rather than omnipotent/omniscient/monstrosities - is a shock, as well as riddled with its own emotional fault lines. By tracing the story of the father through to the stories of the father's grandchildren, with all their intervening mishugas, the novel demonstrates how connected generations are, even though each may be oblivious to those ties that bind. While the writing is infected with banal clich&eacute;s and stereotypes, and while some of his dialog is risible, the story told by Beyond Peleliu is perceptive, penetrating and haunting. Peter Baird has crafted a compelling story that is also a superb vehicle for examining the hardest questions, and considering their consequences. That he preserves the legitimacy, ambiguity and complexity of wide ranges of viewpoints is a tribute to his book and his confidence in the reader."},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","review":"Being related to the author, one stunning aspect of this amazing story is that much of it is based upon true events. The details might seem pretty incredible, but the Battle of Peleliu and the many repercussions, both positive and negative, were very real and do live on to this day."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The reviewers who have given this book a bad rating due to the lack of darklords are missing the point. The book is supposed to be PLAYER FRIENDLY. It assumes that the PCs aren't going to necessarily know who the darklord of a given domain is. This is a GOOD THING. The only problem that I have with this book, which keeps me from giving it five stars, is the fact that they left the Nightmare Lands out entirely. It's never even mentioned and is absent even in the timeline. Other than that, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I was a bit too young when the original Ravenloft supplements were coming out. They seemed attractive to me when I saw the reviews and ads in Dragon Magazine, but I hadn't reached the (angsty) stage in my life where gothic horror really appealed to me. So, when I heard that White Wolf bought the license for Ravenloft and would be releasing roleplaying materials in the new edition of d20 I was very hopeful. Off all gaming companies, White Wolf was a perfect choice. I was not disappointed. This book has everything you need to run an extended Ravenloft campaign, in foreshortened form and by veteran authors of the setting. At the time they didn't know how much of a demand it would receive from their small but loyal original fan base and potential new d20 fans, so they foreshortened all the good parts form the original AD&D supplements. In this sense is it a triumph in its completeness and specificity. The best bits are the essays on creating an appropriate gothic horror setting, overview of gothic motifs, and of course the fabulous artwork. I dislike the d20 mechanics and many aspects of D&D overall, but for Ravenloft it's worth it."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"First of all, I'm not a fan of the d20 system, but that's a debate for elsewhere. I *am* a major fan of Ravenloft - I've been with the campaign world since it was released in 1992, and began DMing adventures not long after - so I eventually caved in and took a look at the d20 version of it. Thankfully, the Kargatane have saved Ravenloft from becoming totally extinct, but this book will be of limited interest to those familiar with the campaign setting.It uses the same timeframe outlined in the Domains of Dread hardcover released in 1997, post Grand Conjunction and post Grim Harvest. That means there is very little (read: nil) new information in this book as far as the Ravenloft \\"canon\\" goes. In fact, this book is intended to be a \\"player's guide\\" (even though it deals with powers checks and other DM-only phenomenon), so it has only sketchy information about domains and zilch about the Darklords. Want that information? Get ready to shell out for ANOTHER hardcover book (two of \`em, if you want all of them...) The rest of the book is devoted to making 3rd edition characters using some of the customized character rules and races (half-Vistani, for example) from the DoD book.So its safe to say that there's very little to interest the longtime Ravenloft gamer here. Converting 2nd Edition to d20 isn't impossible - in fact, there are several freeware programs one could download to do all the hard work. For those of us who have all the old material, and can play 2nd Edition AD&amp;D without a book because we know the rules so well (and yes, I DO have a life), there isn't much to interest us. Since it's actually cheaper to scrounge most of the 2nd Ed. materials, I say go with those, unless you are dead-set on running 3rd Ed. In that case, you better be rich...Final Grade: D+ (it's Ravenloft, I can't flunk it outright!)NOTE: I bought it anyway, because I'd like to see the Kargatane keep Ravenloft alive. Something to consider when making your decision..."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The book is great but For the people who owns other older Ravenloft settings and want to know how the date line continue there is a big lack of information...

Many holes...Too MuchSorry for my poor english."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Recently purchasing this book I was excited because I could not get it in my area (Windsor, Ontario, Canada) no matter who I called, I had to finally order it special online. When I got it however it said it was printed in Canada, well it said Canda. There are many spelling errors in this and quite unprofessional of a publishing company I must say.Anyway after reading the book through I came to some conclusions. First its a good read, It reads like a book rather than a gamers guide. The stories are really good if you like the old time gothic horror. There are long quotes and you get more of the tale as you read through it.Second its not helpful, usually when you buy something to help you as a DM you want the information so you can apply it to your game, but in this case it gives your more questions than answers. The book speaks in riddles and hints at things but does not tell you what you need to know to. If you wanted to run a campaign and have the players uncover the secrets you would have to make them up because it does not tell you all you need to know. For instance there is a part where the book is describing a domain and it says something like this. &quot;This is a barren realm with no life, but if there was something intelligent under the earth it would surely be a mystery.&quot; So what does this mean? Does it mean they know there is something and they are not telling us or is it up to the DM to create this? One other part that got me was when they were talking about two domains side by side and one did not have any one running it that could be seen, but there was a house that had lights at night in the forest. Ok so? Does a dread lord live here? Which one? What is he? The questions just pile up.Thirdly There is a lot of extra talk in here that could have been cut out to save on money, we do not need to go over the races and spells that are already in the DM guide. The monsters guide has all the statistics on the vampires and ghosts already and there is really nothing to new here, I was expecting there would be. The book is neat and if you like Ravenloft you should have it if for no other reason than as a collectable and a good read but don't look for it to help you run a great campaign or give you all the answers."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"For starters, I've never played Ravenloft, though I've been interested in the setting for a long while. And so I picked up the Ravenloft 3e book -- admittedly with some trepidation, as I was afraid the WW guys would inject some WOD-ish angst into the setting. Well, they didn't, and this book helped put me over the edge into running my Ravenloft game.Sure, I think (not having the books) if you have Domains of Dread or the old boxes, there isn't much *new* information. However, its handy to have a full translation of the game.How is it if you don't play Ravenloft? Still good -- I can see much of the material (particularly the madness effects and alternative rules for vampires, werewolves, etc) being able to be easily ported to a homebrew or what have you. Also there's a new race called Calibans, which are essentially grossly deformed humans with the stats of a Half-orc. Easily portable, as well.I give it a thumbs up! Useful whether you DM Ravenloft or not."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The Kargatane did an excellent job, in my opinion, of releasing information in the first 3e Ravenloft book that should have been available to players. I'm not a HUGE canon freak, but I do like to control what information my players have... and this work does that very well. The \\"DM only\\" information derided by previous reviewers does belong in players' hands, because the Van Richten's Guides were published in Ravenloft for the common person to read. Fear/Horror/Madness checks are logical, and with the popularity of studies of psychology in the time period represented, people would have as much of a concept of how this works as a rudimentary glance-over would allow a player to recall.I won't game without it, but having an autographed copy ain't hurting my enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Don't get me wrong: I'm glad I got this book in order to bring my favorite D&amp;D setting up to 3rd edition, but I was slightly disappointed with the book's presentation. One of the things that really drew me into the 2nd edition of Ravenloft were the moody illustrations which evoked the gothic atmosphere of the campaign setting. Here, the prevalent flavour of the book is more akin to high fantasy, while foregoing the grimer (grisly?) aspects of Ravenloft. Buy this book if, like me, you don't care to spend the time working to upgrade your Ravenloft campaign to 3rd edition. However, if it's a creepy sourcebook you're looking for, try to track down an earlier edition."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I was very pleased to find this book at a reasonable rate.

However, I have to admit that John and both the Andrews have done a fair, though not perfect job.All the character classes are present, as is the new Caliban race (though more info on thse guys wouldn't be lost on me), Fear/Horror/Madness has been simplified, though the checks take longer to work out (unless you take 10, 15, etc...), Terror Tracks and other rules for Ravenloft have been condenced somewhat I feel and the reduction of Terror Track stages (it has returned to 6 instead of 10) make the paths into darkness a little short for my liking.The information condenced from the old Van Richten Guides should not be in this book, that is strictly DM info for the players to discover as it is handed out, some Prestige Classes would also have made the book feel more complete.On the whole, it is a very good book, despite my picks at it, though maybe not as good in places as Domains of Dread was, nbut better in others (the timelines and domain information is greatly improved, though most of the maps are terrible). The amount of Errata material also marks the book down a little and the index at the back of the book has never been right yet when I have used it.Still, I give it 4 stars as this is written by the Kargatane, who kept Ravenloft alive whilst it was in limbo and they know what they are doing."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The book does an okay job of updating to 3rd edition.

There is nothing new in here that hasn't been printed before.All of the power checks are the same from 2nd edition, and even the Vampire special abilities are the same. They even ommited some of the really cool ones, like being able to energy drain in gaseous form.All in all, I was really dissapointed. Especially considering the high price of the book.

If you liked Domains of Dread youprobably won't be crazy for this either. It just seems toexplain how you can get a gothic feel to your adventure everytime you play. It gives the history of the land and the population of every domain, but almost nothing about the darklords. Most of them aren't even named. While domains of dread gave each darklord a story and history, nothing is said ofthem in this text. The only thing I really liked about this text is that it hails the return of the lich king Azlain.

Lord Soth is gone (which really bummed me out), the Character classes in Ravenloft details were non exsistent for some of the classes, the main villains and such (and I mean all of them) are suposed to com out in another book(?!?!). For the MSRP to be [what it is] there needs to be TONS more information.

Victorian Horror has always been a favorite genre of mine. When I heard that Sword and Sorcery Press would be reviving the setting for D&amp;D3E under the open gaming liscence I was very excited and S&amp;S came through...Firstly, here's what's inside:*Chapter One: The World of Ravenloft- How to use this Book- The Gothic mystique (outlining the history of Gothic literature)- The Realm of Dread (giving an overview of the setting)- History- Timeline of Events- Geography of Mists (contains Cultural Levels for the domains of dread)- Lexicon (terms used in the game)*Chapter Two: Player Characters featuring:- Races:Humans:Calibans (twisted humans exposed to foul curses):Dwarves:Elves:Gnomes:Half-elves:Halfings:Half-vistani (a new race)- Classes:All of the Core classes are present, with additional rules for each class*Chapter Three: The Ways of the World- Fear, Horror, and Madness rules*Chapter Four: The Dread Realms- Covering each Domain, giving information on Cultural level, Landscape, Major Settlements, The Folk, The Law, Trade and Diplomacy, Characters.*Chapter Five: Horrors of the Night- Covering the monsters of Ravenloft.- Vampires, Ghosts, Liches, Lycanthropes, Constructs (including a new template: the Dread Golem), The Ancient Dead, Fiends, Hags, and the Vistani- Each entry is detailed much as the old Van Richten's Guides did.*Chapter Six: The Ravenloft Campaign- Tips and hints on maintaining a gothic horror atmosphere.- The book ends with a list of reading and viewing materials in the genre.All in all the book delivers more than enough source material to run a campaign of Gothic Horror in your D&amp;D game and plenty of material to allow for a flawless conversion of your 2nd edition Ravenloft campaign to D&amp;D3E.My only REAL disappointment is the lack of statistics for the Darklords themselves. Hopfully this information will be forthcoming in another Ravenloft supplement, perhaps one that will address the variety of monsters not given.

You can give it to your players without fear to spoil their fun in the campaign. There are just two exceptions that I ask my players not to read just yet: The History section and the letter from Azalin - and even those only because we're still playing some of the old adventures.This is a player's book and a rules book. The DM's &quot;guide&quot;, &quot;Secrets of the Dread Realms&quot; will come in December.The book is nicely written and achieves it's purposes: bring RL to 3e and move the setting forward. There are many new things in there as well: a section on faiths, calibans, new feats and skills, rules for firearms and improvised weapons, the appearance of mistways and many many small things.Compared to Domains of Dread, RL has evolved into something more of a &quot;true world&quot;. It feels much more connected. Not only have all the clusters finally been detailed and mistways charted but politics and relationsships (including currencies and tradegoods) have been developed. &quot;Culture&quot; has been given a lot of thought. While the book is significantly shorter than e.g. the Forgotten Realms CS, and comparatively much space had to be devoted to RL-specific rules, I never got such a clear and distinctive picture of the people (how they look and what is important to them)in any other setting before. All this is stuff for a player (and dm) to make interesting characters and stories - and all the informations about the domains is of a nature that could conceivably be aquired by &quot;gather information&quot;.There are also sections, especially the chapter about monsters that are more geared for the fangs of the DM. But the &quot;monsters&quot; are &quot;templates&quot; (more in the Van Richten's sense than that of the MM) - and thus the player won't learn much more than &quot;Be careful with everything in RL&quot;.The only complaint I have is that it's too short. 300 pages would have been better."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"It has been a long wait, but finally Ravenloft hits the shelves once again.

The information is generally clear and useful, and the real meaning of a Gothic campaign is well described. So why only three stars?It's the price that drives it up. You can make characters with this book, but the DM must have the &quot;Secrets of the Dread Realm&quot; expansion (which should have been bigger and more complete with more darkords, and should have carried most of the DM-only information in this book, like Dread Companions, Power checks, monster stats etc.) and should have &quot;Denizens of Darkness&quot; to run a good campaign, which works out to a lot of money when you add the D&amp;D rulebooks.All in all, this book is very good in itself, but it holds information it shouldn't (DM-only) and is brought down by its supplements.

Better to update it overall I say.It is probably true that people with previous materials can give this a miss, but I think you are missing out on a great sourcebook that you can hand to your players and let them read a section or two (i.e. you are starting a new campaign with characters all from the Ravenloft world, you can let each player read the section on their home domain).As to gamers who expect fancy artwork...I'm one of those who actually prefers to see cheesy artwork.

Few may find this odd, but the book was intended to be very usable by players, without the need for a DM watching over their shoulders to make sure they don't get to read the parts that are supposed to be secret.It is recommended for DMs, though, to get a copy of Secrets of the Dread Realms before starting a campaign, as it sheds light on the true nature of the political leaders of many domains. Just make sure your players don't get to read it!5 stars-- And don't worry if you've never played Ravenloft before. This book contains all you need to know."},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":">>Yes, this book could be perfect. Almost everything you need to run a RAVENLOFT campaing is there. Many things I missed in the 2nd. Ed. are here, like the rules to play with Clerics (religion, gods, domains, etc...), and the answer for: \\"how can I travel from Barovia (Core Domain) to Bluetspur (an Island of Terror)?\\". Chapter 5: Horrors of the Night, simple pays the book, in this chapter you'll find lots of information on how to advance creatures like vampires, ghosts, liches, lycanthropes and others, and make them more powerful, and special rules for lycanthropy. The chapter dedicated to the domains is good too. All domains are very well described, with useful information like important cities (and population), percentage of the races in a given domain... Well, the darklords are missing, but there's SECRETS OF THE DREAD REALMS (another book describing them). So, RAVENLOFT 3rd. Ed. is a very good book...Can you belive that Arthaus simple didn't include a poster map inside the book? The only thing you have is a terrible two pages map inside the book! And you'll need glasses to read it! Ah! And it's black&white! For the Dark Powers sake, where's the poster map? Why not? I say, why didn't Arthaus make a map for us? Is it so difficult? Too much expansive? The only thing left is to pray for the Dark Powers... Maybe someday Arthaus realize the mistake, and give us a decent poster map (like the Forgotten Realms one! That's a great map!). After all said... I recomend this book! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"All in all, I believe this was a wonderful book. It succeeded in it's purpose; bringing forth the Realm of Dread for the 3rd Edition generation.

I consider it in the top one percent of all books I have ever read. The sheer scope of this work makes me almost gasp with incredulity and amazement. To think that one man could have accomplished this is mind boggling. This is the eighth wonder of the world. From prehistory and until the late 1980s, this book covers politics, economics, science, and arts. McNeill's generalizations are wonderfully and cogently supported by facts at just the right places in the narrative. To produce a handbook of this scope that is also so pleasant to read is an incomparable achievement."},{"Title":"History of Western Civilization: A Handbook","review":"I got this book for a college course that I am taking.

I would say the only negative of this atlas is that it is almost too detailed, and might be a bit overwhelming for a beginner. For example, it labels subareas of structures that might be labeled as single structures in other atlases (e.g., claustrum, amygdala etc.). I don't mean to present this as a criticism--the atlas fills the role of a comprehensive atlas for intermediate to advanced users, but beginners might want to use this in combination with another atlas (I recommendThe Brain Atlas: A Visual Guide to the Human Central Nervous Systemin the paperback). This latter book is nice for the illustrated pathways as well. I was a big fan of the last edition of the Mai et al book, and I think the current edition is even better. For example, there is a supplemental website containing a large amount of great information: [...]. Used in combination with another book, this atlas will give any medical or neuroscience student a solid foundation in anatomy."},{"Title":"Atlas of the Human Brain","review":"For many readers, this might be a rather exotic book. However, for those who want a sense of the structure of the human brain, this is a fine resource. The title refers to this as an \\"atlas\\" of the human brain. And that it is! As the authors note: \\"The present book consists of a series of maps, each featuring. . .brain morphology and topography.\\"MRI technology allows for a better view of the human brain and makes this volume more helpful still. The Introduction (Chapter 1) emphasizes some realities--such as the fact that there is a fair amount of variability in individuals' brain structure; localization of brain function is another issue discussed here. Methodological issues are joined, too, in the Introduction. Chapter 2 focuses in more detail on materials and methods in the study of brain structure. Chapters 3 and 4 represent the heart of the book, an atlas of different parts of the brain.Interested in the structure of the human brain? This is a handy resource if you wish to visualize the brain."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Of Course I'd heard the name Bruce Lee before but I thought he was &quot;only&quot; a gifted actor trained in some martial arts. After a discussion with my grown son about Lee's approach to tao and self-defense, I decided to read something about him. This book amazed me. Bruce Lee was first and foremost a seeker. The fact that he was able to develop his mind, spirit, AND body is incredibly inspiring. I meditate and do Pilates but now I think I'll study Jeet Kune Do as well!"},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This book is a collection of writings penned by Bruce Lee. I wasn't as jazzed on this as I thought I might be but there were still some gems to be found in this book. One problem is a good portion of this book was the same essay several times over in a revised version. There was also a lot of stuff like term papers Bruce Lee wrote when he was a philosophy major in college and some poetry he had written so its not all martial arts stuff. Overall it was interesting if your interested in Bruce Lee or martial arts but still somewhat of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This book is seriously a very influential masterpiece brought to you mostly by Bruce Lee's essays, poems, quotes, and personal experiences throughout his existence with us. This all came together with the help of John Little too though, so some regards should be left to him as well. But as far as a compeling book goes this one should leap off the shelves into your arms! Don't miss this opportunity to read into who Bruce really was and not just another book on martial arts and how to become a so called, \\"Master!\\" This is one to read and fully grasp for sure!"},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This book is absolutely incredible. Contained in it are philosophical writings, letters, poems, and much more. This book shows an even &quot;deeper,&quot; more intimate, if you will, look at Bruce Lee the man. When one picks up this book, there is little chance that one will put it down without having read through it entirely.Note: I say this book is &quot;almost flawless&quot; because there are some spelling, grammar, and editing mistakes in it. Though such things are extremely disconcerting to me, the content of this book is nevertheless outstanding."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Read this book recently and was amazed at the wealth of information available in it. Bruce Lee was a well rounded personality who was striving to be a complete human being and this book definitely helps in educating how far evolved he was not only as a martial artist but also as a person. As pointed out by other reviewers, some of the information in this book is already present in some previous publications of John Little, but this book is probably the most comprehensive collection of Bruce Lee's hand written poems, articles, letters and philosophy, some of his own and some of other philosophers like Hesse, Krishnamurthy, etc. I intend to read and re-read this book many times as I have found it truly inspiring and educational."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"As a first-year college student, I'm required to read a good many books on a good many subjects. My major is sociology and after reading &quot;Artist of Life&quot; I am going to do my major term paper on the thought and philosophy of Bruce Lee! This is without question the best book I have ever read. Not just the &quot;best Bruce Lee&quot; book, but THE best book! Its topic range is so broad and its content is so deep. I learned so much about the real Bruce Lee from this book. Here was truly a man of substance. Get this book. It's simply the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Not only has most of this material been published in other books, but most of it has been published in the previous books of the John Little series! John Little has to be the biggest Bruce Lee fanatic in the world. He probably knows more about Bruce Lee than Linda Lee does. That fact that he has to raise the price, make it a bigger hard back, and still reprint material from earlier in the series proves that he is just out for a quick buck! Bruce... we've been had. I am not going to return this book and inflict it on another poor soul, I'm going to burn it! John Little is a great author and really knows his stuff. It is just sickening that he feels comfortable putting his name on this absolute xerox of a book. Sorry John, I'm not buying any more."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Most of the things in this book have been published in other books. I wish Bruce Lee was still alive so I wouldn't have to buy a book that is stale with Bruce's 1960's, hippie philosophy. I believe that Bruce would be spinning in his grave if he knew we were rehashing all his old material. I think the editors and Linda Lee should stop abusing the memory of Bruce Lee to make a quick buck. I will take my book back for a refund."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Again i got this for my sister who is a Bruce Lee fan since she was able to read.

Even the section on acting revealed how naturally Lee applied his self-knowledge approach in martial arts with other facets of his life. I dog-eared pages and underlined a few passages and see that Lee's writing frequently gave me pause for thought. Sad that Lee's life was cut short and it would've been fascinating to see where maturity and added life experiences might've taken his efforts."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"This is just my 2 cents. I've always been interested in what else Bruce had to say, besides things of just in the martial way. This book is a great addition to anyone's library.

Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"'Bruce Lee -- Artist of Life' has opened my eyes to an entirely new Bruce Lee! This is an incredible book, packed with amazing, never-before-seen information directly from the writings of Bruce Lee. This is really a collection of &quot;the essential writings&quot; of Bruce Lee, serving both as an introduction to Bruce Lee and an essential, extensive collection. It includes selections from his early work to his later material, including his insights into the nature of the self, love, and the ultimate meaning of martial art. John Little (the series' editor) has done a first-class job of understanding the substance of Lee's thought, revealing his core teachings in all their eloquence and power, these writings incite us to recognize that the truth is within us all, to accept no external authority and to think critically, so that we can free our minds and see clearly on our own personal journey of discovery and growth."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"Editor John Little has framed Bruce Lee's writings in terms of areas that have inspired people from all walks of life. Little, like Lee, has not attempted to create a &quot;how to&quot; book or offer recipes for readers interested in a quick fix. However, those readers who are interested in thoughtful consideration of serious issues will not be disappointed. If one would like to be introduced to relevant, vital issues of the human soul, it is hard to come up with a better means to approach them than this book."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"BRUCE LEE: ARTIST OF LIFE is unquestionably the greatest Bruce Lee book (in the sense of being a pure Bruce Lee book) ever written. John Little has done a masterful job of compiling and editing an absolutely huge amount of materials into a unified and coherent whole. The book also reveals something I've felt for a long time but, until now, have lacked the evidence to prove; namely, that Bruce Lee was much more than a martial artist. While Chuck Norris and Van Damme continue to play schoolyard games of &quot;who's the toughest?&quot; (Norris, particularly is still at this level), it is obvious that Bruce Lee had long ago moved past this stage and was onto something far deeper and more meaningful with his &quot;process of becoming,&quot; having transcended the martial art realm (poetry, psychology, philosophy, etc.)and becoming, ultimately, an &quot;artist of life.&quot; This is an outstanding book by an outstanding man and is extremely motivational and inspiring. Which is something few books (and authors) can deliver in a man's lifetime."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"A great edition of Bruce Lee's entire corpus, with magnificent editing and presentation. Includes works such as &quot;In My Own Process&quot; and &quot;Toward Personal Liberation (JKD)&quot; and &quot;The Passionate State of Mind&quot;, which have never been presented under one cover before. If you're an addict to endless (and also pointless) footnoting, DON'T purchase this book. But if you like reading great thoughts and insights which will allow you to make your own interpretation of Bruce Lee's life, art and philosophy(that is, without attempting to tell you how to interpret his beliefs in only one particular way, as many other writers about Bruce Lee have done) this is THE book you're looking for."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I've been in the martial arts game for over 30 years and have been a fan of Bruce Lee's since I was 15 years old and used to watch him on the old 'Green Hornet' series. I have always been fascinated by his approach to fighting, but now --after reading &quot;Artist of Life&quot; -- I have a much deeper respect for him as a human being. Talk about being a &quot;complete&quot; person; this book reveals Bruce Lee to be a Chinese martial art historian, a philosopher of both eastern and western thought, a poet of great depth and sensitivity, a martial art pioneer, and his essays on self-knowledge are absolutely compelling. Bruce Lee has revealed to me many areas of development that we all need to look at in order to become a &quot;total&quot; person. This is a great book, containing the words of a great martial artist -- and, more important, a great human being."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I've just finished reading &quot;Bruce Lee: Artist ofLife&quot; -- what a book! It was just like having a private lessonwith Bruce Lee on a host of different topics! I enjoyed spending time with him as he discoursed on gung fu and Chinese culture; then attending philosophy classes with him at the University of Washington; moving from there on to the study of the mind as he explored the Gestalt approach to psychology; and then listening to him wax poetic about life, longing and lovers separated by fate; then it was a journey into the inner recesses of the soul to learn about &quot;personal liberation&quot; through JKD; his views on acting followed, revealing how he applied all of the foregoing into his films, and then, finally, his profoundly personal essays &quot;In My Own Process&quot; allowed Bruce to share with me his views on the process of his life. Again, what a magnificent book and what an incredible human being it reveals. This is my favorite volume in The Bruce Lee Library Series and I, for one, quite enjoy the breadth and scope of this volume. If you're interested just in JKD -- read volume three in this series; if you're interested in just gung fu -- read volume two (both are devoted exclusively to these respective modes of combat); if you want more of Bruce Lee's private letters -- you will enjoy volume five. But if you're looking for a great anthology of Bruce Lee's most important writings, you HAVE to read this book!

A great read."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I had to wait six weeks for the Barnes and Noble store in my area to restock &quot;Bruce Lee: Artist of Life&quot; -- but it was well worth the wait! This is the greatest Bruce Lee book I've ever seen! Not only is there new, never-before-published material in almost every section, but Mr. Little has done Bruce Lee a great service by reproducing some of the writings that had been published previously (both in the Tao of Jeet Kune Do and in the Bruce Lee Library Series) in the original format that Bruce Lee first wrote them. I particularly enjoyed the never-before-published drafts of Bruce's great essay &quot;Jeet Kune Do: Toward Personal Liberation.&quot; There are new and subtle differences in each version of the famous essay as Bruce works it over with each draft. I understand that this represents &quot;the essential writings&quot; of Bruce Lee, that is, a representative anthology of Bruce's writings in many different areas. It certainly is &quot;essential&quot; -- it's the best Bruce Lee book I've ever read and essential for anyone who wishes a full and complete understanding of the totality of the man.

It's got my full vote."},{"Title":"Artist of Life (Bruce Lee Library)","review":"I've just finished re-reading BRUCE LEE: ARTIST OF LIFE for the fourth time and cannot believe the incredible material that is packed within its pages! To read Bruce Lee's philosophy of life, his poetry, his writings in psychology and acting, are worth the price of the book alone. And when you add in all of the essays he wrote on Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do, this book gives you an education in the thought and beliefs of Bruce Lee unlike any other I have ever seen. Reading (and now re-reading) this book has opened my eyes to the fact that Bruce Lee was about seeking truth (which he equated with Tao) of martial art - not simply accumulating or looking at different styles. This book also shows how he applied this search for truth to the process of being a human being. Even my wife (who is not a martial artist) is in love with this book!

For one it is written by probably the best know and most talented Martial Artist of the twentieth century. This book consist of personal journal entries made by Bruce Lee. It contains topics such as Gung fu, Philosophy, Psychology, Poetry, Jeet Kune Do, Acting, Self-Knowledge then it ends with personal letter written by Bruce Lee.Gung Fu section lee begins the article by saying ,\\"Gung Fu is a special kind of skill, a fine art rather than just a physical exercise or defense.\\" Couldn't agree more as a participate in the fine art of martial arts. Really if your some what intrigue by Bruce lees philosophy you should read this book. In the Gung fu chapter of this book ,taken from handwritten notes by Bruce lee, he cover such topics as The center of the Oriental arts were he goes into deep discussion about such things as philosophies of Taoism, Cha'an (Zen),Meanings of gung fu, and what they mean to him. Other articles deal with his personal reflections on how he views and interrupts Gung fu and it's teachings. The chapter goes on with other essays he's written such asReflections on Gung Fu - Deep views on the stages of a \\"Gun Fu Man\\"Teach yourself self-defense -Tips on self defense, for example \\"expect to get hurt\\", \\"Ignore the pain, instead of giving up use it as a spur to counterattack and victory\\"Psychology in defense and attack -Explain how to overcome the mental aspects of a fight and the advantages and disadvantages of size.How to choose a martial arts instructor -\\"Believe half of what you see and definitely nothing that you here\\" Before choosing an instructor you must see if he has what it takes to back his statements.The unity of Gentleness/firmness -What's necessary for combat in terms of gentleness to firmness ratio.My (Bruce Lee's) views on Gung Fu -Essay on how he views Gung Fu.The next chapter consist of essays regarding philosophy. Lee's philosophy are more refined than those of lets say Socrates. He tends to deal with more humanizing issues dealing with matters pertaining to the inner self of humans being. For example human understanding, then he gets into really advanced philosophy which ,you really must be quite intelligent to decipher the meaning. Some examples of that are his essay on \\"Living in the oneness of things\\" , The unity of firmness and softness, Taoism, Yin - Yang, Wu-Hsin(No-Mindedness),Wu We(non-action),The letting go(must read essay). He also goes into his opinion on Plato, Plato's \\"Gorgias\\" and Socrates. After that in this chapter there's a essay entitled The nature of human beings in which he is truly inspiring. To me Bruce Lee is much more than a martial arts superstar he's probable one of the most genius thinker of the 20th Century .After that he writes about meditation and what it means to him (how he applies it to his life). Part 3 is the psychology section which is as genius as the philosophy section with topics such as The Relationship of the Organism to its Environment. Not only is Bruce lee a brilliant thinker he's an excellent poet. Here's an example of one such poem :The Dying SunThe dying sun lies sadly in the far horizonThe autumn wind blows mercilessly.The yellow leaves fall.From the mountain peak,Two streams parted unwillinglyOne to the West, one to the EastThe sun will rise again in the morningThe leaves will be green again in spring.But must we be like the mountain stream,Never to meet again?-Bruce LeeHis poems alone could have made him an incredible voice in the world of literature. However, Lees writing ability surpasses the creative mind to which poets need to write. Lee's genius transcends that of an average human being into the realm of a religious figure. Which is probable why he is worshiped in some tribes in the forest of Asian (True!).Part 5 is entitles Jeet Kune Do - The Liberation. It includes essays on the meaning of Jeet Kune Do: The way of the intercepting fist. It also contain multiply drafts of his essay entitled Toward Personal Liberation (Jeet Kune Do).Part 7 is on Acting. This is a list of essays in which Lee philosophies about the meanings, job, self-actualizing, self-made actualization, and the Art of Acting. Part 7 Self-Knowledge. It contains eight different draft of lee's personal essay entitled In My Own Process. The book ends with Part 8,Letters. There are six letter in this chapter written to-Pearl Tso A friend of the lee family written in September 1962-Taky Kimura An assistant instructor for Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.-2 to Jhoon Goo Rhee the farther of Tae Kwon Do in North America-Larry Hartsell a student of Bruce Lee's Los Angeles Chinatown school.If any of these topics interest you ,you should order this book right now. I was amazed at how philosophical lee was. The amount of detail and time it would of taken him to write all these essays on all of these topics to better understand himself. This is a man who truly wanted to get the deep meanings of his self ,Martial Arts, and the things in the environment around him. I have read this book 3 times straight through and I often pick it up to read certain essays which pertain to what I'm looking for. If you do decide to give this book a try I would suggest that you really take a thorough approach to reading this book. As in explore the meanings and how they apply to you and your life as an individual.

Thank you Linda Lee for allowing these wonderful papers of your husband to finally be published! The multiple drafts of Bruce's essays on his art of Jeet Kune Do sheds new light on a subject that is sorely in need of it.

Linnets &amp; Valerians is a magnificent story about the adventuring spirit of childhood and the restorative power of the natural world. In a lush, appealing, way it presents the empowering advantages of higher learning and the great moral value of living an honest and kind life. Linnets and Valerians is also a deeply romantic story about the mystery of family lost and family found. From the first reading I thought this book would one day stand next to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan and Aurther Ransom's Swallows and Amazons series. And while I found Harry Potter a delightful read, that recent best seller certainly pales next to the world of Goudges's Linnets &amp; Valerians; a place in which good relationships between children and adults foster the growth of those children into wise and responsible adults themselves. I own one copy of this book but had hoped to obtain newer copies for my daughters when they were grown. I have found, to my grief, that this book is out of print. I would love to see Linnets &amp; Valerians rediscovered in my library as Aurther Ransome has been, thanks largely to new paperback edtions with appealing cover illustrations.

Their search for a missing family is touching and sweet, and in the best of traditions, ends well with a hint of sadness.I love the beautiful passages in this book - \\"It was a small silver bell, but it rang out in a marvellous manner, clear and sweet and loud, as though it were ten times its size, and echoes woke up in the house and answered it, ringing and ringing away and away like birdsong in the wood.\\" The whole book is not like this, obviously, it's quite readable.

The Linnet children are sent to live with their staid grandmother after their mother dies and their father is away in the army. Grandmother is too strict to abide, so the children steal a pony cart to make their escape. And so their adventures begin, when the pony \\"delivers\\" them to the home of an old, grumpy man who agrees to let them spend the night.This wonderful story is the very first book I ever owned and I never forgot the feelings of magic and wonder that I experienced reading it for the first time. Even now, as a grandmother sharing the story with grandchildren, I SO want to believe that Ezra talks to bees and that all can be right with the world.I highly recommend this book to young and old alike!"},{"Title":"Linnets and Valerians","review":"This charming children's story takes place in pre-WWI England. The Linnet children sent to live with their grandmother after the death of their mother. Their father is off in Egypt, serving as an officer in the army. But the children can't accept the rigid rules and structured life that Grandmother lays down for them and they escape from the house in a stolen pony cart. The pony leads them to the house of a gruff but kindly old gentleman who grudgingly allows them to stay overnight. They don't know it, but the formidable gentleman is their very own uncle, who is a vicar and bachelor. And also a scholar and famous educator. They are allowed to stay only under the condition that they be educated. And here begins a magical adventure, with spells with the somewhat bewitching and ancient Emma Cobb, the folk-wise Ezra, who is the vicar's sexton and factotum, a mysterious hermit who can't talk and an old lady who walks in her mansion garden only by moonlight. The Linnet children absorb the difficult classical Greek education of their scholarly uncle every morning, and have adventures in the afternoon. Eventually, they unravel the mysteries that surround them and everyone lives happily ever after.This is a lovely story and filled with love, good natured fun and a bit of fairy tale. If you like the Potter books, this story is one you will also enjoy with your kids."},{"Title":"Linnets and Valerians","review":"As others have mentioned, the first part of this book is very enjoyable. However, I was a little on edge when mention was made of a book of spells and knew the \\"Linnets and Valerians\\" was not for my family when the children were directed to chant spells and pull pins out of voodoo dolls to undo the bad magic cast by someone else. In telling the children that what they were doing was okay, Ezra, a servant tells them, \\"But don't tell your uncle. He'd say it were superstition. I reckon the cleverest men be ignorant at times.\\" The main premise of the book is that some bad things have happened because someone with bad intent used magic, but we of good intent can fix it using magic and then we will get rid of the book of spells. I probably should have given this book one star, but there were a number of likable aspects of the book. I would advise any caring adult to read the book first before giving it to a child you love."},{"Title":"Linnets and Valerians","review":"I remembered liking this book as a child--though even then I remembered the last quarter being less compelling than the earlier parts of the book. Re-reading it, I would agree with my childhood self, plus I identified some further problems for contemporary readers.Goudge's descriptions of nature and insights into the children's minds are lovely (though probably boring--at least the nature descriptions--for kids) but the first part is an engaging tale of family conflict and resolution as they find their delightfully erudite and well-spoken uncle whom they warm to, in a classic kids' fantasy world of kids running away, no parents, freedom to roam but with two guardian-figure of protective and wisdom-dispensing qualities. When the book entered into into the fantasy realm of witchcraft and voodoo it lost me, NOT because I'm religiously opposed like some reviewers (I couldn't care less) but perhaps because I'm not at all interested in fantasy stories (and wasn't, even as a child), and I feel it's a shortcut to an uneccessary \\"plot,\\" as are they are not delved into in any interesting way.The major issue is, however, the book's dated view of class. I mean, Goudge was born in 1900, so it's hardly surprising! Interestingly, the racism isn't a so much a problem (though certainly the black servant Moses is a stereotype, tho sympathetically depicted), but classism certainly is.The main conflict in the book is not only problematic because of the tired good/evil fantasy-fiction tropes of witchcraft but because of the underlying theme that the \\"evil\\" characters are all lower class: they need to be brought into line with the upper-class, patriarchal hierarchy (the Clergyman, the Lady) or else chased from town, or be shown their \\"proper place\\" in society (when they realize that, they become good).Barely worth mentioning for a book of that era, that naturally the two main \\"guardians\\" are not only male, but predictable in their hierarchy: the primary one an elderly clergyman, the secondary one, though congenial and entertaining, is a \\"wise-old\\" servant. The \\"Lady\\" (hierarchically the highest female character) is basically only--literally-- a Lady, and is only there as a romantic interest. The children are well-rounded and engaging characters; the most interesting female heroine in the book is that of the eldest sister, Nan, but even she refers to her brother as \\"the eldest\\" and of course her business is housekeeping and caretaking (literally and figuratively) plus at the end she's married off to someone 28 years her senior!!!Ugh, leaves a rather bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Linnets and Valerians","review":"This book begins as a delightful Victorian-style children's adventure. However, about halfway through the book, it turns to witches and witchcraft, evil spells, and an oblivious or helpless clergyman.

I will definitely be getting rid of this book."},{"Title":"Linnets and Valerians","review":"This enjoyable tale is about 4 children who, separated from their father by war, end up spending the summer with an elder, bachelor, uncle.

I was a quiet child who saw secret magic in everyday things, much like the magic Goudge portrays in this story, and it struck a powerful chord that still echoes all these years later. The character of Nan was particularly resonant; it is so rare to see a quiet and sincere personality portrayed as a strong leader.I kept my copy, and last year I shared it with my children (9 and 7 at the time). It immediately became their favorite; every few months they ask to read it as a family again. I was gratified to see how quickly the story was integrated into the household; for example, the kids' stuffed animals now routinely \\"return to the Parthenon\\" when they misbehave.

She loves to read fiction, and has devoured many of the chapter books I've purchased for her or checked out of the library. I was looking for an interesting series of non-fiction books for her, and these seemed like the perfect introduction to the genre.This title covers the epic journey that led to the success of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in scaling Mt. Everest back in 1953. I was amazed at how well the author managed to condense this great experience and make it suitable for young readers. It captures all the tension of the mission, as well as mundane details like what the pair had for breakfast before they ascended Everest. Also, the illustrations on each page motivate young readers, especially visual learners like my daughter.The Step 5 readers are described as \\"ready for chapters, grades 2-4\\", though children who are younger and are at an advanced reading level will find these books interesting and suitably challenging as well."},{"Title":"To the Top! Climbing the World's Highest Mountain (Step-Into-Reading, Step 5)","review":"I personally love books about Everest, so I was happy to share my passion with my children. The book is thrilling -- just scary enough -- but triumphant. It's filled with lots of good information about Mount Everest. It gives equal weight to Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary, and has a very positive message about teamwork and international friendship."},{"Title":"To the Top! Climbing the World's Highest Mountain (Step-Into-Reading, Step 5)","review":"I purchased this book along with several others because of its high interest topic, for my son, who is very capable, but at times, a reluctant reader. He became quickly engrossed in the story and read it in two sittings. I recommend this book for its ability to engage and inform. I am impressed with the content of the book, which lacks no important information for any young person curious about the pursuit of Mt. Everest. The drawings and photographs are also appealing. Our son is 8 and reads at a fourth grade level, and this book is recommended for second to fourth grade readers. The bottom line for us is keeping him interested with good material, which this book accomplished easily. He is looking forward to more :)"},{"Title":"To the Top!

Add a little &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; type race activity amongst the sailers, and Mr. Thayer's awesome sense of humour (the methodolgies used to get the foreign sailers to come into the race, for example), I could barely put this book down- and read it in three sittings!"},{"Title":"Force 12: A Novel","review":"Following the successful test of his new ship Victory, information technology billionaire Rex Wyman announces the yachting race to end all races. His ship will challenge the best to race from San Francisco Bay to Tokyo Harbor via the 5200-mile rhomb line that consists of the shortest nautical distance. This Pacific challenge will occur in the winter making it that much more hazardous.What makes the Victory different than its competitors is that it is a &quot;ghost ship&quot; whose crew is a computer. On board during the race will be Rex, his girl friend Gwen Weld (the coding genius behind the ship), and former partner and software guru Toby Odell. The world class rivals seem pale compared to the climatic conditions that places everyone at risk. However, more perilous to one's survival is Rex's need to win at all costs because his company is crumbling, but how far is he willing to go to claim victory?FORCE 12 is an exciting thriller that tries to be too much for everyone. The story line involving the pre-race and the race is fantastic as readers feel the wet wind on their face. That plot easily could have carried the tale and turn this into a must read great novel. The subplot of a deviously dangerous Rex takes front stage and actually slows down the great race. Still FORCE 12 is a very refreshing novel that proves James Thayer (see TERMINAL EVENT) is a talented author. However, though fans will gain pleasure from the book, many readers will believe that it came in second to what it could have been: a modern day humanity armed with technology vs. nature story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Force 12: A Novel","review":"FORCE 12 is a fairly exciting and thrilling story of a billionaire soft-ware magnate who creates a computerized sailboat and enters it in a gruelling and dangerous yacht race from San Francisco to Japan through the Bering Sea. He believes the publicity about the boat's software, which pilots the 155 foot Victory (which has a 30 foot beam and 75 ton keel) and replaces a 20 man crew, will increase revenue and sales in his other companies.Initially the trip is flawless, but gradually accidents occur on the boat and sabotage is expected. Since there are several video cameras on the boat, every movement is witnessed by millions of viewers from around the world and the persona of a forceful man of wealth and power begins to disintegrate.Besides a mystery, the highlights of the book are the descriptions of being in a boat at the mercy of the sea. It rivals THE PERFECT STORM for its descriptions of the waves and feelings of helplessness while caught in the power of the open ocean.FORCE 12 is worth reading if you're a James Thayer fan but he's certainly written better. The plot was a little too unrealistic for me but the sailing scenes made it worth the time, especially if you enjoy seeing powerful men in hopeless situations brought down to earth."},{"Title":"Force 12: A Novel","review":"This action novel stretches the reader's suspension of disbelief past the breaking point.

After all, because it's in the thriller genre rather being a black or tragic novel, you sort of know the best people will come out OK. And the cause of some of the \\"unexpected\\" disasters is really clear quite early on - I say no more, not wanting to be a spoiler.

This book kept me interested in an I-know-what-happens-next-way but I kept reading because I wanted the story line to evlove...it never did."},{"Title":"Force 12: A Novel","review":"James Thayer wrote two novels (WHITE STAR &amp; FIVE PAST MIDNIGHT) that are on my top-20 list of most favorite thrillers. Now, he's written FORCE 12, a novel of intense drama and unbelievable courage as man takes on the sea. FORCE 12 is actually made up of three stories that come together in a stunning, climatic ending that will leave the reader feeling as if he's just gone over a water fall in the dead of winter and has almost drowned several times before being pulled out of the water by a set of strong hands. The first story deals with Rex Wyman, a billionaire who's going broke and has once last chance to save his software company, World Quest. Wyman has set up the world's longest and most dangerous yacht race, starting in San Francisco and ending in Japan, and passing through the Bering Sea at the onset of winter. The top ocean racers will be competing. Wyman, however, has the race locked up. There's no doubt in his mind that his yacht, Victory, will win, especially with his genius of a computer engineer, Gwen Weld, on board. In fact, the purpose of the race is to demonstrate to the world the newest technological and software achievements that have been installed on Victory by World Quest, enabling it to function by computer alone. The second story concerns itself with Lonnie Garvin, a fisherman who's afraid of nothing and has worked the harshest seas. Because of serious financial problems, Garvin is about to lose his ocean-going crabber, Hornet, to the creditors. As the Bering Sea begins to claim the lives of those who were foolish enough to pit their feeble skills against it, Garvin receives an offer over the radio that may just save him from financial ruin, but he will have to risk the lives of his crew and the possible destruction of his boat in order to carry out the rescue. The third story is about Jess McKay, one of the toughest members of the 212th Rescue Squadron. As a teenager, he watched his older brother drown in a raging river, afraid to risk his own life to save him. Since then he has been trying to balance the scales by putting his life on the line to save others. Trained as well as any Green Beret or Navy SEAL, Jess may have taken on more than he can chew when he has to helicopter in to the Bering Sea to rescue the woman he's fallen in love with, during the worse storm of the century. It's going to take all of his strength and courage to save her and to get back to safety. FORCE 12 is what's known in the movie industry as a \\"slow burn.\\" It moves slowly at first by introducing the main characters and the important plot elements, then gradually builds to a roaring inferno that threatens to annihilate everyone within its path. I know absolutely nothing about yacht racing and what it takes to actually make the journey around the world, braving the elements with human skill and superior design. Therefore, I found myself utterly engrossed in the details that Mr. Thayer presents to the reader, especially with regards to the countless dangers any sailor must deal with while on the sea. Also, for any \\"action\\" novel to succeed with me, it must have a hero who's capable of facing insurmountable odds in order to save the person he loves or to complete the mission. This has to be a person with honor and perhaps a weakness that offsets him from the rest of the crowd. Such is the character of Jess McKay. A novel must also have a strong villain who equals the hero in tenacity and determination. Quite often the villain doesn't view himself as evil, but rather as a person who's doing what's necessary to protect himself, his family, his company, or even his country. They believe that the end justifies the means. In FORCE 12, it could be argued that that the Bering Sea is the true adversary, but Rex Wyman, for me, takes center stage with his arrogance and his desire to win, no matter what the costs to others. Because of him, as well as a hidden enemy who seeks revenge, a lot of people will die in this book, some deserving the karma that's dealt to them. I certainly enjoyed how the author was able to blend all of the plot points together, directing them on a collision course, and creating a climax that literally had me sitting on the edge of my seat. After the novel was over, I even found myself pacing around the living room for a few minutes, still filled with the sharp rush of its ending. Strange as it may seem, Mr. Thayer seems to feel that he has yet to get it right when writing a novel. I'm here to say that few people do it better than he does. His prose is excellent, his story lines are always thrilling and suspenseful, and his characters come to life in a way few other authors are able to achieve. I'm always at a lost when his books don't hit the bestseller lists, though I know it's only a matter of time before one finally hits the bull's-eye. If you like ocean-going adventures with an in-your-face finale that crackles with adrenaline and suspense, then pick up FORCE 12. If you love action-packed thrillers that will have you ducking from snipers or hiding from the Gestapo, then pick up James Thayer's other novels, WHITE STAR &amp; FIVE PAST MIDNIGHT. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Force 12: A Novel","review":"I took this book to Hawaii, and the last 100 pages kept me out of the water.
