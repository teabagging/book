As a newspaperman he had the opportunity to follow the early political campaign of the idealistic Willie Stark, a farm boy who thought he could make a difference and agreed to run when some powerful men asked him.Little did Willie know that he was a stooge set up to split the vote and guarantee a win to his opponent. Little did he know that nobody was listening to his earnest, figure-ridden speeches about how he would make the country a better place. Jack was there to help pick up the pieces when Willie finally found out what was going on, and he was there to witness Willie's rebirth as a fighter, who promised to come back to campaign on his own for the next election.Years later Jack is no longer in journalism. Instead, he is Willie's right-hand man. He is the one who keeps track of the things Governor Willie Stark needs to get done. He is the one who digs up dirt on friends and opponents and puts pressure where pressure is needed. He is essential to the smooth running of Willie's personal and political life, and he is much reviled by many people for his role in the government.In Jack's mind, though, Willie is a better politician than most. There is some corruption within his organization, but there is also much more good being accomplished than in past governments. Jack defends to his friends and himself that such good should and does overshadow the dark parts of his boss. As this book progresses, we are able to see how decent and moral people can be sucked into a somewhat immoral life, and how those who are immoral to begin with can find places to sneak into an ethical man's world.I really liked watching the evolution of all of the characters in this book, and the changing relationships among them. It was interesting to puzzle through Willie's change from idealistic young man to hardened womanizer, or Jack's change from slacker student to dedicated blackmailer. I liked seeing where Jack and Anne's relationship went wrong, and I liked the stubborn way Adam refused to let his friendship with Jack go.This book had some beautiful descriptive paragraphs, but there were times in which I felt I was simply wallowing in description, trying to wade through words in order to get back to the story."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of those books that I've been meaning to read for years. My advice is don't wait, READ IT NOW! This is now on my top ten list of favorite all time books.The writing (as befits a three time Pulitzer Prize winner and the National Poet Laureate) is eloquent. The story of southern politician Willie Stark is not only an astute novel about Americian politics, it is a novel that examines the foundations of philosophy. What is good, what is evil is an on-going theme.However, the fascinating part for me is the narrator, Jack Burden. (the names Penn Warren selects are so wonderfully Dickensonian!) His character and his motivation is what drives this story. In many ways Willie Stark's drive in politics and his desires both political and personal is a recognizable theme. (Yes he is based on Huey Long, Governor of Louisianna and populist and corupt demagogue) But Jack Burden, ahhhh Jackie Bird. There is a dark horse! Jack comes from privilege, he grew up with the children of a former governor. He has every advantage, breeding, money, brains, talent and yet he is a rootless soul with no goals. Then he meets Willie, and despite all of his family and friends horror at Jack's working for such a corrupt and crude politician, Jack perserves.The end, when he compares his two friends, Adam Staunton and Willie Stark is the first and only time he uses the word friend to describe Willie. Usually he refers to him as the \\"Boss\\". This is a key part of what motivates Jack.Beyond the character studies of Jack and Willie, this is plain and simple a good story. It is one that you will devour and will keep you fascinated until the end. The revelations about Jack's life, the inevitable clashing of the two worlds (Jack's upperclass family/history and the world of Willie Stark) and the sense of place, the south in the 1930s makes for absorbed reading. I highly recommend this book. It is worth your time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is an interesting, well written and informative study of politics and human nature.

It was about Jack Burden (aptly named) and his travel from innocence to corruption. He learned it at Willie's knee but ultimately the story was his.

I really enjoyed all of it. It reveals great truths about people and the writing style is excellent."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The story of Jack Burden as reporter turned henchman to rising star Willie Stark is gripping, all the more so because of the story's biographical intent. The author loves words and is quite at home flexing the English language in myriad ways. The book reads like poetry. And that's its problem.Though the author writes with zest, the vast, deep eddies or metaphor that he creates to describe a scene ultimately detract from the flow of the story. One wishes sometimes that he would just simply get to the point. But from the outset, our narrator Jack is imbued with superhuman English mastery as well as every other character with whom he converses.The conversations are not believable because no one in their right mind would speak with the kind of flowery language that the author puts in their mouths. This is not to say that it's stilted, but simply too fluid and poetic to be taken seriously. It's the type of book that pretentious bookworms like to tout as an &quot;American Classic&quot; because of its difficulty.Even so, the book itself is pretty good, if slow-going. The characters are fully fleshed out and the story is compelling. It's worth a read, and worth paying for."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel All the King's Men, Robert Penn Warren proves he knows more about writing than just the simple mechanics. Strongly defined characters and a setting so real you can taste the air provide the foundation for this literary masterpiece, yet the real genius of the book is in Warren's understanding of the reader and his use of style to convey a personal tone in the reading.The main characters in All the King's Men are Jack Burden and Willie Stark. Jack, the narrator, was a reporter before joining Stark's bid for political power. Stark began as a small country lawyer who saw something wrong and tried to change it, but he eventually becomes a politician in the truest sense, so much so that the narrator can only think of Stark as &quot;the Boss,&quot; an ominous title indeed. Accompanying these two men is an array of equally fascinating minor characters such as Sadie, a saucy married woman influential in developing Stark's position as a politician, and Sugar Boy, an Irishman so named for his affinity for sugar. Every character has depth and realism and can stand alone as a fully-developed individual.While the characters are clearly an enjoyable part of the story, the setting is even more compelling. Warren's word choice is superb; he chooses to include and omit just the right combination of words to paint a realistic picture in the reader's mind without becoming too cumbersome. It is a balance few authors are able to achieve with such proficiency and yet another way in which Warren demonstrates his almost supernatural understanding of the reader. The best part is, it only gets better.If characters and setting can be described as masterfully crafted, then Warren's grasp of tone is inexplicable. Simply put, the story truly speaks to the reader and could never have been as effective were it written any other way. Sentence structure, word selection, and dialect coalesce into a tangible atmosphere that projects a strong sense of familiarity onto the reader. The book is hard to put down because of this sense of familiarity.Overall, All the King's Men is a book enjoyable in many more ways than one, with intriguing characters, realistic setting, and a true understanding of the needs of the reader. Even after fifty years, this book remains a classic appealing to all generations."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It's a story of the polictics of humanity and how it plays out in government. Warren's metaphors and descriptions have a rhythm and realism that intrigue, and his observations through the eyes of his narrator thoughtful and creative."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize Winner \\"All the King's Men\\" is a very convincing roman &agrave; clef, whose key is a famous populist southern politician Huey P. Long, \\"the Kingfish,\\" former governor of Louisiana and that state's U. S. senator in the mid-1930s. Real life similarities aside, the novel is a complex character study of how corruptive power can be. The writer uses the politics as an excuse to exam the corruption of the human soul.The main character, Willie Stark, is a simple man with a good heart, that degenerates when he is on his way up to the power. His journey is chronicled by his right-hand man, an ex-journalist named Jack Burden. As the narrator tells the politician's life, he exposes the lives of many characters, as Stark's wife, son and other people.Since in the novel the characters and their evolution are more important than the action, Warren takes his time to develop them thoroughly. Every character from the most important to the least one. Of course, Stark is the most complex character and we can fully believe in his changes. Another great character is Sadie Burke. She is considered Stark's secretary, probably because in that time they didn't use the expression political advisor. She makes believable the expression \`behind every great man there is a great woman'.\\"All the King's Men\\" is one of those fundamental books that one is supposed to read in order to understand the world we live in. Warren has a very lucid vision of the political game as well the human behavior. A book that is so real that sometimes is scary."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I refer to the 'restored edition' edited by Noel Polk. Warren's novel is the story of a political strongman, Governor Willie Talos (known as Stark in most editions of the novel). It describes his rise, the political machinations of his tenure and his ultimate downfall. Much of this makes for entertaining and salacious gossip for those attracted to the stories of backroom, tactical politicking. It is especially interesting to see how Willie was before his success: a too-smart, earnest crusader for the mythical 'little man'. There is certainly a kind of political statement in this novel and Warren pits Willie's demagoguery against Whiggish Republicanism in a famous dinner scene near the middle of the book.My problem is with the narrator, Jim Burden. Warren spends some time on his backstory and relates it to the Willie political story through the figure of the judge. While he makes sense in the Burdens' Landing setting, Burden himself is lost in the political story. I could understand why he *might* stray from his roots to support Willie, but the novel does not focus enough on this aspect of the story. It is a timeless theme, of course, and Warren might have developed this angle more. Instead, the real father background to Burden just comes across as a randomly assigning a debased aspect to his genealogy.The edition is nice and Noel Polk does a nice job in the afterward and it is interesting to see the removed beginning to the first chapter."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Never in my reading experience have narrative and stream-of-consciousness so thoroughly complemented one another in one work. I was loaned this book before I began some business travel alone and I am tempted to say that Jack Burden is the best travel companion I have ever had.When a reading of a work of prose by itself almost explains the fact that its author was a poet laureate, you know you have been treated to a masterpiece. Passages like an early one wherein Jack describes the feeling of watching Willie about to give a speech (which Willie begins by saying that is exactly what he is not going to do) and likens it to finding an envelope and not wanting to open but having to because \\"the end of man\\" is to know what is in that envelope even though the \\"sad little foetus which is you in the dark which is you too\\" doesn't want to know. And a later sequence when Jack explains why he went west (the short answer is because \\"that's what we do\\", but Jack/Warren says it much better). These and many others are almost all the reason I need to read at all.I went to a bookstore (sorry, Amazon, could not wait even a day) and bought two copies so I could give back the one I was loaned, keep one to read and loan to people, and give one to a friend to be determined. That's how much I loved this.I have not read the version that was originally published. I may decide to some day out of curiosity or I may not. But I know I will read this version several more times in my life."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book my junior year of highschool, for English class. It was a very well written book, and it is very accurate about Louisiana politics. I will be honest, it isn't the most exciting book in the world. The chapters are at least 50 pages long each, but I really liked the style in which the author wrote, and I found it a very good book. If you need a lot of action to keep you going with a book, this isn't the book for you. But if you are looking for something more for its style, then this is definitely a good thing to check out. It also gives you a good perspective on Lousiana politics."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I'd always shied away from this classic because I thought it was about a Louisiana politician, Willie Stark, modeled after the recent assassinated Senator Huey P.

The novel follows Burden from his failed engagement to a college sweetheart, to his failure as a grad student in literature, to cynical newspaperman, to his job digging up dirt on opponents of Stark's political ambitions. The most interesting things that he digs up on behalf of Stark turn out to yield surprising information about his own family."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"but the book is the way to go...the unofficial &quot;biography&quot; of louisiana governor huey long....i read this book when i was a senior in college; it is one of those books that makes you glad you love reading and will deepen your appreciation of literature... willie stark started out wanting to do good for the people but was destroyed by his ulterior motives and treachery... the story of jack burden is equally fascinating as it sometimes paralells stark's, but takes twists and turns all its own...even if you don't love politics, you'll still love this book...the perfect graph for understanding human nature and for finding out why people do dirt..."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The novel itself turned out to be better than I had expected it to be after listening to the first part on the audio cd set. However, the content of the novel is not the topic of this review, the audio edition is. I had been assigned the book for my Lit class and figured the audio version would help me understand the writing. However, I never even finished listening to the CDs. First of all, the narrator's voice is so gravelly and unappealing that it was a low-level version of torture to listen to. Secondly, the writing is difficult enough to follow on page, but on audio with no writing or punctuation to go from, the story is nearly impossible to follow.

You won't be able to put it down. At least I wasn't!."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Robert Penn Warren does an incredible job making a novel of this magnitude flow. He jumps around in time and still keeps the reader enjoying his novel. It is truly one of the best political masterpieces of all time. Many people hate political books, but this one is interesting enough to hold anyone's attention and at the same time teach you something.Warren based this novel on the life of Governor/Senator Huey Long from Louisiana. Many of the occurrences in Willies life coincided with the occurrences in Huey Long's life. This is impressive on Warren's part because it shows just how much thought and research he had to put into this novel to come up with the facts and ideas.All The King's Men is narrated by a young and nave Jack Burden, the protagonist. He is from a well-known family in Burden's Landing (named after his ancestors) and who believe that no one can be held accountable for what occurs because of your actions. Throughout the novel Warren shows how Jack slowly matures while dealing with the tough lessons of life and making decisions for yourself. An awakening occurs when his boss, Willie Talos, the governor, tells Jack to dig up dirt on Judge Irwin. The things that he finds cause him to look back and reevaluate his own life and change his beliefs.Willie Talos's story takes place simultaneously to Jack's. He starts off as a poor farm boy who just wants to do good for others, but is corrupted by the spotlight of fame when he becomes governor. As he continues on his political journey the one thing that he despised most, the corruptness of politicians begins to become him. He used his power to command others around and blackmail them into doing what he wanted. He gains support by being projected as a common man.These two stories are simultaneously occurring and because of this you see many similar characteristics between Jack and Willie. They are both trying to flee their past. Willie does not want to be the man that others took advantage of, but a strong and powerful man that no one can tell what to do. Jack no longer wants to be the nave boy that grew up in Burden's Landing, but a man that can claim that he did something important on his own. While Jack matures through his experience, Willie has hardly any spiritual growth that occurs until it is too late. While Willie sheds his idealism for the power politicians gain and corruptness that soon follows, Jack keeps it and continues to sees the world through completely different eyes. Their personalities clash more than once although they work well together and keep the novel interesting.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone. Do not let the size (it is a long one) stop you from reading it. It is not hard to follow and keeps your attention. Every time you start to put it down Warren brings up a new point and you get involved again. This is one of those books that you just cannot put down. I really enjoyed All The King's Men and will probably read it again to catch the things I missed the first time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel is, quite simply, the greatest piece of literature ever produced. Every page contains a memorable scene or passage that any reader will remember beyond the actual reading. The relevance of this masterpiece will endure as long as we have the institution called &quot;politics.&quot; It should be standard reading for all high school and college students."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I put off reading this novel for almost twenty years from when it was first recommended to me for the simple reason that I dismissed as a \\"political\\" novel and, ergo, not of the first water. - How wrong can a prospective reader be?!? - To begin, this is not a \\"political\\" novel, per se, and the character of Willie Stark, as compared with the odyssey of Jack Burden, not very gripping. As another reviewer has mentioned, it is only political in the way that Oedipus Rex is political. What All The King's Men is, then, is a beautiful, hauntingly poetic, dark reflection on man's state in the world. It is an authentic American, modernist tragedy. And, like all great works of literature, it resonates in one's mind and heart long after the last page is read and the covers closed.The other reviewers have covered the plots and subplots, so that there doesn't seem much to add save, that, for me, the most engrossing sections were Jack's accounts of his two journeys into the past, one to find \\"truth\\", the other to find \\"the facts\\" and his deeply poetic rendering of the development of his adolescent love for Anne Stanton, which comes as close to Proustian as anything else in literature.I suppose I would go on to add a caveat here too. As I say, despite the book's somewhat pacific ending, the work is a tragedy, with the accompanying dark Weltanschauung inherent in an authentic tragedy. There are so many passages I could quote to exemplify this perspective to let the reader know what s/he is getting into here, but the best comes at the end of the fourth chapter, after Jack's first dive into the past:\\"Cass Mastern lived for a few years and in that time learned that the world is all of one piece. He learned that the world is like an enormous spider web and if you touch it, however lightly, at any point, the vibration ripples to the remotest perimeter and the drowsy spider feels the tingle and is drowsy no more but springs out to fling the gossamer coils about you who have touched the web and then inject the black, numbing poison under your hide. It does not matter whether or not you meant to brush the web of things. Your happy foot or your gay wing may have brushed it ever so lightly, but what happens always happens and there is the spider, bearded black and with his great faceted eyes glittering like mirrors in the sun, or like God's eye, and the fangs dripping.\\"In other words, beware of trying to trip the light fantastic through this powerful novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"If you are looking for a great example of American literature you can't do much better than Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning classic \\"All the King's Men\\". It ranks up there with Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Harper Lee, Truman Capote and all of the other greats. \\"All the King's Men\\" is a quintessentially American tale of politics, greed, corruption, idealism, friendship, betrayal, family, and just a touch of romance (but not too much -- this is, after all, a very masculine-centered novel). It is a sprawling tale of the political career of Willie Stark and his journey from the innocent do-gooder \\"Cousin Willie\\" to the jaded, corrupt \\"Boss\\" who governs the state of Louisiana with an iron fist. After a failed bid for governor where the idealistic young Stark is used as a pawn by one of the other candidates to siphon votes away from his competitor, Stark is crushed and left feeling like a sap. But he comes back and runs again with a new political attitude -- determined that if winning means playing the game that from now on he will outplay everyone else. And he does it, too, maneuvering and bribing and blackmailing his way to the top like a well oiled machine. When he sets his eyes on the Senate, however, his odyssey begins to spin into tragedy. His transformation is narrated by Jack Burden, a reporter who first met Stark when he was toiling thanklessly as county treasurer and later gets a job in his administration at the capital. Burden was, perhaps, once an idealist too but now stumbles cynically through life all too aware of the foibles inherent to human beings (his name, Burden, is quite apt for this position in which he must live). His struggle asks some meaty philosophical questions (can good exist without evil? Is it necessary to do bad things in order to have a good outcome, and is such a thing possible? and more) and thankfully doesn't get too bogged down moralizing the reader (although Warren does dangerously toe the line in a few parts). Reading this book was unique for me because I found myself unable to read it without a pen in hand so I could underline passages and write notes and reactions in the margins of the pages -- agreeing and disagreeing with what was being said. That was great fun, and it was a thrill to feel so involved in a book to be doing that. I do have a few minor complaints, however. I thought that Warren's chronology was slightly jarring as it went back and forth through time and took long detours to get to the point, but since those detours were usually filled with some meaty themes of their own I can forgive them. I thought that Warren's proclivity for repetition got annoying by the end of the book (hitting it zenith when Anne Stanton proclaimed in one flashback \\"Oh, Jackie, Jackie, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, say it's a wonderful night, Jackie-boy, say it, say it!\\" on page 425), but since this is only really present in the dialogue -- and mostly in Anne's dialogue at that -- I can forgive this too. I also took offense to Warren's portrayal of women as either manipulative or wishy-washy but always responsible for the downfalls or travails of men. That's a tough one to get by, but since he can be equally critical of men for their own corruptions and failings I guess I won't let it bother me too much. It's very much a product of the time it was written and of the setting it depicts, and you can't necessarily fault it for that. At any rate, on the whole I would definitely recommend this classic. I don't know how either of the film adaptations compare, but I can't imagine that they could accurately capture the scale of Warren's epic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is called one of the greatest novels of American politics ever written. But really, there is so much more to this tale than that. This is easily one of the best works of literature I have ever read. Robert Penn Warren's style is quite descriptive and flowing, and his use of Jack Burden as the narrator gives readers an incredibly intricate narrator."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is the only book in my life I've read four times and each time is an experience that brings new insights and relevations. I first read this book in high school and I come back to every three years so becuase its just that good. Warren won the Pullitzer Prize in 1946 for this and I argue its the classic of the century and possibly the best American novel ever writte. Reading this book is like drinking a fine wine...it needs to be sniffed, sipped and swirled to appreciated although I promise you won't want to spit this out!Like all amazing pieces of work, this book has many different aspects to it. The story revolves around a southern Governor and his right hand man who narrates the story. The first time I read the book, I knew nothing about the plot or the historical undercurrents and I think this is the best way to read as it the best way absorb the beautiful prose. Warren turns simple situations like the sound of rain beating down on an automobile into eloquent rythmical expressions that fuse you onto the page. The book is also a coming of age story and Warren is able to capture and relate to the human psyche so well that I've thought I'm reading excerpts from my own life. The relationships Jack Burden has with his boss, his father, his best friend, and his best friend's sister will surely ring true with many a reader. Warren does an amazing job developing these relationships in realistic and heartbreaking ways. I love how each chapter stands alone as it's own mini story.There is so much to be said about this book and there is reason why so many other viewers give this book such high praise. For novice readers this won't be an easy read as it exremely involving and some of the sub-plots are hard to follow. I think more experienced readers won't be able to put it down. For people looking to try some classic literature, this is a fantastic place to start. Enganging enough for the advanced high school student, this would be an excellent present for the teenager leaving home for college beacuse of the thematic relevancy.Bottom Line: For me it is the standard all other classics are measured against."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"there are two newish paperbacks out in print right now. one is this edition featuring the classic novel we've loved for fifty years, the other is the restored edition- notably returning willie's last name to talos from stark and other changes. one interesting change is an addition of an opening chapter an editor, wisely in my opinion, convinced warren to axe. THIS edition is the one i would advise purchasing for those who are new to the novel and unfamiliar with 1930s history and politics. warren's biographer joseph blotner writes a fantastic introduction to this classic american work, putting history and politics skillfully in context and setting the reader up for a broader understanding. the introduction is short, only four pages, but is worth the read.check out other reviews for summaries and articulations of why this book is completely wonderful."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;All the King's Men&quot; moves along breathlessly right through to its nail-biting climax. I wasn't prepared for such a suspenseful read, but the intrigues, shady dealings and political backstabbing make for quite a thriller.It's loosely based on the career of Huey &quot;Kingfisher&quot; Long, one-time governor of Louisiana. I didn't know anything about Long before reading this book, but it doesn't matter. Robert Penn Warren's novel is not about Louisiana politics, but rather about American politics in general and the ease with which political figures can become god like in the eyes of their voters and just as easily fall from their lofty perches.Warren uses stylized, thick prose to conjure images of the dense, sultry Southern landscape that serves as this novel's backdrop. The swampy, tangled undergrowth mirrors the tangled machinations going on among the politicians and aides that make up the novel's motley cast of characters. Willie Talos (Stark, depending on the edition you read), takes center stage as the larger-than-life governor, but the story really belongs to Jack Burden, right-hand man to Talos and the novel's moral center. And Warren creates a bona-fide scene-stealing character in that of Sadie Burke, aide to Talos, who understands what it takes to make it in an environment so dominated by power-hungry men and who more than adequately holds her own.This is a compulsive read. I didn't have the luxury of being able to sit down and read the whole thing in one sitting, which is probably the best way to approach it, as there are very few ideal stopping points along the way. But whether you read it all at once or over several days, I hope that you will indeed read this book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It may take awhile to read this but it is worth it. I have read it twice-the second time was even better. There is so much to this novel that just makes it complete. You learn to love the characters and feel like you know them. One word of advice would be to not give up on it- and read it slowly so you don't miss anything!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is quite simply the finest novel I have ever read. The story of Willie Stark offers a powerful, moving platform on which Warren develops the true story, which is Jack Burden's philosophical conflict and its resolution. _All the King's Men_ is a novel about a politician in the American South, but it is also a novel about what it means to be good in a bad, harsh, or morally indifferent world. I have kept this book with me from state to state, reading and rereading it and finding new insights and new lessons each time. I cannot recommend any other novel as strongly as I would recommend this one."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think it would appeal to anyone, male or female, people who like to be kept on their toes by a story and people who like to be able to understand the characters in the story and their actions. This is a story that will stay with you. Whenever I see the names of the characters in this story- Burden, Stanton, I think of this book. It is that memorable. Definitely a book to re-read every few years, as you get older, you will relate to or understand different parts of the book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of the greatest American novels ever written. It captures the drive and all-consuming power of American political life in a detached way that makes the book thrilling at every step."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I wanted to find out about Huey Long and heard this was a good book to read- it's a novel, though."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men is Robert Penn Warren's masterpiece and one of the twentieth century's greatest novels. Excellent in all respects, it is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in American literature, and those attracted to its prime elements will be particularly intrigued. Many of these are nearly always overlooked and often deliberately misrepresented. Like nearly everyone else, all I knew about the book before reading was that it is supposedly a thinly-veiled dramatization of Huey Long's life. It is this, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it is also far more. A top-tier historical novel and a deeply meaningful work with a wealth of philosophical depth, vivid characters, and general verisimilitude, it is well-rounded and simply masterful.Let us deal with the Long parallels first. There are many; this is required reading for anyone interested in Long, as it uses much of his biography and delves deeply into his psychology. Far more importantly, it gives profound insight into the people of whom he is an archetype - supremely egotistical and conscienceless but intelligent, extremely able, and undeniably charming. We see how they work and how others fall under their spell. Long is simply fascinating, a true American original and seminal figure; this is a good introduction, hopefully leading readers to find out more, and a perpetually interesting stop for the many still curious about him.The book goes far beyond this even in immediate aspects. For example, it is an astonishing inside look at American politics just before World War II; it of course focuses on the low and gritty, but this is politics after all. Warren's narrative has that indefinable but all-important air of authenticity, pulling us in immediately and keeping us engrossed. Local and state politics are particularly emphasized, but the basic truths are not only national but eternal. Many have said that politics is corrupt, but few have shown it as vibrantly and memorably as Warren. His novel is also historical in a larger sense, giving a grand panorama of the rural South's last hurrah and even stretching back to the Old South, showing slavery and more. Warren had great insight into the Southern character and Southern culture, showing everything from history to speech to mores. His portrayal is notably unapologetic, non-sentimental, and non-didactic; he shows things as they were, letting us draw conclusions. Unlike so many others in similar situations, he does not force an ideology or even any kind of perspective on us, always letting story take center stage. In addition, the novel conveys a strong sense of what it was like to live in this important era; American politics was being revolutionized, the Depression was in full swing, the Red Scare lingered, and WWII loomed. Few works bring all this so effectively - much less affectingly - to the fore.Even more importantly, the book has a plethora of meaningful themes explored variously and at great depth. Human fallibility is of course key, and a variety of ethical dilemmas ranging from social to familial are dramatized; the book touches on everything from economic issues to race to gender roles and sexual politics. It also movingly portrays the loss of innocence and adulthood's transition. Perhaps most fundamentally, it delves far into the free will debate and even life's meaning.Much of this comes via Jack Burden, the first-person narrator, who is the real protagonist, not Long stand-in Willie Stark. The book is in fact a bildungsroman on top of everything else; we see Burden progress from talented but indecisive youth to outwardly successful but inwardly tormented young man to something approaching middle age's hard-won wisdom. The whole story is filtered through his eyes; significant parts deal not at all or only tangentially with Stark, and Burden's narrative goes on well after Stark has faded. Burden is a sort of Everyman, experiencing the alienation, doubt, and despair at the twentieth century human condition's heart. This is a profoundly existentialist work; much thought and history central to the era and earlier pass through it in thought-provoking and highly emotional ways. Warren also uses these concerns to speculate on things as varied as history's role, epistemology, and metaphysics. Simply put, there is something for everyone, and Warren's ability to plausibly put it all in what is ostensibly only a Southern political novel is truly remarkable.No one interested in American writing can be without this. Hardly anything else Warren wrote is now read, especially not his fiction, but this immortal classic will keep him prominent as long as American literature is read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Jack Burden works for Willie Stark, 'The Boss'. He digs up the dirt so that Willie can have his own way and protect his interests. Willie starts as an idealist before becoming a realist in the world of politics;a real political animal. He does some good by being bad, yet for all his power and control he is helpless against the past,peoples raw emotions and what life continually throws up.This is a terrific read, the only political novel you need ever to read or-if you've read loads-this has all the ingredients you've missed plus icing on top.So much is quotable and so much rings painfully true. Willies response to the question 'What is good in society?' for example; 'Why thats an easy question Doc.You make it up as you go along!' Isn't this exactly what human society has done sinse its inception? What was bad yesterday is good/ok today as we made it so? I guess about 2/3rds of a countrys population today would be jailed for their current life styles by their ancestors of a hundred years back! You easily warm to the Boss despite his huge failings.And his notion that good comes out of bad and bad comes out of good...if a morally upright anti nazi had tried to save innocents during the holocaust, he'd have been instantly shot and of no use to anyone. But amoral, philandering bone idle Oscar Schiendler....On another level the book explores how our image of life/history and people is often distorted and misconceived; that no one is free from the past and the future this creates, no one is innocent and life is a vibrant entity that exists almost seperately from us as individuals.A great work, lyrically written-as befits the man who became the first poet laureate of America."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This review is about the audio version.I read the hard copy of the book years ago, and I've always remembered it being one of the ten best books I've ever read. Of course, over the years only the basic story remained in my mind as the details faded. So I eagerly began listening to the audio version and quickly rediscovered the beauty of Warren's writing along with his interesting -- and sometimes fascinating -- sub plots. But what made this experience special was Michael Emerson's superb narration. With his multiple voices and his perfect interpretation of the drama, the book comes to life and is an even more exceptional story than I'd remembered.If only Emerson and Kristoffer Tabori could narrate EVERY book I want to listen to!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It's doubtful that any book will ever be chosen as The Great American Novel, but those looking for one should certainly try All the King's Men.I don't read many classics these days, but discovered this one when it was assigned in high school English. Then I had to read it twice to feel like I really had a grip on it. (Yeah, I was that kid.) It was worth it, though, as this is one of the most masterful novels I've ever read.For starters, Robert Penn Warren is great with language; it will come with no surprise that he was also a poet. Some of the passages in this book demand that you stop and admire his skill with the English language, and that's not something I do often. But his knowledge of language is complemented by a knowledge of the world: this isn't one of those dry classics full of long-winded philosophical musings or descriptions of trees (although the former at least is present), but a fascinating story in its own right. It centers on Jack Burden, the right-hand man to governor Willie Stark, who is based on a 1930's governor of Louisiana, Huey Long. There is a fair bit about politics here, with the focus on demagoguery and the corrupting influence of power much more so than specific political issues. But that is balanced by the story of Jack's life, jumping backward and forward in time; to me that enhances the story rather than confusing it, but I won't deny that this novel requires a great deal of concentration.The characterization is excellent, and Warren's depiction of human relationships is nothing if not intense. He does a similarly wonderful job evoking various settings. My only criticism is that too many of the characters tend to talk as if they were philosophers or mind-readers (character A can only inform character B of what B thinks, feels or believes so many times before I start to roll my eyes). Still, in a novel this brilliant, that's a minor flaw.This is a must-read for those interested in classics, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in American Literature (with a capital L) or who is looking for a challenging book, because believe me, this isn't an easy or quick read. If you're up for it though, it's worth the trouble, because All the King's Men is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a novel whose prose is astounding on every level. Robert Penn Warren was an immensely talented writer and poet, and he brings these gifts to bear in this wonderful novel. Rarely would I say that a 600+ page novel doesn't have a few words to shave here and there, but I can't say that about All The King's Men. I would not want to be the editor who thought he could whittle down this writer's great work.ATKM is the story of Jack Burden (metaphor of a name) and his long (too long) growth process. Jack has what we would call \\"issues\\", and like most of us he has the ability to overcome them, but first he must grow up. This novel is the story of that process.ATKM has been called a novel about politics, but I think that politics serves a secondary function in this text. It is through his involvement in the underbelly of the political world that the narrator (Jack) learns how to live in the real one.Even though there are a multitude of characters in this text, each one is finely wrought and Warren never seems to delve into caricature. With the huge cast of characters in the novel this is no small feat. One of the greatest glories in this text is that there is not a single character who is likable or without flaws. And yet, as I read I found that I really did not hate any of them. In fact, I felt I knew many of them. That is because they are so lovingly and accurately crafted by the author. Jack states towards the novel's close about one of the text's more dastardly characters, Tiny Duffy, \\"and for the first time I saw him as human.\\" That really is one of the main themes of the text. How all of us, in all of our ugliness and beauty , are still divinely human. When we see the good and ill in others and don\`t pass judgment, we can then recognize and accept it in ourselves. Jack Burden is the unique narrator in that his almost passive views of others allows the reader to engage with them without prejudice.The colloquialisms and speech of the deep south in the early half of the twentieth century are delivered here with the accuracy and the warmth of someone who knew intimately the world which he was writing about. Rarely have I read a novel with such a keen sense and development of time and place.ATKM also has many subplots and diversions that are complete narratives in themselves, and are satisfying to that end. Yet they all also tie into the larger themes of the novel as a whole.Read this novel closely, be prepared to reread certain parts, and then sit back and lustfully digest one of the greatest of American novels. You will learn something about yourself along the way."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I was assigned this book in an undergrad political science class.

This is the best book I have read this year so far."},{"Title":"Art of Justice: An Eyewitness View of Thirty Infamous Trials","review":"The Art of Justice is much, much more than its subtitle (\\"An Eyewitness View of Thirty Infamous Trials\\") lets on. The thirty criminal trials in this gorgeous large-format book span the decades from the 1970's to the present. Courtroom scenes are portrayed in striking full-color sketches, accompanied by an objective narrative about the indictment, evidence, courtroom atmosphere, media coverage, and American cultural pulse. I actually hesitated about picking up the book, because I envisioned it as an art piece, and while it is most certainly artistic, the book is also about the American collective memory, the changing face of true crime coverage over the course of three decades, the meaning of celebrity, and the indelible personal impressions of people who were present in these courtrooms as journalists and sketch artists.The impressions of courtroom artist Marilyn Church take this book to the next level. She writes about the hilarious scene created when Marla Maples's pilfered stockings and high heels were displayed in courtroom trial of her stalker: \\"I had fun pulling them into the center of the drawing, emphasizing the bizarre scene of footwear spilling everywhere.\\" Most other scenes have a more somber tone, such as the judge's order for all artists to stow their drawing supplies when the Central Park Jogger rape victim was on the stand. Chruch also provides insight into the stony, vacant manner of Preppie Murderer Robert Chambers; he chilled her to the bone because her own children could have easily been his peers and friends, at risk from this cold sociopath.Church's career spans all the significant trials of the last thirty decades, from the modern celebrity trials of Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs and Martha Stewart, to the Fall of the Teflon Don, John Gotti, to famous crimes by The Long Island Lolita and The Son of Sam. Yes, O.J. is here, too. Church was commissioned to create courtroom sketches for the trial precisely because every other media source had full-color glossy images from live video and photo, and one magazine wanted something to set themselves apart--what better than a good, old-fashioned full-color sketch?As someone who was raised on the O.J. trial, I enjoyed this book as a history lesson. I was in junior high for the first World Trade Center attacks (1993), and it most affected me because my class trip to New York city was cancelled as a result. With a decade-plus of hindsight, and having lived as a NY resident through the 2001 attacks, I had an entirely different perspective on the event and trial, and the narrative at hand provided much-needed insight into jihad in America in the early 1990's.This is truly a courtside seat to history, one that has the advantage of post-trial hindsight, so that stories can be told in full detail, with all the post-verdict developments. I enjoyed this as a history lesson, as an exploration of the criminal trials I grew up on, and as a poignant perspective on the changing face of criminal trials in the last 35 years. Some of the trials of the 1970's dealt with issues that seem long-settled to me, as a child of the 1980's. As a bonus, this book not only provides detailed insight into 30 infamous trials, it concludes with a \\"Celebrity Gallery\\" of famous faces in various trials. Celebrities sketched included Truman Capote, a bloated David Crosby, Mick Jagger, Don King (\\"everyone else seems diminished when King is in the room\\"), Mayflower Madame Sidney Biddle Barrows, Imelda Marcos, and Sid Vicious (among many others)."},{"Title":"Art of Justice: An Eyewitness View of Thirty Infamous Trials","review":"Marilyn Church's drawings are proof that trials shouldn't be televised: Her sketches express much more than photos could.

Heroine reluctantly agrees but tries to avoid sleeping with him b/c she believes their r/s is only temporary. But is her willpower strong enough to make her resist their strong attraction for each other?I didn't like this book. I'm not sure if Baxter couldn't broaden the characters behavior repertoire or she deliberately made them appear limited. Either way, Hero & heroine had a set cycle of Hero demanding & heroine avoiding. It happened so many times. It got very annoying. It was made more so with heroine's constant crying. All she seemed to do was work, get tired/sleepy, faint, & cry.I didn't like both main characters. Aside from heroine being a big cry-baby, she liked to deny & avoid problems. When Hero tried to confront their issues, heroine unfailingly interrupted him. She didn't want to hear it or know about it. She herself kept secrets from Hero. She didn't even tell him she got pregnant or miscarried. She wanted him to somehow know something was wrong & chase after her. Hero was better about getting things out in the open. But when his efforts failed, he resorted to threats & blackmail. I don't know if he got tired of heroine's immature antics or didn't care enough for her but he also didn't make an effort to discuss their r/s problems with her when she suddenly moved out of their house 2 years before.

I was a smart but poorly schooled student dumped &quot;cold turkey&quot; into a very challenging academic environment.My first class at Kent was W.H. Armstrong's class on Study Skills (first part of first term) and Ancient History. He wrote both of the texts we used that year, and I can testify that this book - and Armstrong as a teacher - saved me. I went on to become an honor student and have lived a pretty good life based on skills I learned from him.Readers of his book will not have the benefit of daily contact with the author - but if you read the book and follow the process - there is no question that you will become a better student.Armstrong was a tough task master and an inspiring teacher. He would not tolerate sloppiness. He checked our &quot;plan books&quot; frequently to make sure we were writing down assignments. He made us memorize poems and other material. He taught us to outline, and to read effectively.He made even this kind of dry material come alive. He would do chin-ups in the doorway of his classroom while he was lecturing on how to take notes effectively, or the Mesopotamians, or the water systems of ancient Egypt, or the value of sheep manure in his garden. His voice never strained, and we all sat there transfixed.He was - and still is - a fascinating individual. He knows how to plan and organize, and how to teach others to do it too. He walks his talk, and uses examples from his own life in the book to prove his points. (He knows how many hours it takes to build a house because he built his own by hand from field stone he collected out of his sheep pastures.)He was the best teacher our class had in 5 years at the school, and we dedicated our yearbook to him in 1967 when we graduated.Having him as a teacher was great - but the lessons are all in the book. I bought it again for my 10 year old to prepare him for the mo! ve from Elementary to Middle School, and I am giving it to him in small doses.If you read the book and internalize it, you or your child will become a better student."},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"Sweat ... .\\"This passage from the Greek Poet Hesiod (which concludes: Long is the road thereto and rough and steep at first; but when the heights are reached, then there is ease, though grievously hard in the winning) is the core message of this book. It is also the passage that was posted on William H. Armstrong's classroom wall for over 30 years. This book and the work ethic instilled by Mr. Armstrong in his classroom did change my life to a very good degree. It took longer for the lessons imparted here to sink in on me than on others but they were there when I needed them once I got to college.Study is Hard Work, as its title suggests, pulls no punches. It is direct and to the point. Excellence is not easy. It takes work and organization. Mix well and repeat! Mr. Armstrong sets out a number of excellent suggestions which, when read, cause you to smack your head and say - \\"how obvious\\". Obvious yes, but overlooked or forgotten until seen in print in simple declarative sentences. The fact that study is hard work is an important lesson for children, particularly bright children, to learn as they move from elementary to middle school and then on to high school and college. Ones ability to thrive on sheer native intelligence alone gets more difficult each step of the way. This book serves as preparation for the increased level of sheer work that is involved in maintaining that level of excellence. It is similar to a dentist advising you \\"this may hurt a bit\\". Foreknowledge is a valuable tool.As has been noted, Mr. Armstrong's approach may seem a bit blunt in today's environment. That fact alone seems a compelling reason to read the book. The fact that the suggestions noted in the book may seem a bit dated provides those children who can absorb these lessons with a valuable competitive edge in our increasingly competitive school and work environment.I have recently purchased this book along with a teacher's lesson plan book,another organizational tool used by Mr. Armstrong, for my daughter. It is a book worth buying. It is a book worth going over with your children even if, as with the dentist, it hurts a bit."},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"William Armstrong's small work is a great way for all life-long students to understand what it takes to streamline techniques for higher learning. Although many might fault the book for it's brevity and say that the author doesn't go into enough detail, I felt the author's advice was very pertinent, and very self-explanatory. His 50 year experience in teaching shines through with a gently guiding hand, placing the responsibility in the hands of each student. There are no tricks that are presented here, as indicated by the very name of the work. So, whether you're looking for ways to succeed in that upcoming course that's supposed to be tough or just trying to brush up on ways to maximize your efforts in a lifetime of learning, you're definitely on the right track, by reading this one.One other thing to keep in mind, because the author wrote this work so long ago, it provides a great baseline in it's fundamental principles. I would also suggest Adam Robinson's \\"What Smart Students Know\\" to supplement the principles introduced in \\"Studying is Hard Work\\". Robinson's work has some more methodology and covers some more modern principles like memorization and the use of \\"hooks\\".

This book helped me understand the difference between merely getting a job done and doing it well. It gave me the tools to study efficiently and to focus on the task at hand, abilities that have stood me in good stead ever since. But my response to one of the prior reviewers is this, gentle reader - the title says it all - there are no short cuts, cute tricks, diagrams. Life does not ever put the important stuff in bold print for you. Mr. Armstrong understood that studying is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. The book expresses the expectation that you, the student, must examine how you think and then develop your own discipline to learn how to learn."},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"This brief book is aimed at high school students, but speaks to anyone learning at any stage of life. That ought to be just about everyone.Its formal, no-nonsense tone closely matches its content, a school-masterly essay on schooling. Armstrong starts by pointing out the number of hours spent in school. If a carpenter set out to build houses single-handedly, he'd be well into the third using only the hours a child spends in K-12 education. Does the student have as much to show for the time spent? If not, why not, and what can be done to fix that problem?Armstrong starts with the basics: reading and writing. Reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page, it means taking in the information, disgesting it, and incorporating it into oneself as thoroughly as one digests a sandwich and incorporates it into the body's tissues. The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees. Writing is the other half of the text. I've seen it again and again: someone who can't express an idea is as ineffective as someone who doesn't even have one.Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong dedicates to specific tips for studying languages, math, science, and history. He generally handles these topics thoroughly and evenly, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and some zealotry regarding history. Well, he was a history teacher - if conveyed only a tenth of his passion to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across. I criticize this part of the book only for ignoring the arts. They demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, but the study differs slightly in kind - and no, it's not \\"just natural,\\" any more than learning French or calculus.My only criticism is that the text aged. The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s - none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s. As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age. Yes, there may be some somatic sense in writing with a pencil that can't be replicated at a keyboard, but the whole process of editing and revision has changed since then. Also, his praise for the \\"new math\\" seems more like a perfunctory show of support for his colleagues. In retrospect, it caused more problems than it solved.These are minor points, though, and don't detract from the main discussion. I recommmend it to any student and any teacher, including the self-taught student.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"Next year I will be entering a hard high-school where good study habits are required in order to get a passing grade.

I would recommend this book to all who have a hard time studying."},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"I'm a couple of decades out of college now, but I consider education to be a life-long undertaking and I fully agree with Armstrong's premise that \\"study is hard work.\\" I therefore read this book in the hope of discovering some new ideas to improve my study efficiency, but I found that I had already learned most of Armstrong's suggestions through my own trial and error over the years, combined with having read the excellent bookHow to Study in Collegeby Walter Pauk back in my college days. In short, I got very little out of this book.I also found Armstrong to be rather preachy, with a tone as though he's lecturing a somewhat insubordinate child, having to overexplain by giving all sorts of step-by-step directions on how things should be done. Since I'm an adult, I didn't care for his tone, and it's clear that his target audience is high-school and college students. Since even many of them won't care for his tone, the audience for this book effectively narrows down to people who are (a) quite motivated to learn, (b) willing to be firmly guided by the hand, and (c) having a hard time identifying and implementing effective study skills.If you fit that description, this book may help you and I can recommend it, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. For everyone else, the book is likely to have limited value, and of course people who aren't motivated won't read it anyway."},{"Title":"Study is Hard Work, Second Edition","review":"Sure wish I had known this book was available in our local library since 1957. I sure could have use it when I was in highschool in the 70s. Our schools' teachers should all read this and begin disseminating it to students beginning when they begin school.Since most schools send out newsletters to parents/guardians of students the same book should be made known to them to read on their own with the notation that these principles will be what is presented to their children as guides to become the best student they can be. As parents are a child's first and best teacher, reading this book will prepare your child for school as you will likely begin to follow these principles and pass them on to your children without much effort.Too many letters go out telling parents to become involved in their children's schooling...but the why and how isn't there. This book is the why and the how. I'll be writing a letter to the editor of our local weekly newspaper as well as to several other daily papers that our community subscribes to so that those wishing to improve their study skills will know they have a means to do so.I doubt any other study books compare as this one has all that is necessary to make a person realize it is within oneself to get the job done.

I read the entire book and answered the questions (70 in total) after each chapter in a matter of 2 days. I already had very good study skills and habits (3.3 overall g.p.a. after my freshman year) but this book still gave me various ways of how to improve those and even brought to my knowledge things I did that I didn't even know was helping me study.

Knowledge is the nourishment of our minds, just as food is the nourishment of our bodies. \\"By the sweat of your brow shall you earn your food to eat.\\"Knowledge isn't easy to acquire, the path to it is painful, but it doesn't have to be boring... you can make study a pleasant experience, just like training for any sport is fun, but ultimately it wears the body down.

As such, do not expect to be introduced to the basic outlines of the history of Europe between 1815 and 1848. Rather, expect to be subjected to a barrage of obscure (to me) names that are simply mentioned without any explanation: do you know who Charles Dunoyer is? How about Pellegrino Rossi? Nikolaus Becker? Armand Carrell? These and many dozen others that I had never heard of are quickly exhibited, perhaps with a handful of words to describe them, and then never referred to again. This is ostensibly done to provide illustrative examples of some trend or school of thought the author is addressing--which, of course, is made no less mysterious. Since the focus here is on the development of social and political ideas, no matter how evanescent, the names usually pertain to the editor of some radical or reactionary European journal, or to some pioneering university professor. In the same manner, events are mentioned but never described--the reader must already know. The sensation is one of overhearing a cocktail-party conversation between experts in nineteenth-century European history. There are, of course, helpful nuggets to be gleaned now and then; and the general intellectual feel of the age comes through, as thinkers of all stripes attempted to interpret the upheavals of the French Revolution, and engage, with varying degrees of reluctance, the demands of modernism. But the thinkers, and their thoughts, are only cursorily sketched. All in all, a frustrating read for someone needing an introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Waterfront Homes: From Castles to Cottages","review":"4 starsWaterfront Homes is a great book to dream about new possibilities and new directions for life. The houses in it range from elaborate mansions to small cabins on a distant lake. This is the type of book you give to someone who is searching for his or her next dream.

She and all these gifted architects opened my mind to the possibilities available as we search for a change in the ways we live our lives."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"This is not a &quot;three steps to understanding organizations&quot; type book. The people posting negative reviews for this were looking for something simple and digestable - this book is not that. However, if you take the time, you will find it profoundly alters your thinking about understanding organizations.This book provides solid theoretical models for understanding what is occuring in organizations. I read this book over 10 years ago and STILL find it the second best and most enlightening thing I have ever read on organizations. This has dramatically aided me in being a very successful business consultant.The foundation of this book is the notion that you cannot understand complex organizations in any meaningful way through a single perspective. People in the organizations operate on many different perspectives. Each view of the world creates its own understanding of the organizational problems, solutions and daily pattern of interaction. This book provides you the tools for understanding organizations through a number of key perspectives or metaphors, and gives you indications on how to perform a multi-perspective systems analysis.If you spend the time with this book, you will find yourself able to understand your surroundings FAR better than your peers."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers have used evocative images in trying to explain just what a corporation is. Have they succeeded? Gareth Morgan presents a thoughtful, well-documented look at images that arise from our theories and metaphors about reality. He discusses how they shape the way we view the corporation as an entity and how we act. His analysis involves a mix of philosophy, history, sociology, anthropology, biology and organizational examples. He moves from industrial-age notions of the organization as a machine, to biological analogies about the organization as an organism. Other metaphors - the organization as a brain, as social reality, as the source of cultural difference and as an arena for power struggles - shape what occurs within corporations. While this book is not an easy read, it illuminates the dynamics of organizational life. We [...] recommend this book to executives, and to readers intrigued by serious societal expositions."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Morgan decribes common assumptions about organizations - he helps to reveal the hidden assumptions behind the managers perceptions. What do we mean when we say that 'organizations are like animals'? It is pretty easy to start to think from a metaphor, and end up in literal believing in it (e.g. that 'organizations live and die', 'organizations have evolutions'). Such reifications are carefully described by Morgan - several most recurrent metaphors of organizations and popular organization theories basing on them are clearly described, and their pros and cons are pointed out. Having read 'Images of Organizations', it is much more difficult to adopt illusionate metaphors, and to get persuaded by a biased visioner."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"Gareth Morgan's book provides an antidote to the finance, marketing and HR texts that are required reading for an MBA student. The clever use of metaphor allows the reader to absorb the huge anount of information contained within the book (check out the bibliography!) - you don't even realise how much you are learning until you start relating concepts to others around you. My fellow students, colleagues and even my parents had to listen ...I found it a very easy to read book, if you are willing to put aside your existing ideas (psychic prison) about the way the organisation works(?) If you prefer big words, read Morgan and Burrell's Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis - essential reading, but even more brilliant as a companion to Images.Learn the stuff you are expected to know from your finance, marketing, statistics, strategy and HR texts, but understand the stuff that will change your world from Images of Organisation."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"This book is quite accessible to the reader. It's not dry like most textbooks, but talks about organizations in a straightforward manner. Morgan presents various ways of looking at organizations through the use of metaphors.This is what made the book so good. Each chapter examines a different metaphor applied to organization. Metaphors such as &quot;...as machines&quot;, and &quot;...as brains&quot; shed light on different aspects of organizations. What makes the book even better is that, in the summary of each chapter, Morgan also looks at the weaknesses of each metaphor, thus giving the reader a very thorough examination of the concept.The reason I didn't give this book 4 stars was the fact that, later in the book, it got kind of hard to follow. By the time he got to &quot;Organizations as Psychic Prisons&quot;, I was way out of my league. The chapters got convoluted and hard to understand. The chapter summaries ended up being half as long as the chapter itself. I just kind of gave up on some of them...they weren't helping me at all.All in all, if you want to learn about how organizations work, this is a very good book, but be wary of the last third or so."},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"thanks for your dealing i will deal again and again with you because it was nice to deal with you"},{"Title":"Images of Organization","review":"I am a graduate student in organizational development.

Eliot's Cycle of Poems","review":"Raymond Preston's FOUR QUARTETS REHEARSED was one of the first in-depth commentaries on T.S. Eliot's masterpiece \\"Four Quartets\\".Preston's examination of \\"Four Quartets\\" consists of four chapters, each about one of the Quartets. He analyses each portion and connects it to the other Quartets and to outside sources. Preston attempts to seek a middle ground on which scholars can agree. He posits no outlandish theories nor attacks the interpretation of his colleagues. He writes, \\"What is needed to correct the deficiencies of one's personal reading is not an exchange of critical gun-fire, but quiet co-operative discussion of detail.\\"What I found most refreshing about Preston's work is that it connects \\"Four Quartets\\" to other things Eliot was writing around the same time, such as his play \\"The Family Reunion\\" and various essays. He also dedicates much more attention to the inspiration of St John of the Cross than do most commentators on Eliot's work.FOUR QUARTETS REHEARSED is a great place to start for those wanting to approach a better understanding of the depths of Eliot's greatest work."},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"Patricia Seybold and her co-authors, Ronni T. Marshak and Jeffrey M. Lewis, have taken the familiar concept of establishing customer relationships as the basis of a company's success and updated the notion into the current day and its new technology, the Internet. The book is soundly based on lasting principles about successful customer focus, and details what that means now in many interesting and detailed examples. The book is strengthened by critiques of the weaknesses of some of the most successful companies, such as Charles Schwab and Grainger.Here are the principles:(1) Customers are in control. This point is made with the example of Napster, and the way this enabled people to change the way they acquired and used recorded music. Customers are going to reshape businesses by their behavior, and you had better be ready to respond. The recording companies were not, and great economic harm ensued as well as a slow down in the development of new acts.(2) Customer relationships count. The book points out that your economic value as a firm is related to how many customers you can attract and keep, and profitably supply. The authors argue that this will become a formal part of security analyst reports in the future. That would be progress over the way they value companies now!(3) Customer experience matters. This section focuses on how people feel emotionally about how they are being treated, and contains an interesting example of the on-line financial institution, Egg.The book then shifts into eight areas to focus on that supplement the list from their last book, which I have paraphrased:(1) Memorable, compelling, and desirable brand personalities(2) Smooth, continuous customer experience across channels and points of contact(3) Genuine caring about customers and the outcomes they experience(4) Measure how you are doing in what matters to customers(5) Improve your operational excellence(6) Make careful use of customers' time(7) Integrate customer preferences and information into the company and its interactions(8) Create products, services, and processes that can be quickly transformed as customers shift their focus.The book addresses how all of this can be better managed, and proposes a &quot;flight plan&quot; approach managed by a &quot;Customer Flight Deck&quot; that keeps the enterprise focused on what is most important. Essentially, the Customer Flight Deck is the customer focus part of a Balanced Scorecard. In fact, you would do well to read this book in conjunction with The Strategy-Focused Organization for the most benefit. The book has several Customer Flight Decks written out about the key examples employed by the authors. I thought these were well done and helpful for applying the authors' concepts and advice.The book is rich in quotes that help focus your attention. Here are a few of my favorites:&quot; . . . [R]unning a business in today's Internet-enabled era is like trying to fly a plane [while] . . . replacing the engine.&quot;&quot;Customers have taken control of our companies' destinies.&quot;&quot; . . . [C]ustomers now have access to information that lets them make informed decisions [for the first time].&quot;I found it easy to relate to this book because so many of the examples are familiar to me both as a customer and as a student of business. The advice to be sparing of customer time and provide coordinated contacts is going to be hard for most companies to follow, but they need to start down that path. I am constantly struck by how much time I have to waste to buy from companies, and how the one hand has no clue about how to help me with something that the other hand knows.When this era is finally history, I suspect that companies will be divided into two categories: Those who used information to make customers' lives easier and more pleasant, and those who created technology (like endless voice mail chains) that drove customers crazy. Hopefully, the latter will soon be dead as a dodo. In which category will your company be?I suggest that you ask yourself constantly, &quot;What have I done to make life better and easier for my customers today?&quot;If you think about customer relationships as being like what a good hostess or host does, you should do well . . . as long as you implement your ideas."},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"As a teacher and counsellor in business management and having assisted over 2,000 businesses in my lifetime, either through diagnostic assessment, financial analysis and/or business plan development, I highly recommend this book. When it comes to your customer, this book is what might be referred to as the &quot;Businessman's Bible.&quot;Without a customer, you do not have a business - the customer is the backbone of your business. The customer is paramount! Simply put in layman's terms, it is not a matter of what you want to sell to the customer that is important. It is what the customer wants to buy and how you satisfy that customer's needs that is critical to your company's success. The customer is doing you a favour by coming to you, the business owner, with money in hand ready to purchase your product/service.It is irrelevant whether you are selling over the internet, in a retail facility, from your home or door-to-door, the same basic business principles of customer service apply. This book takes some recognized standard concepts and expands on these to keep up with modern technology. The author has presented a wealth of knowledge on building long-lasting, positive customer realtionships in today's modern world. &quot;The Customer Revolution&quot; is a must-read book for anyone in business today."},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"When was the following proclaimed?&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident&#8221;&#8230;that all people have a right to &#8220;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;America and its schools have promoted this democratic principle for centuries. Right?But did this &#8220;obvious&#8221; truth help our country resolve the complex social conditions that galvanized the civil rights movement in the 1960&#8217;s? Of course not. We&#8217;re still working on the race issue&#8212;despite the fact that so many American &#8220;leaders&#8221; say they get it.Or what about &#8220;the obvious&#8221; truth that &#8220;people are our most important asset?&#8221; We&#8217;ve heard that one from business leaders for decades. But how many management teams have truly executed that vision consistently, with integrated HR policies and practices in their organization, especially during downturns? Not many.My point is this. Just because something is obvious doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s real or that you can easily execute it. And that&#8217;s where Martin&#8217;s assessment falls short. In his criticism of &#8220;The Customer Revolution,&#8221; Martin say&#8217;s it&#8217;s obvious that &#8220;customers are, and always have been, the lifeblood of any company&#8230;If you are a successful business you already know the significance of customers.&#8221;But talk to some of those successful businesses, some of which are discussed in this book, and it will be quite obvious to you that managing the quality of your customer relationships is a complex, imperfect and at times painful undertaking, especially when you have multiple organizations and product lines. It&#8217;s not as obvious as you think, Martin.For example, I just installed Symantic&#8217;s industry-leading pcAnywhere, so I could download files from my office onto my laptop while spending time on Cape Cod.When it&#8217;s not crashing, it runs like a snail. My 4-year-old daughter is more effective at helping me cope with my frustration than the support I&#8217;ve received from Symantic&#8217;s customer service department, which I find pathetic. Gone is my summer dream of simple file sharing on the Cape! So, do you think I&#8217;m going to do business with this &#8220;successful&#8221; company again? As Martin would say, &#8220;Duh?&#8221;As for other businesses, perhaps less successful, capturing the &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; of customers for the long haul is even more arduous. Many businesses today operate without any well-thought-out strategy for selecting and developing leaders throughout their organization--leaders who truly understand the requirements for managing customer relationships. Nor have they implemented the right business practices, IT strategy or infrastructure to succeed.And that&#8217;s why &#8220;The Customer Revolution&#8221; is relevant for anyone who wants a more sophisticated understanding of the multiple issues you face when building a &#8220;customer-centric&#8221; business. This book adds value in two key ways:1) First, it defines the extent to which power relationships have shifted in favor of customers over suppliers. Martin is right to say that the Internet has streamlined existing B2B relationships and saved costs. But he&#8217;s totally wrong to dismiss how the Internet has help intelligent customers challenge and disrupt standard business practices in such areas as pricing structures, distribution channels, and the way companies design and deliver their products and services to customers.2) Second, and most important, this book offers a glimpse into what a customer-centric business looks like&#8212;the strategies and best practices that business leaders have learned from their successes and failures&#8212;in an environment where customers have greater control. The book addresses such questions as:- How do you build your business based on customer scenarios?- What does it really take to get into your customer&#8217;s head at every stage of your relationship?- How do you build a brand&#8212;not just around products&#8212;but around the way you want customers to feel when they interact with them?- If the quality of your customer relationships determines the value of your company, how then do you measure and monitor that value over time?- What leadership competencies do you need to manage your company by and for customer value?- How well are you building your customer franchise?This book makes a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion about what it takes to build deep customer relationships for long-term survival and growth. For people interested in that topic, it&#8217;s worth the read. Hopefully, it will motivate some folks in business to wake up and smell the coffee before it&#8217;s too late. And that&#8217;s not &#8220;restating the obvious.&#8221;"},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"Patricia Seybold and her co-authors, Ronni T. Marshak and Jeffrey M.

Meet Arne Frager, rock entrepreneur, who has managed the mixing boards for dozens of recording artists and enjoyed the rock-solid, decades-long expansion of the music industry.But last year all that changed. \\"The whole music recording business is off 50 percent,\\" Mr. Frager said in July, 2000. \\"The big record labels are so paralyzed by this MP3/napster/Gnutella/Freenet distribution of digital music, they're not signing any new acts!\\"Welcome to the customer revolution, a chaotic, bottom-up transformation of the marketplace. While the revolution may be invisible, its battle cry sounds the death knell of the familiar top-down business model in which suppliers feed buyers a stock of consumable items.In the new regime, customers order products and services directly from producers capable of delivering mass-customization. Furthermore, consumers and providers can by- pass the cost-heavy distribution stream -- a move destined to shake up everyone from car dealers to insurance brokers.Patricia Seybold's new book, The Customer Revolution, is intended to guide entrepreneurs into this new era of global, user-driven trade. She begins by examining the remarkable transformation of the music business, then analyzes the forces that are re-making almost every enterprise.Timbuk2 Designs offers a fascinating study of mass customization that is at the heart of Ms. Seybold's thesis. You can log on to the company web site and custom-design a shoulder bag, checking the price for each feature you add. Once you complete the on-line payment, the bag is manufactured and shipped within hours.Other illustrations of customer-driven enterprises flesh out the author's premise. For example, log on to to sample some of the 30,000+ commercial-free internet radio stations. After a few minutes, you'll be wondering how commercial radio broadcasters will adapt to the challenge presented by this unlimited, consumer-selected stream of digital radio.Yet despite such compelling subject matter, Ms. Seybold's Customer Revolution fails to achieve its mission. While her goal is clear, her strategy and tactics begin to falter after the opening chapters.First, it's evident that too many authors had a hand in the book's composition. The internal narratives about innovation that bolster the opening pages are abandoned and replaced by half-baked accounting models and re-cycled management theory.Next, the authors become so committed to their customer-centric analysis, they invent a new, customer-based accounting model. \\"Customer capital\\" and \\"customer momentum\\" are intended to measure \\"lifetime customer value.\\" But after several pages of explanation, Ms. Seybold and company confess that their new math doesn't quite add up: \\"As soon as we discover one or more simple formulas that work reliably ... we'll alert you on our Web site.\\" Don't hold your breath waiting for your accountant to embrace this new paradigm while the authors re-jig their tabulations.Another innovation is their \\"flight deck\\" method of assessing corporate performance. Comprised of four modules (navigation, performance, operations, environment) the flight deck analysis is derived from air pilot critical-path management. The technique is applied to several enterprises and each company is reduced to a predictable cookie-cutter deconstruction.Finally -- and most lamentably -- the authors become cheerleaders for their own theories. For example, the success of on-line broker Charles Schwab is attributed to their \\"strong foundation of core customer-centric values.\\" There's no hint that Schwab's success was tied to the biggest stock bubble in history. Instead, we are told (cue the violins), \\"Every employee cares deeply about how well each Schwab customer is doing.\\" Now that Schwab has laid off 13% of its employees and profit has been cut by two-thirds, readers may wonder if the Schwab story still rings true.Ultimately, The Customer Revolution loses the battle for market intelligence to its own reductive -- and sometimes incomplete -- analysis, an analysis that fails to illuminate the forces driving the events the authors describe so competently. The result is a book that attempts to breach the revolutionary barricades, but instead, falls backward and is impaled upon its own sword.D.F. (Don) BaileyThe Customer Revolution"},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"Yes, a MUST Read. Sure, it seems redundant to remind individuals - especially business owners - that customers drive business. However, this book reminded me that I am also a customer and that I control some aspects of others' business. Customer service seems to be a lost art. Many reviewers summarize the book, so allow me share a story instead.I recently wrote a complaint letter to a furniture store - to complain about their lack of customer service. This store advertises, on several in-store banners, that customer service is at the top of their list. When I received a phone call from the corporate operations manager, he immediately asked me what I did for a living and if I dealt with customers. He wanted to appeal to my business sense about the importance of customer service. I told him that business sense has nothing to do with it. I am the customer, it doesn't matter what I do for a living. I told him that he should be applying business \\"common sense\\" toward customer service when dealing with me - the customer. However, he could not focus on the fact that I was a customer. Instead he just kept talking about how I should \\"know what it is like dealing with customers\\". He never saw me as a customer, but as another businessman. He tried to circumvent the customer relationship by attempting to build a business relationship. He failed to know or understand the three basic principles mentioned in the book: 1) Customers are in control, 2) Customer relationships count, and 3) Customer experience matters. Now if this book is so obvious, redundant, a waste of time, or a waste of money, then why didn't the corporate operations manager from this furniture store \\"get it\\"? Why are there so many people that still do not get it?We are human and, at times, we get so busy working \\"IN\\" the business that we sometimes forget just how important customer service can be to the overall business. This book serves as a great reminder.The book includes a framework for customer metrics - Customer Flight Deck. The authors provide a thorough overview and several examples through their case studies. By measuring active customers, retention, experience, and spending, these metrics will help you monitor the navigation, performance, operations, and environment of your company. I found the case studies, with examples of how other companies used the Customer Flight Deck, very enlightening. The Customer Flight Deck will fit nicely in the customer portion of the Balanced Scorecard.On a final note, although the book was written in 2001 it is still very relevant. As mentioned in all the reviews, the authors drive home the point - the customer is in control. In fact, all of these reviews are a great example of the customer being in control. Look at the access and control we, as reviewers, have on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"Summary:Customers are in control. Today most of the customers want both &iexcl;low prices and good services&iexcl;. How can a company survive and thrive in such customer economy? Transformed to customer-centric company is a must. This book teaches us how a company can successfully transform to customer-oriented company. Structurally, this can be divided into three parts and each part will have several well-know company as an examples:Firstly, Seybold analysis how customer control business in terms of convenience, control and transparency.Secondly, Seybold introduce the concept of &iexcl;customer franchise&iexcl; (which means Total lifetime value of the current and expected future customers discounted back to the present) and explain how vital this concept is.Thirdly, Seybold recommends building customer relationship is the basic element. In order to create, maintain and sustain a long-lasting customer relationship, seven factors are introduced, including, 1) Time, 2)Matters to customer 3) Brand personality, 4) Focus on customer&iexcl;s DNA, 5) Deliver a seamless experience, 6) Morph and 7) Execution.Comment:Advantages:1. InsightfulFor students who do not have much practical experiences, this book really give me a lot of insights. For example, I understand the trend of future market will tend to customer-oriented. Also, I understand it will put all company in a difficult position if company cannot put themselves in customer shoes.2. Can apply in different situationAlso, the concept introduced by this book is useful and can be applied in different industries, companies and countries. For example: customer franchise and the seven critical factors.3. Practical case studiesIn addition, all these concepts will be supported by practical case studies which analysis by author from inside-out. For example, author will explain the background of a company first, then explain what does that company do in order to survive and thrive in this customer economy together with their actual result, at last, author will evaluate the disadvantages and advantages of that company policies and strategies.Disadvantages:1. Provide linkage and relationshipIn my opinion, there still have room to improve. First of all, from the student point of view, the structure of this book can be more simple and clear. It is better to provide more relationship between each chapter. Sometimes, it is hard for me to follow the concepts since2. The concepts of &iexcl;Customer Flight Deck&iexcl;Also, the concept of &iexcl;Customer Flight Deck&iexcl; is rather ambiguous. It is better to explain it in a more simple and practical way. Besides, author fails to provide strong evidence and reason why a company should take action to implement &iexcl;Customer Flight Deck&iexcl;. It is better to explain more and provide more supported details why that company can be improved by a recommended &iexcl;Customer Flight Deck&iexcl;."},{"Title":"The Customer Revolution","review":"This is a practical approach to changing customers and how best to respond. In my opinion, it builds on Fred. Newell's book &quot;Loyalty.com&quot; What I found most useful about this book was the practical examples - relevant case studies like Egg, HP and best of all Tesco (page 250). For another book with good case examples of customer relationships, check out Cram's book &quot;Customers that Count&quot;.Another good point, Seybold puts up an interesting form of measuring customer relationships in chapter 8, called the &quot;Customer Flight Deck&quot;. Structurally, the book has three principles: 1. Customers are in control, 2. Customer Relationships count. 3. Customer Experience matters.

The customer is paramount! Simply put in layman's terms, it is not a matter of what you want to sell to the customer that is important. It is what the customer wants to buy and how you satisfy that customer's needs that is critical to your company's success. The customer is doing you a favour by coming to you, the business owner, with money in hand ready to purchase your product/service.It is irrelevant whether you are selling over the internet, in a retail facility, from your home or door-to-door, the same basic business principles of customer service apply. This book takes some recognized standard concepts and expands on these to keep up with modern technology.

Based on the premise that customers are much more informed, and thus are aware of competitors and pricing, she describes how to embrace the e-business revolution and respond to these new demands. Seybold includes many examples of companies that successfully adopted these strategies. However, it should also be noted that as this review is being written, many companies that espoused the ideals offered here are closing up shop.

I have studied history in school the more traditional way; with dates, places, maps etc. This was lacking in this book. The inter-connectedness of the nations and the huge influence of the papacy came as a surprise to me. There was a lot of space given to Martin Luther, but I completely missed the link between this, the kings / rulers, and how the boundaries of the various kingdoms changed over the centuries.When did Germany really become a nation?

It gave a look at a young boy not living in a conventional household. It doesn't give into stereotypes regarding children from split homes. I like the fact that the story focuses on the important aspects of DeShawn's life. He tends to notice the little things rather than on the big picture. I like the way it is something that many kids are able to relate to. It isn't just for one group, one gender, or one race. Certain aspects of the story are relatable to anyone who reads the book. DeShawn is also a very relatable character. The reader feel drawn into the story and cannot wait to turn to the next page to see what will happen. The illustrations are also so tied into the story that a reader need not read the story, they could figure out what was going on through the pictures."},{"Title":"Deshawn Days","review":"Mr. Medina's &quot;DeShawn Days&quot; captures what life looks like from the view of a child growing up in an urban and distinctly ethnic area.

Mr. Medina somehow presents just the right balance between both the difficult realities as well as the, yes, believe it or not, joys, both of which actually do exist in what some folks like to call &quot;the ghetto.&quot; It's reading that I think kids like DeShawn will relate to, and other kids will learn, understand, and yes, enjoy."},{"Title":"Deshawn Days","review":"Medina takes you back to your childhood with his depiction of the life and times and dreams of Deshawn Days.

Not because it was badly written book, but because the mystery subplot played a poor second fiddle to Sara's frustrations over her feelings for married DCI Andrew Poole. The story unfolded very slowly and the suspense and tension levels were barely discernible. What saved \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" was Morag Joss' clear and precise character portrayals and how she made her characters the focal point of what was going on.Cellist Sara Selkirk is not feeling very happy or sanguine right now. First she allowed her agent to persuade her to work with the famous Hungarian composer of modern music, Herve Petrescu (he's writing a very modern and contemporary piece for her), in spite of the fact that she really doesn't like Petrescu's music very much. And then she's allowed herself to be lulled by the famous man's sex appeal into agreeing to find him suitable accommodations while he's in Bath. (Actually what Petrescu was angling for was to live with Sara while they worked on his composition. Something that Sara suddenly discovered she just wasn't up for just then). And if that's not all, there's the messy complication of her relationship with the very married DCI Andrew Poole, who has agreed to give his failing marriage another go in spite of the fact that's he very much in love with Sara. So that when Andrew finds himself in the middle of a letter bomb killing, Sara finds herself taking an unnatural interest in the case. The victim was a not very well liked old lady who had had an altercation with a pair of animal rights activists over a fur coat. The police think that one activist sent a letter bomb to the woman to make a point. But Sara instinctively thinks that some secret in the old woman's past may be at the root of her death. If she could only get Andrew to listen to her...The novel unfolds over the course of a few months in autumn, and as such is a little slow moving. And the fact that the book seemed to circle over and over again around Sara's and Andrew's twin frustrations over the state of their relationship only added to the nothing-much-happening-here feeling. However, the author's colourful and loving depiction of Bath, together with her precise, vivid and full bodied character portrayals saved the book and made it a more interesting read. Some readers may, however, grow a little tired and irritated of Sara and her frequent outbursts of anger and feelings of superiority -- I know that I did. And I also found myself, unexpectedly, feeling sorry for Andrew's wife, Valerie. It is fairly obvious that she's not a likable character, and yet I couldn't help feeling sympathetic towards the outclassed Valerie. All in all, \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" is a well written novel. It is just not a very satisfactory mystery novel because the atmosphere of suspense and intrigue was not always there, and because the entire mystery subplot was often overshadowed by Sara's emotions. About a two-thirds through the book, things do pick up at a breath-neck pace, and everything is tidily tied up. And I couldn't help wishing that the entire book had had that same feel and tone."},{"Title":"Fearful Symmetry","review":"At the Oxfam store in Bath, septuagenarian Imogen Beven puts out an old fur piece for sale. Animal rights activists Anna Ward-Partigan and Bren kick up a fuss to get it removed from the shelf. Imogen tells the irate duo to leave. As they do he says he will get even with the SOB. Not long afterward, Imogen receives a package in the mail. When she goes to open it, the package explodes. She dies in the hospital.Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Poole leads the investigation into the letter bomb homicide. He is distracted by his estrangement with his wife Valerie; she punishes him for an alleged affair with his beloved internationally acclaimed cellist Sara Selkirk that he wants but has not acted on out of fears of hurting his three children. Andrew learns of the Oxfam incident. He interviews Anna, who admits Bren vowed he would get even, has since vanished, and demands she see her father a judge as her animal rights idealism vanished once she understands the trouble she is in. A second homicide forces Sara into the investigation.FEARFUL SYMMETRY is a fabulous tale that starts off as a pure English police procedural, but towards the middle becomes an amateur sleuth investigation. The transition is effortlessly handled so that the audience accepts Sara's involvement without blinking. Andrew is an intriguing protagonist struggling with his growing love for Sara, but trying to remain faithful to his wife. Czech composer Herve Pretescu accentuates the personal drama when he meets Valerie and already knows Sara, but in turn somewhat overwhelms the mystery. As with the finely tuned FUNERAL MUSIC, Morag Joss provides a delightful mystery that looks deep into the key quartet.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fearful Symmetry","review":"The first half of this book seems to have been written tongue-in-cheek, detailing the pomposity of third-rate modern composers, aging opera singers, their hangers-on and emulators, in an irresistibly deadpan fashion. The central love affair between Sara the professional cellist and Andrew, the policeman who studies cello with her, is not the main attraction of this book - nothing really new happens in their relationship, except for one surprise toward the very end of the book which remains undeveloped. Rather, the point lies in the other characters' facades and the contrast with their underlying agendas. This is indeed a bit like Rendell or P. D. James without their tightly woven dark elegance. Through Sara Selkirk's perceptive yet inept blundering, facts are uncovered and the connections between these dysfunctional, sometimes repellent, yet often sympathetic, individuals come to light.Adele, the autistic daughter of an opera singer, is vividly drawn and totally credible, at least to me, although I must admit I have not read lots of books about autism. She is gifted with perfect musical recall and a technically admirable but inexpressive voice, as well as the ability to recall and reverse visual patterns, and it is this gift around which the plot revolves - the \\"fearful symmetry\\" of the title. Her character will \\"vibrate in the memory\\" as music does; we will also remember her pitiable yet somehow heroic mother and the young Chinese boy who truly loves her. Joss has a wonderful gift for tragi-comedy and although this is certainly not a perfect book, it's nonetheless enjoyable for what it is...a way station, on her way to writing \\"Half-Broken Things,\\" a prize-winning novel which I am eager to read."},{"Title":"Fearful Symmetry","review":"Morag Joss writes well, but I would not put this book in the class of a true mystery. It takes ages to get through it, long paragraphs of descriptions of gardens, etc., whole bios of all the characters, even minor ones, that, though interesting, are not necessary.

Andrew's marriage is one that has grown boring, Sara and he have so much more in common, but he frets about his children should he leave Valerie. At the end of it all, one is not too sure one cares.

As the father of three children in primary grades, it was good to have this book as a transition between simple children's books and chapter books. With the simple books, the story ends just as children are starting, and with chapter books, they think they'll never end.The themes addressed are: wanting to please, friendship, gaining approval, different perspectives, how misunderstandings can lead to sadness, and how that sadness can be overcome by serendipity. The owner wants to do the best for the dog, and the dog wants to do the best for the owner. It helps us appreciate the gap between humans and animals, and how we can get along through unconditional love. The mix of themes and perspectives is unique.

Firstly a breakdown of different aspects of Indian vocal music, Druphad, Kyhal and the types of ornimentation used in singing and secondly a good listing of a large number of ragas in all of the different thats with examples in different Tals.As with Tabla playing vocal music is something that should be taught teacher to student rather than from a book. This book would no doubt be very useful to someone who has a either a good grounding in Hindustani music or has had a couple of lessons and wants to push themselves a bit futher however I wouldn't go for it if you are a total novice.

The book itself makes no claims about being a self-study course, that being said, for the astute individual learner; one can work through this on their own, it would just be difficult. But imagine if piano method books were being judged on whether or not they could be studied on their own.As far as the book itself is concerned, I think it is an incredible resource for those of us who don't speak Hindi/Sanskrit but want to play/sing songs from India. It is organized by thaat with raga-s that belong to that thaat along with a very straight forward history/theory section.

Michael Himes reflects in his introduction to this book, it is essentially a synopsis of a series of videotapes compiled as a \\"Mystery of Faith\\" lecture series.The book contains ten concise chapters covering the following topics: Trinity, Grace, Incarnation, Salvation, Church, Baptism, Eucharist, Sacraments of Vocation, Reconciliation and Tradition.Each of the ten chapters concludes with a series of insightful questions for reflection. Whether for use by a group or for personal study and reflection, this book contains many interesting insights. Although the subtitle indicates that the book is an \\"introduction to Catholicism\\", I would recommend the book to anyone interested in a further examination of the faith."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Nothing I write will come close to the appropriate praise that this little book deserves. Michael Himes, a professor of theology at Boston College, known for his excellent video series from which this book was derived, does an amazing job at summarizing the essential elements of what it means to be part of the Catholic Christian community.This is as fun a book to read as it is informative. Having looked at many \\"Introductions to Catholicism\\" in order to better recommend particular books to inquirers, I would not hesitate to endorse this book."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"I have found this small book to provide a wonderful introduction to Catholicism for my RCIA group here at Cornell University. It offers a broad and easily understandable look at Catholicism and leaves our students hungry for more. The questions at the end of each chapter are particularly helpful."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Michael Himes provides a very different approach to understanding the basics of Catholicism. A provocative and nontraditional approach yet faithful to the Tradition. The style is conversational which makes it easy to read. The author intertwines Scripture, classic literature and human experiences as he probes the mysteries of the Catholic faith. The reader is plunged into the meaning of the mystery of God, the Incarnation and Salvation,the Church,the Sacraments and Tradition. A stimulating resource for readers who would like to revisit these fundamental topics. And an interesting first look to introduce a reader to the basics of Catholicism."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Michael Himes writes just as he speaks, that is to say, in a deeply theological yet easy to read and clear style, avoiding theological jargon. The book is based on his excellent video series of the same title. The ten chapters of 7-9 pages each cover the essential foundations of Catholicism, including concise presentations on Trinity, Grace, Incarnation, Church and the sacraments. The book also includes a topical and scriptural index."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"I am only halfway through this book and I am so in love with it that I called it up on Amazon to purchase it for a few people I know would love it, too. It's a brief, concise discussion about some basic philosophical tenets which have grown to be included in the religion of Catholicism. As a recent student of Fr. Himes, I would like to address a previous reviewer who is made uncomfortable by language like \\"God emptied Godself.\\" This is the way the man speaks. He uses all of the phrases written in that book. He says, in his lectures at Boston College, \\"I would suggest to you...\\" as if his point might be something you would like to consider. It is a wonderful, inclusive manner of speaking/writing. And, as a side note, if something philosophical/theological makes one feel initially uncomfortable, I would suggest that one give it a little more mulling over in the heart; perhaps there is growth and learning just around the corner...?"},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Although cleverly written and interesting to read, I would not recommend this book for a person who is not already well grounded in their knowledge of the faith. I found myself growing in disquiet with every chapter I read. While not directly espousing error, it came sufficiently close to be disturbing. I will give some examples to illustrate:1) Chapter 3 on the Incarnation discusses how the Incarnation shows the essential dignity of man and even quotes Pope John Paul II on this point. Yet the way the point is made comes close to idolizing man - going as far as saying: \\"From all eternity God has wanted to be exactly like you and me\\" and that this was God's \\"secret ambition\\". To me, that comes uncomfortably close to saying that God wants to be in our image whereas the bible tells us that we are the ones created in God's image! This is accentuated in Chapter 4 on Salvation when it frames the original sin as the refusal to believe in the goodness of being human. Yes, arguments can be made to explain what the author really means but the risk of misleading the uninitiated is too great in an introductory book!2) Chapter 7 on the Eucharist, goes to great lengths to discuss how the Eucharist brings about the unity of believers who share in the Eucharistic banquet. While this is true, the first and most important aspect of the Eucharist is that it is the re-presentation of Jesus' sacrifice on Calvary. Unfortunately, this essential element is not mentioned. This emphasis on the communion aspect at the expense of the sacrifice aspect drains the Eucharist of its meaning and value.I could have given other examples but these should be enough to make the point. If this is truly your introduction to Catholicism, all I can say is BEWARE. BTW, an irritating trait is the use of 'inclusive language' resulting in ridiculuos sounding expressions like \\"God emptied Godself\\"."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Drafting for Handweavers","review":"This book is destined to become one of the great classics for weavers!

Jance's tenth book in the Joanna Brady series and it seems as if she keeps getting better as she racks up the bestsellers.Cochise County Sheriff, Joanna Brady, is called to the scene of a gruesome murder. Out in the desert, secluded from everyone, Carol Mossman enjoyed her seventeen dogs as her only companions. She had lived a troubled life and didn't trust many people. Someone was bent on killing Carol and it was Joanna Brady's job to find out who and why.The basic story line is enjoyable, but the subplots are what make the book interesting. Seems Joanna Brady has just learned that she's pregnant and is battling morning sickness. Added to this is the budget cuts which leaves the animal control department answering to the county sheriff - when the seventeen dogs perish along with their owner, animal rights activists begin protesting and voicing their outrage. And we're given a glimpse as to the focus on the next book in the series: it's reelection time and Brady is beginning her campaign against a former deputy.Character development is one of Jance's strong suits. Lively individuals abound in this tale. We have Carol's grandmother who is feisty and determined to help Joanna Brady find her granddaughter's killer. Carol's two sisters are both unique and interesting. And we have reoccurring roles from Tica Romero (the dispatcher), Gregovitch and Spike (the K-9 team), Frank Montoya (Joanna's right had man), and detectives Carbajal, Carpenter among others. Of course Butch, Joanna's husband, has a major role but at times he came off surly. I'm not sure that was Jance's intention, but non-the-less it was apparent that Butch is getting a bit tired of his wife's hectic schedule. It should be interesting to see what he thinks as Joanna's pregnancy continues and her schedule doesn't slow down.Underlying moral issues abound in EXIT WOUNDS. Carol Mossman was a hoarder - someone who takes in abandoned, abused, or unwanted dogs. We find out that many hoarders have been the victims of abuse and this book focuses on the long-term affects of that abuse. Without Jance's skill it could have been a depressing book dealing with so many issues that are hard to digest in large doses. Instead we are given a story that will make one stop and take stock of the situation and realize that judging someone is not a good thing, but getting help for those that have these issues is a necessity. Too many times, people as well as society turn their backs and just point fingers saying, \\"She has too many dogs.\\"Another moral issue lightly touched upon is bigamists and the cults who exist to promote this behavior. Jance doesn't delve into this topic but opens eyes to the fact that it does exist.Also, we're given a glimpse at the illegal immigration problems encountered in many southwestern states. Coyotes smuggling undocumented aliens are often headline news when their vehicles crash, or they dump the UDA's in the desert and expect them to walk in the heat with no water. Jance gives a personal touch to these stories that will make her fans take heart when they again hear one of these stories on the news.Overall the mystery portion is not rocket science and is easily understood, especially when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. The moral issues will make you think long after the book is finished. And the characters are like old friends, whom we can't wait to see again soon! It's another winner for Jance."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"This was my first Jance novel. I enjoyed it immensely. I was surprised until the last page about \\"who done it\\" I learned some things about why people keep such large packs of pets. Jance's descriptions made me want to visit the desert.

Her running for Sheriff and the up coming election takes the back seat, as she is knee deep with all the uncovering of incest and the sad aftermath of thirty years of secrets.

I felt almost the opposite, that Joanna maintained a remarkable degree of femininity given her job as Sheriff, and her male \\"support staff\\" which included her husband, seemed very male and secure in their maleness.

They are very similar. This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise. What a contrived piece of garbage!I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time. If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through. If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious. If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating. That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.This author has no style. The book reads like an episode of inside edition. There is no immersion into the story. The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them. As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario. The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable. I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn. The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me. Do not waste your time.I must say though that this novel was inspirational.

Although tragic, on a heartwarming level it is likely to be appreciated by 'committed' dog owners. It deals with the abusive deaths of a dozen innocent dogs slain by an incompetent who under- ventilates a shelter, then leaves the dogs, toilet seat down, confined in the overheated desert with the unbearable stench of an unpalatable dead human. A corrupt lawperson illegally takes the sole underaged survivor home as a potential sex slave of a family friend instead of properly consulting a kindly officer entrusted with such problems, herself a victim of the lawperson's budgetary mismanagment. The survivor is found in a makeshift shelter outside, where fortunately much of the psychological damage of vicious loss of the entire community was minimized. Although swift justice to the corrupt official is thwarted through political influence, the incompetent dog killer is at last punished. By pluck and personality the survivor ascends to a role as a security advisor to the now-contrite lawperson, which leads in turn to a rewarding career.B.

But when the local priest, or minister turned out to be female the book starated becoming unbelievable.

Detectives discover seventeen dogs in the woman's house, all of whom suffocated to death. The dead woman turns out to be Carol Mossman, who has held a series of low-paying inconsequential jobs before ending up in this trailer owned by her grandmother.Jance, a seasoned best-selling author, plays fair with the readers while delivering a page-turner. We look over Sheriff Brady's shoulder as she investigates. Two newswomen were murdered in the same style: is a serial killer loose? What was Mossman trying to keep quiet? And what is the role of her definitelydysfunctional family?Although the mystery holds attention, the real action takes place in Sheriff Brady's personal life. By marrying her off to a novelist who does the housework, author Jance has avoided the fate of most married detective heroines: losing their edge. Husband Butch cooks great meals and raises teenage daugher Jenny, while her mother continues to disapprove of whatever Sheriff Brady does, on or off the job.And early in the book, Joanna Brady gets a surprise that will create interesting subplots in volumes to come.Jance's novel goes down as smooth as a good scotch. She's a real pro even when she delivers a searing message. As a dog-lover, she must have had a hard time writing about the way dogs suffer, and it's not surprising that the Brady household acquires more dogs during hte course of the action. I think the author's heart was touched as much as her heroine's.I'm not surprised by the number of women who appear here: a female sheriff, a minister, and more. It's not uncommon to experience women in those roles. By creating a superman husband, Jance allows her heroine to focus on her sheriff role, bypassing traditional female obligations.The characters don't have the staying power of other heroines, such as Anna Pigeon or Bennie Rosato. The focus is on action, no-nonsense and get-the-job-done. This approach may be anchored in the author's southwestern roots, where tough women work on ranches, ride horseback and do their jobs. Jance herself comes across as tough and straight-shooting (I saw her sign books in Tucson). Sandra Day O'Connor is cut from the same cloth.Heroine Joanna Brady would probably find a soul sister in Shirley McClintock, heroine of the series by B. J. Oliphant, or Texana Jones, Allana Martin's heroine . You may not agree with their southwestern values, which remain conservative in many ways. But you have to respect their grit and determination to get the job done. And you have to respect the skill of author J. A. Jance, who makes it look easy."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"We'll admit we're big fans of JA Jance, having read every novel she's written, some two dozen to date. This tenth book (or so, depending if you count \\"Partner in Crime\\" featuring both her fictional stars) in the Sheriff Brady series sees Joanna incredibly busy with an unfortunate murder of a lonely poor woman surrounded by 17 dogs; a horrific car crash filled with 20-some illegal aliens; and family issues in abundance including morning sickness! Deaths of two reporters, a bigamist cult, and a dysfunctional family filled with incest only add to the headaches and heartaches. Joanna tends to be a workaholic anyway, personally doing much of her detective's leg work or attending trouble calls at all hours of the day and night. If you're wanting to read about a highly competent, driven law enforcement officer, you need to look no further. Indeed author Jance not only develops her plot carefully, with plenty of character work to get you hooked on the people involved (as is our leading lady), but also spins the story with enough complexity to keep you guessing 'til the end.An ulterior motive with this book is to describe a mental illness called \\"hoarding\\", in which usually an unbalanced loner starts accumulating far more animals than they can begin to feed or care for properly. Using the ploy that the county Animal Control operation has recently been turned over to the sheriff to manage, she and we learn about the difficulty in placing animals for adoption and the surprising number being put to sleep every week. Pictured on the back cover with two dogs, it's clear Jance makes a compelling case for more awareness of the issues and the funding such shelters really need.With a realistic cast of characters hard not to like, with family tensions and murders galore, it's hard to put down the latest Joanna Brady. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Sheriff Joanna Brady has her hands full with an election campaign, unexpected pregnancy, and her house-husband Butch's frustrating career as a novelist. But when a woman is killed and her seventeen dogs die in the woman's non-air-conditioned trailer, Brady is plunged into mystery. The first murder is followed by two more--with the same weapon signature. But the deeper Brady digs, the uglier she things look. The dead woman was already a victim--of child abuse so severe it made her incapable of holding a steady job and turned her into a hoarder for dogs. Brady swears she'll find the killer, but can any punishment be enough for what has happened?Author J. A. Jance writes a compelling and exciting mystery shot-through with authentic visions of the desert mountains of Arizona. Brady is well developed as a character--with a rich but complicated family life and the drive to serve as sheriff. A subplot involving a SUV crash that killed a number of undocumented aliens being smuggled across the border from Mexico deepens the story and adds emotional depth.J. A. Jance has written a series of novels featuring Sheriff Joanna Brady and EXIT WOUNDS may be the best I've read so far. I couldn't put the book down and was practicaly out of breath when I finished it. EXIT WOUNDS may be read independently of the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Sheriff Joanna Brady's first husband, Andy was running for Sheriff in Cochise County, Arizona when he was shot by drug dealers.

Joanna always gets down to work and with the help of her staff finds the guilty parties.This new installment in this series is a book you will not want to put down. I read it in 24 hours!J. A. Jance has done her research. The plot, characters and setting are all well-written and very alive.I am glad to find this book only having Joanna Brady. I enjoyed the last book that paired her up with J. P. Beaumont (from the other series she writes), but I prefer them in separate books.I highly recommend this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Though she is pregnant and struggling with morning sickness, Arizona sheriff Joanna Brady feels she still can campaign for reelection. Though stuffing her face makes her vn more nauseous, she runs from one hot dog event to another as she seeks votes while constituents celebrate the Fourth of July holiday.However, her reelection bid goes on the backburner when Joanna learns that a homicide occurred. Someone shot and killed Carol Mossman in a mobile home amidst seventeen dead dogs that were victims of the cruel summer heat. Later ballistics proves the weapon used in the Mossman murder was also used in the killing of two females in New Mexico. Joanna begins to look into the life of the victim in her jurisdiction and she finds a link that ties Carol's father to the Brethren cult that is under investigation because of allegations made by the Lobo State victims.This is a strong entry in one of the better police procedural series on the market today. In many ways, the tale will remind the audience of Fargo, but with the added issue of running for office. The who-done-it is cleverly designed and Joanna is learning the hard way how difficult it is to work while throwing up. J.A. Jance further humanizes one of the better-fictionalized law enforcement officials in this top rate tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"This is another of them -- they keep you reading (I read this one in a couple of days) and you enjoy them while you're reading them. And yet...They are not all that memorable and sometimes I find her \\"detective\\" characters (Brady and Beaumont) indefinably irritating -- they're just too good to be true, just too competent, and not vulnerable enough. Quite frankly, them and their near-perfect lives are intimidating. I'll bet Joanna Brady's house is never a mess -- she's got the perfect husband staying home taking care of everything for her. I guess that's every working woman's dream...Aside from that...this is a well-constructed and well-written mystery. Although one reviewer said he/she knew all along who did it, I didn't, although in retrospect it all made sense, which makes for a good mystery in my opinion. The plot involves a woman murdered in her trailer -- for some reason she has 17 dogs in the trailer with her and they die of the heat before her body is discovered. With all those dogs, there's a subplot about animal welfare issues (although personally I think the word \\"hoarder\\" gets thrown around too much and the issue ought to be not the number of animals but whether they're adequately cared for). Another subplot involves polygamous communities in the Arizona area (where the Joanna Brady series is set). Then there are two other bodies that may connect to the woman in the trailer, and a coyote driving an SUV full of undocumented aliens trying to slip across the border -- all in all, there are a lot of subplots being juggled in this story, and the plot moves back and forth among all of these subplots.All in all, Jance is an excellent craftsman, and I like the Joanna Brady series, but there are days when I wish that Sheriff Brady was less intimidating. I can recommend this book as being at least equal to others in the series (and maybe better) for those already familiar with the Joanna Brady series."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment in the Joanna Brady mystery series. The story literally starts out with a bang when an eccentric loner, Carol Mossman, is murdered by someone who shoots her right through the locked door of her mobile home. Carol Mossman's murder is discovered by one of Joanna Brady's deputies, sent out to check on Ms. Mossman's 17 dogs which she is &quot;hoarding&quot;. Tragically, the dogs have been trapped in the un-air-conditioned mobile home and all are found dead from the heat, along with their mistress. The story develops rapidly from there.Along with solving the Mossman murder, Joanna is kept busy juggling many other personal and professional responsibilities. Shortly after the murder is discovered, Joanna realizes a happy surprise--she is pregnant! Joanna is also swamped with campaign obligations in her quest for re-election as sheriff of Cochise County. Then another incident happens in Cochise County where a car loaded with 20 illegal immigrants overturns and many are killed in the accident. And did I mention that all this happens over the Fourth of July holiday weekend? Ms. Jance continues to develop all the characters introduced in the series so far. However, even if you are new to this series, you should have no trouble picking up the story and the characters.It seemed ironic to me that the general public of Cochise County cared more about the dogs who died in Carol Mossman's overheated trailer than the score of immigrants hurt or killed in a car accident. Not only was this novel a very enjoyable mystery, but the author's comments on &quot;hoarding&quot; and smuggling immigrants across the border illegally were good points.With all that is going on in Joanna Brady's life, the next story in this series is bound to be another great read!"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"This was my first book by this author. It was very well written and I plan to read more titles by J.J."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I have read every book by J.A. Jance. She is one of my favorite authors. This book is an excellent addition to her collection. I recommend any book she writes!"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I enjoyed the way in which Jance wove social issues (animal hoarding, immigrant smuggling, etc.) into an entertaining story. Joanna Brady is an interesting and likable protagonist but in this book she almost has a little too much on her plate. She's newly pregnant, has adopted two new pets into her home, her husband is starting to become despondent over his stalled career as an aspiring novelist, her older daughter is starting to compete in rodeo barrel racing, a woman is shot dead in her mobile home with her dogs trapped inside in 100+ degree heat, an SUV overloaded with illegal immigrants rolls over killing many....how much more can we pack in here?!I still enjoyed the book but just felt that this time Jance was trying too hard. Poor Joanna Brady is only human, not a superwoman, but Jance (and Brady!) seems determined to prove otherwise."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"This is yet another unusual J.A. Jance mystery. I can agree with other reviewers that the preaching about taking care of animals does run a bit thin. However, this is a great book. It is more adult than any earlier work, and some Mormons may object to the cult in this book. However, this book is so different than so many others and is a great mystery. I'd recommend this one to anyone over 16."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Sheriff Brady is faced with an interesting mystery involving three dead bodies connected by bullets from almost a century ago. This has the makings of a very good mystery, but the book moves at too slow of a pace. Meanwhile, our hero battles morning sickness as she and Butch are starting their own family (is this the beginning of the end of the series as we know it?). The side stories are not as good in this book as they are in most of the Brady books. Overall, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I am so enchanted by Joanna Brady as County Sheriff. The mysteries are very satisfying. I often was surprised by the endings in this series. I can't wait for more of Joanna."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"We have throughly enjoyed the entire \\"Joanna Brady\\" Series and this was no exception! Can't wait to read #13!!!"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I always read J.A. Jance's novels, both the J.P. Beaumont series, and the Joanna Brady series, of which \\"Exit Wounds\\" is the latest entry. The story and the plot usually make it worthwhile. \\"Exit Wounds\\" is interesting for the sake of the illegal immigrant and homeless pet/animal \\"collector\\" issues that it deals with.However, I remain amazed that such a popular author has such stilted dialogue. Example: Sheriff Brady is meeting with her right hand man, Chief Deputy Frank Montoya -- '\\"Ernie Carpenter will be at the autopsy later this morning,\\" Frank said. \\"Jaime Carbajal will start canvassing the neighborhood...&lt;snip>\\"' Now, Joanna and Frank both work daily with these two individuals in a relatively small department. Are we really to believe that Frank is going to use their last names? And that everyone is going to talk in full sentences, with no slang or even colorful metaphor? Emotion in characters is handled just as clumsily: 'Joanna nodded. \\"This whole thing offends me,\\" she said, her green eyes flashing in sudden outrage.' She nods, and then all of sudden her eyes flash? All she can say is that it \\"offends\\" her? I don't think so... a real person, actually offended, would twist a lip in disgust and say \\"it just grinds my goat\\" or some other colorful local expression (if they were running for office and trying not to swear, otherwise, they'd just say it {made them mad}).I do think that Sheriff Brady balances her compassion for the homeless pets and for the murdered and exploited humans in the story in a believable and reasonable way... it would be really hard to have to prioritize your outrage over crimes, but Jance's Brady handles it in a way that many \\"real\\" people would do well to emulate."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Sheriff Joanna Brady is back, along with her husband Butch, and all her familiar deputies and side characters. The problem with this book is that it leaves way too much up in the air to be answered/solved in the next book. Although the crimes are reprehensible, they are wrapped up rather neatly, with one bad guy getting killed, and another one giving a key confession, with very little work from the sheriff. It was interesting enough to keep me guessing until the end of the book. However, the ending was also wrapped up rather neatly. It's an okay book, but I think I like some of the other mysteries that came out this Summer a lot better."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"For all the hype, (NY Times Bestseller??!!!), I was absolutley floored by how bad this book was. The writing is so poor I had trouble concentrating on the plot, which was probably a good thing.How many times can each character say something \\"grimly\\"? Other repetitions with adjectives, verbs and adverbs (often in the same paragraph) drove me to distraction. Someone please buy Jance a Thesaurus.Conversations between characters were vacuous, and Joanna's thoughts in italics were just plain stupid. Did I mention the exclamation points? That's 12th grade stuff, folks. Who the heck was the editor on this book?The only mystery about this book was why I read the whole thing. Guess I wanted to see how truly bad it was, and I was not disappointed.If you want good tight writing and twisting plots, try Karin Slaughter's books."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I did not make it past page 168. Only 25% of the book related to the primary story line, the remainder was morning sickness, her dogs, other people's dogs, dog names, dog food, her Mr. Mom husband, her resentments against mother, husband (cooking) town people, mother, brother, mother, co-workers, mother, morning sickness, what foods nauseate her, what she can eat, how the smell of coffee sickens her, etc. If I wanted this kind of personal turmoil and drama I would have my mother spend a month at my house. I simply could not manage to get through this 75% put my story on Oprah and have Dr. Phil analyze me part of the book. Fortunately I keep my recycle bin close at hand. Excellent alternative for sleeping pills."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"It took me over 2 months to slog through this muck. Character and plot development is so jerky that by the time Jance returns to a thread you no longer care. The last two chapters get better but it's not worth the wait."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller. Goes to show you some people have really bad taste. The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog. It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc. I would NEVER purchase another book by this author. Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can... Charlie"},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"The premise of this book is interesting, but falls flat. The lead character is a female sheriff who is up for re- election. Her character needed to be developed more as did the rest of the characters. The plot was boring at times, predictable and repetitious. The audio CD performance left much to be desired. The narrator's range was limited. Overall, I would not waste your time with this book, especially on CD."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Yep...Joanna Brady is pregnant...and running for reelection. The unspooling of her life continues to be really interesting and forms the backdrop to the mayhem and murder that plagues the Cochise County. One of the themes running through Exit Wounds involves animal hoarding and we learn what is oftentimes sadly behind the misguided efforts of such people to accumulate more animals than they can support. The author deftly weaves the story of Carol Mossman, the hoarder trying to care for eighteen dogs, with that of her grandmother who resides at an assisted living facility, and, eventually, the many other members of her family. Before long, Joanna is faced with three murders, including that of the dog hoarder, that appear to be connected to one another, the other two occurring in neighboring Hidalgo County, New Mexico. When Carol Mossman's father shows up from down Mexico way, the story becomes really convoluted, in a horrifying way. I think readers will find their fortitudes tested in ways unlike with other Jance Brady novels, but the story is compelling. As usual, Brady has trouble juggling family life and her sheriffing duties, but she does find a way to add a couple of new members to the menagerie at High Lonesome Ranch, now that Sadie is gone. For his part, Butch, Joanna's Grade A husband, might have some good news that will please readers. Exit Wounds is a powerful entry in the Joanna Brady series, which continues to provide good reason to follow the work of J. A. Jance. Although folks are always ending up dead, it is really the relationships that Joanna enjoys (in the broad sense of this word) with her family, friends, and enemies in Bisbee that keeps me moving on through this series of novels. I heartily recommend them for readers who like stories with strong characterizations, multiple intersecting plot lines, and unpredictable denouements. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Jance hits a home run with this exciting mystery revolving around the shooting death of a dog hoarder. Once again the strong points include the character growth of the series regulars. The only downside is the absence in this book of Angie Hacker, the prosititue-turned-bar owner."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"The prologue contains most of the action, the body of the book goes into more detail from a different viewpoint. Why the killing is the question and the deaths of the woman's dogs is of no consequence to that action. But the dogs play a role in the family life of Sheriff Joanna Brady; she acquires two dogs of her own to replace the family pet who died of complications of age.In getting the new dogs we are introduced to the concept of dog sign language and to the deep seated fear that can be introduced by harsh treatment of man's greatest friend. The killing of the woman to prevent her telling a sad tale of child marriage, incest, and patriarchal rule to some free lance TV reporters is well reported by Jance; as far as I am concerned it held my interest throughout the book. Jance did her customary job of writing well, and of having a well plotted story. The big problem is in continuity; it is almost a given that one book leads to another, back story is minimal but is this a trick to force the reader to get previous novels to find the characteristics of so many of the characters in each book? Fortunately I have every book on Sheriff Brady/Dixon and enjoy them all; I hope all others are so fortunate."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment, Dead Wrong. I love the Joanna Brady series and will not miss one. Jance has got a real winner here. I like this series far more that the J.P. Beaumont series. Also, there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one. Jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series. Great characterizations and storyline."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Have always loved the J.P.Beaumont series, but never tried the Joanna Brady novels. This was my first and I enjoyed it. I will have to go back and start from the begining however to catch up on all the different characters. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Sheriff Joanna Brady investigates the murder of a woman found in her trailer with her seventeen dead dogs.Another murder occurs on the same day involving the same gun and suddenly the investigation gets a lot more complicated than just the question of who would want to kill a down-on-her- luck animal lover. In the course of her investigation we learn about \\"hoarding\\", a compulsion to take in stray dogs and cats in order to \\"save\\" them usually brought on by childhood abuse. In addition to this crime, Joanna must deal with her re-election and the dirty dealings of her running mate, another crime involving a illegal immigrants, her pregnancy, and her on-going strained relationship with her mother. There is a lot of Joanna's plate, but she handles it with fortitudeJ.A. Jance's books are always rich in characterization. Joanna has been a long journey since the beginning of the series and each of the characters continues to grow. Each book is a stand-alone novel and Jance takes quite a bit of time in the beginning of the novel explaining earlier events. This part of the book dragged a bit for me. After the first 100 pages the pace picked up considerably. Jance can always be counted on the write a compelling story."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Joanna Brady wears a lot of hats, mainly sheriff, wife, and mother. This book illustrates the delicate balancing act she performs, but it seems that her worklife takes precedence over her homelife. She spends very little time at home because she's trying to solve the murder of Carol Mossman, a hoarder of animals whose 17 dogs die with her. Joanna becomes embroiled with Mossman's family and delves into its ugly secrets in order to solve the murder. Along with this, Joanna is faced with a large number of undocumented aliens who have come across the border from Mexico and who have been killed or injured in a bad car accident. There are political implications in this book, too, because Joanna is running for sheriff and each one of her actions seems to bring forth a new protest group. She could never pull all of this off without the help of Butch, her selfless stay-at-home husband who takes care of hearth, home, and Joanna's daughter while she is performing her duties as sheriff. There are some developments on the homefront plus the election which are not settled in this book and are a perfect lead-in for the next book in this dependable series."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"Exit Wounds, by J.A. Jance, is my second Joanna Brady mystery. This review is based on the audio version. The reader, Debra Monk, was a little annoying. Everything she said was pretty monotone.This story started off really well, and caught my interest immediately. Carol Mossman, a loner, is found shot to death in her mobile home. Carol's seventeen dogs, were trapped inside her mobile home, and all except a puppy are found dead from the Arizona heat.What follows after this was several subplots: Joanna's unexpected pregnancy, every minute detail about her home life and her job, and another subplot about illegal immigrants. None of these subplots were needed, in my opinion, as I felt it just made the plot drag, until we find out what really happened to Carol Mossman.This was my second Joanna Brady, Jance novel in the past month, and at least for now, I plan to pass on this author."},{"Title":"Exit Wounds: A Novel of Suspense","review":"I was able to maintain a high level of interest in this story of a female sheriff investigating the murder of a indigent woman with multiple pets in rural Arizona. While not an \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller, this book presents what I would compare to a good detective TV series. Joanna Brady is an interesting character who you will like to get to know (or continue to know if you follow the series). In addition to the main plot, you get to follow Joanna's day to day challenges with her family and other police duties. The main plot does keep you wondering as any classic whodunnit would, with some, unfortunately predictable twists. Some may get annoyed with the authors more than subtle message about animal cruelty. The 1 star harsh reviews noted here are not a fair representation of the quality of the book.

I have been scouring bookstores for it for over a year. I used Cartwright's book extensively while I was working on an undergraduate thesis project on Isabella d'Este's patronage. The main pitfall of the book-which is by far the most complete &quot;portrait&quot; of Isabella d'Este-is Cartwright's own sentimentality. She creates a true Edwardian heroine of the Renaissance, however, she provides enough epistilary evidence to allow the reader to interpret for herself what Isabella was like. I have read a few books on Isabella, and each of them use the Marchesa for their own purposes. Isabella's unique position as a patron of the arts makes her a frequent target of lavish praise and damnation. In Cartwright's book, the reader is allowed to see a more complete picture of Isabella, although much work still needs to be done on the Marchesa in order to really understand her and her milieu."},{"Title":"Isabella d'Este, marchioness of Mantua, 1474-1539: A study of the Renaissance","review":"received the book (Isabella D'Este, Marchioness of Mantua, 1474-1539: A Study of the Renaissance.)It is in great shape and I do enjoy the swift time you took to send this order.

It came highly recommended by two very respected (well published, board certified, etc)professors I worked under as part of my clincal internship. My primary duites are not as a forensic psychologist; however, I have found in the couse of my work for an Outpatient Community Mental Health center that one can never really avoid forensic / competency issues and related evaluations. I have referred to this text often in the year since I purchased it; this book has proved invaluable. Forensic issues are increasingly prevalent in todays clinical practice; even if you are not primarily interested in forensic psychology, chances are you have or will be asked to assess competency at some point; while clinically oriented professors often offer some guidance on this matter, they often lack the epxerience / expertise to thoroughly train their students on the legal aspects of such determinations. This book provides the most relevant and accurate needed to ensure prudent and high quality. My only regret is that I did not purchase this book sooner.Rob Metzger, Psy.D."},{"Title":"Evaluating Competencies: Forensic Assessments and Instruments","review":"continues to integrate and expand upon what is currently at issue in the new field of forensic psychology. next time I teach forensic psych on the undergraduate level, will use much of this text"},{"Title":"Evaluating Competencies: Forensic Assessments and Instruments","review":"&quot;The first edition of this book was a classic, widely cited both for its analysis of forensic assessment instruments and for Grisso's integrative theory of forensic evaluation.

My opinion of it has not changed in the last (could it be true) almost half a century. In &quot;Long Season&quot; Mr. Brosnan gives us what seems to be a very believable and accurate account of what major league baseball was like in the almost now forgotten days of the mid twentieth century. As a pitcher for the St Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds, Mr. Brosnan (I cant bring myself to call him Jim) gives what is a humorous and thoughtful insight what it is like to be a non-marquee player on teams that were quite frankly, less than steller. The Book, which is written in diary form, is an easy read. It flows from start to finish in a very readable manner. Mr. Brosnan has the talent to make everyone of his teamates and coaches come alive. As the reader, you feel that you are sitting in a bar, sipping on an adult beverage and listening to the author tell you of his everyday life in a now forgotten world of professional sports.I guarantee you will become a fan of bullpen pitchers and oversized, bespeckled and hard-throwing righthanders within the first 10 pages.My recomendation, is for you to grab this book and its sequal Pennant Race&quot; before any other basebll books that are available anywhere. You wont be sorry, and once you have read it, you will be sucked into the history of baseball totally."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"This insightful diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan recounts his struggles on the mound for the 1959 St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. Jocks weren't supposed to write books, but this college-educated ballplayer (uncommon in the 1950's) wrote a very good one. Brosnan's mild irreverence annoyed the game's overseers in an era when ballplayers earned modest paychecks and rarely popped off. Older fans may enjoy reading about long-forgotten ballplayers playing in now-demolished ballparks like Forbes Field and Sportsmen's Park. Brosnan followed this book with &quot;Pennant Race,&quot; a diary from the 1961 season. Some alledge that the Chicago White Sox tried to insert a clause in Brosnan's contract banning him from publishing anything, while others say he was blackballed from the game after 1963 for his writings. Readers may also enjoy &quot;Ball Four,&quot; pitcher Jim Bouton's funny and more combative diary of the 1969 season."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which is a milder, tamer, less controversial book written 10 years before Jim Bouton's Ball Four. Both books are written by good, but not great relief pitchers named Jim. Both are written in diary form while the pitchers toil for less than stellar teams. Funny, and at times irreverent, Brosnan's book is worth the time to read! Teaser: I love the nickname Brosnan's wife gave him. :-)"},{"Title":"The long season","review":"While Brosnan ruffled some feathers with this book, it isn't anywhere near as controversial or raunchy as Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four.\\" Brosnan does mention his difficult contract negotiation, but it's not as bitter as Bouton discussing contracts. Brosnan has an elephant-like memory for conversations and the batting history of every hitter he faces. You get to see every aspect of a game, from the pitchers discussing how to pitch to a batter to who's got the best pitch to the manager's pep talks before the game. Brosnan has an excellent grasp of the language and even perplexes some of his not as scholarly teammates with some of his words. Overall, a great read from a talented pitcher and author. I look forward to reading \\"Pennant Race.\\""},{"Title":"The long season","review":"I read this and Brosnan's Pennant Race as a kid - a must for anybody growing up as a baseball fan in the late 50's, early 60's - the era of Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, etc. - a daily journal of Brosnan's career as a reliever for the Cubs, Cards, and Reds all in one long season - 1959."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"Although \\"The Long Season\\" predates \\"Ball Four\\" by ten years, it's been all but forgotten by baseball fans in general. And that's too bad.When Jim Brosnan wrote \\"The Long Season,\\" he was 29 years old and approaching the midway point of a respectable major league pitching career. Brosnan was entering his first full season with the St. Louis Cardinals when he wrote his diary of the 1959 season, but was traded to the Cincinnati Reds during the year.Lots of people compare \\"The Long Season\\" with \\"Ball Four,\\" which is unfair to both because you're comparing apples to oranges. Although \\"Ball Four\\" is in general a funnier book than \\"The Long Season\\" (and more profane by far...there is little swearing and no sexual escapades in \\"The Long Season,\\" making it safe for your 10-year-old nephew Billy to read), I think Broz's book is a little bit more literate and urbane...and please don't take that as a knock on Bouton. This is not as breezy a read as anything Bouton has written, but it's worth digging a little deeper to see what's going on. The humor is a little more subtle, too. Where Bouton might have simply made some wise comment about Frank Crosetti giving a convoluted speech about sign language from the third-base coach's box, Brosnan writes what Johnny Keane actually said and lets it stand without comment. The same point is made, but with a different methodology.I give this one four stars because (as one reviewer notes) it CAN drag a little in places, but \\"The Long Season\\" isn't that far behind \\"Ball Four\\" as the best baseball diary ever written...and it's better than diaries also written by Sparky Lyle, Bill Freehan and others. A very good book, but not necessarily something that will appeal to a peripheral baseball fan. If you are really into the game, however, go ahead and buy this one. You won't be disappointed.Then buy Brosnan's \\"Pennant Race,\\" his book about the 1961 Cincinnati Reds."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"The Long Season by Jim Brosnan was the first of the baseball insider's diary type of books that was actually written by major league relief pitcher Jim Brosnan.This diary of his 1959 National League season was not whispered into a tape recorder, it was actually written, pen to paper during the 1959 season by up and coming relief pitcher Jim Brosnan.The Long Season details the failures and triumphs of pitching relief in the Major Leagues by a young man who seems to be on the verge of becoming a bullpen star if he could just gain control of what he throws and, at the same time, have his manager and coaches believe that he is able do the job.It also details the lives and careers of his bullpen cohorts, some of whom are banished to the minor leagues and replaced with other pitchers starving for a taste of life at the major league level.Brosnan's diary also reveals his relationship with the media people, both writers and announcers, who's job it is to bring the game to \\"all those wonderful fans.\\" For those of us who have been around for a while, it is a little jarring to hear one broadcaster usually referred to as \\"beloved\\" described here as \\"old tomato face,\\" but that's the business of professional sports or the business of anything else, I guess.The Long Season was published in 1960 and although Brosnan never reallyslammed anyone it was a controversial book for its time. Brosnan took a fair amount of heat on and off the field for the book but it remains as the standard for sports diarys so far as I am concerned.I think, however, the best part of The Long Season is the section when Jim Brosnan, up and coming relief pitcher, is traded from a young team, thought to be on he rise, to a team with established stars, trying to stay in the pennant race one more season.A startling development to our hero and his young family and an upsetting personal experience to say the least. I think that Brosnan demonstrates vividly that while a trade like this is routine to most fans, it can be a shattering experience to the actual players and the families involved.As I have said, The Long Season is a groundbreaking book and still is an entertaining read to anyone who likes baseball. In the history of the game, this 50-year old diary has proven to be an invaluable, entertaing record of the way it was."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"As much as I enjoy Ball Four, I enjoy this book more. Not because it was written by a baseball player ten years before Ball Four was written by another baseball player, but because this book is less constructed and more real. The author was keeping a diary of one season in his life in baseball: this book is that diary. In that sense, it's less constructed and more real: there is no aiming at a conclusion, no flashbacks (unless they happen to be in the diary), no dramatic chapter endings. Not that I object to any of the previous constructions, just that, in this case, their absence helps highlight the real experience of a season in baseball. This book reads easily, fluidly. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"wonderful baseball expose of the era. fascinating, riveting and, best of all - true! not some Bernard Malamud fictional account, this author was a major league pitcher for 9 season.

I've read it probably twenty times. Brosnan brought to life the players who were just pictures on baseball cards. The book reads as a breezy, humorous, conversational diary written from the inside of baseball. Where else would you go for a contemporary account of how one pitched to Mays or Aaron? Want to know what kind of teammate Stan The Man was? Or how cold and windy it was playing at Candlestick Park? That and much, much more is in this page-by-page gem alongside the other players, umps, the managers, wives and fans of late-50's baseball."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"\\"Twist, belly-button, block.\\" A major league relief pitcher taught me how to hit a baseball.

I didn't think that the book was quite as good as its reputation, however.It is easy to see why The Long Season made such a strong impression when it was published in 1960. Brosnan's account of the 1959 baseball season was one of the first books that didn't \\"sugarcoat\\" the professional athlete's life. Brosnan is very opinionated about baseball and the characters in the baseball world.I don't think that the book has aged that well, however. It doesn't have the irreverence or gossipy tone of books that followed, such as Ball Four. I found, therefore, that the book could be slow going in places. You do get an excellent view of the 1959-era baseball world, however.In summary, The Long Season is a good read for those who want to know more about baseball 50 years ago. If you aren't a hardcore fan, however, you probably will want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The long season","review":"Eh. I was expecting more frankly.

Despite being pregnant with twins, she heads off to the asteroids with 250 people and two small ships. On the way she encounters plague, blood-feuds, and other minor difficulties, but none of them can stop her.The history presented in this book was pretty obviously not going to happen even by the time it was first published in 1991, but the author felt she had to stick with the background in \\"Second Star\\". Since then both technology and history have diverged even more drastically from the story told in the book. The history referred to in the novel includes a contact with an extraterrestial civilisation, the \\"Librarians,\\" that the Soviet Union not only survived to 1992 without collapsing under its own contradictions but actually conquered Europe that year (pause for hysterical laughter) and that the world population reached 9.5 billion by the turn of the millenium. It also assumed vastly faster human expansion into space than we have actually seen.However, none of this really spoils the story, most of which is set in space, in the early days of the exploration of the solar system, and it's stilll entirely quite possible that when we, or our children, start building habitats in space and trying to mine the asteroids, the challenges and problems they face will be like the ones in this book.Not the greatest Sci-Fi ever written, but nevertheless an entertaining read."},{"Title":"A Handful of Stars","review":"I wanted to do a honest reveiw of her first book - This is the second - improves on the first - more to come .

Author Dana Stabenow included Terran history that was current then, but not now.But she tells a good story, and her literary references are astounding. From Carl Sagan to Shakespeare to tech specs from NASA, Dana seems to have read every book in the state of Alaska.Written first person from the viewpoint of Star Svendotter, director of a space habitat in progress, the plot revolves around the day to day problems and triumphs of such a huge undertaking. Throw in a military junta by a would-be tyrant, and it's even better. At the end there is a bit of deus ex machina as a mysterious alien spaceship arrives just at the heat of the conflict. That's obviously setting up a couple of sequels.Nope, it's not set in Alaska, though there are references. No murder mysteries, which is what Dana is famous for now. And heroine Star is downright heroic and determined. But it's a fine story, and figuring out the plentiful literary references is entertaining in itself.After searching our Clearwater Florida libraries, I went ahead and ordered the other two sequels from Amazon.

This is the second in the series, after 'Second Star.' It was a fun read, with Star now leading a prospecting/mining expedition to the asteroid belt, but it's also very dated (80's?). So, it's one of her early works, it's sci-fi, and it doesn't have Alaska or Kate Shugak.

Now almost two, she's had the book for a couple of months and still wants to read it over and over. She especially enjoys finding the hidden stretch in each picture (Hint: check the laundry for body parts sticking out). We have to read it before bed every night now, and sometimes before her nap.The flaps seem quite sturdy, and show no sign yet of pulling off. The art seems a little dated (retro forties?), and this adds extremely well to the charm of the story.If your child likes lift-a-flap books, this is a good one to add to your library. If you're not sure, this is a good one to try: dogs and hidden objects-what more could a child want?"},{"Title":"Where's Stretch: A Lift-the-Flap Book","review":"Children love lift-the-flap books. Children love dogs. Author Karen Pandell and Illustrator Jill McElmurry successfully combine the two in \\"Where's Stretch?\\" a charming book that young readers will adore.The family of Stretch, the dog, is getting ready for laundry day when they decide to give Stretch a bath. Of course, Stretch makes himself scarce and the search for Stretch begins. Is he in the closet? No. Is he in the bathtub? No. Where can that dog be? Your children will delight in the search for Stretch and will love the surprise at the end when Stretch's hiding place is revealed.The text is effectively presented as family dialogue, bringing the reader into the search for Stretch and eliminating a lot of unnecessary words that would detract from the story and make things harder for the beginning reader. The story was so compelling and easy to follow, my 2-and-a-half year old memorized the book after having it only half a day. A few months later, after the newness has worn off, it is still one of her favorite books.McElmurry's illustrations show the family searching for Stretch as they get ready for their day. The pictures, which fill the pages with scenes from Stretch's family's home, invite the reader in to participate in finding Stretch.I highly recommend \\"Where's Stretch?\\" Your children will want to read it again and again; so will you. You will enjoy seeing your children's delight with each lift of a flap and the story is short and sweet so it won't drive you crazy the 150th time you read it."},{"Title":"Where's Stretch: A Lift-the-Flap Book","review":"My son has had this for a couple years now.

Moves the battle between the Kurii and the Priest-Kings, via their earthly agents to the next level. Once more Tarl Cabot goes native, this time as Hakim of Tor into the swirling Tahari Desert to fight for the survival of Gor. With some help from an unexpected quarter Tarl once more saves the day...learns new and interesting weapons, befriends world leaders with his stunning blend of martial skills, thickheaded stubbornness, and winning personality.Beyond the excellent story line, we get another glimpse into the workings of Gor and what it means to be Gorean. After coming to grips with his newfound Goreaness Tarl Cabot goes on with his expounding of where it's at.Warning: Not everyone's cup of tea. If you are under the impression that gender is a societal thing...my suggestion...don't pick this book up...you'll be in for a shock.I wish you well"},{"Title":"Tribesmen of Gor","review":"In the previous volume (Marauders of Gor) Tarl Cabot romped with pseudo-Vikings. In this one it's pseudo-Bedouins. Samos of Port Kar, agent of Priest-Kings, receives three messages under mysterious circumstances...beware of the steel tower; beware of Abdul; and surrender Gor...and off goes T.C. to the burning sands of the Tahari Desert to investigate. Along the way he encounters assassins, slave girls, treachery, slave girls, an invisible monster, slave girls, a desert bandit, slave girls, an old friend/enemy who IS a slave girl...you get the idea. As in Hunters of Gor, the author takes time out to spend 2-3 pages expounding on his sexual theories. It's hard to take them seriously, especially since they are not consistent. For example, Norman says that true slave girls revel in their domination by men and would not have it any other way. But a girl who asks to be freed reveals herself to be a true slave. Hunh? The Gorean ethic didn't seem to bother me as much in this book as it did in previous volumes, probably because domination of women, slavery, and harsh punishment are an integral part of the culture this story is based upon. (Alternatively, the previous books may have inured me to it but I don't think so.) Some of the previous books (most notably Assassins of Gor and Hunters of Gor) have had scenes so outrageously over the top as to cause the reader to guffaw. There were none in this book that compare although Cabot's inhuman stamina, good luck, and fighting ability do stretch credulity a bit. There are a few other minor flaws (such as asking the reader to believe that a massive 20 foot monster could survive in an environment that is described as chronically food-poor) and one gaping hole in the plot: early in the book Tarl is framed for a crime and sentenced to a life of hard labor in the salt pits of Klima. However, there is tribal warfare brewing between the Kavars and the Aretai so the villain that framed him becomes afraid that the march to Klima will be attacked during the fighting allowing Cabot to escape. He decides to bust him out of prison then kill him as an escaping criminal. Needless to say, Tarl makes good his escape despite the bad guys. (Why the villain didn't just kill him while he was helplessly chained to the cell wall isn't clear.) Later on the same villain captures him and the same war is still brewing but this time he DOES send Cabot on the march to Klima. Hunh? Well, I didn't read this book to be edified and I didn't read it for a dose of reality. I read it to be entertained. Ultimately, what counts in a book like this is how much fun it is to read and on that score it was quite good. It makes me wish that their were more gradations in Amazon's rating scale. I reserves 1 star for a book that is either unreadable or that made me mad that I wasted my time reading it. 5 stars I reserve for books that are near perfect for their genre. (Nomads of Gor got 5 stars.) This book is better than Hunters of Gor (3 stars) but not quite as good as Raiders of Gor or Priest-Kings of Gor (4 stars). I'd like to give it three-and-a-half stars but can't. It's closer to 4 than to 3 stars, so I gave it 4."},{"Title":"Tribesmen of Gor","review":"Without a doubt this book is a thrilling masterpiece. One of the best of John Norman's series. I've read the book thrice and all I can say is--Wow! I can't stress enough how imaginative John Norman was in extending the scope and size of his world. Tor had been alluded to in books past, but the scope and size of the Tahari itself was never guessed at. Norman could have based several more adventures there if he had so chosen.Cabot's willpower to survive the march to Klima is astounding! I can only be in awe of the character's manhood. The determination he had to live is mindboggling. Even when offered the chance for a quick death by Ibn Saran, Tarl declines, determined to have his revenge on the perfidious Vella!

Norman never says anything once he can say three or four times; does he think being so repetitous makes the utterances more profound or does he just not have anything else to say and needs to take up space? I do not agree with the sexual philosophy but even if I did once a book is enough starting with this book you seem to get it once a chapter.When the bandit Hassan enters the palace dining romm on the back of his kaila end scatters gaurdsman with one sweep of his mighty sword and grabs the girl with one crack of the whip i just laugh.Books four, five and six are still good reads as far as I am concerned. The yellow pool of Turia is a truly unique adversary I did not figure out immediately and Harold and Kamchak of the Tuchuks are very funny. Book five is good for the action sequences, yes they are a little farfetched, and the plot twist where the hero realizes he is not fooling anyone but that they are fooling him. Book six I just liked the battles at sea, everything else was very pedestrian. Books eight and nine had overtones of Beowulf which i liked also."},{"Title":"Tribesmen of Gor","review":"Though this is one of the later books, where Tarl has become a true Gorean male, with all the unfortunate philosophy associated with it, I found this book brought the desert region to life with keen detail and clever protagonists.The desert men, based on perhaps 6th century Saudi Arabia were clever and subtle. The desert and it's dangers were brought especially to life. I don't think Tarl has gone through so much as in this book with the march to Klima and the trek across the desert with the Kur later. Simply amazing survival.The Kur's were brought to life well, and Tarl impresses his admiration of the intelligent brave beasts on us. It was interesting to see the Kur have various factions much like the Priest kings did in the third book.I even enjoyed the small haggling bit, where both Tarl and Suleiman haggle well, then Tarl gives up his advantage to give a lower price in thanks for the hospitality and then Suleiman offers an even higher price to demonstrate his generosity.As for side characters, Hassan (and Samos) were admirable as well as Ibn Saran and the unnamed good Kur. The females were less fortunate. The one free woman turned out to be nothing more than a puppet, and when she was allowed to demonstrate her skill with the scimitar it was of course against Tarl himself, perhaps the best swordsman on the entire planet. The rest were slaves that loved it as usual."},{"Title":"Tribesmen of Gor","review":"John Norman did again!

The book explores the lives of the working class poor in Manchester, England, during the 1840s, a period of strife and hunger. The pretty, young, naive Mary Barton persues a romance with handsome, dashing Harry Carson, son the mill owner, while spurning the attentions of her childhood friend, Jem Wilson, who loves her passionately. Mary's intentions, however, are less than noble; while certainly attracted to Harry, she wishes to improve the lot of herself and her father, John, who, disconsolate over the loss of his wife and only son and the attendant poverty after the loss of his job, has slipped into a daze of opium and seeks vengeance against the Carsons for putting him into this position. This eventually leads to tragedy and redemption. Gaskell writes as if her life depended on it; she describes the horrible conditions of the Manchester poor with searing vision, and makes the influence of radicalism completely understandable, even if she doesn't always agree with it. The delineation of character is quite remarkable; one's heart beats faster as Mary realises who it is she really loves and particularly when she is forced to protect, against incredible odds, both of the men that truly love her. Admittedly, the second half of the book, detailing the murder and subsequent trial, is quite melodramatic, but it's grippingly told. A magnificent work that should be required reading."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"Actually I read this book in three days' time (it can be even faster if I don't have to go to school). Anyway, Mrs. Gaskell's depiction of the working class people in Manchester during the 19th century was so vivid that you can just *see* and *feel* how the rich and the poor's lives were like back then by turning the pages. I believe no one who had read this book will not to some extent feel pity for the tragic hero, John Barton, in the story. But aside from this formal social theme being presented in the novel, there is also a very strong sense of religious/moral theme in it (espeically near the end of the story), as well as some drama and romance in it. Definitely worth a read, especially to those who are interested in Victorian Literature."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"Gaskell wrote one of the most vivid descriptions of the gap between rich and poor in this novel of the Manchester 'hungry forties'.The romantic plot centers around the murder of the son of a factory owner. While well written, the plot romance and mystery are almost cursory in comparison to the loving detail that Gaskell lavishes on Alice Wilson, the temptation of Esther, and all the little points of life in deep poverty. Gaskell is compassionate and clear-sighted in her writing, making this a very nice read.Mary Barton appeals to readers of all ages, and works at the level of both plot and social history. Recommended for fans of the period, historians, and general readers."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"This is a fine book, full of beautifully rendered characters. I love the painful and powerful picture Gaskell paints of life among the English working classes-- the struggles for physical and spiritual survival against horrific odds is rendered with compassion and depth.

The friendship between Mary and Margaret, the gentle, but rock solid faith of Alice, the passion of Jem, etc. This book is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"After watching the 2005 BBC TV-adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel \\"North and South\\", I was intrigued to go back and read the novel. I liked it so much, that I wanted to read more, and so found \\"Mary Barton\\". In both novels, I was impressed with Elizabeth Gaskell's keen insight into the human spirit - despair, doubt, kindness, love, compassion, hopelessness, loyalty, frivolity, and most of everything in between. She has a rare talent to create believable male and female characters (with their inherent differences in perception and interpretation) at all walks of life, and to inspire compassion and understanding for all her characters' actions. The plot is largely divided between mystery and romance, both of which are done well. This is definitely a book I would recommend to fellow Austen fans!Compared to the majority of modern novels, her writing has more of a leisurely pace to it and she takes the time to describe the emotional inner workings of her characters as much as she devotes to outward plot development. The frequent historical or literary references not immediately at a current-day reader's fingertips are explained well in this edition's notes at the end for those who want to know (like me).Historically, this book is a fascinating treatise of the working class toil, life, and death in the mid-1800s in Manchester, England, the rise of trade unions, and the trouble attendant therewith. Gaskell's astute observations about the living conditions of the poor in that day and age make for a compelling and thought-provoking read. It is hard to leave her books not feeling that the two opposite points of view of masters and men can be true, and that compassion might go a long way to bridge the gap."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"A tale of Manchester working life set in the 1830s, Mary Barton begins as bucolically as any gritty urban novel can. The Bartons, who are expecting an addition to the family, meet the Wilsons, who are carrying their infant twins, at Green Heys Fields. The charm of these low, flat, treeless tracts lies in their rural contrast to \\"the busy, bustling manufacturing town [he] left but half an hour ago.\\" The couples adjourn to the Barton home for tea, where Gaskell lovingly describes every modest luxury such working folk can manage--the bright green japanned tea tray with its scarlet lovers, the cupboard of crockery and glass of which Mrs. Barton is so proud, and the hodgepodge of furniture (\\"sure sign of good times among the mills\\"). In honor of their guests, the Bartons send young Mary out for fresh eggs (\\"one a-piece, that will be five pence\\"), milk, bread, and Cumberland ham.Thus Mary Barton commences with a self-conscious air of cautious prosperity, but underneath the pleasure of the occasion are hints of despair to come--Mrs. Barton's distress over the disappearance of her sister, and the Wilsons' \\"little, feeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.\\" In chapters I and II, Gaskell sets up the end of abundance and joy for the Bartons and the beginning of misery for their entire class in the mill city of Manchester.Mary Barton is a novel of contrasts. While the Bartons take homely pride in their furniture and wares, the Carsons live in a \\"good house . . . furnished with disregard to expense . . . [with] much taste shown, and many articles chosen for their beauty and elegance.\\" As Carson's former employee, Ben Davenport, lies dying in a filthy basement in the company of his wife and children, who are \\"too young to work, but not too young to be cold and hungry,\\" Carson's youngest daughter Amy tells her brother and father that she \\"can't live without flowers and scents\\" and that \\"life was not worth having without flowers.\\" They can't live without food and shelter, and she thinks she can't live without luxuries. Perhaps the most terrible contrast is between the \\"listless, sleepy\\" Carson sisters and the tragedy that interrupts their idle chatter.The contrast and conflict between the rich and the poor, the men and the masters, is not conventionally based on envy or even class; Carson was once no better and no richer than anyone else. The men don't aspire to wealth, at least for now. They want to feed their families and perhaps to enjoy the simple comforts the Bartons once shared with the Wilsons. What keeps masters and men apart is not class or money, but a more fundamental unwillingness to acknowledge the other's humanity. Mr. Carson can't be bothered to recall who Ben Davenport is, other than one of the many faceless men who worked for him for many years, or to give Wilson more than a useless outpatient order. Instead of approaching the masters, the men, who are powerless as individuals, join groups and send delegates like John Barton to London and Glasgow to try to gain government support for their cause. On their own, they fail.Neither side is willing to break the communication barrier. Ignoring one of their number who wisely notes, \\"I don't see how our interests can be separated,\\" the masters choose to hide the conundrum they face from the men, who are described as \\"cruel brutes . . . more like wild beasts than human beings.\\" Even as the omniscient narrator shows the just causes for both groups' anger toward one another and tries to avoid demonstrating a preference, she can't resist retorting parenthetically, \\"Well, who might have made them [the men] different?\\" It takes a murder and a near miscarriage of justice merely to open the door to redemption for the man in each side's leading role.Mary becomes the fulcrum of the characters and plot, connecting the Bartons to the Carsons, the unforgiving John to the repentant Esther, the worldly men and the more spiritually minded women. Through positive and negative models like Alice, Job, Margaret, Esther, Mrs. Wilson, and Sally, and through her true and patient if frustrated lover, Mary avoids Esther's fate and is transformed from a heedless young girl into a courageous woman who is able to withstand the pull of her divided loyalties.Confronted with the undeniable humanity of John Barton and the relentlessness of his unfamiliar poverty, Mr. Carson finally recognizes the need for change. As guardian of the old institutions, however, he struggles with his ambivalence toward taking action. Meanwhile, Mary Barton simply leaves the dead and the past behind to embrace an entirely different kind of future in a new country.Mary Barton lacks some of the psychological depth and nuances that make Gaskell's Wives and Daughters more interesting and engaging; here, the characters behave consistently and predictably. Despite the ease of its characterizations and assumptions, though, Mary Barton is a surprisingly stark, unvarnished look at the poorer, seamier side of urban industrial life. Gaskell accomplishes what the masters and men have failed to do--she recognizes the humanity in each of them and hints at its potential if only it is discovered and embraced.Copyright 2009 by Diane L.

I think I was scared off by the summary of the book which made it sound a bit depressing. But this is such a wonderful book! Gaskell writes with such apt descriptions as to make you really feel like you become part of that Manchester world. The chapter detailing the mill fire and rescue had me sitting on the edge of my seat. She manages to convey suspense in a way that's not overdone or cute-sy.I loved this Oxford edition that had an appendix. It really increased my understanding of the original meaning of words not common to us now. You get the sense that Gaskell picked every word with so much care, and with the intention of providing the deepest understanding. Knowing her personal history with regard to why she wrote this book (the death of her child) made the book more meaningful to me, too, because there is a lot of strife and suffering in this book amid the hope that Mary has.The characters are rich and unforgettable. Anyone that is a Gaskell or Austin fan should give Mary Barton a try.

Mary Barton and North and South have many similarities.

Instead, Mary is the daughter of a union striker, who places her sights on a wealthy mill owners son named Henry Carson. Mary has lived a life so full of privations that her one goal in life is never to suffer the poverty her mother had to endure.Like North and South, this novel is full of illness and death due to extreme poverty. It is written in the introduction that Gaskell wrote this novel shortly after losing a child. Her terrible lose echoes through the characters who lose child after child throughout the novel.Mary Barton was an ambitious first novel. The romantic triangle between Mary, Henry, and Jem Wilson was a little abrupt, but once her choice is made, her sentiments towards her beloved reminded me of John Thornton's love for Margaret Hale.

It being a novel, there is also a love story. Mary Barton, daughter of a soured mill-hand, attracts the attention of two men: Henry Carson, son of one of the mill owners, and Jem Wilson, a worker. She chooses Carson (a big mistake, of course). Later Carson is killed and Wilson is suspected of the crime with jealousy as his motive. But Mary learns that her father, John, is actually the murderer, and she spends a good portion of the second half of the book trying to prove Wilson's innocence (she now realizes her mistake in picking Carson over her true feelings of love for Wilson) without implicating her father. John Barton is wracked with guilt, however, and makes a deathbed confession to Carson's father that redeems him. It's an energetic book, and the story moves forward swiftly. The trial scenes are especially stirring. MARY BARTON was one of the first novels set exclusively among the working classes, and the book was highly regarded by the public and critics alike (though the Manchester mill owners protested against it)."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"This book is a true classic along with all the books of the early to mid-1800's.

I have to admit that I began to feel like every character in this book was going to die before it was over. But it was compelling. I ached for the people who had really lived such lives, for though I knew I was reading fiction, I also knew I was reading of life as it was for many in Gaskell's time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone struggling with depression or anxiety.

The number of harrowing deaths, though probably realistic, is artistically excessive. There are powerful descriptions of the squalor and poverty of mid-19th century working class families, as well as of the modest comfort of better-off workers, such as John Barton once was. The squalor of the town is occasionally contrasted with the idyllic countryside, as in the opening pages and in the memory of Alice. Scenes in the thronged harbour of Liverpool and in the factory where Jem works convey the dynamic power of the Industrial Revolution.The attitude of the classes is well contrasted. John Barton refuses to believe that in bad time the masters suffer, too. He believes in organization; in the end he accepts violence against the masters rather than against blacklegs. The masters on their side accept the laws of competition. While there are occasions of casual charity, in general they have no comprehension of the situation of the poor. They show contempt for the working class and ruthlessness when they feel challenged.But the only solution Mrs Gaskell offers is more understanding from the masters; more willingness to explain the economic reasons why they cannot increase wages, both in their own and, in the long run, in their men's interest; and a lot of Christian spirit which obliges the strong to help the weak. There is no glimmering of an idea that the State should be involved in this at all; and although John Barton is a Chartist, there is only one scant reference to what the Charter was about (i.e. to get working men into Parliament in the hope that Parliament - i.e. the State - could do something to help the poor. In fact the local delegation of \`Chartists' going up to London in 1839 are not, according to her, thinking of the six points of the Charter, but of laws against machines, for shorter hours, for permission to let under-age children work for their living [!], for free trade etc.)Mrs Gaskell herself accepts middle class ideas that the workers are generally improvident and that they are worked up by outside agitators. She does not understand why strikers should not act against blacklegs; she feels that combinations for striking are evil; she makes Job Legh complain about being forced to be a member of a union. John Barton is said not to be such a fool as to have Owenite ideas of equality.So, for all her undoubted sympathy for the lot of the workers, Mrs Gaskell is trapped in the well-meaning but condescending bourgeois thinking of her time. Of possible political solutions she has no idea."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"Two men love the Mary Barton- one she has known her entire life being from the same poor neighborhood as her while the other is from a wealthy family. What should she do?Mary Barton's life doesn't go according to plan and her life is changed forever! Set in the 1840's during the industrial upheaval in England, Glaskell takes the reader on a journey through love, loss, social restrictions, death, murder, and redemption. Great cast of characters that come together to create a well written and moving story- the beautiful Mary, faithful Margret, devoted Jem, simple Job, doting John, and meddling Esther, to name a few.As a fan of Austen as well as Glaskell's 'North and South' and 'Wives and Daughters', it did not disappoint- could not put it down!

In light of our current economic and political situation, national and global, I've been thinking a lot about class struggle and more importantly the issues of workers and business owners. So much of our hostility in the political arena is related to this issue particularly now since all groups are suffering.Gaskell addresses this issue beautifully and from the reader's viewpoint seems to be in favor of the workers with the objective of evoking sympathy towards them. In reality, her portrayal probably WAS the workers' viewpoint. It provided phenomenal insight into the mindset of the social group, specifically union factory workers within the human interest context of their daily lives and suffering with the added bonus of a bittersweet love story. It made me more aware and better able to understand the importance of sound economic practices and the government's responsibility towards keeping their largest population afloat."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"We live in a word where poverty is no longer something we see everyday. Many of us live cushy lives where we hear about people living on the streets, and don't think twice about them.

We are more and more seeing these times coming back to life here in America as well as many other places. Class distinctions are once again increasing. We live in a world where people describe real life events as being \\"just like the movies\\" when shouldn't it be the other way around?

Much of the book concentrates on life in a manufacturing town, however, the love story has a prominent place. The characters in this book are lovable and fallable, as usual in Gaskell's work, and overall very realistic. This novel is set up much like \\"North and South\\" yet not as well put together, and with quite different characters. There is the struggle between masters and men and a love affair unrequitted on the female end with family and friends dropping like flies on account of mental or physical anxiety. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes Gaskell, Dickens, and the time period of early industrialization in England.As to the edition, Everyman's Library always makes a nice hard copy. It includes a biography and timeline of work as well as the author's preface and an introduction by Jenny Uglow."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"Mary Barton is the first novel of Elizabeth Gaskell, a female writer who left her influence upon other English writers of the 19th century, like, for instance, Charles Dickens. The book is only an average view about Manchester life in the 19th century, focusing its attentions over the extreme poverty of the working class, the first labor conflicts in the pre-dawn of the Industrial Revolution, all this connected with a tender love story between the young Mary Barton and his old time friend Jem Wilson.In fact, the murder of the young mill owner, Mr. Henry Carson - he too an admirer of Miss Barton - is not well developed and is not the central point of the novel because the reader knows all the time who is the real murderer. So, it's not a surprise at all the ending of the trial and the revelation of the real murderer in the last chapters.Miss Gaskell has a simple and an almost n&auml;ive vision of the social problems that harassed the working class in England when the Industrial Revolution started. Even though, we must recognize that she made a good work trying to denounce the insensibility of the English government about the problems of the workers and their families and the inflexibility of the mill owners and other high economic classes to negociate with their subordinates.Mary Barton is a book that will hold the attencion of the readers, men or women, because Miss Gaskell has an elegant style and really knows how to tell a good story. Another great vintage of this novel are some great characters portrayed with flavour and undeniable charm, like the old and friendly Mr. Job Legh and the hard and anger John Barton, Mary's father."},{"Title":"Mary Barton (World's Classics)","review":"Very good condition.

There is no better example of this phenomenon then the example of the so-called Rise of the Novel. The Rise of the Novel led to the hey-day of the Novel as an autonomous art form, Richardson and De Foe, a printer and hack writer respectively, gave way to The Bronte Sisters, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens: Self-conscious stylists who were both aware of the novel as a form of art AND the tastes and needs of the mass market. This is a period that lasted until the \\"Modern\\" Literature revolution of 1922, a year in which T.S. Eliot published The Wasteland and James Joyce published Ulysses. The modernist revolution carried with it a rejection of the mass market and the accompanying idea of the autonomous, independent artist/creator typically in the guise of some kind of authenticity/purity requirement.I would argue that this beginning of audience-less art was a wrong turn. To give an example of how the rejection of mass market appeal began to pollute the form of the Novel, you can look at Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton. Mary Barton was published in 1848, but set in the 1830s, in Manchester during a national recession/depression. Mary Barton is at least partially written in dialect, and it concerns the murder of a Factory owner's son and the ensuing investigation. Mary Barton herself is a Manchester Dress Shop girl (not a factory girl) who is the shared object of attraction between the murdered and the accused.Mary Barton is kind of like the smash-hit book/movie The Help because Barton herself lived in Manchester and was part of the factory-owning social class in Manchester when this book was published. Awkward talk at parties, for sure. At the time it was published, Mary Barton was hailed for what critics call it's \\"realism\\" but that's probably because the vocabulary for expressing concerns over class disparity was in it's infancy- Marxism hadn't even \\"happened\\" when Mary Barton was published. Realistic depiction of the living conditions of the industrial working class was definitively a \\"trend\\" when Mary Barton was written, and the similar factual depictions of these conditions- in Government and reformers reports, had been available for ten years.But the introduction of the labor union stuff certainly diminishes the style of the Novel. Her third person Narrator hovers awkwardly over the proceedings, and the essential tie between the underlying economic conditions and the behavior of the characters seems forced. At the same time, there is sheer joy in the depictions themselves, as well as the dialect of the characters. One interesting point along this line is that the word \\"ask\\" is repeatedly written as \\"ax\\" a linguistic phenomenon that exists up until today.Already though in 1848 you can foresee the perilous rocks of social concern and grand artistic purpose beginning to creep into a previously joyous art form. Critics are beginning to fence off the territory of \\"realism\\" from sloppy description and social consciousness is beginning rear its style-wrecking head. At the end of the process, in about 1922, the novel will take it's leave from the concerns of the audience and depart on a journey into the heart of self-awareness, but in 1848 no one was there yet."},{"Title":"Fast Forward Leadership","review":"This is an excellent book.

Couldn't he have just gone to the colorful musical milkweed plant instead, with flowers around instead of fall trees? And one more nit-picky thing: if they were taking the caterpillar in Rocket to the tree, why is he not in the Rocket picture? My 3-year-old looked all over the pages for him--and was disappointed.

The story is about some strange kids helping a caterpillar get to the Musical tree of Many Colors via pickup truck and space ship. Huh? Then the caterpillar turns into a butterfly in the normal fashion. The kids learn about this transformation in a space ship. In an attempt to be educational, a Van Gogh painting appears for no apparent reason. It appears to have been written by a committee. \\"Hey, I know, we can have a bug and a truck!\\" \\"Yeah, and a space ship!\\" \\"How about some art? Who's a famous artist?\\" It makes no sense.If your child would be interested in learning about metamorphosis, you can find lots of good books that don't confuse the subject by requiring the caterpillar to need human (and alien) assistance to get to the right plant. Plus, the biology of this book is all wrong. The caterpillar shown grows on a milkweed plant in the spring, not a mushroom, as shown. Caterpillars don't eat dried yellow maple leaves as the kids feed the one in the story; they eat milkweed leaves. They don't need to move from the milkweed anywhere, and especially not to a maple tree in fall colors, and definitely not in the bed of a pickup truck driven by another caterpillar or by an alien ship manned by someone named Rocket. The butterfly is not a caterpillar in a brand-new outfit, as one of the characters asserts. The whole thing is just wrong.Personally, I think it's absurd to take what is a magical story and make it bizarre and unrealistic in an attempt to entertain kids so much that they don't notice they're learning. Why not just tap into the natural desire children have to learn? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"New Negro","review":"This anthology contains works by many of the most important contributers to the Harlem Renaissance.

There is ample evidence of a New Negro in the latest phases of social change and progress, but still more in the internal world of the Negro mind and spirit.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:(Alain Locke) \\"As with the Jew, persecution is making the Negro international.\\" (Pg. 14)(Jessie Fauset) \\"For years the Caucasian in America has persisted in dragging to the limelight merely one aspect of Negro characteristics, by which the whole race has been glimpsed, through which it has been judged.\\" (Pg. 161)(J.A. Rogers) \\"The Negroes who invented it called their songs the 'Blues,' and they weren't capable of satire of deception. Jazz was their explosive attempt to cast off the blues and be happy, carefree happy, even in the midst of sordidness and sorrow. And that is why it has been such a balm for modern ennui, and has become a safety valve for modern machine-ridden and convention-bound society. It is the revolt of the emotions against repression.\\" (Pg. 217)(Charles S. Johnson) \\"A new type of Negro is evolving---a city Negro.\\" (Pg. 285)(James Weldon Johnson) \\"To my mind, Harlem is more than a Negro community, it is a large scale laboratory experiment in the race problem.\\" (Pg. 310)(Kelly Miller) \\"It was said that the Negro could not be educated. The missionaries refuted the charge by educating him... Nowhere in all history has education so fully vindicated its claim as the process of unlocking and releasing the higher powers and faculties of human nature.\\" (Pg. 314)(Walter White) \\"The constant hammering of three hundred years of oppression has resulted in a race consciousness among the Negroes of the United States which is amazing to those who know how powerful it is.\\" (Pg. 366)"},{"Title":"New Negro","review":"My problem with this book is that it is wrongly titled by the reprint publisher (it was originally published in 1925) something that the current editor must have gone along with.

All sorts of sloppy readers are citing the book as The New Negro: Voices of the Harlem Renaissance (1925) when no such book exists. Second, the writer of the introduction criticizes the book for not covering a variety of aspects of the Harlem Renaissance when that was not the book's intent. It was \\"an interpretation!\\" It allows for other interpretations. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best interpretations because it covers more areas of literary and social interpretation of 1925 than any other.

I'm not a knitter of yarn, but of yarns. As a writer and teacher of women's writing retreats, I am enthralled with Fire's insights and use of language. As interesting as the book itself is Fire's story of its birth: how author Bryan Robinson approached her about writing it and how his agent helped the book on its way.

Stories from her past--of the old woman who taught her to knit, of friends who knit their way through sadness, of children and men who learned to knit. There are gleanings from other writers' stories about characters who knit, and of course, there is haiku. \\"Kitting with spirits/shedding again and again, what you think you know.\\" One haiku for each narrative on a separate page of its own with the image of yarn or knitting needles to purl the two together.In one of my favorite stories in this book, \\"Stitches that Danced,\\" Fire tells of the time she took her young boys to see the movie White Nights with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines.

Pierce, which provides a whistle-stop tour through nearly every concept important to the perception end of music psychology, touching on major findings in the physics of sound, time resolution of the ear, theories of consonance, pitch perception, Fourier analysis and spectra, the science of singing, speech, timbre, scales and tuning.Schroeder's Chapter 2 describes modern attempts to understand the mathematics of acoustical design. Weinberger's &quot;Music and the auditory system&quot; is an indispensable review of auditory system anatomy, functional organization of the auditory pathway, attention and learning. In Chapter 4, Rasch and Plomp explain that the perception of complex tones can be conceived as a pattern recognition process. Risset &amp; Wessel completely reorganized their chapter on timbre with new sections on global/non-linear synthesis, sampling, controlling musical prosody in Real Time Synthesis, and an expanded section on physical modeling. &quot;The perception of singing&quot; by Sundberg explains that the choice of acoustic characteristic of vowel sounds that singers learn to adopt represents deviations from typical, normal speech for specific requirements of performance and intelligibility.Chapter 7 by Burns comprises an essential treatment of psychophysical and perceptual studies relating to the human perception of pitch and pitch relations. The chapter has been completely reworked, and Burns employs smoothly pellucid prose, making it my favorite chapter of the book (tied with Dowling's). &quot;Absolute pitch&quot; (by Dixon Ward) is an updated, comprehensive overview of 100 years of research, summarizing key theories and a host of methodological traps in the study of this poorly understood ability.Chapter 9 by Deutsch surveys the literature on auditory scene analysis, stream segregation, and the attempts to find auditory correlates to the Gestalt principles of visual grouping. In Chapter 10, Deutsch discusses feature abstraction and its neural substrates, local vs. global processing, hierarchical encoding, memory for music, and a thorough review of the various auditory illusions and paradoxes that Deutsch has been studying for more than 20 years.The third entry new to this edition is Bharucha's &quot;Neural nets, temporal composites, and tonality.&quot; Neural nets have demonstrated (with varying degrees of success) learning of pitch class, chords, keys, and musical style, and provide &quot;a framework in which aspects of cognition can be understood as the result of the neural association of patterns&quot; (p. 413).In &quot;Hierarchical expectation and musical style,&quot; Narmour gives a cogent overview of his implication-realization model enhanced by his more recent ideas about the role in music listening of bottom-up and top-down processing, schemata, and &quot;filling in&quot; of missing (or implied) tonal elements. Eric Clarke's &quot;Rhythm and timing in music&quot; surveys research on rhythmic grouping, meter, perception and production of timing, and the relation between musical timing and movement. Gabrielsson's entry on &quot;Music performance&quot; reviews the literature on performance planning, sight-reading, improvisation, feedback, motor processes, measurements, physical, psychological, and social factors affecting performance, and performance evaluation. In &quot;Development of music perception and cognition&quot; Dowling concludes that there is a converging body of evidence suggesting that &quot;memory for music typically operates in terms of more precise representations of particular stimuli than has been generally thought,&quot; (p. 620) and with this makes an important link to current &quot;multi-trace theories&quot; of memory. Rosamond Shuter-Dyson's contribution on &quot;Musical ability&quot; has improved in organization with reworked sections on concepts, methods, and studies of musical aptitude, achievement, and ability, as well as investigations into correlations between music and other cognitive abilities. Perry and Marin's &quot;Neurological aspects of music perception and performance&quot; is the best single source of information on the topic including discussions of amusia, auditory agnosia and verbal deafness, and the current state of knowledge about functional localization of various component abilities in music perception, understanding, and production. Capping the volume is Edward Carterette and Roger Kendall's, &quot;Comparative music perception and cognition,&quot; which roves across the ethnomusicological landscape with a fairly in-depth treatment of pitch systems (including structural, perceptual, and tonality issues in Indian and other Asian musics).On the other hand ... The book does have its biases which trace their roots to the first edition, and chief among them is that it focuses almost exclusively on the cognitive psychology of music, a bias I can understand given that Deutsch is a cognitive psychologist. As it is, the book is so eminently coherent that it would be a mistake to change it or add to it; but it would have been more accurate to title it &quot;The Cognitive Psychology of Music,&quot; so as not to lure readers interested in topics not covered. In particular, there is minimal coverage of music therapy, personality and individual differences, learning, music education, musical imagery, musical savants, the social psychology of music, or the role of music in people's lives. And not covered at all are the following intrinsically interesting, and potentially important topics: musicogenic epilepsy (e.g., Critchley, 1977; seizures induced by music listening, often by listening to one's favorite song!); memory for music in naturalistic contexts, &aacute; la Wallace and Rubin (1988a; 1988b); the nature of talent (whether musical ability is learned or genetically transmitted, as was insightfully explored by Howe, Davidson &amp; Sloboda, 1998); chromesthesia and other synesthesias (Baron-Cohen &amp; Cytowic, 1989); and theories of musical emotion. After reading the entire book I am no closer to understanding why music moves us; why we like music; or why, as Stewart Hulse (1985) asked in his review of the first edition, yesterday's noise becomes today's musical favorite. I am not faulting the book for this - at 800 pages it is already long enough - I only point this out so that readers (and potential purchasers) will know what to expect. And to be fair, the answers to these last three questions are probably not known, but I would at least have liked to read about the struggle to deal with them. --Daniel J. Levitin, Asst. Professor, Dept. of Psychology McGill University"},{"Title":"The Railways of Palestine and Israel","review":"This book takes the reader through the historic development of railroads in Palestine and Israel from the first time the iron horses appeared in the Holy Land and until the early 1990's. The book is very well written in excellent English spiced with typical British humor, which make it a very enjoyable book. The book is very nicely illustrated and contains comprehensive rolling stock lists. The writer nicely catches the rational behind rail development in Palestine, and so he writes:\\"The railways of the Middle East, and of Palestine in particular, have ever been the pawns to the vagaries and caprices of politics, of international rivalry, and of war. Economics have almost always remained a very secondary consideration. With a foundation based on the ever shifting sands of political and military expediency it is really no wonder that the railways in this part of the world should present today such a neglected and haphazard aspect.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of railways in Palestine and Israel."},{"Title":"The Railways of Palestine and Israel","review":"The English know how to it - at least in railroad studies. They tend to have less glitz and more academic focus than USA counterparts. Cottrell is an excellent writer, and the material flows beautifully and in logical sequence. This topic is rarely treated in literature but has great historical significance. I acquired this volume at the same time as the Hebrew volume, purportedly on the same subject. I doubt that Cottrell was directly involved in its production, since he had already passed on. The Hebrew volume selectively includes some of the material in the earlier, English volume; but omits much of the important and unique information of the English predecessor. And adds a lot of the glitz that apparently impresses Israeli/Hebrew-reading railfans as much as it does USA railfans.I have only two quibbles with the item under review. It has little information on the \\"Hejaz Railway\\", and isolates its Israel-Palestine segment/branch from the rest of that significant railroad. The geopolitical significance of the whole railroad to Ottoman power, and its Palestinian branch to the subsequent development - social and political - of the Mandate, should be studied. Lastly, I would have like to see more information on the \\"military\\" lines the Turks built in the greater Gaza-Beersheba area in the WWI period. But at least it does expand on the very scanty information found elsewhere, and maps these lines.The major defect is in the maps. They are rather primitive, but for one interested in the subject, at least they are more comprehensive than any found elsewhere. The English volume is far superior to the Hebrew one, and although it doesn't deal as comprehensively with the recent development of Israel Railways, such information is not difficult to obtain (or view!).The producers of the volume didn't market it very well. I'd never seen mention of it elsewhere. I was delighted to find it listed in Amazon - wouldn't ya know?!!

As Author Sandidge wrote, \\"To David, what the Ten Commandments of Moses meant by 'Thou shalt not commit adultery' was basically, 'leave other men's wives alone, because if you don't their husbands will try to kill you, and it will start a feud with their husbands' clan, and if someone gets killed over the dispute there will be eternal bloodguilt, and then people will be trying to kill each other till the end of time, so for the sake of holding society together and having civil peace, make due with your own women'.\\"And so with a dry wit sharpened by the years between youth and middle age, and a great deal of research on those who peopled the Old Testament, the author sets out to explain the events that shaped King David's life from the persepctive of one who has battled some of the same middle age demons.It's not gospel, but it's certainly insightful and entertaining."},{"Title":"King David in the Valley of the Shadow of Middle Age: What Israel's Greatest King Knew About Survival and Faith","review":"Excellent book.

It is obviously well researched and brings out information I have not found in other sources."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"I'm starting to think that there is a certain clique of authors, to wit, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Swift, and Voltaire, who have developed a popular perception that tragically limits or constrains their legacy in the world of to-day. For Voltaire's part, when he is spoken of, it is generally in regard to &quot;Candide,&quot; certainly a great work, but not the be-all or end-all of his particular genius. &quot;Letters on England,&quot; a series of musings on his exile in England from 1726-1729, is a work which gives a much different perspective on Voltaire from the cynical, suspected atheist we've all come to know and love.The primary focal points of the &quot;Letters&quot; are comparsions of England and France in the realms of religion, politics, and the arts and sciences. While Voltaire clearly criticizes the French institutions of his day, he does not intend us to look at England as the ideal society. In religious matters, Voltaire derides the monolith of French Catholicism, acknowledging the relative harmlessness of English sectarianism - saying &quot;if there were only one relgion in England, there would be danger of despotism...but there are thirty, and they live in peace and happiness&quot;. Politically, Voltaire admires the progress England has made since the Magna Carta, even though it means limited enfranchisement, and division of legislative power. In the arts and sciences, Voltaire examines the ingenuity of philosophers like Bacon, Newton, and Locke, and the ability of authors like Shakespeare, Pope, Swift, Wycherley, and others, to make their reputations and livings largely independent of a feudal patronage system.Throughout the &quot;Letters,&quot; Voltaire privileges common sense, forward thinking, and right reasoning. As I understand it, the main purpose of satire is as a social corrective. Voltaire points out the flaws in both the French and English nations, not to be simply critical, but to encourage progress in thought, in science, and the institutions that govern civilized countries. Voltaire was no revolutionary, mind you, but it is obvious throughout the text that he cares deeply about France and its international relations. Voltaire looks so far ahead in his writing to anticipate our own current debates over health care (the availability of infant innoculation, and euthanasia), equal opportunity regardless of faith or race, and so on.For such a brief work, Voltaire covers a lot of intellectual ground in &quot;Letters on England&quot;. His style, enthusiasm, sense of wonder, and incisive commentary makes this a non-fiction counterpart to Montesquieu's fictional &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. While Voltaire himself dislikes and distrusts translations, I've always thought that if you can read a translation, react strongly to the material, and get the basic points, then the translation must be counted as successful. Leonard Tancock's translation in this Penguin Classic edition must be counted by me, at least, as successful. My admiration of Voltaire has been enhanced, and I feel just a little bit more enlightened. &quot;Letters on England&quot; is an excellent work in any language."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"Letters on England is enlightening on several levels and a very interesting description of the society politics and science of England in the mid 18th century from a French point of view. Voltaire being profoundly interested in all aspects of life and all types of knowledge provides an astounding account of sundry aspects of England from his patently Voltaire style. He makes the book interesting by including his take on some of the peculiarities of English life. Many of the letters are rather short and they need not be read in any particular sequence. The style is strait forward and they are relatively objective for Voltaire's work. I think these letters are indicative of Voltaire's style and provide a unique glimpse of many often overlooked aspects of English culture in the 18th century.He is particularly interested in the Quakers and devotes several of his letters entirely to their customs and beliefs. Yes these letters are certainly interesting. For anyone studying religious toleration (or intolerance) in England these letters may be of certain value.My favorite and possibly the most endearing letters is the one devoted to Francis Bacon. He alludes to the fact that Bacon was involved in an embezzlement scandal for which he was removed from office. Of course this is certainly true but he, as many others have, forgives him for this since he has provided so much for mankind. I feel that Voltaire saw much of the same in Bacon that he saw in himself. We must remember that Voltaire too was a fantastic speculator (investor) and many accused him of possibly crossing into the realm of less than legal activities.Voltaire's Letters on England are wonderful to read and after breezing through this book you will probably wish, as I have, that there were more to read. That being said I will note that I believe that had anyone else written these letters (except for maybe Montaigne) they would be in some academic library but not published widely. We can thank Voltaire for achieving the fame he did because having such immediate access to these letters is great for students historians and curious readers alike.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. Voltaire's (mostly complimentary) commentary on the English spans religion, government, philosophy, and science. It's always interesting to read a great thinker's take on other great thinkers. Most of Voltaire's subjects will be familiar to modern readers (e.g. Quakers, John Locke, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Shakespeare...) which makes the book easily readable by a contemporary audience.The humor is sharp and the observations are keen throughout. And it's free!Note that this version leaves out a letter on Pascal that is included in some other collections."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"Material receive in great condition. Very cost worthy and practical. Highly recommend future purchases for my continued education needs.

An excellent break from the novels that make up the majority of my reading materials."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"It's free so how can it really be. This isn't the type of material to be read while distracted or you'll find yourself going 'what did I read and what the hell did it all mean?'."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"LETTERING:Mr. Todd Klein is a seasond veteran in the field of comic book lettering and I've never seen a more concise, enagaging, and useful field guide on the subject of lettering in our industry. Along with the ABC's of computer lettering (pun intended), Mr. Klein pulls back the shroud of mystery on hand lettering; tools, tips and great advice. This is the most definitive text ever written on the subject, hands down.COLORING:As far as comic coloring is concerned, there are many places online to get the hard and fast techincal aspects of the trade, but the most important lessons Mark Chiarello gives the reader is color theory as it realtes to comics... How color evokes mood, how complimentary and muted tones can be used most effectively -- and perhaps the most important lesson in computer coloring: what NOT to do. The majority of examples in this section provide a sample of technique gone wrong as well as what to aim for. Another great lesson lost on most colorists is made a priority here: Let the art dictate the style of coloring.I wish I'd had this book when I first started out. It will be kept in easy reach in my studio from now on!Nate PiekosDirector, Blambot Comic Fonts & Lettering"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"Just to start off - if you are just beginning to learn how to do computer coloring, DO NOT buy this book. Not yet, at least. The DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics is not written for the novice, but seems largely aimed at those who have had at least some experience with coloring before. While I'm sure I'll get some use out of this book later on, right now it is simply sitting on my shelf, unused, next to my other computer coloring books.The DC Comics Guides are always interesting, but they never offer what is really needed - hands-on examples and tutorials. Computer coloring is difficult enough - especially in the early stages when you are trying to isolate your line art and get it ready for coloring in the first place (this can be a highly difficult and, indeed, frustrating process) and you need a book that will hold your hand through the process. The DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering is, unfortunately, not that book. While DC certainly means well, trying to publish useful books with their brand name to get a foothold in the \\"How to Draw\\" market, they haven't yet hit upon a successful formula in my opinion.Why isn't this book successful, you ask? First, the lack of \\"how tos\\". There is really not one part of this book that offers tutorials with step-by-step instructions and screen shots to help you out. This is a book on the theory of coloring - in other words, once you know what you're doing, it will teach you how to improve, create subtlety, select the right colors and effects, etc. It is a finesse book, for those who want to add that extra something to their work. For those of us who are still on the first level, learning what to do, this book is a ways ahead of us. This goes for the \\"lettering\\" portion of this book as well. Second, the unclear instructions. Their section on how to set up your files for coloring, for example, is so confusing that I had to go through the steps several times, over and over again, and I'm still not convinced I've gotten it right. If you're trying to teach a subject, you've got to be able to communicate more clearly than this.For those who want really good books on computer coloring, here are three that I recommend without reservation:1.Hi-Fi Color For Comics: Digital Techniques for Professional Results- An amazing resource with a excellent DVD-ROM full of exercises you can do along with the book.2.How To Color For Comics- While not as great as \\"Hi-Fi\\", this book is great at teaching understanding of more painterly techniques in comic book coloring and can help troubleshoot some issues. Also has a great DVD-ROM full of tutorials and exercises you can do along with the book. Though it's out of print, it's worth the trouble to get it.3.Digital Manga Workshop: An Artist's Guide to Creating Manga Illustrations on Your Computer- A great book on how to achieve cel-style coloring and other effects, especially if you are a manga enthusiast.If you want a great book on how to do comic book lettering, here is my suggestion:1.Comic Book Lettering: The Comicraft Way- This, quite literally, is the last word in comic book lettering, and is very inexpensive.Good luck with your artistic endeavors!"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"It's refreshing when a book as thorough as this comes out, AND it's written by industry professionals.The colouring section was very informative, giving both colour theory, balanced with practical steps and illustrations. I found the reviews on colouring fads such as using Photoshop filters/SFX to be informative.The thing that stands out from all other material I've read on colouring comics are the definitive procedures and clear explanations on things to do and to avoid.THE LETTERING SECTION was just as good. With good examples and explanations as to WHY and HOW things are done.If you're into comic colouring and/or lettering, this book must adorn your shelf; It is that helpful."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"Klein and Chairello have authored a well written and informative book on a craft of comics/ graphic story telling vastly ingnored UNTIL the advent of digital technology.BOTH sections COLORING & LETTERING will be the watermark for other authors to achieve.The COLORING section addresses the AESTHETIC side of the craft along with the MECHANICS behind it.I have other books on the craft of comics:1. Read this book FIRST, apply the concepts to your own work; THEN read OTHER books related to coloring/lettering.2. Look at NATURE to get color ideas, read magazines, bus ads and observe typeface designs.3. CREATE YOUR OWN FONTS!!!"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This isn't the first \\"DC Comics Guide\\" I've purchased. Prior to this, I also purchased \\"Writing\\" (meh) and \\"Inking\\" (FANTASTIC!). This book comes somewhere between the two.The first half of the book was great. The lessons on color were more helpful than the four years of color theory shoved down my throat at the university. The first part was solid and helpful for more than just comic art.The lettering sections were informative as well, but there wasn't as much thought and theory behind it as there was a \\"how-to\\" section on software and tools that most people don't have."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"You sometimes have to read outside of your field to understand central aspects that goes unsaid or unexplained. As a filmmaker, I've looked to other how-to comics and graphic novel books for help, but they didn't bridge any gap between the page and screen. Alas, in the first few pages, all the questions I've had of color theory and applying it are answered with accompanying illustrations. Right away you can see the dramatic effect of a color value in a black and white image. The last book that attempted to cover this that I read was Sight and Vision, and it kind of confused issues by being too academic. This is very direct.This book focuses on Photoshop and Illustrator, and explains the workflows for each. Again, very direct on the ideas behind WHY you do something, provides the HOW, leaving it to the reader to put in the time to get good through practice. The ilustrator portion will have you doing quick balloons in no time. Even if you don't know Illustrator or can't get through the manual.So if you're unsure of why you would color correct an image- get this book. If you're unsure of why you should even bother to worry about the colors of sets and costumes- get this book. Again, I've been aware of these issues and theories, but this one book just made me say \\"Hey! I got it! I understand the jargon finally!\\" And not only do I get it, I understand WHY an image works, and how to make it work for the emotion desired. For the cover price, that's a low fee for a personal triumph!Finally, this is a practical book. There are books on doing fantasy art and sci fi art, but this focuses on an extremely important art of coloring and lettering. Read this first!"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This is a great book.

Stan Lee's book is good if you don't already know how to draw."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"The section on coloring was nice actually; its pretty informative regarding the history of the industry, the professional terminology, and the aspects of coloring. The process of coloring that they run you through is interesting but a little vague on how its done. For my money its almost better to get the Hi Fi Coloring book by Image.The Lettering section is pretty informative, I still have to go back and read the last of it but it was written pretty well so far."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"I bought this book after buyingThe DC Comics Guide to Digitally Drawing Comics. I was looking for something with tutorials on actually making comics (the actual doing, not just the set up). I walk away from reading this book with mixed feelings. The color theory and principles of coloring was great, as was the entire section on lettering. But there was nothing on actually coloring in a step by step kind of way. If you're looking for a book on HOW to color, this is not your book. If you're looking for a book on what to keep in mind WHEN coloring, then this is your book. Also if you don't care about color and just want lettering than this is your book (the lettering has more in the way of tutorials).One thing I forgot to mention before, the book is edited a little weird. There is a picture on just about every page. On a number of pages the paragraphs are split between two pages. You wouldn't think that this is that big of a deal, but many times I finished reading a paragraph and then looked at the pictures to see what they were talking about, and then started reading again on the next page only to find that the next paragraph started on the page I just got done reading. Or I would have to turn a page to finish a paragraph and then turn it back to look at the examples. This isn't a deal breaker. It is just a distracting break in the flow of the book. Someone could have easily changed the sizes of the images to keep everything on one page, so it just seems kind of lazy."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This book is a great help to my comics work as well as my illustration and fine art work.

I was not disappointed but I still was not satiated.The book is very informative in showing you what not to do and the rules of coloring (the color theory, etc) but it really doesn't go step by step through the coloring process, which would have made me give the book a five star rating.Definitely worthy of a buy because it goes over many things that most artists have either forgotten or simply just don't know. :P"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"The introduction by legendary artist Jim Steranko (mould-breaking artist on \\"Nick Fury of SHIELD\\") says it all. \\" . . . the dynamics of colouring and lettering have been essentially ignored. Fortunately, this volume resolves that oversight.\\"As with the previous two books in this series, this is no simple \\"how to do it\\" guide, nor does it contain a series of exercises and a CD with inked artwork for the reader to practice on (as does the excellent \\"Hi-Fi Colour for Comics\\" by Brian and Kirsty Miller).What is does give however, is an imense amount of insight into the theory of colour in comics, particulary in the use of Photoshop and the difference between CMYK and RGB in relation to preparing coloured comics for print.As with the other two books in the series, this volume may appear \\"text heavy\\" (particularly to its audience of comic book artists who deal in pictures), but the effort in carefully reading the text pays off in spades in terms of serious insights into improving style and technique.Again, not an book for beginners, but an essential addition to any serious comic book artist's bookshelf - be they amateur or professional."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"Want to understand color theory?

This book is still good for learning about computer coloring principles."},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This book has proved valuable to me, both in my comic-book work and my teaching. I rate it just as highly as the other two excellent DC books on penciling and inking by Klaus Janson. This one is a marvel of economy, giving the reader a grounding in two fairly technical (and not widely appreciated) areas of comic-book production in the briefest form imaginable.Most of it is a how-to, but there is some spot-on coaching on matters esthetic and expressive.As for the how-to aspect, when I wanted to find out how, for example, to letter in Illustrator, Klein's section walked me through it, right down to making the balloon pointers pointed.Chiarello's well-illustrated section walks you briskly through the four or so main styles of coloring gives a bit of guidance as to why you might choose each, and tells you how to do them.(As a side note to colorists, I'm not sure Chiarello's method of backing up the blacks is necessary: I believe Photoshop does this automatically, to a degree that's determined by one's color settings.)"},{"Title":"DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics","review":"This is a great guide for those who would like to get into coloring or lettering comics, but have no idea where to start.

Dozens of full color examples are provided to show the contrast between good color jobs and bad color jobs. Also it provides info on how to create your own fonts for use in lettering. It also provides information on which tools would be useful for computer coloring and lettering. Most of this is done on computers these days, so the appropriate software is recommended. If you already have an idea of which tools you would like to use, it may be better to go ahead a get a guide on the specific software you are going to use if you would like more on the side of technique.

The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that.

Instead it focuses solely on explaining the negative impact of specific investor emotional traits on investment performance. It is written in an easy-to-understand, friendly, conversational style.Specifically, Fertig covers seven psychological factors that result in causing investors to perform poorly. These factors include: envy, pride, lust, greed, anger, gluttony and sloth. He covers these topics one at a time, and includes interesting personal stories and examples that clearly illustrate his key points.From my own investment experience spanning 49 years, I can attest to the critical importance of keeping your emotional behavior and psychological weaknesses in check, otherwise investment results suffer. Too many investors buy at the top and sell at the bottom, because they were never strong enough to overcome their weaknesses. Hopefully, by reading this enjoyable book and thinking about their own situations and need for discipline, and taking corrective ACTION, the reader will improve his/her investment performance.We live in an age of instant gratification, instant messaging, and an overabundance of stock market commentary from the TV talking heads and media outlets. All this extraneous information (not knowledge) negatively impacts investors thought processes. Investing is not a game and should be considered a place to have fun.

Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Death's Door: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve: A Cultural Study","review":"We humans are the only animals that know we are going to die. The only real questions are how and when. For Ms. Gilbert's husband, he went in for a relativly minor operation and never recovered.We use a lot of euphemisms to refer to death: a hit, a contract, passing away, crossing Jordan. And through the twentieth century we have seen a lot of death: World War I with its machine guns and poison gas, The Holocaust (In capitals, that means the jewish one in Germany, but there have been several from Turkey/Armenia, Cambodia, 'ethnic cleansing,' and the current Darfur situation.), Natural disasters from tsunamis, earthquakes, and of course 9/11.There's been a lot of literature about death, from the Bible through Shakespeare to numerous others (Amazon lists hundreds of titles). This particular book has two real strengths: First comes from Ms. Gilbert's mastery of the language and her analysis of her own feelings of grief. Then there is a carefully made selection of quotes from past literature.I don't know that this makes our own future any more clear, but it certainly helps in the understanding of our grief when a loved one dies."},{"Title":"Death's Door: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve: A Cultural Study","review":"Death's Door: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve: A Cultural Study by Sandra M. Gilbert is one of those remarkable books that leave me feeling inadequate to respond appropriately. Gilbert, known for her academic approach to common literary themes, was inspired to write about the elegy, how poets write through grief and mourn on the page. After some research and some disillusionment, she set the project aside. But life and loss have a way of infusing past inspiration with new life and Gilbert's own grief drove her to return to this project.The result is this remarkable book that works on a myriad of levels. With the death of a child and later of her husband, Gilbert infuses a traditionally academic text with a personal empathy that elevates this above and beyond a dry resource. Drawing not only on the works of poets and novelists, Gilbert alludes to artwork, photography, even experimental works from the AIDS quilt to internet memorials. Anyone familiar with Plath or Eliot, with Yeats, Keats, or Hardy will be comfortable with the sections that compare and contrast the way each writer approaches death and loss. I found myself setting the book down frequently, doing my own research and rediscovery as I contemplated not only what Gilbert shared but remembered poems and writers to which she makes no reference at all.In trying to approach the shifts in how we, as a society and individuals, grieve, Gilbert repeatedly confronts the impossibility of not only avoiding death but the inevitability of how change has affected not only the process of mourning but of death itself. Progress in medicine has moved death from being in the home to somewhere sterile and removed. \\"Progress\\" in warfare also has an impact as those who survived World War I are confronted with not merely the loss of a single family member but the death of a whole generation of young men. How long do you wear widow's weeds when you are mourning the death of a husband, a brother, a son, and more? The implication on faith is also addressed for how does one embrace a bodily resurrection when only parts of a loved one's body ever make it home?I find myself, even as I write this review, wanting to list the many points Gilbert makes about the spontaneous memorials-those clusters of flowers, stuffed animals, etc. that manifest on the side of the road where someone has died-to how art has evolved from showing the suffering of saints to exploring the agony of a parent dying from Alzheimer's on film. Rather than reinforce the idea that death is sacrosanct, Gilbert suggests that the modern and post-modern era has realized that there is nothing sacred about death and dying and that sterilizing death by removing it to hospices or hospitals leaves those who survive at a loss. With the process of death changing, mourning too becomes something that we no longer know how to express. From women ripping their hair and clothing in grief, from keening and wailing, we now offer antidepressants and the impossibility of closure.If nothing else, Gilbert offers the promise that death is not only inevitable but it is not something from which we ever fully recover. For this reader, knowing that some pain can never be left behind and bearing the burden of grief is the inevitable grace of living, is a profound comfort. Possibly because I fully believe that compassion, that feeling with someone that can only come from empathy, I can appreciate the despairing message of Gilbert's exploration and it is not surprising to know that she could not approach the subject of death and grief until she herself had been fully immersed in the experience of loss. While not an easy book to read, it is one I would encourage anyone who loves literature and art to read, especially if you are comfortable with questions and not seeking answers because, when it comes right down to it, for death there really are no answers-only the inevitably endlessly open door.PS: I recommended this book to my mother and she immediately ordered it. When she received her paperback copy, she called me up. \\"This book is heavy.\\" Yes. In many ways this is a heavy book, not an easy one to carry or to read. I can't even imagine how Sandra M Gilbert lived through the writing of this book without feeling some sadness and I can't thank her enough for her bravery in facing death day after day as she chose to do in writing this book.PPS: Another story about this book. When Rob went to the hospital, I stayed behind only long enough to get things organized at home, just in case. Just in case what, I could not say. After all, Rob had gone to the hospital before and been sent home after only a few hours. Still, I sent Marc to the store to get some things and I gathered myself and my things, including the inevitable pile of books that I simply must take with me everywhere I go. Death's Door was in that pile. It was not until I got in the car that I realized that this was not an appropriate book to carry with me to a hospital emergency room. It isn't like it is a small book, one that I could easily tuck away. But then I thought that if I chose to leave it behind then I would be showing some superstitious fear, denying death somehow. It was silly of me, of course, to sit there worrying about the worst that could happen and somehow connect it with my not bringing the book with me.Then the doctor explained that the CT scan did, indeed, show an enflamed appendix which would have to be removed. I held onto Gilbert's book, in which she shares her own experience of her husband's death due to complications stemming from a routine surgery, as if it were a shield. I didn't open it, couldn't dare read it, but I wouldn't leave it in my bag. At this point it became a sort of talisman, a refusal to believe that the worst could happen, that other husbands die due to complications but mine would not. Period.Of course, we all know how that story ends; Rob came through the surgery well enough. I did not, however, begin reading the book again until he started turning cranky, annoying everyone from the staff to me, his sleep deprived wife. (What the hell are hospitals thinking with those impossibly uncomfortable chairs that unfold into still more uncomfortable cots? Insane and torturous.)I think that once I really knew Rob was safe, I no longer had to just carry the book around but could return to reading it for the research I was doing. Superstition and irrational thinking aside, I wanted to share this part of my experience with this book as well."},{"Title":"Shades of Gray (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #32)","review":"Title: Shades of GraySela Barnes and her husband Rodney enjoyed a wonderful marriage, good relationships with their six children and a beautiful home. The only thorns in their side were Rodney's parents who refused to accept Sela as part of their family because Sela is African American and Rodney is White.The book opens with Sela and Rodney renewing their vows for theirtwentieth wedding anniversary at their new big, beautiful homesurrounded by family and friends. This would be their last milestone together as Rodney is soon diagnosed and succumbs to a condition called congestive cardiomyopathy, a disease that is hereditary.Knowing that her life will forever be changed due to the death of her husband did not stop Sela from trying to make peace with her in-laws because she promised Rodney she would. Sela was constantly having a battle of words, wits and wills with her in-laws until her oldest daughter and son sat down with Sela and their grandparents to voice their opinion about how they treated each other. Ultimately it was Sela's decision to return to the God of her youth and depend on His strength so that she was able to make it each day after the passing of her husband and to finally make amends and become a true family.I enjoyed this beautifully written novel by Jacquelin Thomas, but I still had questions when I was finished such as what was it really like to be an African American woman married to a White man in the South? The book takes you through the emotional struggles of dealing with grief from Sela's point of view, what her children did to cope and how she helped them, but it was not until the end of the book that I found out that it is not about race. It was about those gray areas in our lives that transcend the color line and is covered in a multitude of love.Reviewed by Sharel E. Gordon-LoveAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Shades of Gray (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #32)","review":"In Shades of Gray Ms. Thomas' portrayal of the challenges of the Barnes family brings the reader face to face with the magnitude of the power of unresolved issues.Throughout the pages you will come to know the love and trust Rodney Barnes has for and in God. The same reverence is seen in his children who range from five to twenty years in age. It is his wife Sela who worships from afar.After twenty years of marriage and six beautiful children the gap between Sela and her in-laws has only widened. When tragedy strikes it is the truth of Psalm 127:1 (Except the Lord build the house), that is put to the test. Beset by pressures seemingly unbearable Sela initially reacts out of her pain. Words of love and truth spoken by her children and those from the journal of her husband are tools used to chip away at the cell walls holding her hostage to the pains of her past and present.The story is not one unfamiliar to us whether it is a personal encounter or one experienced by those we know. It is the manner in which Shades of Gray is written that causes one to examine where they are at in personal relationships, (with God and others).I commend Ms. Thomas for gifting the reading world with a novel that speaks to the truth of what a godly family should be and our responsibility to stand firm and to fight to retain the legacy for future generations.Linda F. Beed, D.R.EdOn Assignment Reviews"},{"Title":"Shades of Gray (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #32)","review":"Jacquelin Thomas is a phenominal author. She has definitely crossed over to show that Love is not black or white, but shades of gray. She has written a riveting story of how we all have to make changes and that GOD is in control of our lives whether we think so or not. Sometimes we wait too long to see the error of our ways and through children, Adults can also learn.Proverbs 22:6 states to \\"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\\" Sela Barnes has and is raising some wonderful children and she should be very proud, from the youngest to the oldest, they know who GOD is and they are strong and more help then she actually can imagine. Her and Rodney have been married 20 years and you would think that by now her in-laws would be used to her, but see whenever you allow things to go on and you don't consult GOD years fly by and lost time is just that,you never know who you will need in your life. Rodney is the love of Sela's life and the apple of his mommas eye, but I think Rodney could and should have done more to decrease the gap between the family. Sela and Ethel have to deal with difficult situations and Sela realizes that once she has released the past and allow to GOD to work, he will use who and what he wants to bridge the gap and find a common ground for all involved. This story has some great moments, some sad moments and some angry moments, but it all has to come together, because you don't get to choose who is in your family and who you love. You also see where a lose can also bring about a gain. Rodney is a sweetheart though, planning so far ahead and he just prepared so much for his family, his love for Sela and the children was genuine. Ms Thomas can do a sequel with the children and also it is going to be time for Sela to move on - she is still young. Also Jay and Ayanna will have a story to tell I am sure and it is great that they are grounded and in the LORD! Excellent writing..."},{"Title":"Shades of Gray (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #32)","review":"I always shed a tear when I read Ms. Thomas' novels, and this one is no exception.

The moral and spiritual lessons are priceless close to exceptional but not quite still run out and buy this one it's a keeper. Shades of Gray could receive nothing less than a Silver rating."},{"Title":"Image Processing: Analysis and Machine Vision","review":"This book is OK as a rather non-mathematical introduction to image processing at an advanced undergraduate level.The &quot;analog&quot; approach to signal and image processing is not covered extensively. There is more emphasis on algorithmic aspects. Frequency analysis is kept to a minimum and one-dimensional signals such as speech are not covered extensively or at all, although some aspects of analog processing are more easily explained in a 1-D context.Maybe just as well from an image analysis/computer vision standpoint. Indeed, many other textbooks exist with more emphasis on base functions and transforms (but then they are utterly lacking in the algorithmic approach).More down to earth, though. I know that my students would be turned off by the US price of $115. Hardly appropriate for the less affluent student ! Especially since the UK Amazon price is 37. Same ISBN. Luckily, in Europe, we can order from the UK store."},{"Title":"Image Processing: Analysis and Machine Vision","review":"I really love this book as far as having many algorithms in the area of image analysis and computer vision spelled out in both mathematical terms and algorithmic steps. Just about every subsection of the book has the format of mathematical equations that perform a particular vision task followed by the algorithm in numbered steps and accompanied by very good figures. What is lacking is any explanation on what is going on as well as a \\"big picture\\" viewpoint - why would you want to perform this transform in the first place? For those of us who know the whys and just need the hows, this is a great book. For the novice and the student, I can just imagine this book would be incomprehensible as a textbook. This book is also recommended to students taking a college course in robotics. Most robotics texts give you plenty of narrative on subjects such as the kalman filter or particle filter, but fail to deliver the goods on how to do it. This book gets you there. The product description does not list the table of contents, so I do that next. Note that I am reviewing the third edition, published in 2007.1.

It's got an engaging plot, witty insights into the human condition, and - oh yeah - it's packed cover-to-cover with creatively hot sex scenes, several of which are essential to the plot.Clare creates fun, three-dimensional characters that are easy to identify with. Every character in the book is flawed, some more deeply than others, but it is in part their flaws that make them so engaging. Every character has acerbic commentary on life and each other, and their entertaining cynicism makes this a fun read.And the sex...\\"sizzling\\" is the best way to describe it. None of it feels out of place, and every scene is creative. Sometimes the characters are sweaty, sometimes they have morning breath, but the reality factor makes it even more hot."},{"Title":"Mixed Signals (Black Lace)","review":"Anna Clare, Mixed Signals (Black Lace, 2004)I actually got this one by accident for my birthday last year. I'd ordered a different Black Lace title, and the seller threw this one in instead. But, hey, it's Black Lace, I'll give it a shot, right? For those of you unfamiliar with this British imprint, Black Lace is, for lack of a better term, thinking person's erotica-- plenty of hot sex, but wrapped up in such niceties as character development, somewhat realistic plots, and the like. In other words, you'll still be embarrassed to be seen reading it on the train (though, in my opinion, the covers are tasteful-- certainly better than we got with those Beeline books), but at least you won't be embarrassed because you're reading a slapdash novel some unshowered guy in a wifebeater slapped out over a bored weekend.The ensemble cast in this one is headed by Adele, a young chef with a really messy breakup in her past that she's never quite gotten over. She gets hired on by Paul, who left his wife for Ieuan, a working-class lad who can never quite seem to put it together, and who spends much of the book trying to get his wife to serve him divorce papers. On the day of her interview, Adele catches the eye of Jude, one of the workers involved in the renovation of the restaurant. Cue affair. Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated storyline, washed-up pop singer Suki is trapped in a loveless marriage, and sees a way out in Karina, who shows up at a party her husband throws at their country house. Cue affair #2. (The two storylines do eventually converge, but we'd be deep into spoiler territory before I explained how.)The characters are well-drawn, not surprising for a Black Lace release, and the plot is solid, if it goes out on a limb now and again with the coincidence factor. (Okay, it loses credibility entirely a few times, but usually gets back on track.) And, of course, the sex is hot, and whatever your kink, it'll find a niche in here at least once. My only problem with the book, and the reason it only got the \\"mediocre\\" rating, is that the pacing moves at two speeds-- slow and stop-- until about halfway through the novel. Once there, it picks up like gangbusters, but you've got to make it through to that point.

So far so good."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"I was very impressed by Liz Greene's work and I will admit she was accurate about many things. But there were a few things that really bothered me.... For one I appreciated learning about all the negative traits about each sign but would have loved to hear more positive traits. Second I noticed when I got to Virgo after reading Taurus(which by the way is completely talked down on) Liz Greene talks very highly of this sign. More so than any of the other signs. I was curious so I researched Liz Greene's zodiac sign and oh what do you know.. She's a Virgo! Now finally what really upset me was when I got to Capricorn(my sign) I felt as if it was completely talked down on as Taurus was. For Virgo being so \\"misunderstood\\" she should understand that Capricorns are actually very misunderstood too. The only thing written about them was a spec of what they really are. Capricorns are seagoats (head of a goat, tail of a fish) and come from the sea onto land to climb the mountain of success. She only talked about the goat part of this sign and left out the sea part of it. The sea part is what's deep inside a capricorn that most don't get to see because we hide our emotions. Caps deep inside are passionate, emotional, intuitive and intelligent. Of course to truly understand you would have to go more into depth. I still have respect for and admire Liz Greene but these problems really got to me as I am extremely passionate about psychology and astrology and feel she was being completely biast."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"I will admit that this book is probably one of the better-written astrological texts that I have come across, but I can't help but notice that the author, while trying to avoid stereotypes and the typical astrological myths, still seems to get caught up in quite a few. I think that the two most misrepresented signs are Virgo and Scorpio, and I was pleased to know that I am not the only one who feels that way, as the author herself professed that she feels the same way. While doing a fantastic job of representing Virgos for who they actually are, instead of the neat-freak, obsessive-compulsive image that is amusingly used to represent them most of the time, I feel that the author completely missed her mark while trying to describe Scorpio, the other most misrepresented sign of the Zodiac. When are people going to stop portraying Scorpios as these enigmatic, strong-willed, yet emotional mysteries? All my life, I have been surrounded by Scorpios, and even after evaluating each of the ones that I am closest to individually, and with an open mind, I still don't see them as these 'penetrating, all-knowing, all-feeling, mysterious creatures.' This image is so ridiculous. I have no shame in writing that Scorpios are by far the absolute most selfish of the signs, even though they abhor this trait in others. Every single Scorp I know is self-pitying, and in a lot of ways, incredibly weak. Look, we'd all love to believe that there is one magical sign that seems so seething and unbearably erotic and exotic and just plain unique in comparison to the others, but honestly, is this the way that you REALLY perceive the Scorpios in your life? I used to believe this image until I gave it some serious thought, and I now accept Scorpios for being pretty basic, with human faults, not these \\"fantasy\\" faults that astrologers try to mythologize. Secondly, I wonder why the author uses Sigmund Freud as an example of how simplistic the sign of Taurus is, yet when the tables are reversed, and the author is writing about what an interesting, perplexing, mystical sign that Scorpio is, she mentions the fact that Freud has Scorpio rising. Why, just a few chapters earlier, Freud was a simpleton made legendary just because he had a few \\"ideas\\"! But now, because she is writing about Scorpio, he is considerably much more complex and cutting-edge because he has Scorpio on the ascendant? Shouldn't this point illustrate that within every sign, there is always room for ascendants and moon signs and other complex housing situations? And shouldn't it then be taken into consideration that a lot of signs are simply not as dull as one may think? I have known Librans who just aren't very bright, and Aquarians who aren't very curious, and Sagittarians who aren't very visionary (yes, vision is in the eye of the beholder, but if the author can have her own vision of what is 'visionary,' then why can't I?), and Taureans that can't do math equations to save their life (not to mention caring about money or dealing with it at all). Astrology is a science and is very accurate, but when authors begin to spin their own tales and over-generalize instead of giving simplistic, straight facts, this is when people begin to believe their own truths about signs.And to change the subject briefly, everyone has a \\"shadow,\\" as Greene points out, but what I don't understand is why she feels that shadows don't \\"really\\" represent the \\"actual\\" sun sign. To her, the Leo \\"shadow\\" has a bullying side, but God forbid that a Leo actually just genuinely be a bully. Capricorn may have a shadow that sometimes actually feels an emotion, but God forbid a Capricorn just be a mixture of varied emotions and a hundred different moods, instead of the straight-laced, money-grubbing bore that he supposedly is. Greene illustrates basic truths about every sign in beautiful detail, but it's when she begins to go off on metaphorical tangents that she begins to lose sight of what astrology actually is. I can see that Liz Greene is a very talented and gifted writer, as well as a knowledgeable astrologer/psychotherapist, but it's a shame that she had to direct these talents toward following the same creative-writing/novelized trend of every other astrology book out there. To be quite honest, the preface was actually the best part of the book."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"I'm not sure if this book was written to see mostly negative things about each sign, but that is how I read it. I was hoping to see some positive qualities as well as reading about the challenges with each sign."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"Liz Greene will blow you away. Somehow she has eerily succeeded in describing deeply personal truths to each and every sign. This is no vague fluff in newspapers and fortune cookies. I also have another book by Greene that is out of print entitled &quot;Star Signs For Lovers&quot; and I guard it carefully because anytime anyone reads even a few sentences they are shocked at the accuracy of the description of their personalities and tendencies both secret and expressed in relationships. Just don't tell your love about it unless you think they are ready to understand your shadow. Greene somehow intelligently puts into words what every individual already knows and didnt really understand about themselves. As you read this book, you will find yourself stopping and exclaiming &quot;that is so true!&quot;. Ive seen it happen with all my friends, and I enjoy sharing their personal discoveries, especially the skeptics whose set beliefs are no match for Liz Greene. I recommend this book to EVERYONE, and NO! You cant borrow it!. This book is so well written with such simple and personal intelligence, and so many insights, I want to know more about its mysterious author. What is her sign? Liz Greene is the real thing, some kind of cosmic prohpet. I guarentee she will freak you out."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"Liz Greene's explanations of sun sign characteristics are precise and unsentimental yet descriptive. Don't be put off by the title. Though the focus of the book is the effect of astrology in romantic relationships, I often refer to her book for help in understanding the personalities and motivations of many other people around me."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"This is the second astrological book I ever owned. (I now have a collection of around 24 books).The best thing about this book is actually the beginning and ending of each chapter and not the definition of each sun signs itself imho. Liz Greene puts in a lot of passion in writing her ideas and thoughts about astrology and for that I salute her. She gave me the impression she's really writing astrology for the sake of the cosmos and not for the sake of the dollar signs behind astology.For most of the star signs, she gave pretty accurate (if not somewhat generic) information. But I find all her star signs to be too 'good'. She pointed out that 'We simply can't like everybody'. But her books makes it such that 'We simplcy can't dislike everybody'. She make everyone nice and kind and generic.Personally, I feel that Greene should have an influence of Libra in her, she makes her book decorative, beautiful and balanced. If I ever want to feel good about myself or people around me, I would definitely turn to Greene's book.I find this book to be appropriate for anyone who is starting out in astrology, it's quite a delight to read and does contain a lot of information. With this book, you would learn about the general ideas of Earth, Fire, Air and Water signs. This is hardly emphasised in many other books. Since this book is not too pricy, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in astrology, however, I won't recommend it if you are already self-professed professionals in astrology."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"This is not a traditional information text, you won't find delineations of planetary positions or house emphasis. It is a book of Liz Greene's personal opinions and experience of the sun signs in relation to relationships...and it is wonderful. She writes of each sign individually; their potentials, their shadows, and the way they are expressed differently in men and women. She writes with humor and compassion, giving new insights on both signs with notoriously &quot;bad&quot; names and those who can seem to do no wrong in the horoscope columns. Reading it was not only enlightening but thoroughly enjoyable. She respects the intelligence of her audience, and get's herself across as one might to a valued fellow earthling."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"liz greene writes as if our lives were great dramas....all of us gods and godesses on some scale...and each with his own dark and cold or jealous side. she breaks each personality down into six basic sections ...the sign, the myth, the shadow, the lover, the man, and the woman. greene goes deeper than most in illustrating what an intricate character each one of us in this cosmos is....and provides answers where answers are possible. nevertheless, she never leaves you feeling that it isn't all just one huge mystery. a must-have book."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"Despite its rather corny title and cover, this book is by far the best-written and clearest articulation of the archetypal nature of astrology as it intersects with the specifics of the psychology of the individual. It's influenced by Jung, not someone's half-baked *idea* of Jung, and this is also refreshing. Overall, it's the best book of its kind I've ever read--the *only* book I've ever read on &quot;astrology&quot;, in fact, that lead me to feel I had come away with genuine psychological insights into myself, thus giving validity to a subject that is usually approached sophomorically at best."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"I love this book she is right on about the shadow base of the signs and she is an excellent writer. i was only going to read my own sign but then had to read them all i was very intersted and it kepted my attention through out the book. people from where i work fight over reading this book. this book also helps those whom are into astrology you can use the descriptions in doing your tarot card readings for self and others its awsume."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"I am a Sagittarian, and I am very excited when I was reading about my sign. I always think how happy would I be if I had live as a true Sagittarian. I have a friend who is of Capricorn. I shew her the Myth of Capricorn on this book, and she was shocked with the accuracy. Now she become an astrology lover.I have been studying astrology for nearly 10 years. So far this is the best book I have ever read. As mentioned in this book, Astrology is not just about the personal behavior, but the motivation behind the behavior. Everyone has his own destination to go, and they have their own path to go. By understand myself, appreciating myself and live as myself will I become a contented and a whole person."},{"Title":"Astrology for Lovers","review":"Astrology for Lovers is a great book for those who want to know more about their significant others' inner drives and why they are the way they are. And plus, it gives an insight to ascendants which I personally didn't know about until I read this book.

The students find it easy to understand as well as demonstrative enough to teach application.Dr. Domb's credibility (international TRIZ evangelist and editor of the TRIZ Journal, www.triz-journal.com) in the quality and innovation communities is such that this book MUST be studied if you are serious about TRIZ."},{"Title":"Simplified TRIZ: New Problem-Solving Applications for Engineers & Manufacturing Professionals","review":"I found the book very interesting, even if I was not able to apply it to real problems we face yet."},{"Title":"Aspects of Greek History 750-323BC: A Source-Based Approach","review":"I think that the review posted for this book is exceedingly unfair. What Buckley tries to do is clear away some of the hypocrisy that has surrounded modern writing about ancient history. For generations books have been written by regurgitating the narratives of a few primary sources: Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, et al. Buckley puts this process in the foreground and allows teachers to amplify and to correct by appealing to inscriptions, coins, less &quot;privileged&quot; narratives and so forth. This is a dynamic text, which is really alone in a sea of pompous writers who aspire to the true account of what &quot;actually happened&quot; and don't want to let students in on the process. I fully intend to use this text in a course surveying Greek history. Everyone gets some details wrong, but I admire the basic honesty of this text."},{"Title":"Aspects of Greek History 750-323BC: A Source-Based Approach","review":"This book is amazingly useful, providing both lovingly picked primary sources and commentary to help with understanding.

I highly recommend it, and so did my lecturers."},{"Title":"Aspects of Greek History 750-323BC: A Source-Based Approach","review":"To support the title, I'll take as an example only one chapter of Mr Buckley's book:The age of Greek Tyranny:c.650-510(page 47). First, the term &quot;Age of Tyranny&quot; as above is at least unfortunate.The author astounds everyone by such an unfounded allegation, since it is well known that tyrannies exist from their inception throughout Greek history. Second, at page 47 he defines a tyrant 'as someone who had seiged power unconstitutionally', thus implying that the cities where tyrants took over had pre-existing constitutions, which is untrue. Third, in his section &quot;Feidon of Argos&quot; at page 55 he alleges that &quot;the Chalcidians were the best in pre-hoplite fighting&quot;, whereas it is well known that Chalkis' strength lay on its horsemen, as it is reported in the expedition of 508 BC in the topic of Cleisthenes and the war of the Athenians against the Spartan alliance. I only chose these three points to illustrate and state further that I would never have recommended this book to my A-level Ancient History students."},{"Title":"Against Politics (Routledge Studies in Social and Political Thought)","review":"De Jasay's book does an excellent job punctuating the arguments typically used to justify the state. He shows the absurdity of contractariansim (if the state is necessary to enforce contracts, then how did the state make a contract with the people for its establishment?). His essay &quot;Is Limited Government Possible?&quot; is an excellent tonic for those libertarians who feel that the state can be effectively constrained by a constitution. In addition to the problem of enforcement, de Jasay highlights the disturbing tendency of the state to expand indefinitely as an increasingly smaller majority is necessary to exploit an increasingly larger minority (culminating in democracy where a coalition of 50+1 gets to exploit the remaining 49.9). He also demonstrates the flaws of adopting loose limitations on government action (for instance, if governement is supposed to promote fairness, who defines &quot;fairness&quot;?) The second part of the book highlights the functioning of social institutions and conventions that existed prior to governement and evolved independently of the state, strengthening the conclusion that people can lead peaceful, fulfilling lives without the state. I would have given this book five stars, except that it suffers from the same defect as most treatises of academic philosophy in that his writing style is often a bit dry."},{"Title":"Reimagining Shakespeare for Children and Young Adults (Children's Literature and Culture)","review":"This book is dynamite."},{"Title":"Before and at trial: What should be done by counsel, solicitor and client","review":"It was not until I received it in the mail that I realised this \\"book\\" was a bound photocopy of a title written in 1886.

At the heart of the story is the main character, Emilia. She is a combination of science, intuition and emotion that more than holds our attention and whose story we are sorry to see end. Her love life is a mix between torrid chemical passion with childhood sweetheart Daniel Cuenca and a more calm romance with medical colleague Antonio Zavalza. I enjoyed being transported into the rhelm of instability in Mexican politics of the late 19th and early 20th century. Daniel's passion for the political was a wonderful wanderlust. Emilia's parents were also great characters: Diego the pharmacist and Josefa, a mix of practicality and emotion. Several medical issues were also fascinating. One is the role of women in medicine and the difficulties of early female physicians to get education and be accepted. Another was the development of medical theory with Emilia's research encompassing the herbal, mystical, massage, etc. At one point the male doctors are amazed as her directness in asking a patient, &quot;Where does it hurt?&quot; Another tidbit was excluding women medical students from lessons on male reproductive organs; this highlighted a sense of history in a novel that spans years from 1874 to 1963. In Margaret Peden's English translation, there is a good sense of rhythm and pacing. This is an excellent novel that rivits our attention with the love story and many strong characters, and has enough historical, political and medical information to stimulate the intellect at the same time. Seek it out!"},{"Title":"Lovesick","review":"I finished this book in 2 days; I struggled to put it down. Such a beautiful story, richly woven through with strands of history and sorrow.

Emilia Sauri is the daughter of a Mayan herbalist and a Spanish mother. She loves her childhood friend, Daniel Cuenca. As Emilia studies to become a physician and turns into a political rebel, Daniel runs off to fight, joining whomever he thinks makes the best leader of the month. He constantly returns home when his current favorite leader fails to live up to his expectations. At home, Daniel makes passionate love with Emilia, only to quickly desert her, leaving her lonely and angry. However, she loathes herself more for wanting and loving him even deeper after each departure....... While Daniel is away on one of his long term excursions, Emilia meets Antonio Zavalza, a physician who abhors violence. When Antonio opens up a local hospital, she joins his efforts to help the poor. Working side by side, the two doctors fall in love with each other. However, Emilia must choose between a man of peace offering to share a serene and professional future together or a man of war offering spurts of feverish love....... LOVESICK is a great work written in the Mexican form of historical fiction that will thrill readers who enjoy a novel written from a different perspective and writing style.

Furthermore, the debate over abortion is not so much about the status of the fetus, but the very meaning and place of woman's status in relation to the larger society.Because that question cannot fully be examined without delving into how ecconomic status and ethnicity affect women's options, a multifaceted analysis is thoughtfully woven throughout the text. Abortion is only one dimension to women's health, and different options may be appropriate for the same woman at different points in a single life time.Although the book is dated 1990, it should not pose a deterent to the scholar because the issues we are researching have essentially remained static through the past couple of years. Petchesky devotes separate chapters to teen sexuality policy and the funding attacks of the far right--issues that are now central to the question of choice."},{"Title":"Abortion And Woman's Choice: The State, Sexuality, And Reproductive Freedom (Longman Series in Feminist Theory)","review":"I needed to read A LOT of books about abortion politics for my PhD dissertation - and although this book might come across as an older source, it is one of the most thorough, and critical analyses of not only abortion in the U.S. context, but of abortion policy overall. Petchesky's takes a clear stance the U.S. debate, but what actually make her book special is her analysis with regards to what abortion policy means in the overall context of a nation. The first two chapters should not be missed if you want to know about what abortion as a policy matter means for gender regimes within a state. The conclusion IS a bit outdated, but the book itself is a great source."},{"Title":"Just a Boy: The True Story of a Stolen Childhood","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I had started it!

I guess I'm not the only one who bought the book because I wanted to know \\"that side of the story\\" and about the people who suffered the most. I read the book and I must say that I expected more than what I got. The book is nice and will touch your heart. But as the story goes on, you start to loose interest. It becomes a sequence of events, nothing more. I agree that \\"sometimes you must decide to survive\\". But I think that, well, the second half of the book could have been written in a more interesting way.It is an affecting read. But if you read it, don't take too long or stop reading and think \\"I'll come back to it later\\". Finish the book and you'll enjoy.

Before I read it I checked on the biography of the author, as I wanted to make sure he had the intellectual standing to write such a book before I invested my time in it. He does. You can check him on Wikipedia. He is contemporary (1881) with great events regarding the relationship between science and religion, yet everything he covers is applicable in today's world. He recognized the importance of the conflicts that were emerging and investigated the history of the relationship between science and religion, observed their present state, and makes what turns out to be very accurate predictions of exactly the situation we are in today. I am a student of history and I could find no fault with his presentation of historical facts, though he presents them in a context is unique to him at that time.With the publication of Stephen Hawkin's book, \\"The Grand Design\\" we are seeing a replay of the same conflict again between a static belief system and a system that is constantly expanding, making Draper's book all the more relevant in understanding just what is happening and why.As a plus, the author is an excellent writer of his time and I enjoyed his civility, and how he uses his words. A great relief from the \\"yell at you\\" style that seems popular now. If anyone is interested in a well thought out and intelligently presented explanation of why civilization finds itself in the conflicts we see everyday in the news, I recommend this work.BTW the University of Va. has a copy of this book in it's online library. I'd recommend reading the preface there to see if you'd like it. May be able to get a sample on the Kindle also."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"What a refreshing encapsulation of the history of religion and how it stifled science! I was shocked to find that the author is from the mid-19th century. I have picked up many new insights into all religions and the politics of religion. Well written, though sometimes tough to follow author's thoughts (due to (unavoidable) inaccuracies in transcription). Will read more by author and further investigate some of his claims regarding very early astronomy - just the kind of action that reading a good book should generate! I loved it!"},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"This book should be called \\"A history of religion and philosophers\\". I got it to research the attitudes of those opposed to science in history, and there was not much I could lift from it. However it's quite interesting, just not much about science."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"As a student of astronomy I was at least a bit familiar with some of the history, especially of the time around Galileo, so I skipped past the prologue (or more correctly \\"why the Christian Church is horrible\\") section and went straight to the 1500's. Note quote marks are the authors work, breaks in between are my comments.\\"So great was the preference given to sacred over profane learning that Christianity had been in existence fifteen hundred years, and had not produced a single astronomer.\\" Oh, really? Pope Sylvester II (1000's), Johannes de Sacrobosco (1200's), Nicole Oresme (1300's), and Nicholas of Cusa (1400's) would disagree and they were just a few Catholic CLERIC Astronomers.\\"Copernicus, a Prussian,...\\" and Catholic Cannon (I wonder if the author knew and left this out or just never came across this bit of info) \\"Aware that his doctrines were totally opposed to revealed truth...\\" and could not be proved scientifically \\"refrained from publishing his book for 36 years...[until] the entreaty of Cardinal Schomberg.\\" Well, at least he admitted that we owe a Cardinal the publishing of this book. Although it was banned, as far as I can tell it wasn't until 100 years after his death with and that mostly due to Galileo's personality conflict with certain church authorities.\\"[Waxing poetic about Galileo noting a couple of astronomical phenomena] and many other beautiful telescopic discoveries tended to the establishment of the truth of the Copernican system.\\" While they were indeed evidence for it, it still was not scientifically provable. For Copernicus still used spherical orbits and his system was no better than the Ptolemaic one at predicting the motions, which is what a scientific theory is supposed to do.\\"By the low and ignorant ecclesiastics...\\" and noted scientists like Tycho Brahe \\"...they were denounced as deceptions or frauds.\\" Now for the Evil Church attacks poor noble Galileo (conveniently leaving out how he insulted the pope...of course being insulted does not justify the actions of any man, but this author is so driven by an agenda that he has made Galileo a saint.) \\"He was then committed to prison\\" otherwise known as house arrest in his villa.The author picks and chooses bits of facts, distorts and lies to create a blatant anti-Christian screed and anyone who thinks otherwise is smoking something. I studied Astrophysics and am a faithful Catholic. There have been many, MANY Catholic scientists who have made notable contributions to their fields of study. So, where can we find a good history of science and religion? I hear Stanley L. Jaki is a good author on the topic or you could just go check out the Vatican Observatory."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"Draper is a man who predicted advances in science when many of those things hadn't been considered by those more skilled and qualified than himself.It is quite amazing to read the predictions of a man made in 1874. His thoughts on what he considers the precipice of the information age. He couldn't possible have known what was in store for this world as it progressed through the late 19th and early 20th century. He certainly would not have understood that the later half of the 20th century would give rise to more knowledge, advent, discover and technology... to more science and understanding than the entire history of humanity thus far. Yet here in his own words he shows that with forethought one can have an idea about how things will pan out.Draper seen the conflict of Religion and Science as ultimately lost by religion if it simply did not adapt to the new knowledge being uncovered in his day and what was to follow. It was probably okay in the 16th, 17th or 18th century to have a 50 year debate on a single subject since science moved rather slowly. It was NOT okay to do that in 1874... and its suicide to think people will do so now with a world of data at their fingertips. In his mind Religion picked a fight they knew they could not win by insisting on absurdity when demonstration said otherwise and that continuing in this manner would simply spell the death of religion. The ultimate threat of 'forget your idea or we will kill you' is now simply gone. Which leaves demonstration in place of forced subservience.For its part in the 1800' those proselytizing science as an 'understanding' of the word tended to face off against religion giving it essentially a forum to make its point.Since this time scientists have learned not to bother questioning religious doctrine. To them the battle is won and most don't care what the worlds religions say. They now simply get on with the job and the voices of those in the religions camp may do as they wish. This is one of the reasons Japanese, Chinese, European and Indian scientists agree the situation in the USA is terrible... but really couldn't be bothered to do anything about it. They know that either the science will demonstrate itself, or it will be forcibly curtailed... either way those are political things that might happen and will not impact on the philosophy of science or its knowledge base. Once discovered and used you simply can't put the science genie back into the box.This book was added to a list of 'banned books' by the catholic hierarchy. Its still on that list even though the catholic church now accept every word of it. But in the In the 1870's that was more or less a sales aid and only served to increase sales of the book. Moreover I find it interesting that to ban such a book someone inside the church had to read it. Surely if its okay for them and only served to have them ban it, then its okay for their congregations?Drapers work in this book was mostly a discussion of the works of others.I find it amazing that although this book is over 140 years old, and even though the things we can easily demonstrate to ourselves on a kitchen table in 2012 are known by many... that some people still see the world in the light of nonsense that those lesser educated did in the centuries before even this book was written.Moreover almost every point raised by those who argue for creation mythology is mentioned and quashed in this book from 1874! These things were known then...we've passed an entire century and there are still people who think the world is 6k years old...Home schooling is not an excuse either... Draper himself was home schooled by his father, a creationist clergyman.I would recommend this easy to read tome to anyone with an interest in the social and scientific evolution of the United States."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"John William Draper (1811-1882) was an (English-born) American scientist, philosopher, historian, and photographer. He wrote in the Preface to this 1874 book, \\"The antagonism we thus witness between Religion and Science is the continuation of a struggle that commenced when Christianity began to attain political power. A divine revelation must necessarily be intolerant of contradiction... The history of Science ... is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other. No one has hitherto treated the subject from this point of view. Yet... it presents itself... as the most important of all living issues... What I have sought to do is, to present a clear and impartial statement of the views and acts of the two contending parties...\\" (Pg. vi-vii, ix)He notes that \\"I have had little to say respecting ... the Protestant and Greek Churches... In speaking of Christianity, reference is generally made to the Roman Church, partly because its adherents compose the majority of Christendom, partly because its demands are the most pretentious, and partly because it has commonly sought to enforce those demands by the civil power.\\" (Pg. x-xi) He explains his own perspective: \\"It is enough for us ourselves to know that, though there is a Supreme Power, there is no Supreme Being. There is an invisible principle, but not a personal God... All revelation is, necessarily, a mere fiction... There is no such thing as Providence... The vital force which pervades the world is what the illiterate call God.\\" (Pg. 24-25)Of Galileo, he recounts, \\"Knowing well that Truth has no need of martyrs, he assented to the required recantation, and gave the promise demanded... What a spectacle! This venerable man, the most illustrious of his age, forced by the threat of death to deny facts which his judges as well as himself knew to be true! He was then ... treated with remorseless severity during the remaining ten years of his life, and was denied burial in consecrated ground.\\" (Pg. 171-172)Of Giorano Bruno's burning, he asserts, \\"No one can recall without sentiments of pity the sufferings of those countless [Christian] martyrs, who... have been brought for their religious opinions to the stake. But each of these had... [his belief in] eternal happiness... For Bruno there was no such support. The philosophical opinions, for the sake of which he surrendered his life, could give him no consolation... But perhaps the day approaches when posterity will ... [unveil] a statue of Bruno under the dome of St. Peter's at Rome.\\" (Pg. 180-181)He summarizes, \\"Whoever will in a spirit of impartiality examine what had been done by Catholicism for the intellectual and material advancement of Europe... and what has been done by science in its brief period of action, can, I am persuaded, come to no other conclusion than this, that, in instituting a comparison, he has established a contrast.\\" (Pg. 321) He adds, \\"Roman Christianity and Science are recognized by their respective adherents as being absolutely incompatible; they cannot exist together; one must yield to the other; mankind must make its choice---it cannot have both.\\" (Pg. 363)This book, along withA History of the Warfare of Science With Theology in Christendom (2 Volume Set), is one of the \\"classic\\" texts on the conflicts between religion and science."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"I recently took a history of science course (the Learning Company) by Lawrence Principie, who holds dual appointments at Johns Hopkins (Organic chemistry and The History of Science).

Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such. For example, the ancient Christian polemic of Bahira, the heretical monk, is repeated as historical fact with no indication that it is at best pure legend."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"Now, after seeing one review on here, I have to make my thoughts known. This is an absolutely amazing book. How anyone doesn't think that it clarifies exactly what the title dictates, is beyond me. There is a disturbing story that brought tears to my eyes: monks took an educated woman, the bishop was jealous of, stripped her naked - dragged her into the church, where Peter the reader bludgeoned her to death - then scraped the flesh from her bones and burned it all in the fire. I totally see how the conflict between science and religion started, escalated and continues on. It is a great book and extremely well written."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"There are two problems with this book: First, its title and introduction lead one to believe that it will be an objective depiction of the anatomy of a conflict. Instead, it is a polemic against Christianity (mostly Roman Catholicism) and an endorsement of Science. Second, although its conspicuous copyrite year is 2010, the book was actually written in the late 19th century.The book presents very detailed historical material of the evolution of science and Christianity from the time of their origins up to the late 1800s, and concludes that Christianity, during most that time, severely hampered the vigor and freedom of scientific inquiry. The essence of the author's thesis is that in trying to explain everything about everything Christianity had, in large part, stepped on ground that would have been better served by observation and experimentation. In its determnation to maintain the upper hand, and in vacating the ideational ground upon which Christ stood, Christianity ultimately killed people, stifled free thinking and stymied the progress of civilization for at least a millenium before the Protestant Reformation. At least the author implies as much.This seems axiomatic from the standpoint of the 21st century and it might be true that Christianity lost its way within a short period after Christ's death. But, in the author's 19th century zeal to extol the virtues of science he omits an examination of what Christianity did accomplish on ground that it rightly stood. For instance, \\"Seminal Christianity\\" is not designed to be scientific but rather to be interpretive; it's not to explain what the universe is but why it is there; it doesn't speak to the human mind but to the human heart. To paint Chrisitrianity, in general, negatively in contrast to the neoreligion of science might have worked in a culture bathing in the first glow of Darwinism. However, those brush strokes don't impress the modern mind that knows religion and science try to do different things, knows that any religion is not monolithic, notwithstanding the indiscriminate carpet-bombings of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, et al. As one tradition steps on the ground of the other, it is wrong.Draper was drunk with the miracles of late 19th century science and was understandably myopic. This reader, by virtue of the times he lives in, is not."},{"Title":"History of the conflict between religion and science","review":"This book isn't really about science or religion per se, though it says a lot about both subjects, it's more a handbook of opinions and how to not write authoritatively.

It's a creative re-telling of the story of Noah from the time of God's call to build an ark to when he and his family went their seperate ways to go and re-populate the Earth.I think what I like about the book so much is how the author uses his imagination to fill in the gaps in the story of Noah.Moses gave his best attempt at the re-telling of the story of Noah and the flood. A man who lived to be 950 years old and yet Moses only tells the story in a few pages. Hitting the high and low points rather casually.As I'm learning to approach Scripture in a non-traditional way, one of the thing that most excites me is the possibility of using imagination to fill in the gaps. Not that it makes it true. Or real. But when the imagination is brought into the gaps and spaces of Scripture that remain silent, it opens up a place of creativity. If nothing else it's a great creative exercise.Taking us outside the world of blacks and whites . . . scientific, analytical words. And into the realm of real lives.What was the rest of Noah's life like? What was his family like? Did they believe Noah and God? Did they think it was fake? Were they resentful? Were they mad at God? What did their wives think? What did they experience? The animals? What conversations were had between Noah and his children . . . his skeptics . . . his attackers?David Maine does this with his book. Using his imagination to craft the story of Noah around what has been shared with us in Scripture. Filling in the gaps with missing pieces of the story. He mixes the spirituality and agnosticism of the family with the faith and call of Noah. The consequent tension that this creates and how it turns everyone's life upside down.The end result is an excellent piece of fiction that was not only excellent literary entertainment . . . but a new theological possibility for approaching Scripture."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This is a wonderful, funny book exploring the wrestling that people of faith (and their familes) have in trying to follow the way they understand God is leading them.It captures some of the loneliness of faith, and the difficulties that those close to faith explorers face. We all respect those who actually try to live by their convictions, but living with them can be tough.I learned a new swear word, 'rutting' an ingenious way of inserting harsh reality to the dialogue without resorting to course language.Whoever said that stories of faith have a happy ending, this one has a kind of bitter sweet conclusion. I loved the book and I smile at the recollection of some of the classic lines. Would Jonah work?"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I thought this book was incredible with it's harsh reality and ability to make the reader question what how the Bible should be interpreted. Admittedly, I am unsure of my own beliefs as far as religion goes, but I am very sympathetic and empathetic. There is definately a line between the faithful and unfaithful, but this books makes the reader question what it is that makes someone faithful or not. Noah exhibits his own sinful behavior through some of his actions and yet he is saved. What is it that really distinguishes him from everyone else? What makes him any better other than God talked to him. God could have talked to anybody, why him? There were those who had done nothing, had shown no sinful behavior but they were killed anyway and yet Noah's family showed signs of sinful behavior and they were saved. It makes no sense to me. Where is the fairness in that?Overall, this books is a great example of unbreakable faith, which is good for everyone to witness. Maine has a way of making it real rather than a fable in the Bible. His creation of characters was deliberate and insightful, with each character playing their part in one of the oldest stories of all time."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"A quick yet memorable read that is truly original and impossible to put down. It's hard to make anything but symbolism and allegory out of a 600-year-old man who hears voices from God, builds a giant boat to hold every species on earth, then drifts for 40 days while the entire planet is flooded and everyone else dies. Miraculously, David Maine takes the fantastical and makes it as real, earthy, and funny as anything I've ever read. The characters in this book ring so true you'll forget you're reading a biblical story at all."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"In this retelling of the familiar Genesis story of Noah and the Great Flood, Maine's use of multiple narrators gives supernatural material very human dimensions. The biblical \\"details\\" of the ark, the deluge, and the gathering of the animals are kept and enlarged upon right along with each human's story (each human in Noe's (Noah's) family, that is.)The women in the story are particularly strong characters--a pleasant surprise considering the patriarchal resource from which it's drawn. They become the true human instruments of Noah's successful voyage. The supernatural aspects are nicely juxtaposed with the mundane aspects of cramped quarters, human appetites, unpleasant smells, filth, and toil. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I am an avid reader of various genres, this novel caught my eye because I am a big fan of Lamb by Christopher Moore and The Life of Pi by Yann Martel. It was suggested in a review that this had elements of one (Pi), and clearly had basis in the other (Lamb). The book was an easy and interesting read, the P.O.V.'s of the characters individual dialog was fresh, and the language was much easier to understand than good old King James. I guess I was hoping for a little more of a \\"hook\\", but all I got was an interesting retelling of the oft-told tale, albeit with a little feminism tossed in for good measure. I was never tempted to NOT finish the book, but I am really into \\"thought provoking\\" these days, and in that regard (at least for me) it fell short. If you want an interesting AND thought provoking take on biblical lore, I definitley recommend the afore mentioned novels."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This is an amusing and interesting telling of the Noah Ark story. It fills in all the details - like excrement and the depressive nature of riding through 40 days and 40 nights of rain in a boat with your relatives.This is, however, more than just sitting around and telling what it might have been like on the ark - something that might be an interesting past-time for anyone. Mr. Maine rises above this. There is cleverness throughout - like the way Mr. Maine figured the animals were gathered and an explanation for the black race after Noah's white family propagated the world post-flood.There is also the depth of following faith - and not. Also insight as to just how primitive - nearly prehistoric this age and its people were.To accomplish all of this, Mr. Maine also gave believeable personalities to Noah's family. First, Noah, the patriarch (and zealot)and his wife, seemingly meek but a pillar of strength. Then each of their sons were given separate and plausible personalities as were their wives.This was an interesting and thought-provoking retelling, or fleshing out, of one of the best known stories of the world. It was enjoyable to read and I believe it is the type of book that will stay with the reader for a long long time."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Another Amazon reviewer recommended a book that turned out to be a great read... The Preservationist by David Maine. This book has everything I can't do as a writer, and I love it.Maine takes the biblical story of Noah's Ark and weaves a narrative tale around it. Using a combination of first and third person voice, the story is fleshed out through the eyes of \\"Noe\\", his wife, and his three sons (along with their wives). The core story follows the biblical account, but plenty of room is left for the author to add personality to each player. You see the fear and doubt that Noah encounters as he follows his directives from God, knowing he has to act but not knowing how to accomplish the huge task set before him. His sons are all distinctive individuals who don't always play well with each other. Each wife is distinctly different from the rest, but their uniqueness addresses the ability to bring in animals that no one has ever seen or imagined. Best of all, Maine does a great job in painting a picture of what it would be like to be trapped on a boat with a huge number of animals and little to do to break the monotony of each passing day. What is largely a sanitary account in the Bible becomes a struggle that every reader can identify with.The reason I liked this book so much is that I don't do very well in painting color into a story. If I wrote War And Peace, it'd probably be done in 75 pages. Not that I write tight prose. I just don't describe events and emotions very well. Maine has forever altered the way I'll view Noah, and for me that's a good thing. Very well done..."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Who would have thought the Noah's ark story could be fresh, delightful, thought provoking, and even sometimes funny? Great character development -- especially the daughters-in-law, and their surprising contributions to the success of the journey. David Maine has done a great job of telling a story that puts us right there on the ark."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio cd edition.David Maine's THE PRESERVATIONIST is a vastly entertaining enlargement of the story of Noah (here named Noe) and the deluge. Taking as his starting point the details as recorded in Genesis, the author then expands upon the personalities and gives each a unique voice (in fact alternating between their points of view) to relate the story in their own way. Thus, while Noe's perspective is written in the third person, the rest speak in the first, and in reaction to the tremendous events they are witness to.I find that I internalize these audio versions differently than when I read the physical book, and how successful the spoken version is can largely depend on the speaker. THE PRESERVATIONIST is a bit different than most audio versions in that each character is represented by a different voice actor, and except for one, I found them all extremely easy to listen to. In fact, as happens sometimes, I have the feeling that the entire experience was enhanced by the voice actors, rather than having to listen to the voice in my head. In this case, I think the women's voices added the most - along with Mr. Maine's adroitness at capturing the personalities of these female characters, the women themselves, through their inflection and pace, sounded realistic, believable.There should be no surprises to a story like this, so the charm of the telling lies in the interaction between the characters and the development of personality and tension between them. As I mentioned, the author does not stray from the biblical account - though there is an earthy realism to it that makes it inappropriate for Sunday school - but there is a lot of room in the sketchy details for improvisation. Think along the lines of, 'what would I be thinking and doing if I were in this position', and you'll have a fair idea of the book's thrust.Yet if I do that - try to place myself within the context of the story - my first thought is that I would probably question the whole project. But Noe's sons and their wives do not. Some of their interior thoughts subtly hint at misgivings toward what they are asked to do (and they are asked to do the impossible), but they obey the patriarch. At first, I thought I would have liked to hear the author account for someone's doubts, but now I think that was the point - they had none. They were fallible people but they had complete faith - Noe in YAHWEH, and his children in him. Looked at in this way, I think the entire story becomes an interesting commentary on faith, rather than one of surviving the deluge.The story is not completely without faults, though I think they are minor. It does seem as though the final days on the ark drag on (though not nearly as long as it would have had you actually been there!), so the final chapters seem a little long. Other than that, there are few false notes. Although there are frequent allusions to sex, sexual violence, and genitalia, taken in context, I thought it was all rather circumspect. Those who would prefer not to think of their biblical icons as human may want to avoid this retelling, though I think they would miss out. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I think we all have the tendency to be biased about what we enjoy based on our personal likes and what we can identify with. I decided not rate this book based on how much it 'fit' into my experience, theology or personal taste.I imagine some religious folks might get upset at certain \`irreverent', or \`inaccurate' parts of this book (like how some ASOIAF readers were upset at the changes done in the Game of Thrones Season 2 adaptation). Whether it be scripture or canonical fiction, diehard fans are unhappy with interpolations and extrapolations, it can't be avoided. On the other side of the coin, I imagine some who were burned by religion to be turned off from the start at the concept of biblical fiction.The Preservationist is a 5 out of 5 for me based on my appreciation of it as a work. I knew the bible story well but never reimagined it enough to put myself in the character's shoes. A third of the way into this book I suddenly realized how fantastic and terrible the situation was, indeed, the story is a post-apocalyptic tale of God wiping out all life on the planet, save one family and a very large stinky, floating zoo. Any sane person can't help but question God's morality in this act, and it's the question most of the characters struggle with in the aftermath. (Though the theological side of me questioned, \\"wasn't the gene pool mostly corrupted because the population had become Nephilim, hence the reason for the flood?\\" I didn't bother to dig deeper).Dave Maine does a terrific job at fully fleshing out the characters so that we identify with them as normal people. I enjoyed the humor throughout, and for the most part it's told in first person. Seeing the world through the eyes of the various characters, their frustrations, their humor, their values, how each individual viewed and interacted with their spouse, with members of the family and with Noe--each viewpoint added one to another. And I was particularly impressed by the characterization of all the women in this story. Very insightful and well crafted Dave! Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Supposedly witty and humorous, as a devoutly religious person, I found the book to be way too irreverent for my comfort level; it seemed to mock God (as well as Noah), and I couldn't force myself to read the last half (although I skimmed a few sections). Noah was not pictured as a Godly being but as somewhat of a tyrant, and I didn't feel that the sexual \\"escapades\\" belonged in a Bible story.I'm sure there are those who are in disagreement, but this is, honestly, how I felt about the book and cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Every chapter draws you to the next, page after page. Some novels find their roots in historical facts. Others draw from the Bible. Some mix it up from both. This is one of those, although some would likely argue there is little historical facts behind the great flood of the Bible. Let's skip that argument though and just enjoy the fact that the story of Noah is at the root of this novel and from there the characters are fleshed into reality by the author. They become real and ordinary - or not so ordinary - people that you get to know as the greatest event of the Bible enfolds thier lives. Each character is its own and their stories mesh into a terrific read that fascinates and pulls you along, page by page, until you regretfully come to the ending. And that ending is still seen to be just another beginning. Given to me as a gift, it interested me, pulled me in, and left me realizing more of the story than I had imagined to exist. This, was a great read. Well worth it, whether you think the great flood was real or not. After all, reality isn't really necessary for a great story, but - like this one - it makes the story all the more tantalizing to read."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"A fairly funny retelling of Noah and the Flood; this imagines what life was like for Noah and his clan. I don't usually like so many changes of point of view but it works for this book - each chapter is a different family member and it helps to flesh out the characters by how they see others and how they are seen. Overall, it was pretty good but I preferred Christopher Moore's funnier take on Jesus (Lamb, or the Gospel according to Biff, Jesus's Childhood Friend)."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"An extraordinary tale. David Maine proves to be one of the best storytellers of our age. The Preservationist is a retelling of Noah's Ark. When Noe (as he's called in the Douay Bible) is 600 years old, God comes to him and commands him to build an ark, sparing him and his extended family from the death which awaits everyone else, in the form of a global flood. But this version is more than just a biblical narration. The reader gets to experience the events as if Noe was telling the story himself. Perfect. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Book Review for the PreservationistMany different shades of red, brown, and green glaze across the wanting cover. Every animal drawn to the very last detail running out of the monstrous boat. There, aloft a little hill lays the mightiest ark of them all. It breaths new life that will hopefully stay for along time and begin the new society. The animals scurry around trying to sniff out the new land, making there new territories, and making sure that none of the other animals come near. It is a true survival story. The book talks about what Noe and his family had to do to survive the horrific flood. The preservationist is Noe. He is the chosen one who is in charge of creating the new society for the world. The Preservationist, written by David Maine, is a magnificent book to read. It has great symbolical elements and has a great plot that flows nicely with the book.The book takes place in the Middle East. That is about all the book gives you about the setting. It doesn't go into much detail about it. We also learn that this happened a long time ago. The main character is Noe, the preservationist. He got chosen out of everyone in the world to head up the building of the ark that would save him and his family from g-d's flood. G-d wasn't very happy with all of the members of the world, so he decided to kill them all by creating a flood that no one could survive. To help Noe build the ark, he gets all of his sons and their wives to come to his homeland and help him create it. He sends them out on very long treks and hikes to get either thematerials they need to build the boat, or the animals that g-d has told them to put on the boat, so when they get to land, they can start life all over again. One of the big arguments that the family had was; what order should the animals go into the boat. They had built three decks worth of storage room for the animals, but they needed to make sure that the animals went in the right way so that they wouldn't tip over and drown. They worked through it by Noe finally making the decision.The rain clouds had finally come and so they all got into the boat and waited. It took 2 weeks until the rain finally came, but it wasn't enough for the flood. They waited for awhile longer and finally it rained the holly rain and g-d created the flood. They all safely got onto the boat and started floating away, watching everyone die, not being able to do anything. One of Noe's daughters in law took this very hard. It was very difficult for her to watch them all die in front of her. Noe said it was g-d's will and that this was their fate. She finally got over it and understood.While they were on the boat, they changed so much. They were on the boat for over a year. Sometimes they didn't even talk to each other during the day. It got so boring some times that they would just sleep for the whole day if they weren't doing their daily choirs. One of the more sad parts of the book was when Noe went into his horrific stages. He would go in and out of consciousness. One of Noe's sons took charge while he was out of it. Noe finally got better and went back to work. It was truly a team effort. If one person didn't do there job, then all would go wrong. Every single person on that boat needed to be doing something most of the time. Surprisingly enough, they did workall together. They did this probably because if they didn't, they knew that they would all die. Also, they never really argued a lot. I know with me, if I'm with one person for a really long time, there is bound to be an argument waiting to happen. While on the ark, no body ever got into an argument. The book's description of things is really good. The author did a really good job of slowing the book down and then describing a situation or event in full, so that one could totally understand it a lot better then if he didn't. I really didn't see anything that I didn't like. It really did a great job of writing this, the way I would like it.One great symbol in this book is the ark. The ark definitely represents an important part. It represents life. Noe's family is the only people left. They are the ones who will have to start society back up. Another symbolical element in the book was the animals. The animals symbolize hope. I mean, g-d isn't going to tell you to take all of these animals for you to just drown in the middle of the sea, right? Having the animals mean that they are going to find land and be able to start society back up again.The book definitely connects to modern life. Life is all about survival. We earn money, eat food, drink water, do well in school, and respect other people to survive in the world. Noe and his family being on the ark is simply a means of survival. They have to be on the ark to survive the flood. To save their lives! This book is for any ages really. I thought it was a great read and was very interesting.The PreservationistDavid MaineISBN: 0-312-32847-8230 pages"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"My background is this: for many years an intense faith in the story told in the bible's pages, then a total loss of faith & belief, and now a solid un-knowing. I hold no belief but I don't rule out the possibility of believing.THE PRESERVATIONIST is an entertaining, interesting, thought-provoking story and suitable for persons of (biblical) faith as well as persons without faith. Regardless of your spiritual status or belief, the story told here is worth reading - as is the story in it's original form as found in the book of GENESIS.The bible account is fairly straightforward. Reading it first or having a prior knowledge of it will make the genius of THE PRESERVATIONIST much more apparent. It takes a well known story of mankind's past and transforms the faceless, colorless, personality-free characters & events into something easy to identify with.The characters are very diverse in their personalities. The characters are marked by equal parts of reverence & irreverence, grit, flaws & strengths. They are real. Anytime a story of the past is retold with characters WE can identify with it takes the story from a cold distant telling and makes it OUR OWN. One we could visualize struggling through and getting past. THAT is what this book does so well.If you are a person without faith in the bible account, you will be entertained. If you are a person WITH faith in the biblical account you may be surprised to find your faith & appreciation strengthened."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This book has its defects, but they're irrelevant because what it does well is retell a Biblical story without religious bias, making it more real and emphasizing where the spiritual aspect of faith comes into play. This is not literature, or philosophy, but folk knowledge, and while it has philosophical defects, in my view, its main value is communicating the human experience of believing in life enough to weather its darkest channels, including facing death and despair and possibly, being wrong and have a whole bunch of people laugh at you for bankrupting yourself building a giant boat. I didn't take it seriously and was able to enjoy it. I think it's designed to entertain and in that it succeeds, as well as communicating some of what makes the story of the flood an epic tale."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"When I think of the ancient tale of Noah's ark, I find it hard to imagine overcoming the difficulties inherent in constructing an ark, loading it with every kind of animal, and then surviving in it while waiting for the flood waters to recede. In debut author David Maine's \\"The Preservationist,\\" he works out many of the practical implementation details in a believable manner and allows readers to place themselves at the scene. We get to witness the labors of Noe (as he is called here) and his family, as they gather materials and build the ark while facing ridicule from others. We accompany the women as they collect every species of animal, and then load and arrange them on the boat. We experience the effects of a year of cramped conditions aboard the ark, while worrying about having enough food and fresh water for the survival of man and beast alike. We feel what it would be like to be the sole survivors of a watery holocaust, setting out to rebuild our lives and repopulate the world. And through it all, we feel God's helping hand here and there to make this monumental feat succeed.As interesting as these details are, what truly makes this story shine is the way in which Maine makes his characters come alive through gentle humor and creative artistry. Told in alternating voices by the members of Noe's family, the story documents the unspoken affection between 600-year-old Noe and his unnamed wife. It explores the personalities and conflicts of Noe's three sons and their wives. It explores Noe's alternating feelings of confidence and anxiety as he bears the responsibility of carrying out Yahweh's will. Every character has the opportunity to voice their thoughts about the nature of God and His reasons for causing the flood and sparing their lives.This book can be read both as an interesting story of a family's struggle for survival and as a refreshingly innovative retelling of a story of God's relationship with man. At times funny, at times touching, and at times even irreverent, it is a story of affection, faith, humanity, and endurance.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This is a remarkable first novel. Let's be frank -- it's a remarkable novel. Art does not need to do this, but Maine has written a work of art that invites its reader to become better, to understand the world more, for having read it."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Biblical fiction boasts a proud tradition of high literature, perhaps most masterfully seen in Mann's Joseph cycle. Sadly, this fine genre recently seems to have fallen on hard times, now consisting of taking a bible story, adding in a dose of sex and modern sensibility and mixing. Such novels, and they are legion, dilute the power of the original story, offering readers an easily digested mockery.David Maine, beginning here with his novel \\"The Preservationist\\" and continuing with his critically acclaimed tale of Cain, \\"The Fallen\\" brings the genre back in the direction of its powerful past. Showing both great respect, thought, and considerable humor, Maine delves into the story of Noah, fleshing out the characters with a sensitive eye towards both the narrative and the reader. Most importantly, while making the characters multidimensional and sympathetic, the novel never tries to white wash to ethical complexity of the Creator destroying most of his creation.Readers familiar with the biblical account of the flood will recognize that the story includes a heavy dose of family drama. Maine builds on this deftly, creating tension and an engaging thread that binds the story together. Further credit must be given for the author's excellent use of the midrashic stories that surround the biblical text, often to create great humor.A word must also be said about Maine's excellent use of the character of the Divine. Most biblical fiction either ignores The Creator's central role, a strange betrayal of the original text, or turn the characters into puppets pulled on strings. Far from either of these pitfalls, The Preservationist demonstrates a clever balancing act, turning the story into an interesting and yet strangely familiar tale of the challenges of faith."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"In The Preservationist, David Maine takes one of the Old Testament's most fanciful, seemingly allegorical episodes and brings it kicking and bleating to life. Maine takes the story of Noah's ark and dares to fill in the gaps, rendering the logistics of Noah's (or Noe's) feat surprisingly credible while grounding the narrative in fresh, earthy detail. What ultimately makes this novel more than a precarious literary stunt is Maine's deft characterizations--the women, in particular, inject the tale with sly resourcefulness and dry wit. The Preservationist is darkly funny and often irreverent, but its timely themes (which address family, faith, and the very meaning of life) pack a deceptively powerful punch."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This novel captured my attention because of the wonderful cover art, one of the best I've seen. Last year, I read the great \\"Life of Pi\\" and enjoyed that story so much, I guess I wanted to read a similar novel...spiritual story of people at sea with a bunch of animals. For anyone who loves \\"The Life of Pi\\", I recommend checking out this novel.I've always had a lot of difficulty with the whole Noah's Ark story, because the idea of ancient man creating a big enough boat to hold two of every species on earth for months (plus the constant feeding and waste removal), that a perfect, all knowing God would become angry enough to kill all of His creation save Noah's family instead of punishing only the guilty, along with the idea of the whole earth under water (which would have to cover the peak of Mount Everest) always seemed a bit far fetched to me. It makes an interesting fictional account and I'm glad that a writer was confident enough to sketch out the details of the Biblical story.What this novel presents is a very interesting character drama, written from different points of view, which I really enjoyed. I found myself liking the women a lot. They were clever thinkers and intelligent, and I especially liked the part about one of them using knowledge of a coming eclipse of the sun to scare a group of thuggish men to follow her lead. The sentences are well crafted and an immense joy to read. My favorite character is Chem, the more independent son of Noe, and the one who struggles the most in his faith, yet dutifully helps in the building of the ark and keeping up the maintenance while they are afloat. He's not a bad guy at all...just doesn't understand what kind of God would do the kind of things to His creation that they all were witness to and saved from.Even when delivered to safety to begin human society anew, God still makes demands of Noe, which can be seen as a test of his faith and devotion. Though a slim read, it is worth one's time and won't take long to finish. When I finished reading it, it made me want to go back to the Biblical account of the great flood. I believe this author has found a unique niche and I would love to see his take on other Bible stories. This novel would make an excellent reading selection in Sunday School, if churches are willing to have their own book reading clubs. There are a few profanities and mentions of procreation...but it's done quite tastefully and shouldn't embarrass even the most sensitive of readers. I recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"David Maine has produced a modern masterpiece in what is one of the best books of the year so far. The Preservationist (or The Flood in the UK) is the story of Noah told from the perspective of his family, who are variously confounded, angered, excited, nervous or just plain stoic about his Holy orders.Maine's strength is his stunning portrayal of the women in Noah's life, viz. his wife & three daughter-in-laws. Clearly Maine loves his women and portrays them as storng characters without whom the men would fall apart ion shambles. And most of us know how true that is at any part of time or place.This is a realistically funny, poignant story told with a great sense of good humour about it, and is bound to be of enormous interest irrespective of whether one is a believer or not. A strong recommendation to anyone interested in literary fiction."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I really loved parts of this book. I loved how the author, David Maine, has us look at this classic biblical tale from several different points of view. We see this tale though the eyes of Noe (Noah), his children, his wife, and his daughter-in-laws. I loved how Bera questions God's will and Ilya declares \\"only a man's god would show love for his creation by destroying it\\". I love how Noe's basically a stubborn old coot, bedding teenage girls in his five hundredth year, bargaining with giants for timber and pitch and acting almost gleeful at those perishing around him as the waters come pouring down. I loved a lot of things about this book, but for some reason I didn't love the book.There are been a lot of attempts at recreating Noah's famous adventure, there was a boring movie, a dreadful mini-series and of course many books. The real trick is taking a story that last but for a few pages in the bible and turning it into an epic. Maine is ultimately successful. He is faithful to the scripture while at the same time a critic. How could a God do this to his creation? is a theme that is addressed through out the book. Noah has faith but his son's wives don't see things in such black and white terms. Maine also reminds us that we dealing with Adam's God...a God that's easily spurn. A God that makes his presence know, a God that strikes others down.For me the biggest problem with this book is that a consistent voice is impossible to hear, this is what makes the book so unique but it also makes it hard to enjoy. I loved the multiple points of view, but I hated what they were doing to the overall story.I recommend \\"The Preservationist\\", it's an excellent complement to the biblical story but for a more fanciful experience about Noah and his Ark I recommend \\"Many Waters\\" by Madeleine L'Engle the final book of the \\"Time Quartet\\" (the Wrinkle in Time Series). It's more fun than \\"Preservationist\\" but its waters aren't as deep."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Noe, at six hundred years old, while out searching for a lost lamb, has been chosen; his God, Yahweh, has come to him in a vision and instructed him to build a boat and to prepare for a deluge.Noe, with his wife, must gather his sons together; the oldest Cham and wife, Ilya, Sem and his wife Bera and the youngest Japheth with Mirn. They must build a very large ark to hold two of every living species that they can collect, store provisions before the rains start and be ready for a very long voyage.This first published novel by David Maine is different. Different is good. Therefore, this book is good. However, it is much more - it is a readable, if not a familiar bible story, told in a very familiar style for the 21st century. To explain his reference material, the author notes that &quot;Quotations are taken from the 1914 printing of the Douay Bible, translated by the English College at Rheims in 1582 and first published at Douay in 1609. All names are spelled as in that edition.&quot;The reader is right there, inside each character's head, as the trials and tribulations unfold. What are these people feeling? Living at such close quarters, young and old, animals, insects, reptiles and humans, they experience many emotions. The author reveals to the reader what he thinks would be overwhelming the immediate family members in this confinement, especially the feelings toward Noe. During the early part of the voyage, Ilya imparts passionate insight in a modern colloquial reflection:&quot;To be honest, when the rain started I was shocked. I had supposed my father-in-law to be something of a crackpot, though admittedly a compelling one. I never expected him to be right.&quot;The morbid conditions of imprisonment in the boat during the deluge &quot;...collecting buckets of dung from the holds&quot; the dangers of firing a cookstove so that &quot;Noe shudders: one solid wave would pitch those coals into the tar...&quot;, the foul air, &quot;...the relentless swinging of the boat...&quot; are the no-holds-barred style of Maine that makes his telling of this story so vivid.Sem is delighted that after six months &quot;Just like that the clouds start shredding, sky showing through. I swear I had forgotten what blue looked like, but there it is. I start crying then. We all do.&quot; The boat settles into mud and silt. Noe ventures out and on his return commands the family set about releasing the cargo. A marvelous and picturesque representation by the author of what happened next:&quot;The animals bolted, a snarling, trumpeting host. Elephants squelched knee-deep in marshy soil; big cats slunk away like sinners; buffalo and wildebeest lumbered off. Giraffes ambled, zebras trotted, wolves darted. Rhinos stepped carefully, shortsightedly, like old people.&quot;How could a reader not be enchanted by Maine's words, believer or not?After a year at their settlement, the human and animal population has thrived and increased; life is good. Noe, while walking in the hills receives another message from Yahweh, his God. Noe is to send his sons and their wives out into the world to explore, settle and populate. The sons and wives have matured and become settled in their ways, but they heed their father's wishes and prepare to leave. Mirn, the wife of Japheth, who was thought to be the immature and brainless one, has obviously grown emotionally and intellectually. She muses and predicts to Japheth:&quot;Of course people will tell something, it was the end of the world after all. A story like that won't be forgotten. But things will get added and left out and confused, until in a little while people won't even know what's true and what's been made up&quot;.Even those of us who are Christian non-believers will be charmed with this telling and with the style of the author David Maine. A small book in size but even the jacket design and cover by Jonathan Bennett is creative and adds to the originality of the presentation and the contents."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"On the surface of it, there's not much to David Maine's novel THE PRESERVATIONIST. After all, most of us probably knew the plot already, right? The animals came two by two, it rained for forty days and forty nights, and there was a rainbow at the end. What else can be said about the oft-told Old Testament tale of Noah's Ark?A whole lot, as it turns out. From the well-known Biblical story, Maine constructs a fully realized novel that not only explores issues of faith, doubt and devotion that arise from the Biblical text itself but also fully examines the effects of crisis on individuals and families.Since the novel's basic story is already familiar to so many readers, much of the book's richness arrives from the way the story is told, through the voices of its many exquisitely drawn characters. There's Noe, of course --- Maine utilizes the spelling of names from the 1609 Duoay Bible. Zealous, stubborn, sometimes barely in control of his mental faculties, the aged man is alternately pitied and feared by his family. Noe's wife also narrates several chapters, and the narrative plays with the fact that the woman is usually nameless in most traditional retellings of the story. Noe's three sons also play key roles, each with his own part to play not only in the construction of the ark but also in the telling of the tale.Surprisingly enough, the heart of Maine's novel lies with Noe's daughters-in-law, who barely receive a mention in most retellings. These women --- strong, industrious and ingenious --- not only take responsibility for collecting the animal species, but also hold the family together through adversity and ensure the perpetuation of the species. Each of these women is an individual, from the fiercely independent northerner Ilya to the powerful but vulnerable African Bera to the childlike but surprisingly insightful Mirn.For ages, people have had a hard time reconciling how Noah's story could contain literal truths. Maine cleverly, sometimes irreverently, addresses many of the criticisms of the story's plausibility. Despite its playfulness, though, the novel possesses a deep respect not only for the Biblical story but also for the faith that underlies it. As Bera narrates, just when the future seems bleakest for the small band of travelers adrift on an endless sea, \\"Hope swamps my throat...I hope the waters will fall back and the plants will somehow, impossibly, sprout green in springtime and life will go on as it did before. Except perhaps with less sin, and more approval from God.\\"Hope, faith and love are the real truths at the center of the Noah's Ark story, and THE PRESERVATIONIST gets right to the heart of those truths.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Rehash the story of Noah and the ark? Why? What writer would tackle such an idea? You have to admire anyone with the courage to make the attempt, but it seems like a disaster waiting to happen. The religious groups are likely to be offended, while the non-religious are sure to turn an apathetic shoulder. Of course, the potential for historical and biblical blunders rises like Mt. Ararat in the mind of any novelist.But Maine is not any novelist; he's a talented wordsmith. \\"The Preservationist\\" walks a tightrope of accuracy and creativity. No, it dances along that tightrope with irreverent--and sometimes poignantly reverent--abandon. Maine breathes color into his settings and life into his characters. He paints Noe's family in realistic hues that leave us catching our breath. We can relate to these people. Their struggles are not unlike our own. They are gritty and real. Through the jaded and flawed character of Noe, God brings about judgment and redemption.Which brings me to the most astounding accomplishment of \\"The Preservationist\\": It never preaches; it never condescends; it surprises and startles; yet somehow it manages to make God's Word seem viable for the questions and struggles of our present age.On top of that, it's one very entertaining read!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Noe and the Flood retold in a completely refreshing way. Powerful language. Short, well-crafted sentences. Gentle humor. Characters you come to know and love. All in a slim book for a long weekend. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"David Maine's first novel is a thought-provoking, fresh twist on one of mankind's oldest stories. As a casual but curious Christian, I was a little apprehensive about picking up a religious book, but I was very pleasantly rewarded. Maine brings Noe [Noah] and his family to real life as a bunch of regular people struggling with day-to-day tasks, responsibilities, and fears while fulfilling their monumental undertaking. The story is not sugarcoated in any way; each character gets a chance to speak through their own chapters complete with uncensored remarks, observations, and musings.This was a quick and easy read, and I find myself hurrying through the pages to find out what happens - even though everyone knows how the story turns out. Maine's storytelling is simple, yet creative and as realistic as it can get for a very unrealistic situation. At some points you can actually visualize the Ark with hundreds of birds perched on its rails, the deck covered in you-know-what. Good book, and even better given that it is the author's first novel!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Restrained but luminescent prose, both bawdy and reverent, a fine novel, but for readers prepared to appreciate it, more than that: a sustained, poignant meditation on the ambiguous lot of the believer. That fact that at certain points Noe knows with certainty that God wants him to do something, and that he responds faithfully to that call, does not exempt him from the common human lot. He knows God's absence as well as he knew God's presence. Each character in this tale exhibits another paradigmatic facet of the human-divine relationship. Could be a good book for a spiritual reading group."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I really enjoyed the fresh perspective on a story as old as time. As a bit of a pragmatist I have always hated how stories like this are canonized without even examining the logic behind them. How did Noah's family get roped into such an incredulous task? What did Noah and his family do with all that animal feces?etc. This book was an interesting way to address the absurdity of some aspects of the story.But what I saw as the most important take home from this book was the fact that no story is ever told without the bias and perspective of the teller and time erodes history in such a way that it can become unrecognizable. Maine reminded me that the true history remains there and no amount of storytelling can compile the facts exactly right. That is why for reviews discussing the damnation of Canaanites need to remember that it may have just been heated words from an embarrased father."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I am just lost of word to describe this book. It is one of the best book I read in my life. Even with the known ending the character building the dialemma and the story development is just extra ordinary"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I found this book a very enjoyable one. Maine portrays Noah as a real person with a real family and real decisions to make. I would recommend this book to anyone who just wants a good read!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"I was a little hesitant to read this book, even though it was recommended by a friend who's a Christian, and has great taste in books. I wondered what more anyone could possibly say about one of my all-time favorite stories: Noah's Ark. Turns out I didn't have to worry at all. David Maine takes all of the characters in this familiar story and makes them REAL. From Noah (who Maine calls Noe) to his three sons Sem, Cham and Japheth (whom you might know as Shem, Ham, and Japheth from a different printing of the Bible than Maine used), the author gives each of the men in the story a distinct personality. But where this book really shines is in David Maine's portrayal of the women. If it's true that behind every great man there stands a great woman, then Noe's wife, and his three daughters-in-law Bera, Ilya, and Mirn (whose names Maine invents) are four of the greatest women in history.I could gush on and on about this book-about how the author amplifies and illuminates the story in the Bible at every turn, but I won't. I'll just say you have to read it and discover the joy for yourself.If you liked The Red Tent, you'll love The Preservationist- but this is different from The Red Tent, because your husband or boyfriend will love it too."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"i would definately reccommend this book. it is well written, has good character development, it is a quick read and quite interesting. i liked how the story is told from each character's point of view. it raises some interesting questions and makes you think, if you feel like it, or you could just sit back and enjoy the story for itself. i know it is fiction, but it is quite plausible, and the subject of noah and the ark is an interesting platform for a story."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Item arrived in excellent condition....the \\"book\\" however was a great disappointment. I only was able to listen to a very little of the first disc because of language and content. I was expecting something totally different than this. Very disappointed in it!"},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"This is honestly one of the worst books I've read all year. You can tell the author probably isn't Jewish OR Christian just by the messed up theology in this book. He also potrays Noah as a abusive husband, Shem as a son who blindly follows his father's faith. He also doesn't understand that God would have kept the animals on the ark alive (he has several animals dying, including a rabbit [which means there would be no rabbits in the world. Rabbits are unclean, therefore there would have been 2 of them. Kill one, there are no rabbits.])It also gets sexually graphic at points, which really doesn't have a place in this book.Overall, if you must read this book, borrow it from a library. It's not worth the paper it's printed on."},{"Title":"The Preservationist","review":"Why not use the names in the common scripture that we are all familiar with . . Noah, Shem, Ham and Canaan. In particular, rather than use the name of Canaan, who was cursed by Noah (implying that all Canaanites were cursed) another name was used. Whether this odd assortment of names (going back to a previous scriptural translation) was done to be cute, or if there was a more sinister reason, it was at the least an annoyance.Another issue that I found disturbing was the painting of Noah as a tyrant to his family. He may have had reverence for the Almighty, but he was shown to be a mean fellow, particularly to his wife. The reason that he and his family were chosen above all others to be survivor of the deluge was not made clear. Noah may not have had a sexual appetite for other women, contrary to others in the story who did, but was that reason enough for him to survive?In Scripture there is no mention of any authority given to Noah to invite others to go with him. He is clearly commanded to take only his wife and children and their wives. But he tells others that if they would have a good heart they would be allowed to come with him. This is another flaw, and a serious one, I believe. Why did Noah assume the sin of pride in showing others that he had the power to bring them along, even if no one took him up on it?This was a poorly thought-out story. It is a fairy tale within a fairy tale, and it just didn't work for me. The facts are not all correct, and the underlying impetus for the entire episode of the flood is not shown clearly. I tend to think that the reasons for writing such a book, changing the names, particularly not acknowledging Canaan and Canaanites as the cursed of Scripture, is more a promotion of a revisionist way of treating the subject, and of treating the Old Testament, than an interesting take on legend. Sunday schools should concentrate on readings from Scripture until something comes along that makes more sense and that is more honest than this attempt."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I've just discovered the Angelique series(reading Angelique in Barbery just this minute) and I cannot believe such a brilliant series is out of print in the USA! Angelique:The Marquise of Angels is the first book of this series, and is about the childhood and first marriage of one of literatures greatest heroines, Angelique. The copy I read was actually an old library copy of it, and it was titled Angelique and combined this book and Road to Versailles as one. The Angelique books are excellent historical fiction and both Golons(Anne and Serge) were born storytellers. The Marquise of Angels is my favorite book of the series so far. Its really brought to life a time period I knew very little about, 1600s France. This book has everything. Intrigue,suspense,romance,action,wonderful historical detail,great and memorable characters, the works. I also love how Golon brings to life historical figures. Theres so many memorable scenes in just this one book, my favorite scene is probably Angelique and the poison(I won't give it away!) Like another reviewer has said, it is definitly a very cool scene. I just can't understand why these books are out of print, they are quality fiction! Theres 63 reviews for this book on Amazon, alot of books that are in print don't get that many! And all of them are positive five star reviews too! I know they did put the first 2 books in print again a few years ago, as special large print editions but alot of people(myself included) don't like large print. If only they would put the whole series out again(regular print) and get the last three books translated, I'd be a happy camper..."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"My Mother grew up in the Netherlands watching the TV series, reading the books, and watching the movies. She loved the series so much that she named me Angelique Michelle. I have also watched the movies and I love them, even though I can't understand them because we have them in French. I have tried finding the novels through our library, but they only have the first book of the series. I wish I could read all of them, but they are so incredibly hard to find. The Angelique books are a great read for anyone looking for an interesting and historical novel. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"My father and I used to fight over who could read the latest Angelique book first when I was 14 and 15. My poor elder sister had to wait her turn after either of us were through. My father and I liked the series so much, we made sure we gave each other Angelique books as birthday dan x-mas presents. I'm Indonesian, and in the late 60s and early 70s imported books were hard to come by. Our family used to buy up indiscriminately any book we found in English. As it is, it's only after I opened Amazon.com that I've found out there were more than nine Angelique books in all. I've read the first seven over and over again, but have never seen \\"The Jesuit Trap\\" nor \\"Gold Beard's Downfall\\". \\"The Marquise of the Angels\\" is positively my most favourite book in all my reading life. Unfortunately, somebody borrowed my copy many, many years ago, and I've never found a replacement. I wrote to Pan Books, I rummage through second-hand book carts wherever I find them, all to no avail. The Angelique character, to my mind, is a proto-feminist. She never yielded to feminine stereotyping, and always did her 'own thing', regardless of society's disapproval. I do believe that her character made a huge impact on myself. The other outstanding book in the series is \\"Angelique and the Sultan\\" in which there are great passages comparing Islamic and western philosophy. In this age of misunderstanding in the west about Islam, I think reprinting this one particular book would be an enormous contribution to the discussion. There are other passages in \\"Angelique in Love\\" quoted by Joffrey de Peyrac which shows diligent research by Serge and Anne Golon on comparative religion, albeit still stilted towards western Christian argument. Nevertheless, seldom since have I come across such a good read which provides me with instant philosophical discourse and a crash course in French history all at the same time. I'm excited to discover that others have found the series as captivating for them as they were for me. I agree that a publisher would do well to have the series reprinted."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"Although romance plays a major role, there is so much more to Angelique's story that to categorize the series as &quot;Romance&quot; does not do it justice. The series is historical fiction at its best. The authors, (husband and wife team of Serge and Ann)succeed in transporting the reader to seventeenth century France by vividly describing the backdrop of our heroine's life from a poverty stricken childhood in Monteloup to triumph at Versailles. Through our heroine, we are introduced to the institutions, intrigue, challenges and joys of the times, including the fabulous court of the Sun King and its many personages.A sincere thank you to the authors for the meticulous research that made this series of novels true classics, and for inspiring generations of young people to pursue further study of that colorful period."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I've read the series 4 times and am now on the fifth, only this time reading it to my husband out loud while we drive. He is as captivated as I and we now look forward to long trips (Hint: this is NOT just a read for gals). I first discovered Angelique in the library 30 years ago. She quite literally saved my life during a very troubled childhood. She remains my greatest role model to this day. Her spiritual growth during the span of the story is sublime, the historical background is fascinating, the scientific and philosophical details are brilliant and meticulously researched. The content was so ahead of it's time, written as it was in the 1950's - timeless. What can I say? These books have changed my life. They are as fresh and exciting with each re-reading as they were the first time. I'm going to take the plunge and learn French just so I can find out what happens after Book 9!

Fortunately, I was able to read the entire series, as it was published in German up until the very last book. The first books, until book 6 or so, I reread about 14 times over the course of approx. 10 years. It became my tradition to read the series at least once a year!The final ending was a bit strange, but nevertheless a positive one. Does anyone need to know how it ended? Write me."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I have discovered that the reason the last three books have not been translated into English is because the author is in a legal battle with the publisher over her authors rights, which has drawn on for 6 years! Her day in court is coming, Oct 4, 1999! There are petitions to be found on the web for support of Anne. As many of us know, these are books in one of the best series ever written, (to my mind). The author is actually writing the final two, now, but has become impoverished because of her legal battle."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I first discovered these books in the late sixties in paperback form published by Bantam Books. I fell in love with Angelique, and have avidly followed her adventures through the first nine books (which I own).

Now I understand that there are more books in the series, which have not been translated into English or published in the US...who do I need to contact to beg for this to be done? Book 9, &quot;Angelique and the Ghosts&quot;, left the readers hanging by a thread as Angelique and Joffrey looked up at the lights of Quebec...what became of them there? I have reread these tattered paperbacks twenty or thirty times, and always feel a sense of loss when the story has no ending. Also, I have noticed that some of the books have apparantly been published under different names...here are the names of the Bantam editions I own... 1. Angelique 2. Angelique and the King 3. Angelique in Barbary 4. Angelique in Revolt 5. Angelique in Love 6. The Countess Angelique 7. The Temptation of Angelique 8. Angelique and the Demon 9.

My paperbacks that I purchased throughout the 1970s are pretty much shot (missing covers, taped together, yellowed pages), which is why I thought to check on [Amazon.com] as have not found these books in stores. Now I know why. I have to add my comment that these books should definitely be re-printed with the final books translated. It is a fantastic historical series of 17th century France. Along with the Dorothy Dunnett series (Lymond and House of Niccolo) the Angelique series is a standout on historical fiction."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I have all the books in Russian.

It has everything one would want in a story: action, adventure, secrets, love, hatred and revenge in the time of Luis XIV. Although the story is far more interesting while Angelique is still in France (the first 5 books), her adventures in America/Canada are also pretty good. Unfortunately, it is impossible to find a new edition in the English language. I am lucky enough to be bilingual and was easily able to find the new editions of the full series (and the movies) in Russian, it has never been out-of-print in that language. However, I would love to reread it in English. The mini-series is also fantastic although it takes some liberty with the written plot and Michele Mercier is the perfect Angelique.

Unquestionably Angelique is the greatest hero ever invented (I say hero because she outshines characters of either sex). She's been compared to Robin Hood, James Bond, Joan of Arc and Scarlett O'Hara, but leaves them all for dead in depth of characterisation, spirit, deeds and everything else. I've read thousands of books and sagas, and the Angelique series is by far the best series of books ever written IMHO - even better than Lord of the Rings, which I've only read 5 times as compared to Angelique's 10 so far. It has everything - adventure, an incredibly strong leading character, pace, plot, romance, death, lust, conflict and historical accuracy. It has inspired me to visit France (and I live in Australia) many times to see the areas where the first five books are based, and I plan to visit Maine and Canada, the scene of books 6 to 10.

Every one of her adventures represents an incarnation that the Soul must go through on its way to God -- its Spiritual Journey.Her travels through the underworld of the Court of Miracles and her struggles to survive and rise from it correspond to the Soul's fall from grace into Matter and its struggles to rise once again into the Spirit.At least in the films, Angelique's hair has a special reddish cast that identifies her as a Mary Magdalene figure, traditionally portrayed in the legends as having flowing red hair.An incarnation of the Sophia, she -- reluctantly at first, and then willingly -- marries and falls in love with her Spirit twin, Joffrey de Peyrac.He, on the other hand, is a type of Christ as the Gnostics saw him: his so-called magic powers, his trumped-up trial, his violent execution and his reappearance later on.Angelique's arch-enemy, King Louis XIV, is an incarnation of the Rex Mundi, the Prince of this World -- a satanic figure in Gnostic myth. He is the Lord and Master of the Material World, the world of darkness and ignorance.Far-fetched as it may seem, this interpretation is perfectly consistent with the Courtly Troubadour background of the Joffrey de Peyrac character. It links him directly to the Cathar Gnostic tradition."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"There is no comparable historical/romantic fictional heroine to the fascinating Angelique de Sance de Monteloup!

It began a love affair for me with 17th Century France and the court of Louis XIV. More than that, a reading journey started for me that still goes on and helped me discover great classics (like those by Dumas &amp; others). I loved Angelique then and do now, 25 years later I still remember those books and the pictures they painted in my mind vividly.

It was followed by many sequels, equally as good. The author is a genius on every level, the characters so memorable you will feel they are real people, the story telling fascinating, never contrived or predictable, just pure magic all the way around! It was after reading this series I became interested in French history, but it's appeal is universal - everyone will be moved to tears and laughter (and everything in between)! I read this book over twenty years ago, and am an avid reader, so when I say this is the best, I don't mean it lightly, and have not read another book in the past twenty years that even comes close!"},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I first read these books in the mid-70's and have periodically returned to them over the years. Every time I pick them up I am surprised that I enjoy them as much now as I did when I was a teenager. A bit of information for those of you who are frustrated with the way the English translation series ends - there are indeed 12 books - only 9 of which have been translated into English. The last three are &quot;Angelique a Quebec&quot;, &quot;Angelique, La Route de l'Espoir&quot;, and &quot;La Victoire de Angelique.&quot; (please excuse any missplling of the French). All of these novels are compelling and, in fact, addictive. So much so that I eventually tracked down #10 and #12 in French and started translating for myself. Unfortunately, although I've tried very hard, I have not been able to find a copy of #11 - La Route de l'Espoir - even in French. Those of you who are French-Canadian (particularly M. Boucher) who say you can still find these books, I would appreciate some help. If you can find a copy of #11 in French, I would be interested in buying it from you. Thanks for your help."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"The first time I came across the Angelique series was pretty much close to 30 years ago. They were my first insight into a sophisticated style of writing I had hitherto not experienced. I was an avid fan of Jean Plaidy and enjoyed the historical context of her books, but found the Golons' Angelique filled not only with a rich content of French history, but realistic adventure a feeling of belonging to the books and a desire, perhaps close to addiction to know more and more and more. The addiction was assuaged by the ongoing series until it came to an abrupt end - at least in the English language. But to return to the Marquise of the Angels and Road to Versailles - from the moment the book starts there is a familiarity and ease of reading that as the characters emerge one feels one has known all about them for a long time. The change in pace from the struggle to survive in the countryside to the outrageous riches of the Comte de Tolouse. In time the intrigues, jealousies and passions of the court which wreak their malevolence to the point where real fright takes over - the prejudices that cause so much heartbreak. Then - sudden death - a woman whose husbands name is tarnished - suddenly becomes a persona non grata - 1984 before Orwell wrote about it. The fall from grace, the depths of despair, the emotions within the alternative court &quot;of miracles&quot; - aptly named - the whole sequence of new characters - then out of the blue the return of Nicholas as Calembredaine - this thread, used by the authors, of resurrecting characters long forgotten is both magical and mischievous. This mischief keeps me crying out for more - for a conclusion! On the strength of this tome nothing would have kept me from not wishing to read on! There is humour and pathos, a real understanding of how things were at the time - in itself an education - much has been written about Louis XIVs court - many intrigues apparent, classical authors like Dumas have woven stories about history - this modern classic takes it several stages further - it is not just story-telling it is a seminar where everyone is involved and pulled along in the wake of sensational believable story-telling. I'm re-reading the whole series now - although the paper is brown and the spines broken to pieces and pages stuck back in - and I can't wait to plunge into this world that I am so familiar with again and again. I am a great respector of the written word and pride myself on keeping my books in excellent condition (wherever possible)and have many favourites but none as sustained as the Angelique series and in particular the introductory book - which if it had not worked as well as it did - would not see us here, today clamouring for more."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I agree that the series is excellent. This definitely sets up the rest of the series, letting you know where she came from.As for why it isn't in print, Anne Golon was able to get back the publishing rights to her work and is in the process of restoring the books back to what she wrote as the translators for the publishing company took great liberties in the translations, even to eliminating characters and plot lines entirely. She is currently looking for a good translator as well as publisher for her restored series since they are written in French."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"Poitou, 1648. Ang&eacute;lique is the daughter of a minor baron (and a very poor one at that). After spending her younger years as a bit of a tomboy, she is eventually married to the fearsome Comte de Peyrac (he dabbles a bit in alchemy and other mysterious doings). It doesn't take long for Ang&eacute;lique to find a man of gold underneath the dross and it's true love forever - that is until some evil baddies plot against Joffrey and...Well, I can't go much further without spoiling, but our heroine finds herself in a battle for her life, as well as the lives as her two sons and she eventually sinks as low as she can get. Can she drag herself out of the underworld and herself back up again? To what lengths she will go to get her greatest desire, a place at Versailles in the Court of Louis XIV? Perhaps that casket with a deadly secret hidden so long ago just might come in handy right about now?Wow, what a ride! Ang&eacute;lique's life is a never ending roller coaster of ups and downs (although many of them do get to be a bit too OTT at times), and the Golons do a nice job of working their characters in with known historical events and people. Despite the rather lurid covers this book has, and yes our intrepid heroine does have a number of lovers, the sex is very understated and left pretty much to the reader's imagination. These books were written before the days of being very PC, and there are some plot turns (especially in book two) that might disturb some of today's more *sensitive* readers. These books are very hard to find at a reasonable price, but do persevere, you never know when you'll have that lucky find at the used book store or hit the jackpot at the swap sites.These books were originally written in French and translated into English. Some editions have been broken up with different titles, so it can be tricky to make sure you have a complete one. The edition I read had about 800 pages, so if you've something that is in the 400 range, you are missing a book between this and the next in the series, Ang&eacute;lique and the King. If you need help sorting them out, there's a very useful website that I will leave the link to in the comments, since they aren't allowed in the review section."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"when this book came out in 1958 the New York Times reviewed it and said it was a masterpiece.

I first read Angelique whenI was 19, after having seen the films on French television.Since then,I have read and re-read the whole series many times. Every time, Ilearnt something new, because Angelique represents life itself, as onereviewer already put it. Depending what age or what situation one isin, the story means something different to you. In fact, the charactermay be fictional within a historical context, but Angelique is acomposite of real women who existed in the 17th century, and it ispossible to draw comfort from reading the whole series. It is the sortof life-story that pulls you up even if you reach rock-bottom. I waslucky enough to read the whole series widely available in France, ofcourse, including La Route de l'Espoir and La Victoire d'Angelique. Ido not wish to give any hints of what goes on in the latest novels. Iam sure someone somewhere is preparing a translation for you Englishspeakers. If not, just learn French! I would gladly translate thebooks myself for you, but you would have to wait for a long time!..."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I only found the Angelique series a few years ago and I love them. This book is the beginning, and it is utterly gripping. The development of the story, the characterisations, the detailed yet fascinating explanation of the history, the way real characters are brought to life and the captivating personality of Angelique not only set up the rest of the series, but make this book a classic in its own right.No wonder this book was made into a film (in fact, 5 films) and also a best-selling play.I read it every year and love it every time"},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I have read these books recently as my mother told me I would enjoy them. The first book was so breath-taking that I had to read the rest, and each was as good as the others. I am only 15, and so this proves that these books can be loved by everyone, but I am impatient to read the final three, and just hope they come out soon as I can't stand the suspense."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"Having just finished my 4th reading of the 9 known translations of the Angelique Series I feel letdown that for me the series had ended. I understand other volumes are available in France, however have never been translated. What do we as avid fans and readers of this series need to do to insure the popularity (sales) will be as strong today as in the 60's and 70's. Angelique possesses all the strength of character and sensuality expected of today's woman. Set in Louis XIV france and the new world the tale of Angelique continues to intrigue and capture my attention since I first read the series in my early 20's. I'm now 55 and wishing for more of the same. READ THESE BOOKS AND DEMAND MORE OF THE SAME QUALITY. TODAY'S ROMANCES CANNOT COMPARE WITH ANGELIQUE."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"This is the beginning of one of the most absorbing, well-written series of historical novels I have ever read. It boggles my mind to think that something of such substance as well as being so vastly entertaining could have been out of print for so long. I am hopeful that the publishers will continue to reissue the rest of the series, including those books in the series that were never translated into English. The Angelique books will appeal to the same set of readers who loved Gone With the Wind, anything by Anya Seton, the books of Diana Gabaldon, the novels of Dorothy Dunnett, and anyone else who has ever reveled in a long absorbing story. Do not miss this book and the ones that follow; you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I am not sure if Marquise of Angels is recent publication or not. My mother read these novels in 1965 when I was only 11. When I turned 21 I decided to read them. I was fascinated, and like other readers became obsessed with the Sun King and researching French history. The books are very accurate with regard to history. The last book I read was Angelique and the Ghosts, published in 1982, I believe. Has there been another. &quot;Angelique and the Road to Versailles seems to be &quot;Angelique and the King&quot;. I would love to read a new installment. Did she ever get out of Canada? and back to France? I have read each book at least 3 times."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I read the Anglelique books many years ago and decided to reread the first book in the series. It was as wonderful as the first time. This book is storytelling at its finest. The reader feels as though they have been transported back in time as Angelique's adventures take her to France at the court of Lous XIV. Betrayal, court intrigues, and everlasting love are the blend that make this a must read novel. Readers of any age will enjoy this book as well as the other 10 books in the series."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I too grew up with Angelique - and have reread the books many times, including just lately - just got back from a trip to France to visit my daughter. I am privileged to own the complete translated in English set, and multiple copies of some - snapped up with joy at a library sale, etc.Upon actually googling Angelique when I came back, I found out that, contrary to my belief, this set of books was actually very well thought of in its day, being on the best seller lists in France and Britian as well as the New York Times for quite a while. It's not till a decade or so after its heyday that it was relegated to Barbara Cartland Land, and lost respect. Several movies were made of it, and according to the reviews, French people think of it the same way we might think of the African Queen - a classic to watch. However, the plot deviated more and more from the story line as the movies went on. I'm not sure I would have liked to see how Joffrey was played, and by whom. Would anybody have really done him correctly according to the picture in my head?So, I have been rereading the books since I've come home, and, in the first book especially, have been remembering Paris. Of course, Angelique never lived, but the authors did their homework. I stood on the square in front of Notre Dame and, along with enjoying the scenery (wow) and pigeons (not), held in mind's eye the picture of the Comte of Toulouse singing there as he was brought to confess. Right across from there is the Hotel Dieu, where she had Cantor. And we knocked around on the Pont Neuf, the banks of the Seine, and the Ile de le Cite and Ile de Louis, where Hortense lived, as well as walking in the corridors of the Louvre and the Tulleries. Did not make it to Versailles or La Rochelle, even though I was pretty close to there. A lot of the suburbs in Paris still have the same names: St. Denis, etc.The one thing I wish is that I had mentioned how much I had enjoyed the books to our French hosts, who would have evidently remembered them in their heyday, in the same way that you'd have to be in a cave not to have heard of the Twilight series. I was still thinking of them in their Harlequin Romance costume, before I came home and did the research. We might have had some interesting discussions!I love the stories, but I think that sometimes the language is a bit stilted, which I am assuming is because of the translation."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I started reading this series in 1959. The research done by the author's husband was so extensive, that I learned a lot about the history of fifteenth century France. I bought the series on E Bay in paperback. I once owned the series in hard bound and lost track ot them over the years. They would be worth a lot of money today.I want to read them again, and that is number one on my \\"Bucket List.\\" I have willed them to my grandaughter. She loves to read and wants to be a writer.I don't let any one borrow these books, as I paid a lot for the set. I have loaned too many books that have never been returned, and these books are really keepers! I have also purchased the DVD. It is in French, with English subtitles.I am still hoping the last four or five books will be translated to English.

I knew the movies from TV, but I always could see only the last ones and never knew, what the first parts had been about. When I saw the book in store, I thought: OK, I have to buy it and finally know the beginning. So I did it and fell in love with Angelique. Since then, I purchased every sequel of this fascinating novel. And after seeing all movies, I was lost for years. Most of my leisure time I lived in 17th century and was a great lady at the Court of Louis XIV. I was decided to see Paris and Versailles and when my dream came true and I visited France, I couldn't do anything but to more fall in love with this country. Angelique had a very big influence on my life - I started do study French (but still know only basic words and sentences) and was interested in everything connected with France. After readind the last book in the series - The Victory of Angelique, I was sad because of end. I re-read the whole serie many times and wanted it to continue. And it seems my another dream will come true - I found out Anne Golon was writting one or two more sequels! I am sorry of English readers not having the last three books, because they are worth it. Is there any way I could help them? PS: If you love Angelique, then you MUST read a book &quot;Catherine&quot; written by Juliette Benzoni, another great French writer. It is the only book better than Angelique."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I remember these books from my teenage years. My friends read them in high school and I swore that one day after college I would too. Well. . .by the time I graduated from my master's program, I'd forgotten about them for the next 20 years. I stumbled onto a website about them earlier this summer while looking for another set of French movies and books. Now I own all nine books that have been translated into English, and like many folks here, am waiting for the other 3 that were published in French to be translated and released in the USA. Meanwhile--what a story! This is epic stuff, chock full of little details about the life and customs of France during the time of King Louis XIV. You can almost hear the tinkle of the wine glasses at Court and smell the stench of the gutters. And what a woman! Angelique is beautiful, enterprising, sassy, spunky, resourceful, and at times laugh-out-loud funny. In fact, in Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell, we learn early in the book that Scarlett's mother was of French ancestry--and those who read about and love both these characters will see many similarities between them. There is a resillience and fighting spirit in both of them that's forged from straight-on dealing with historical and political factors outside their control. Classic, unforgettable, and definitely worth my time:)"},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I first read the Angelique series when I was in high school, 30 years ago.

I can't believe I got rid of them!!!ARGH! Now Angelique is selling for $45! I now have to buy all the books again to reread them.I would compare \\"Angelique\\" to \\"Kristen Lavransdatter\\" by Sigrid Undset. Heroines like these come along once in a generation.The book traces Angelique's story from her childhood in Poitou to her arranged marriage to the horribly disfigured Comte de Peyrac. Her days as a criminal in the Court of Miracles, her time in the tower of Nesle and finally her triumph.The detailed research in these books is mind boggling. It was this book that sparked my interest in Louis XIV and French history. Everything in these books is based on historical facts. In Angelique La Voisin predictes that the King will love Mme de Montespan and Angelique but that he will marry Mme Scarron. This is what actually happened! The poison conspiracy also is historically documented. Sergeanne Golon is not the only author(s) to write about The Court of Miracles. In \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" a large part of the action takes place in the Court of Miracles. If you look at a Michelin guide map of Paris the Court of Miracles is identified on it.For Angelique readers here is a list of her books in chronological order:Angelique (sometimes appears as two books Marquise of the Angels & The Road to Versailles)Angelique and the KingAngelique and the Sultan (Angelique in Barbary)Angelique in RevoltAngelique in LoveThe Countess Angelique (Angelique in the New World)The Temptation of AngeliqueAngelique and the DemonAngelique and the GhostsI am not surprised to see that nearly every single review of this book is 5 stars.

One of the reviewers here states that Anne and Serge are born storytellers but is misinformed: Serge did indeed produce writings, but he was primarily a scientist and he provided invaluable research for earlier Angelique books; their historical accuracy, human insight and fluid yet economical prose were, and remain today, the key to their enormous success. Anne and Serge Golon combined their very different talents but Serge was adamant in crediting the authorship to his wife.

I've read a million books, this one stays with you for years..our favorite...."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I liked the book very much. I want to have the video's from the whole serie on VHS. Hwo can help me."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"This is the first in what I consider the greatest historical fiction series ever written. I have read and reread them all numerous times. Unfortunately the series has been out of print for the greater part of two decades, which is a real shame! At one time they were the most widely read novels in the world, and with good reason. Anne Golon's characterizations are such that the reader feels he truly knows the characters in the books, even the minor ones. To me Angelique is a real historical character, although, in fact, she was a figment of Anne Golon's imagination. I only hope that the publishers continue reproducing this entire great series in addition to translating and publishing the three books which have never been available anywhere in English."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I read this book for the first time over 30 years ago when I was a teenager and I almost passed out from the very graphic descriptions of Angelique's many adventures. Upon recently re-reading this book and some of the others in the series, I found that they are just as fresh and incredibly sensual as they were originally. The descriptions of ordinary life in 17th century France are such that you can see the people, smell the odors of their lives, and quickly immerse yourself in the characters. The character of Angelique is comparable to a Scarlett O'Hara or to Anne Boleyn. She is a thoroughly fleshed out character and such flesh as described is amazing. Beautiful, intelligent, and savvy enough to manage to survive no matter what life throws into her path, she is Woman incarnate. I would have loved to have been able to read these stories in the original French but the translations are outstanding.I can think of no actress, living or dead, who is or could have been worthy of this role had these books been filmed. The character is just too rich, lush, earthy, and larger than life to be captured by someone of this century. It is fitting that she remains forever in the century that she makes come to life."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I agree with all of the previous reviewers Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels is a fantastic read, as is the whole series. I have read and re-read this book over the last 25 years and find it as fresh and entertaining as ever. A real highlight for me is the well crafted background of 17th Century France for teh extrordinary character of Angelique, but she is not so extraordinary to be unbelieveable or unsympathetic. I really consider this is a historical series to compare all others against and I would love to see the books reprinted again. I have most of the series (picked up from 2nd hand shops) but I dont have Angelique and the Sultan and it is very frustrating."},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"I was a teenager when I first read this book. Over the next few years my mother and I would take it in turns of buying the new Angelique Book out and the other would wait impatiently to read it. Unfortunately with travelling I lost all of my Angelique Books and am now trying to get them back from anywhere and everywhere. The books are great and it would be fantastic if they could all be put back into print.

I've read the lot (or at least the ones you can get in English) eight or nine times and I never tire of them.They're brilliantly characterised and written and the story is totally mesmerising them. I can't recommend them highly enough, from this first book right through to the 9th (or 10th, depending on the sountry), 'Angelique and the Ghosts'.The series is one, consistent tale of Angelique's adventures spanning 30 years, 3 continents, and innumerable adventures. Brilliant"},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":". . .I remember first seeing these books when my friends read them in high school. They looked like &quot;bodice rippers&quot; if you looked at the covers that Bantam Publishing Company gave them, and I figured my folks would never let me bring them into the house. Well. . .twenty years later, I rediscovered them via the Internet, and the old adage &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot; definitely applies here. I have found all nine books that made it into English before going out of print, and am halfway through Number 6 in the series (Countess Angelique). You will learn about French history, mining, chemistry, and later in the series, sailing and settling in the New World during the early days of America's colonization. The research, care, and love that Serge and Anne Golon put into these books shows on every page.&quot;Angelique: Marquise of the Angels&quot; is the one that started it all. It's worth the price of the book just to read the wonderful chapter where she and her husband--who were not in love when they entered their arranged marriage--discover that love has found them and they finally become a married couple in every sense of the word. (Is it hot in here, or is it just me?)Throughout all her adventures, Angelique is sometimes up, sometimes down, but she's never ever out of the game. Like Scarlett O'Hara and Timex watches, she &quot;takes a licking and keeps on ticking.&quot; Now, if we could just get those last three books translated into English. . .:)"},{"Title":"Angelique: The Marquise of the Angels","review":"...Once you begin to read it you cannot stop until you read the last word...or the last book...I must have read this serie of books at least 10 times, and they are still wonderful!...These books were so popular that 5 movies were made in France...

When I was in France 11 years ago we went to Versailles to have a look at the beautiful royal palace. I was lost for words...wonderful paintings on walls and the ceilings, I almost expected to see Philip Belliere come out from somewhere on his red hilled shoes!!!! and courtesied.

Old enough to be riverted by the romance, young enough to still get more and more out of them as I grew up and bothered to find out more about the period for myself.They are well written, and don't seem to have suffered by translation into English. The stories cross years, and continents, and the characters change enough to hold a reader's interest, while remaining still visibly 'themselves'. Well worth anyone's time!"},{"Title":"Warmaking and American Democracy: The Struggle Over Military Strategy, 1700 to the Present (Modern War Studies)","review":"From my review of this work published in the Naval War College Review, Spring 2000:Warmaking-the pursuit of political objectives by military means- ineluctably involves trade-offs not only in determining appropriate goals but also in determining the means by which they may be best pursued. While recent military action in Kosovo highlights the truth of this statement, the struggle to achieve a coherent military policy is not simply a contemporary problem for this nation. In this work, Michael D. Pearlman, a historian and associate professor at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College, traces this problem from the pre-Revolutionary colonial wars through to the present, providing a comprehensive survey not only of America's wars but of the continual push and pull between the practitioners of military art and the politicians who direct them. In doing so, Pearlman demonstrates the difficulties faced by a pluralistic democracy in obtaining a consensus on either the most effective means for fighting a war or on justifiable ends of the wars being fought. While pursuing an explanation of the sources of these difficulties, he also illuminates a warmaking goal that is perhaps peculiar to America-that of fighting in order to banish doubts that a democracy can win its wars.The timeliness of this work can not be overlooked. It sheds light on the recent debates on the use of force in Kosovo, as well as on the general discussion about the effectiveness of the application of military power in the pursuit of limited political goals, by opening up new avenues of understanding into the formation and execution of military policy. Written in a highly readable style that eschews both political science jargon and \\"military-speak,\\" this work is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of anyone interested in seeing how strategy has been determined in the actual rather than the abstract/theoretical world. It is essential reading for those who would understand the why of military strategy as well as the what."},{"Title":"Warmaking and American Democracy: The Struggle Over Military Strategy, 1700 to the Present (Modern War Studies)","review":"This book is original, well written and well researched. It tells the story of how domestic political decisions have affected American war-making since the Revolution. It must be read by anyone who is interested in defense, politics or history. Engagingly written with eye-opening revelations on each page, this book is one of the few books on any subject which can truly be said to be indispensible."},{"Title":"Warmaking and American Democracy: The Struggle Over Military Strategy, 1700 to the Present (Modern War Studies)","review":"This is a splendid and original book. It examines the faultline between military strategy and political considerations. It is an engagingly written product of a superb and fairminded thinker and thorough researcher. No matter how much you have read about military history, you are guaranteed to learn many new things. I have two faults with it - both major, but localized: first, in his analysis of WWII, he does not discuss the allocation of resources enough. Joel Davidson showed how we ended the war with a larger Navy and a smaller Army than we should have had, largely because of FDR's Navy bias, Adm. King's aggressiveness and Gen. Marshall's willingness to back down, even when he was right. I would have liked to see Mr. Pearlman direct his considerable talents to this subject. The second failing is somewhat perplexing: the author's willingness to accept the argument of a handful of JFK partisans that JFK wanted to abandon South Vietnam after the 1964 election. The only sources for this canard are a handful of intensely loyal Kennedy insiders who made these claims only after the war had become unpopular. If there were any truth to these claims, they would have surfaced when these same people were in counsels of war with the reluctant hawk, Lyndon Johnson. I'm not saying that these people are liars exactly, but that they so wanted JFK to have done the popular thing, that they created these conversations in their subconscious and came to believe them as gospel. Recent studies suggest that JFK ordered the coup against Diem because Diem was talking to Ho Che Minh; surely JFK would have let that continue if he planned to pull out. At any rate, once he had had the CIA depose Diem and completely disrupt the established government of an ally, there was no way he could bail out. Forget getting Bobby elected, there were too many people committed to Vietnam and who were privy to the coup to let JFK pull such a stunt without facing an impeachment. Despite these two shortcomings, this is one of the best works of military history that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Warmaking and American Democracy: The Struggle Over Military Strategy, 1700 to the Present (Modern War Studies)","review":"What a great look at our nations wars from the political perspective.

Included in each chapter is a brief discussion of the sabbat's history, symbolism, recipes, suggested traditions to incorporate into the holidays to personalize them, charms, and rituals.I found the book to be well written, with some interesting pieces of information on the reasons for the symbolism used by modern pagans. If you have read extensively on the basics of the craft and the sabbats, it may prove to be too basic. I would suggest this book for someone who is new to the craft (novice) or just seeking information before deciding upon a path. This book does appeal to those seeking a very natural path, usually referred to as a 'kitchen witch' or 'hedge witch'.Over all a good resource book for basic reference and information."},{"Title":"Ancient ways: Reclaiming pagan traditions (Llewellyn's practical magick series)","review":"I got my first copy of this nearly twenty years ago.

Instead, I sat down and read it cover to cover, enjoying every section, and leaving the book with a feeling like I'd just undergone a guided meditation on the wheel of the year.This book is a valuable resource for all of us who have learned only the basics and the typical rituals associated with the wheel of the year and the major Sabbats, and wonderful for anyone looking for new ideas to make their sabbats fresh again.

For those lacking in funds or resourcefulness, this gives them an opportunity to start their own traditions using the crafts, recipes, and decorating ideas contained within. One problem, however...I felt that perhaps when discussing the various crafts they should perhaps offset them from the rest of the page so that one could see where they mentioned one. I've spent many an hour searching through pages trying to find the paragraph (and they all look the same) that begins the recipe for pumpkin bread, or straw weaving.

The book has no sections, headings, formatting or any other way to quickly reference or distinguish anything. It is not a calendar nor has correspondences, it's mostly history and background, which is great if not for the lousy presentation style: it is written in a rambling narrative style (think: long novel) that takes forever read through and is frusterating to muddle through when you know what you want but can't find it. There are no dates listed for the holidays, so either you have to already know them or find another way to know what day each chapter is talking about. Also, the craft ideas seem to be geared towards those who live in the country and have lots of time and/or ready access to many of the supplies us city-dwellers don't. Just be warned of these things if you order it.

It is obvious that the book was written by someone who deeply loves the traditions of Paganism and wished to share that with the rest of us. I recommend this book, but not for the casual reader or for &quot;newbies&quot; because of its rambling style. The book does lack some specifics of dates when the Sabbats occur.

It has a very conversational voice, and you can tell the author feels deeply about the subject matter. Still, if you are trying to learn about the traditional holidays, you should not use this as your only text.

I want to let you know what a fantastic book this is. I just completed an entire office consisting of 10' desk with 2 sitting areas, a computer caddy, dual lateral file cabinets, two banks of drawers (5 drawers each), upper shelves above the file cabinets (hutch), dual printer cabinet and narrow shelves with lucite inserts. I have to say, it is beautiful. Now, for the best part. I had never touched a piece of wood in my life. I had not done any wood work at all. None, nada, zip.After getting bids for my office in the 12K TO 13K range, I dediced to get some books to see if I could do it myself. I ordered The Custom Home Office: Building a Complete Workspaceby Niall Barrett along with 2 Danny Proulx books as well as others (6 total). I read everything and decided that I could do this. When I acutally got involved with the planning and design, it was Niall Barrett's book that lead me through. I used his book exclusively throughout. I purchased the tools he recommended, even my own table saw. I spent $1000 on tools and about $1500 on materials for a saving of nearly $10,000!!!If anyone wants to see pictures of my office just to verify, you may email me at reidfinancial@cox.net.To all other gals out there considering something like this....GO FOR IT!"},{"Title":"Building the Custom Home Office: Projects for the Complete Home Work Space","review":"The book does a great job of covering both ergonomics and the furniture building side of things. It includes plans for desk cabinets, book shelves, and desks that are actually sturdy enough to support a real monitor. We're still building out our home office, using the book, and have run into only a few frustrations.It only falls short in a few ways. The worst problem is that some of the hardware that's needed is hard to find. The duplex hinges that are used for the cabinet doors are rare, and need to be mail-ordered from no-name specialty shops. It would have been helpful to have either had a web companion where you could buy the products, or to have had alternate plans showing more common alternatives, instead of using something that he's in love with.I also would have liked to see, for each project, a cutting plan. Cutting plans were only supplied for the file cabinet and the bookshelves. Since we tend to get our wood rough-cut at the lumber yard, it helps to have something we can print out. It would also have been good for each project to have a list of the tools needed."},{"Title":"Building the Custom Home Office: Projects for the Complete Home Work Space","review":"This book is a great book for designing and building a home office solution. The cabinetry he builds in this book is what most people call European (or frameless) cabinetry. All the units are cut from plywood and edgebanded. The top and sides of the desk unit he builds are of a torsion box type construction. This is completely strong and imparts a modern, minimalist look. I like the way he used modern mounting hardware for the computer and desk drawer which elminates some of the more complicated parts of building a desk. One reviewer had problems getting the 32mm hinges: both Rockler and Woodcraft, among others, carry these products.I am still in the planning stage with regards to my office, but I have built both frameless and face-frame cabinetry around my house and I have this to say: the pitfalls with European-style cabinetry is that the measurements have to be much more precise when building your cabinets because there is no way to dress up the edges. Also, unless your walls are completely flat and plum, there will be gaps where the units meet the walls (a good portion of this is solved in his design by developing that space as a place to put cords). This is no biggie, but if you want to use more traditional-style, built-in cabinets, I would suggest getting both Taunton's Workspace Idea Book and Jim Tolpin's Building Traditional Kitchen Cabinets (which you can adapt easily to office cabinetry)."},{"Title":"Building the Custom Home Office: Projects for the Complete Home Work Space","review":"I used this to build my custom workspace after checking around for prices on commercial office cabinets.

As others have said, I bought ALL the tools, all the materials, had a great time and saved a bundle. And, best of all the sense of accomplishment and knowing that I have a unique layout with features you couldn't get with prebuilt cabinets.I even modified my design to fasten my cabinets to the wall and created a 9' formica countertop with a rounded corner (and my own matching custom design rounded shelf unit underneath) to create my dream space to mount my 27\\" TV / PC monitor above.Doing it myself let me design unique features in such as where I wanted cords to come up through the countertop and even a shelf in a cabinet that didn't extend all the way to the back to allow cords to pass freely between the two shelf levels. Definitely pre-think every detail of how you'll use the cabinets and you can build in lots of custom touches.I highly recommend the book and have received numerous compliments on my work, AND, this was my first go at building cabinets.

I have avoided the need for 911 and was better prepared for the times that professional help was needed and arrived. While you are in an emergency situation you may not be thinking quiet clearly. The index has been put together for this type situation. Before you find yourself in an emergency this book will get you familiar with knowledge you will need to assists your family, camping friends and others. The first section is for those that are not familiar with homeopathy. The next section is on how to examine a person. The information in this section will assist you in determining if the situation potentially life threatening and you'll be able to give valuable information to the paramedics. Here you'll learn great tips like pressing on a persons finger nailbed and watching for the color to come back in as an indication of shock. The next section is an alphabetical listing of emergencies. There are definitions so you have confirmation that yes this is the situation you are dealing with. The signs, symptoms and indicators are clearly presented and treatment for the situation are given clearly in numerical order. The homeopathic remedies that are listed here are found in the next section which is a Materia Medica . The Materia Medica is also clear and concise, reading about the different remedies you will have everything you need to decide on the right remedy for the situation.The glossary and the appendices are helpful in finding just about everything you'll need to further your studies in homeopathy.

Rather, it represents an attempt to explore, without succumbing to the two dominant stereotypes of \`Islamic fundamentalism' and \`multi-ethnic Bosnia', how and why a war that began as a defence of Bosnia ended as a Bosniak struggle for survival... In his introduction to Hoare's book Brendan Simms, author of the best analysis published thus far of British diplomacy regarding the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, says that he wishes he had been in a position to consult the work when writing his own. Hoare's approach to Bosnia differs from that of participants in, or witnesses of, the events that he covers; but his advantage lies in the fact that, being neither, he is not a prisoner of memories. The idea that the war should end without a victory was certainly not Bosnian, but his book explains the circumstances that led it to be accepted at the very point when the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was poised to win the war, leading to the surprising conclusion of the war ending in neither victory nor defeat. His research is important for all those who in their different ways are involved with Bosnia, but it is only a Bosnian translation of the work that will permit a critical reading of it, by counterposing the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina's own image of itself with that reconstructed by the British historian.Gordana Knezevic"},{"Title":"How Bosnia Armed : The Birth and Rise of the Bosnian Army","review":"I am not sure if the NATO-loving interventionist party has a propaganda arm or perhaps funding the propaganda tools is done more discretely and I have no time to check the author's revenue streams. It's quite possible even though not too likely that the book was committed out of the kindness of heart of a naive do-goodist unknowingly serving imperial masters but whatever is... is.The actual 'facts' are that the so-called NATO, after being made irellevant by the Soviet Union dissolution needed 'something' to keep militarism alive and it turns out that Yugoslavia was it. Note that no one ever thought of, let's say, intervening in the Palestinians case and bomb their overlords into submission the same way huge propagandist armies are screaming over Iran's possibly attaining the 'capability' of mastering the 80 year old 'nuclear cycle' technology while there's not a peep concerning let's say the Jewish state's actually stockpiling hundreds of nukes. Iran 'must' submit to the most intrusive inspections or face sustained bombing, assassinations and crippling cyber attacks because it 'might have' thought about building nukes but dare to suggest that the Jewish state allow inspectors into their own nuclear facilities and the propaganda death squads would swarm in for the kill.But let's not digress. Yugoslavia used to be a peaceful, relatively happy and prosperous country until NATO set to take it apart. During War World 2, Serb 'partisans' fought the Germans to a standstill and were known for sheltering downed American pilots. After the war while turning 'socialist' because most of the partisans were people of the left, Yugoslavia refused to align itself with the Soviet block and stay proudly independent, out of the Warsaw pact, its people free to travel abroad and its economy leaning more toward West than the Russian block. Life was good and it stayed that way until the communist block collapsed. Then... mission Yugo destruction was launched and propaganda barrages were quickly followed by bombs dropping. Facing the powerful 20-something nations armies Yugoslavia never had a chance.The author seems to be one of the post-kill bottom-feeding propagandists who make a living feeding on whatever decaying meat may be still left sticking to the bones.Good work.

One of the best writers I believe in anything associated with maritime and naval stories.This story has only a few elements to work with but creates a great light read. The story is so good there is no need for any major complex twists, turns or tricks making it very digestible. A welcome read if you have just spent the last few books in heavy intense thrillers or of the like.The writer obviously knew what they were talking about as some of the details are not only incredibly interesting, but also incredible at creating suspense. The details do not bore you at all and treats you like you are intelligent enough to understand what is being said, which is a massive relief from the spoon feeding of other writers.The book is a well written breath of fresh air. Like tea on the porch in the fall. lol."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"Seen the movie, now read the book. This is an adventure tale about Charlie Allnutt and Rose Sayer set in WWI and was written by C.S.Forester in 1935. The book has been over shadowed by the 1951 film which starred Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. The book stands on its own as a classic and centres on the relationship between the unlikely match of Charlie and Rose with the war as a backdrop. Charlie is a gin loving engineer and Rose is a religious missionary who manages to convince Charlie to take his rickety old boat, The African Queen, down a treacherous river to destroy a German gunboat patrolling the lake at the end of the river. The inter play between the two characters is developed beautifully as they influence each other to form a formidable team. Forester may have meant it to be many things, but to me it is a great love story. Two people who shine in the presence of each other. The novel is relatively short and keeps the suspense and sense of adventure high throughout. The ending of the book turns out to be more realistic and poignant than the film and just by reading it you will appreciate the brilliance of Bogart and Hepburn even more."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"I really loved the movie, but just want to warn you that the last part of the book is wildly different than the movie, and pretty much of a bummer....... Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"Rose Sayer, bent on avenging the death of her English missionary brother, enlists, or drafts, the cockney Charlie Allnut, captain of the steam launch Afican Queen, down a mighty river in 'German Central Africa', to enter \\"Lake Wittelsbach\\" and there, with makeshift torpedoes, sink the Konigin Luise, the German Navy steamer that then controls the lake for the Germans in 1914.Thanks to John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, everyone is familiar with the titular film, which is virtually the only cinematic representation of the East African Campaign of 1914-18. Stretching himself, CS Forester rises above his usual stock characterization in filling out the figures of Allnut and Rose, the latter being somewhat (and thankfully) more attractive than Katherine Hepburn. He really excels at describing, in an engaging way, the exhausting journey down the 'Ulanga/Bora' river, with all its attendant perils - heat, crocodiles, mosquitoes, hippos, leaches, etc. This is 'Heart of Darkness' but written in such a way that you can and want to finish the book.Once the African Queen reaches the Lake, there to confront the German gunboat, history intrudes. It is also at this point that the film, wisely, diverges. Without naming the actual participants, Forester introduces the fascinating story of the real-life Royal Navy expedition that, through incredible exertion, crossed Africa with 2 motor gun boats and fought the Germans for naval supremacy on Lake Tangayika in 1915. CS Forester's conclusion to this story, after effectively building tension and also spinning quite a nice little romance between his two heroes, is distinctly anti-climatic. Forester also includes several minor historical inaccuracies, such as the Germans arming their native troops with Martini rifles, and that these same native troops were rather dimwitted and rather cowardly. Given that the Germans, only a few hundred strong, fought a successful guerrilla campaign in WWI East Africa with only about 7,000 native troops, puts the lie to Forester's account, even if fiction.Michael Kitchen does a fine job in narrating this tale."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"The first C. S. Forester novels I ever read were the eleven volumes comprising the Hornblower series of nautical adventures in the British navy. Years before encountering those, which, by the way, are superb reading and far better written than the Aubrey/Maturin maritime novels of Patrick O'Brian, perhaps their closest competitors in readers' affections, I saw a movie entitled \\"The African Queen.\\" I was far too young then to know or care about the inspiration behind that 1951 film and was not even acquainted with the novels of C. S. Forester. That film must have made quite an impression, though, for, decades later, I can still hear the throbbing of the steam engine driving the Queen down the Ulanga and Bora River, so, when I chanced to encounter Forester's novel, there was nothing else to do but dive into it.The story line in THE AFRICAN QUEEN rushes along even faster than do the plots of the Hornblower novels. The story, set in Africa at the beginning of World War I, is replete with deathly disease, conquering Nazis, and never-ending derring-do amidst cataracts and rapids plunging down boulder-strewn canyons toward huge Lake Wittelsbach, whose waters are patrolled by the Konigin Luise mounting the Nazi iron cross flag. Oh yes, we mustn't ignore the love element that evolves between the spinsterish, virginal Rose Sayer, steeped in her brother's missionary zeal and stern religiosity, and her companion, Charlie Allnutt, a cockney with a highly questionable past. Primarily, however, this begins and remains an adventure story, and there's just enough love element to spice things up a bit.The novel is not without its flaws. There are undoubtedly critics who take it to task for the ease with which Rose loses her austere countenance (not to mention her virginity), given her strict, traditional upbringing and her circumscribed life. Her assuming almost instant command of the steamboat, her fanatical self-imposed mission, and her sheer strength of mind and unwavering determination appear too atypical for someone of her background. For our other protagonist, Allnutt, his ability to repair or cobble together everything the couple come to need as they careen down the racing Alanga or laboriously pull their boat across the stagnant delta of the Bora is nothing short of phenomenal. The reader's credulousness is sorely tested when Forester has Allnutt create a workable forge on the banks of the river and repair a kinked drive shaft and a broken propeller in the middle of the jungle.Still, this is adventure fiction, and the reader must not be overly critical of characters who find themselves in dire straits with only their imagination and ingenuity (or at least with the imagination of the author who created them) to succor themselves. I dare say that THE AFRICAN QUEEN, written in 1935, has yet to be bested by any more recent adventure stories--equaled perhaps, but not bested. The book is a very fast read and is not easy to lay aside, and I feel that any reader, from adolescent to antiquarian, who enjoys the vicarious mystery, challenge and excitement of a fine adventure story will not find THE AFRICAN QUEEN lacking.And just who is the real African Queen, the steamboat or Rose Sayer?"},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"A Great read.

Nevertheless, it's an inspiring tale of courage, intelligence, and mutual respect. Each makes the other a better person."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"First off, I want to say I wholly agree with the other two star reviewer.The basic set up:Missionary Rose Sayer is left high and dry after the Germans kill the villagers and her brother Samuel. Cockney boat owner Charley Allnut lets her ride along with him on his creaky old boat and Rose gets the brilliant idea to use the explosives on the boat to torpedo the K&ouml;nigin Luise and convinces Allnut to go along with it. Why he goes along with this is any one's best guess (I was sure scratching my head over it). But to get to that point, they must travel the river, avoiding the Germans and their guns, shoot rapids that no one has ever shot before to reach the lake where they will find their target.Shooting dangerous rapids in a creaky boat, being fired upon by evil German soldiers and risking all to strike a blow for freedom and Britain. Wow, that should be even better as a book, right? Not. Boring, boring, boring.I just never bought into the relationship that develops between Rose and Charlie, nor could I fathom why he'd merrily follow along on her cockamamie plan to blow up the Germans. How a sheltered on-the-shelf missionary managed to learn how to hold the tiller and guide them through rapids like no one has done before them really stretched the credulity meter, but even worse is how it all ends once they reach the lake and the K&ouml;nigin Luise. I won't spoil, but if you're expecting a big bang like in the movie, think again - it's a snoozer, albeit a mercifully short one. This was so dull it almost put me to sleep on the treadmill, and I only finished as it was I needed an Africa book for a reading challenge. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"The lady has the will, and the cockney has the ingenuity.

The movie may have won an academy award but the book comes up short. More of a novella, or screenplay than a book. The author could have doubled the text and it may well have been a good book. I appreciate the drama of the two people pulled from separate worlds that are changed dramatically by unfolding events and raise themselves to previously unimagined feats of character and bravery. Still, it was a wasted effort, two little to hang it all on and a pointless ending."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"Forester's novel appears to be a fairly straightforward adventure tale, set in German Central Africa during WWI. Rose is the sister of an English missionary, who dies at the beginning of the novel after the Germans have driven off his &quot;flock.&quot; She is picked up by Allnutt, a Cockney mechanic who works for a Belgian mine, running supplies up the river in the flat-bottomed &quot;African Queen.&quot; He's basically a coward who will follow the path of least resistance, and so allows himself to be browbeat into a harebrained scheme by Rose. She intends to pilot the boat down river, through rapids that are generally agreed-upon to be unnavigable by a boat like the &quot;African Queen,&quot; and onto a lake the Germans dominate thanks to a giant gunboat. There, they will rig some explosives Allnutt has on board and ram the ship, blowing it--and themselves--up, thus striking &quot;a blow for England&quot; and avenging Rose's brother's death. Depending on how you read it, this is either the stuff of great derring-do, or a critique on the futility of heroism in WWI. As an adventure tale, the characters are rather too flat. Allnutt is drawn as too pliable a character, especially for one who has somehow ended up running a boat in the middle of Africa. Rose somehow becomes an expert pilot in a matter of a week, managing to master the nuances of a creaky and unwieldy vessel in extreme poor conditions. Along the way she sheds her proper upbringing and godfearedness with rather unlikely alacrity (unless, that is, Forester was trying to say that such beliefs are rather ephemeral anyway). Their love affair more or less works in the context of the adventure they're on, but it's very hard to imagine it continuing in the outside world. The ending is somewhat more interesting, foreshadowing some of the bleakness of Pierre Boulle's novel Bridge on the River Kwai."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"I was shocked to learn how bad this book really is. The title is so beloved by many as the Bogart/Hepburn classic, and one would expect the book to not only match the Hollywood translation but to dwarf it with typical literary superiority. Not so. The basic plot itself is brilliant enough in its simplicity: two unlikely characters (the archetypical Cockney grease monkey and the chaste maiden) have an adventurous float down an untamed river on a cocked-up mission to sink a German gunship. Ok so far. What Forester does with this promising seed is ridiculous and leaves the reader wondering whether this was all just a vehicle for Forester to deliver a little saucy \\"maiden-missionary-loses-her-virginity\\" stuff mixed in with his clearly evident views that missionaries are idiots. Forester's story is outrageous on all levels. From the timely and chance first meeting between Rose and Allnut, to the mere minutes that it took for Rose to hatch her ignorant plot to sink a German warship, to Allnut's agreement to participate, to the absurd success of the journey, to the ridiculous \\"Cockney ingenuity\\" with which Allnut fashions a propeller out of a coconut or some such stunt, Forester lays a number of eggs. The creme de la creme is Rose's glorious fall from grace. This whole angle of the book borders on soft porn, at least by 1930's standards. Are we to believe that this apparently devout missionary woman has maintained her purity for all these years just to give it all to this unbathed louse? Forester clearly delighted in this stuff: at one point, he actually describes Rose's 'chests' as literally levitating with her newfound vigor and energy - having replaced her former existence of Christian bondage with a new life of unbridled jungle boogie. Come on. Last criticism, with a SPOILER ALERT: the movie's ending is much better than the novel's. Whereas the movie made the boat (the very namesake of the book) into one of the main characters that ultimately sunk the German gunboat, Forester sinks the Afican Queen early and unceremoniously, and then takes the reader through an irrelevant account of Belgian naval manuevers and German military justice. Anyway, I've written enough: stick to the movie."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"C S Forester knew his business. He knew a plausible method of turning an old river steamer into a torpedo, he knew the hellish consequences of losing a prop blade, of mooring in a mangrove swamp, of finding still water in a rapid.. And as he has proven so many times in the Hornblower novels, he knows the way of knaves and gentleman... This is a book for any age."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"There is really not much to say except that the Hollywood movie is not really very much like the book. (Why does this not suprise me?) The story and the characters are much more human, possibly because they are not &quot;Katharine H. and Boogie&quot; and this is not Hollywood. The thundering falls, the hunger,the heat, the gloomy swamps, the smother lake of water lillies, the endless toil and hours...and then, in the end, to see their mission fail. As heart breaking and riviting as any book ever writen."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"Some authors have the gift of putting words together in a way that entertains and enthralls the reader. C. S. Forester is one of the best. When Forester tells a story, the reader feels personally involved. We feel like we know the characters in a personal, intense way. If you have read Forester's Hornblower novels, you have read Forester at his best. The African Queen was made into a memorable movie starring Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. The book is more intense, darker, and far less triumphant than the movie. If you thrill to the successes of Horatio Hornblower in Forester's navel novels, you might find African Queen a little depressing at times. If you like depressing novels (and apparently many readers do) you might give this book five stars. The story is set during World War I and involves the attempt by a missionary lady and an alcoholic English boatman to travel down a river in Africa to do battle with the Germans. The interaction between the characters and the river creates a riveting story. Like Hemingway, &quot;I recommend Forester...&quot;"},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"I will not reveal the ending; I will say only that it does not end with the German captain of the Louisa marrying the protagonists just as the ship impales itself on the overturned African Queen's torpedoes. C. S. Forester's ending requires less suspension of disbelief, less \\"deus ex machina.\\" Throughout the voyage of refugees Rose Sayer and Mr. Allnutt down the Ulanga and Bora Rivers in German Central Africa at the outbreak of war, the reader is treated to C. S. Forester's literal, high resolution realism. Forester would not have felt the need to depart from that realism to enhance the final drama. Forester reveals the characters of protagonists Rosie and Allnutt as successive adversities beset them on their voyage. Their steam launch, The African Queen, is their vessel in both senses of the word: if course it is their boat, but it also represents a container in which the protagonists' spirits are blended in a purposeful collaboration. it is a touching human drama, and the realism is such that the reader's ears ring unceasingly with the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"Throughout most of the book, I found myself thinking, \\"This is one case where I like the movie better.\\" Although the plot for the first 3/4 of the book is the same as the movie's, the characterization is a bit different. For example, the movie portrays Rose as a determind, principled, yet prim woman who slowly learns to love; in the book, she comes across as a bit immature, supposedly the result of being repressed by men her entire life, and is so thrilled with the freedom earned by her brother's recent death that she decides to kamikaze a German boat. Personally, I found the movie's Rose more realistic and likeable; the book's Rose felt too much like a poster child of feminist propoganda.In general, most of the novel is a bit heavy-handed is describing the character's motives, characters, and thought processes, and leaves very little to the imagination. Subtlety, apparently, is not Forester's strong point.The only thing keeping me from giving this book a lower rating is the ending. Forester truly redeems himself in my eyes with the ending, which is far darker and more realistic than the movie's. The ending calls into question everythng that you assumed that Forester was trying to tell you -- all the notions of heroism, patriotism, and true love. The last line is probably one of my favorite of all last lines,(Spoiler space)forcing you to ask yourself: Are Charlie and Rose truly soulmates, or has an extreme situation simply brought them together and instigated passion? While in the movie it is clear that Charlie and Rose truly love another, the book suggests that their \\"love\\" may simply be due to the arousal that arises during a near-death situation. For me, this very human, bittersweet ending enabled me to forgive Forester for his earlier heavy-handed treatment of the characters."},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"When her village in German Central Africa is destroyed at the start of WWI, a missionary is rescued by a gin-loving river miner.

The first 80 percent of the movie and the book are mostly similar. The endings are quite different. I slightly prefer the movie's improbable ending, although the endings of both have serious flaws.Reading the first 80 percent of the book is a joy after having seen the movie. If you are like me, you will see and hear the movie in your mind as you read the book.In the first 80 percent of the book, you will find more in the book than in the movie. C.S. Forester is able to tackle interesting themes in the book that were too delicate for Hollywood. Also, he employs an amazing mastery of the technical details in describing the African Queen's voyage down the Ulanga and Bora rivers into Lake Victoria. You will almost feel like you are reading science fiction from the time of H.G. Wells, as Allnut and Rose keep making something out of nothing.To me, the best part of the book is that the contrasts between the &quot;civilized&quot; conventions and the &quot;natural&quot; instincts are drawn in extreme and fine detail. It will make you re-examine how you think about what is the right thing to do in your own life, which is what good literature should do.To me, the weakness of the book is that the attitudes that The African Queen challenges are very far removed from our experience today. What was very scathing then now seems quaint. Somehow, the outrage behind the story is diffused into a dreamy period piece. Are there many women now of 33 who are so completely dominated by their brothers that they do not lead their own lives? Would many people today be inflamed by love of country to want to strike a personally fatal blow against the oppressor against all odds? Does the arrogance of colonialism seem believable, or just a silly notion to caricature?Ultimately, Rose's instant rise from docile creature to Wonder Woman does seem to strain credibility. It's inspiring fun, though, like any book about brave heroines who are undaunted by the odds and convention.After you read this book, think about where your assumptions about what you should be doing have not been re-examined by you in a while.

What should you be doing because you think it is a good idea?Take the initiative to do the right thing with full speed ahead!"},{"Title":"The African Queen (Bantam Book)","review":"&quot;The African Queen&quot; is a very decent classic which I enjoyed very much.

I felt like Charlie and Rose, having escaped the lilies or the mangroves... Here is an author who knows when description is called for and when action must take the lead; when relationships must be built, and when the setting needs a nod. And Forrester does it so well. What a delight.\\"The African Queen\\" is a road trip, where a cockney steam engineer and a British missionary's sister take a boat down a fictitious river, over countless literary waterfalls and onto a make believe lake with a gunboat that never existed; along the way, necessity insists that they discover themselves, and each other, and, being that it was written in 1935, there's not a lot of hullabaloo about it, they just look up, rather Monty Python-like and go \\"Oh, okay\\" and get on with it. And there you are, reading it all, and lapping it up. Unlike the movie, there is nudity, and sex. Unlike \\"Shantaram\\" both are very nearly erotic. Although I couldn't get Bogart and Hepburn out of my mind so I was somewhat impaired...Sadly, by the last two chapters, the author has developed cold feet. It seems he feels wicked for leading us on this ridiculous tale and he attempts to make up for it by creating new characters and events that will make everything right, at least very realistic, albeit off the mark of the original plot. Forrester is so convinced that his story won't hold up, he wrote a new forward to the 1940 edition (which I read) saying how the editors removed the last two chapters, for the first printing, and celebrating how he put them back.Forrester was SO wrong.Fortunately, there is the movie. Where Forrester got cold feet, John Huston knew a story when he heard one, and the movie fixes the ending, although the book's version is still very nice.\\"African Queen\\" is a very good story, very well written.

I havn't read a lot of books in years and a friend loaned me this one 4 years ago and I finally decided to read it and I was done in three days. I read during my breaks at work, whenever I had the chance. I couldn't put it down. And last night I was reading it, it was almost midnight but I refused to go to sleep until I was done. Then I had to get up and go sit in the bathroom so I wouldn't wake my husband up while I was crying at the end. So real and so many lessons you can learn from this one! READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"All the Time in the World","review":"This book was absolutely incredible. It made my heart race and my eyes water.

I thought the characters were unrealistic &amp; behaved improbably throughout.While there is a certain suspension of disbelief that a reader engages in while reading fiction, this book went far beyond these limits. For instance, the protagonist, Callista, dislikes the telephone because she prefers to spend time gardening, yet allows her sister to repeatedly insist she answer &amp; return calls when she doesn't want to; the casual way she ignores being locked in the shed is also extremely unrealistic, as is the loss of the straight razor which she left in the seat of an unlocked car. The gardening information was excellent &amp; interesting, but the story itself disappointing."},{"Title":"The Indian Cuisine: Dishes from the Sub-Continent of India and Pakistan","review":"While I may be biased due to the fact that my Great Grandmother created this wonderful cookbook, I know that the recipes it contains, as well as the ones my family make based on them are superb, and thus can highly recommend this book to anyone looking for simple and delicious meals for the family.

On the whole a definite necessity in a desi kitchen."},{"Title":"The Indian Cuisine: Dishes from the Sub-Continent of India and Pakistan","review":"I have owned this book for over 12 years and I constantly refer to it. The dishes are very easy to make and the instructions make the steps very clear. My favorite parts of the book are as follows:- All ingredients are transalted into english, so I know what to buy at the grocery store- All similar items (e.g., snacks, lentils etc.) are grouped together- At the end there are suggested menu combinations. This makes planning a dinner very easy.I couldnt imagine cooking indian food without this book."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 2: Books 3-9","review":"This is a word of warning to potential purchasers of this volume; it is only one of three volumes. This is not made clear in the presentation so just be aware. Look for the other two volumes if your intent is to acquire all thirteen books of Euclid's, The Elements."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 2: Books 3-9","review":"This is a review of the Dover edition with Heath's commentary. The review combines Vol. 1 (Books I-II) and Vol. 2 (Books III-IX) because I don't think many people besides possibly historians will only buy Vol.I.I think this is the definitive edition, the best choice for scholars, the mathematically mature, and beginners alike. The main competition seems to be the Green Lion edition, which is also Heath's translation but without the commentary. It's been a while since I've looked at the GL edition so if anything I write is incorrect please let me know and I'll edit appropriately. I believe it has some commentary in the difficult Book V, but nothing as detailed as Dover. Most people will need a good amount of help in Book IX as well, which the Dover edition provides. I'll attempt a short comparison between the editions. You'll notice that GL gets short shrift. This isn't because I prefer the Dover edition, but rather the other way around. I prefer the Dover edition because there are so many good things to say about it.IN FAVOR OF GREEN LION:**Cheaper. The three Dover books will cost about 13 dollars more. If you don't plan to read past, say, Book VI, like many people, then vol.1 and 2 of the Dover editions are only about 3 more dollars. Although if you really want the best price, the entire Elements is free online (Google D.E Joyce).**Figures are redrawn on the next page in case a proof carries over. This seems like a minor thing, but I think it's a really nice touch.**Slightly easier to find a proposition. Ok, I'll give this to them, but their preface exaggerates quite a bit when it says that in the Dover edition it's \\"difficult to find propositions.\\" How one encounters this difficulty when at the top of each left hand page is the book number and on the right the proposition number is unclear to me. But like I said, it is slightly easier in GL so they win this one.IN FAVOR OF DOVER:**If your goal is to learn even a tiny bit about Greek mathematics or math history in general, then read no further. This is the edition for you.**This is the best edition for beginners. This directly contradicts some previous reviewers, so some explanation is in order. The main argument against the use of this edition for beginners more or less asserts that Heath's commentary is only for the scholar- just dense, esoteric filler material to be skipped by the \\"real\\" mathematicians. Maybe that's a little harsh to those other reviewers and slightly exaggerated, but I put myself in the shoes of someone who has never seen this edition and that's essentially the feeling I got. This isn't the full truth. The first two thirds or so of volume 1, before he even gets to Euclid's text, might fit this description, as do some of the in-depth comments following Euclid's definitions, but then again a lot of those comments are necessary to know what Euclid is trying to say. This is the case with quite a few theorems as well. Now, it could be the case that I can't understand them because I'm stupid; that's still a conjecture at this point, although most people believe it's true. But to appeal to authority, De Morgan called some of the propositions in Book V \\"unintelligible to modern ears\\", and this description is definitely not limited to that book. Sure, some beginners will be ok with no help, but just like that one friend we all have who always claims to win at the casino, most people who claim to be ok on their own are probably lying. Heath also, especially in Book IX, goes through difficultly-worded proofs in the same style as Euclid but with modern notation, which is a tremendous help. Another thing to keep in mind is that one can understand something at only a superficial level. If not for Heath's commentary, I wouldn't have really understood Proposition VI.27. When I saw \\"The importance of VI.27-29 from a historical point of view cannot be overrated\\", I knew I wasn't getting it. I would never have noticed the connection to quadratic equations without the commentary. As far as GL is concerned, you're on your own with all this stuff. Good luck with that.Still keeping the beginner in mind, Euclid's habit of only proving one case and leaving any others to the reader could be confusing. Take I.24, for instance. Readers with some mathematical maturity will immediately wonder why F is drawn outside of triangle DGE, realize that this is just one case, and prove the others. A beginner might either not notice it at all, which is a bad habit to get into, or become frustrated at not understanding why (they think) F has to be outside the triangle. Heath always explicitly mentions and proves all but the most obvious missing cases. On a related note, Heath explains why lines that Euclid claims will meet, actually do meet, usually invoking the parallel postulate. I think this is important for the beginner because while they \\"obviously\\" meet from the diagrams, it gets them into the habit of thinking axiomatically for when diagrams can be misleading or are simply impossible to draw.**In addition, there's plenty of MATH in the commentary, which not many people have mentioned. There are alternate proofs of several theorems, some of which are arguably superior to Euclid's. There are also extensions that will be new to many readers. In particular, there's a nice extension to the Pythagorean Theorem credited to Pappus, and in Book VI Heath proves, surprisingly easily, that the locus of a point such that its distances from two given points are in a given ratio (not equal to 1) is a circle. I guess this wouldn't be extremely difficult to do algebraically, but it would probably be tedious and nowhere near as pretty as a geometric proof. These are just two I recall at the moment. There are many more.I think that's reason enough to get the Dover edition."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol. 2: Books 3-9","review":"Contrary to the reviewer who says it is not clear that this is only one volume of 3, I thought there was 6 or 7 volumes altogether. The title clearly says \\"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4\\", so obviously this is volume 2 of a collection. Knowing that the original Elements had 13 books, my assumption was there must be several more volumes in this new edition. Actually, Amazon's title of the book is wrong! If you look at the front cover, or the index of this book, you can see that it says \\"Vol.2 (Books III-IX)\\". And if you are interested to know, volume 1 covers books I and II, and volume 3 covers books X through XIII so altogether they cover the original Elements entirely.Update (10/14/2010):At the time I wrote the previous review, the book's title was \\"The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4\\".

Oh, do not be optimistic, this is not the only book with forbidding notation, see Artin's Galois theory, which is an excellent book if someone just tries to update its notation.Aside from that the book was a merry one. It contains more books than the first one. It contains the books 3 up to 9 of Euclid's 13 books of the elements.Book 3 is a delightful one. Its sole purpose is to characterize circles. It goes with the same style of the first two books given the first volume. Books 4 continues in the same fashion and studies circumscribing and inscribing figures by others.Book 5 is the first attempt to bring geometry near to algebra. It deals with proportions. The notation started getting more and more cumbersome. He continues giving us things that we know already. And all through the volume until book 9 we see results commonly given in simple college algebra in the most tedious fashion.I praise this volume only for the material on circles and I see that it is worth reading if you have a strong constitution.

Now he just writes his thoughts almost directly and to the point. Anyway, I am only a few pages into it(just got it yesterday) but I find it to be very enjoyable reading. I too am a fan of not only their music but mainly thier lyrics. Heck the older I get and the more I learn about myself as a human, the more Neils lyrics mean to me. It is also very nice having somebody to discuss his lyrics with and I find that in Mr. Roberto's book. It is my Rush conversation companion. I never looked at some of his lyrics the way Leonard did and I like getting different points of view.I should do my own book of the early stuff as a companion piece to this fine work!"},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"I have been a fan of Rush for almost 20 years know, this started when I was a kid of 15, the rythim they use and the &quot;fairy tale lyrics&quot; just sounded cool to me.Now after 20 years I find the music still inspires me and through life's ups and downs the words can give direction and peace. As a non native english speaker I wanted to &quot;understand&quot; the meaning better. This book really gave a new depth to that."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"This &quot;book&quot; began it's life as an e-Book, available as a download for a small fee. It reads like something you'd find on a Rush fan's personal website... especially the passages in which the author tells us &quot;when I'm in (x) mood, I like to listen to (x) song.&quot; Furthermore, his observations about the meaning of Rush's songs are always obvious in nature.Roberto's &quot;book&quot; of song interpretations includes EVERY song that Rush released from &quot;PERMANENT WAVES&quot; (1980) to &quot;TEST FOR ECHO&quot; (1996). In this respect - the sheer quantity of songs discussed - it surpasses Carol Selby Price's book on Rush lyrical analysis &quot;Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush.&quot; Price only analyzes a handful of songs in her book, and none of them are post-1990 (&quot;PRESTO&quot;).In every other consideration, this book is dramatically inferior to Price's book. At eighty pages total, &quot;A Simple Kind Mirror&quot; allots less than a page (and sometimes only a few sentences) to each song discussed. Len Roberto doesn't dig very deeply into the songs, and only scratches the surface when it comes to the depth of meaning in Neil Peart's lyrics. There's really nothing here that Rush fans haven't grokked themselves from listening to the songs. Price, with her background in Philosophy, offers us much more.Regarding the writing STYLE, I'm pleased to report that &quot;Simple Kind Mirror&quot; isn't riddled with spelling, grammatic, and syntax errors like so many Rush-related books. Roberto seems to possess an above-average vocabulary, and each sentence is well constructed. HOWEVER... throughout the book's 80 pages, one finds many sentences which seem like non-sequitirs given the sentences that precede them. (Roberto will offer us a theory about the meaning of a lyric, and in the next sentence give us a further idea that doesn't seem to fit the first. It's as if we're reading his stream-of-consciousness meanderings, and only by entering his brain could we understand how he arrived where he did.)I really can't recommend this title. If it's a scholarly and in-depth interpretation of Peart's lyrics that you're after, skip this book and buy Carol Selby Price's &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot; instead."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"For anyone who can barely speak English, this is a great book -- it's so oversimplified and generalized and structured for the average 8 yr old that it's the most unreadable waste of paper that trees have ever given life for. It's just awful. It's actually too terrible to be funny. Avoid it like the plague.Here's some of the author's brilliance paraphrased: &quot;So like, the song's like Spirit of Radio, you know, like the Radio has a spirit, like it's alive, but everybody knows a radio can't have a spirit, right? Or maybe it can if you think about it!&quot;Plainly stated, if you're of the mindset and level of intellect that Rush's work appeals to you, then you're way overqualified to bother with this tragic waste of ink. Get Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush if you're that into the lyrics; if you're that into the band, Robert Telleria's Rush: Merely Players is about THE best thing I've ever read. If you want further insight into the mind behind the lyrics, read either Masked Rider or Ghost Rider by Neil himself -- THOSE are both literary masterpieces."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"While the writing style of this book is very simple, it also seems the author knew it was sparse on content by the way he used so many filler words. If there were more complex ideas he could have been more straightforward with the writing, but as it is he's lucky he got so many pages out of the few ideas he discusses. I literally could have written a better book with deeper discussion without further research, which the author claims to have done. (How is it possible to read everything about Rush online? Does that now include this review?)If you're writing a book about lyrics, don't even mention the instrumentals (more filler). About &quot;Where's My Thing?&quot; Roberto claims: &quot;Continuing the Rush tradition of incuding an instrumental track on every album&quot; (46). Aside from the English problems of that phrase, I could only find instrumentals on 5 of thier 16 (at the time) studio albums. If I was writing a book about the lyrics of a band that's something I probably woudn't get wrong. There are also other errors and weak filler observations. I hope an editor got fired.I consider myself a hard-core fan. Maybe check this out if you're a very casual fan or just getting into Rush lyrics and you're young. Otherwise, try Mystic Rhythms if you want to read about their lyrics on a more meaningful level.A couple things I liked about the book: (1) it's short, so less painful, and (2) I'm finished with it, so less painful."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"I can't believe I bought the back cover hype, and purchased this book. Mr. Roberto should have begun most sentences with, \\"Uh...\\". Lacking confidence, he speculates on the shallow, obvious sides of Neal's brilliant lyrics. I can only surmise that a Writers Club Press saw dollar signs, conspired with a bogus editer, and convinced Mr. Roberto that his internet thoughts would make a good book. But, c'mon Len, this book is in your name, and your reputation. How could you have not fleshed out this manuscript to make it readable? Skip this book, and read Mystic Rythums."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"I have not read any other Rush related books, so my rating of this book is not a relative one. The author (and I'm being kind when I call him that) misses a lot of the meaning of the songs and, in my opinion sees things that I do not think Peart intended. I do not mind the latter since the reason we read books, poetry, or lyrics is to gain our own interpretation. My problem here is total lack of credibility. In the \\"About the Author\\" passage at the back of the book, there are two sentences which state about four facts: 1. He lives in Connecticut, 2. He works for a business media company, 3. He is a progressive music fan, and 4. He has been a Rush fan since the late 80's. Who cares where he lives, and his job could be a paper boy based on the vague description. So the only thing we are left with is the author is a progressive music and Rush fan. Since when does that make him an authority? But that's not all- It says he has been a fan since the late 80's. In the introduction the author tells about his life changing experience after hearing Tom Sawyer on the radio for the first time, presumably in 1981. To quote the author, \\"Listening to that song on the way to work was the start of my appreciation for and devotion to Rush and their music.\\" So how devoted did he become to Rush in 1981? He attended his first Rush concert during the Presto Tour in 1989 or 1990. Now there is nothing wrong with all that, except that in my book that makes you a casual fan...definitely not an authority figure.Putting aside credibility, I find the writing to be simplistic. This is great if English is not your first language and you want to gain literal interpretation of the songs. This book reads like a high school or junior college book report. Sometimes lyrics are cited as indented, sometimes they are \\"quoted within the paragraph\\", and sometimes they are simply incorporated into the author's sentences. Maybe he is using them in context...I dunno...it's an amateur approach.I expect that any long time casual Rush fan (like myself) will learn little from this book. I know that Neil Peart draws upon literature and philosophy for his lyrics, but none of that is covered here. The research is lacking big time. I find it disturbing that a fan of Rush or Neil Peart could have the gumption to publish a book that is so lacking from a literary standpoint. I find it embarassing...I've tried to convince myself that the author did this simply to make a buck."},{"Title":"A Simple Kind Mirror: The Lyrical Vision of Rush","review":"I don't really have to say anything more than the reviewers before me have said. Thankfully the book is short so if you do fall victim to reading it you won't have wasted much time and if you've purchased it you won't have wasted much money.

Embarrassingly bad.

Peart is himself an Objectivist, and most of Rush's songs have an Objectivist point of view. Some of the author's interpretations are decidededly non-Objectivist in nature.We all draw our own interpretations from Rush's songs, and there's no saying that my interpretation is any better than anyone else's.

(Call me jaded - I very seldom read any Writer's reference these days that teaches me something I haven't already learned.) In the first few (very brief) chapters, the book confirmed my suspicions. But something prodded me to keep reading. I did. I can't begin to tell you how much I have learned from Mr. Edelstein. This simple book stores a goldmine of information for any writer at any stage of his/her career. Buy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"I've had this book for a while now, and have discovered it again among my many tomes. Definitely the book for beginner writers or those who wish to know a bit more about their passion. Edelstein writes very comfortable prose allowing for pleasurable reading, without having to unnecessarily strain one's cognitive matter. The information is mostly common sense, but as we humans are not known to have a lot of it (at least this member of the race) I find it positive that Edelstein has gotten it all in such a well-organized book. The prospective buyer will be pleased to find 100 short but concise \\"chapters\\" concerning, among other things:- how to get an idea when starting or during difficult times while writing a piece. The \\"myth\\" of \\"writer's block\\" is also dealt with at length.- how to organize your writing time, and a good deal on writing cycles one can naturally fall into. This includes what methods are useful in planning or mapping out a piece.- how to make a living as a writer, and what options are open to us. The use and necessity (or not) of agents, professional critics, and publishers is also carefully dissected.- what those many strange words (such as \\"novel\\", \\"novella\\" and \\"novelette\\") used in the writing business actually mean. This section also includes a brief description of words used to describe poetry. Quite useful as a quick reference, in my eyes.Most of the advice concerns every type of writing, from poetry, (film/play) scripts and non-fiction. The above is of course only a partial list; I have only attempted to show some of the main points of Edelstein's wonderful work.Of course, this book alone does not (and physically cannot) cover the topics presented extensively, but should rather be used as an index or overview of the writing craft. To delve deeper into such subjects as synopsis writing or how to structure one's novel, you should turn to such works as \\"Your Novel Proposal\\" by Blythe Camenson and the \\"How to write a damn good novel...\\" series from James N. Frey. As mentioned above this book is very commendable for the beginner writer and is the perfect stepping-stone. We all have to start somewhere, now don't we?"},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"This is a quick read, filled with great information and brutal honesty. Perhaps this is what I enjoyed the most since a lot of the information in here I had read in other places. (Hence the 4 star rating rather than 5.) Nonetheless, I like how the author tells writers to work the way that is best for them, as opposed to trying to be the model writer discussed in writing magazines. I also liked how the specific information I was looking for was easy to find. You can choose to read it straight through, or only the section that is pertinent to your situation. This book is a worthy investment for a personal library of books about writing."},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"The writing tips in this book were vey useful to me. They were easy to digest, written to give the biggest impact in the shortest amount of space, and very, very practical. I commend Scott Edelstein for writing a fine piece of nonfiction. He covers may areas of writing, and even though his tips are short, each sentence carries a lot of weight. I would recommend this book highly to those searching to improve their writing career."},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"I love this book because the author breaks with the ideas we were taught when we were learning how to write in grade school. Each chapter is short and easy to read, great for those of us that have just a little time to read and then go back to work. The author also assumes that every writer is different, which is true. After all we all come from different backgrounds and we each have our own style. I would recommend this book to anyone that is starting a career in writing, or someone that wants to know what it would be like, and someone that wants to know what to watch for when you are out there. I have to admit that I felt for one of the scams decribed by the author. It really opened my eyes."},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"The format of the book is perfect for writers who want access to pertinent information. Though Edelstein builds his points logically, technically one can bounce around the book reading only those points that are important at the moment.However, I would encourage the author to come out with an updated version as there are a small, yet important number of aspects of writing that have evolved since the books publication in 1999, especially in the arena of self-publishing and the now dramatically increased role the Internet has on marketing.Still, there are gems aplenty in what is now a classic reference book for writers."},{"Title":"100 Things Every Writer Needs to Know","review":"This book is perfect for beginners looking to pick up some helpful tips!

Forbush has no understanding of Messiahship. For example, he thinks Jesus was a follower of John the Baptist and hero-worshipped John. Jesus, he says, joined John's \\"movement\\", having been baptized into it, making Jesus a disciple of John! Jesus bowed Himself at John's feet. From his 1912 children's Life of Jesus, Bible Study Union Series, here are examples of his doctrine:\\"Jesus hastened from His hilltop home, down the Jordan valley, to meet John. Through all these years of silence He had been studying the same problems which John had faced in the desert, and He was, no doubt, now feeling very clearly that His own great future was just at hand. He must have listened to the impassioned speaker with admiration. He must have felt toward him something of hero-worship.\\" (pages 44-45).\\"[Jesus] bowed Himself at the feet of John as his follower and allied Himself with this movement for the purifying of the nation's life. When Jesus came and asked to be baptized by John He was not claiming leadership, He was becoming a soldier in the ranks...\\" (page 46)Forbush was a teacher who unfortunately did not understand spiritual things. I am sorry to find his works still being published."},{"Title":"Rotterdam 650 years: Fifty years of reconstruction","review":"My title is Dutch for \\"Rotterdam As We Remember It,\\" and I chose that title because this is essentially an edited compilation written by Rotterdammers Hans Baaij, Ger Bestebreurtje, Koos de Gast, Jan Oudenaarden, and Hans Soeters, all authorities in the history of Rotterdam. This book was published in 1990 on the 650th anniversary of the founding of Rotterdam, although the text is quick to point out that there are several conflicting versions of history regarding the official founding of the city.Most people know that Rotterdam, home of the \\"Europoort,\\" is the biggest port in the world, but many do not know the interesting history of this important city, famous for \\"boompjes\\" and particularly streets lined with lime trees. The town has had many tribulations throughout history, perhaps most significantly during world war two, when it was essentially razed to the ground by aerial bombardment.This book is a social history and as such is very much a story of people whose lives are inextricably linked with the sea. Today the Europoort is an unqualified success story, but this was not always a given. Throughout the book the story of the port of Rotterdam takes center stage, with particular attention paid to nautically relevant men such as Pieter Caland, Lodewijk Pincoffs, and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who was publicly decapitated for his views in 1619.My favorite section of the book was written by Koos de Gast and is titled \\"The New Rotterdam.\\" This part of the book concerns itself primarily with the rebirth of the city since world was two, and touches on the rebuilding process, the post-war social climate in Rotterdam, and architecture in Rotterdam. Indeed, the architecture of Rotterdam is of particular interest to me (I am especially fond of the \\"Treehouses\\" by architect Piet Blom), and while I would have preferred more emphasis on it, I realize that in a commemorative volume of this nature, that general treatment of specialized subjects sometime prevail during editing.The book has a little bit for anyone interested in Rotterdam: it has an account of Koos Speenhoff, a guitar-wielding anti-authority troubadour famous around 1912; it contains the mercurial parliamentary maneuvering of the highly-regarded visionary Minister Thorbecke (who persuaded the government to back the port expansion, as well as silt and erosion control plans of the brilliant, if enigmatic, Pieter Caland) who set in motion the plans that eventually culminated in the building of the Europoort; it also contains other less-known aspects of Rotterdam history such as the history of Chinese stokers (note particularly the plight of the Chinese in Rotterdam as extolled in the lyrics of the song \\"Peanut, Peanut\\" on page 62), and early urban planning sponsored by the Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy, which focused on the east side of Feyenoord.My biggest critique of the book is in the editing. In addition to writing much of the text, Hans Baaij edited this volume, and generally did a good job. The problem is that with multiple authors writing on closely related subjects the same history is sometimes recounted a number of different times. While it is sometimes useful to compare and contrast differing views of history, this repetition occasionally detracts from the coherence and readability of the book.Overall, this is a fine salute to the city of Rotterdam. It does not pander to people who seek only to glorify the city, it is a genuine history with all the detractions 650 years are bound to bring in any municipality, yet it does pay tribute to those who have contributed so much to Dutch society, the history of the Walloons, and Rotterdam. While imperfect, this book is a must-read for anyone who is a Rotterdammer or a Rotterdammer at heart."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"About 25 years ago, I said that the only thing the Bible translation world really needs is a minor revision of the old RSV. The standard issues: 'propitiation' rather than 'expiation,' virgin rather than 'young woman,' 'homosexual' rather than 'sodomite,' etc. Unfortunately, the RSV, and subsequent NRSV, patents were held by rather 'liberal' groups who didn't share these views. Even so, the RSV has been reviewed and edited and has for many years been the best overall Bible to read and study from, IMHO. Many conservative pastors and teachers agree with this assessment. (The NRSV, apart from the controversial gender-sensitivity issues, is also an excellent work, with scholarly footnotes/alt. readings.)So when the ESV came out, I was happy to take a look and realize that, 25 years ago, I would have been happy with it. That was a long time ago. I've since become more ecclectic and would like to see a little more modern wording and diversified but honest scholarship. My review will highlight things not mentioned in other reviews.Keep the theological jargon (justification, redemption, etc.) but dump the non-theological unneeded Bibleze: eg. reproach (When was the last time you said, 'I've been reproached?'), sober-minded (unclear as to exact meaning, and a modern dictionary won't explain what is meant in these texts), abide (not as clear as 'reside' or 'remain,' the two meanings of the Greek word).Most passages are in fact identical to the RSV, moving one reviewer to call it the Remarkably Similar Version. (I found that funny, but true.) Unfortunately some passages that begged for updating were left unchanged, eg. Matt. 7:1:'Judge not, that you be not judged.' That is not modern English and I am bothered by the fact that this translation is very uneven in it's modernization. Some passages were modernized, but in an unhelpful fashion- it's OK to replace an old but useful term like 'fornication,' but rendering 'sexual immorality' with no useful, defining, footnote leaves the reader in the dark.Some parts are excellent, such as 1 Corinthians 6:9 and explanatory footnote, concerning the two words explicitly referencing male homosexuality. I was pleased that in the Ephesians 6 passage about the armor of God, verse 18 was not dissected from the previous text, but continues in the same paragraph; from my perspective, the prayer mentioned in verse 18 refers to the word (rhema) of verse 17. More goodies: 1 John 2:16 has, correctly, 'pride in possessions' rather than 'pride of life.' Hebrews 10:39,'But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.' The ESV text, at least in the NT, flows exquisitely, as in the original RSV.The ESV is overall an excellent work. For a comparison with a more modern reading, but still conservative, translation, check out the Holman Christian Standard Bible. It is currently available only in the NT; OT to follow. It is published by Holman and is called 'Experiencing the Word.' I am still trying to decide between these two versions as to which will be my main Bible. The ESV is more familiar and fluid, but the HCSB is, IMHO, more scholarly, uses modern English and sentence structure, and omits unused words (while retaining thelogical jargon). Try this one alongside the ESV.From a publishing perspective, the ESV print is too small (10 pica, I think) and, as others have commented, the segmenting in the poetic sections leaves a lot to be desired. I would recommend to the reader that you wait for larger type and a better layout before you buy an expensive copy- the hardbound edition is suitable to evaluate this work and decide if you like it.I've been overly critical, to give the reader a balanced perspective. I greatly respect the work and the staff that produced this work."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I researched every other classic and thinline to compare in the ESV, the NASB, the AMP and the NLT, all of which are excellent. None compare with the style as I stated above. You cannot tell, but this is a hardback and it lies open, the pages turn easily and do not bleed through. This edition should be made also in a masculine cover.

The ESV is an excellent Bible for in-depth study. However, unlike some word-for-word type of translations, it is much easier to read. This may or may not be a version for fast reading devotionals, but there are plenty of reviews about the English Standard Version of the Bible to be found elsewhere on the internet.I ordered...the Black Premium Calfskin edition of this Bible, and I can whole-heartedly recommend this Bible without reservation. The print type is large and readable, the margins are large, and the binding appears to be very durable. The calfskin cover is soft as butter, yet very durable. Somehow, the paper used in this Bible appears to be much thicker/more solid than previous versions of Crossway's ESV Bible...meaning, when reading a page in this Bible, you don't have the distraction of words printed on the back side of the page showing through.Overall, an excellent quality Bible.

The cover feels good and looks just right (I've actually gotten comments about how good it looks.) The ESV translation is awesome -- it takes a little getting used to if you're coming off the old school translations, but it flows nicely (it's pretty close to the version that the Episcopalian church uses in its worship services, I found), and it's spot on with the Greek (at least as far as I've been able to determine.)This one probably won't replace your bedstand Bible (unless you have really good vision, as the print is so small), and it can be a bit hard to take notes in (since the margins are fairly narrow in places), but it fills its niche very nicely.

The Bible itself is not too large, actually a little smaller than the study Bible I previously used, and fits into my zip-up Bible cover. The pages are a little thin, but that's standard for Bibles.

A number of Book Sellers opine that the cost is prohibitive and that since whole Bibles are so readily available in so many styles and formats at such a low cost, it isn't worth it to the publisher to set up for just a small, low-cost NT. Those who believe the Bible to be the Word of God and the instrument of our salvation have long found great use for a handy version of the NT as the greatest of aids in the proclamation, defense and discussion of God's Word.The ESV version is an endearing (and may I predict, an enduring...) translation that makes plain what is most precious, without the compromises that so often beleagure modern translations.

The 9.5 x 6 x 1.7 inches Amazon gives is the dimensions of the box it comes in except the box cover is 6 3/8 inches wide instead of 6.Pros: I love this Bible. The cover is nice. It is thick, soft, seems durable, has nice texture and color. It speaks quality to me. The binding is sewn and looks sturdy. The paper is a little thin but not brittle like I feared it would be. There is some text showing through the pages but it is not sufficient to hinder reading.I like the cross references. I don't know how many other Bibles have this kind of system but there are four kinds of cross references in here. Just the text (e.g. Ps. 48:12) in the column indicates a key word or phrase repeated in that passage. The text in square brackets indicates a theme relationship. A less direct, more general theme relationship is given by introducing the text with \\"See\\" (e.g. See Gen. 9:9). Passages in the New Testament quoted from the old have a reference with \\"Cited from\\" before the text (e.g. cited from Isa. 53:7,8) and the corresponding passages in the Old Testament have \\"Cited\\" in front like for example \\"Cited Acts 8:32\\" to show they are cited in the NT.I like the ESV translation. My new youth pastor recommends it and he said it was recommended to him by several faculty in seminary. A hebrew/greek scholar at my church recommended the ESV as a good translation. The language flows well most of the time. It seeks to be readable yet distinct in its language. It doesn't use \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" but still uses \\"shall\\" and \\"behold.\\" It's hard to find modern English equivalents for those words. \\"Will\\" works for \\"shall\\" only some of the time and \\"look\\" or \\"see\\" have not the force of \\"behold\\" which is required. Also, there are many Bible translations that all try to be the most contemporary. This one can afford to be distinguished in its language.Cons: The cover, though thick, appears to scratch easily because it is soft. It's just the price you pay for having it soft. I was tempted to feel bad like I ruined it when I nicked it but you just have to remember that the bible is better to be scratched up and read rather than in perfect condition and unread. The book is made to be used and its replaceable!The printing on the pages is slightly inconsistent. The text is a little light in areas and sometimes the darkness visibly varies within a line. The inconsistency of of the print is especially visible in the red letter. Some segments even within a red letter paragraph are quite visibly lighter than the segments around it (I checked the print on the other side of the page leaf and it was consistent). However I have not yet found a single page in this bible where I had a hard time reading the text so functionally this doesn't make a significant difference. It is just mildly distracting."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I find the ESV to be the best and most conservative (note, for example, the changes to \\"virgin\\" in Is. 7:14, and \\"propitiation\\" in Rom. 3:25, both contra RSV) of all the \\"modern versions\\" out there. One even wonders why the various Bible publishing houses find it necessary to continue to release new versions, or revisions of versions (and even revisions of revisions of revisions, as in the case of the KJV-ERV-ASV-RSV-NASV-NRSV chain), each heralded as \\"the best\\" or \\"most accurate\\" by the publishers (with, of course, the obligatory endorsement of this theologue or that) year after year, unless it be for the \\"GOG\\" factor (i.e., GOOD OLD-fashioned GREED), since we surely have enough of these translations to last us till kingdom come.But the ESV, arising out of a desire to bridge the gap between the stilted accuracy of the NASV, and the casual charm of the RSV (upon which the ESV is based, differing only 6% from the RSV text) strikes a welcome balance for those desiring a translation that is both readable and faithful to the wording of the originals.The ESV's main drawback is the rather cavalier attitude shown, following most modern translations, to place in the margins the various verses from the AV. That aside, this (leather) edition of the ESV strives to disalign itself with any denominational interpretation (notice book introductions and cross references).Overall, the English Standard Version is to be recommended as a fine backup translation for the student to consult when the sometimes difficult wording of NASB needs clarification, as it occasionally does. It should have no problem replacing the NIV AND its puzzling popularity in spite of its inaccurate format."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I just received a copy of this ESV Bible (tru-tone, portfolio style, single-column reference) from Amazon. It's a lovely volume. The cover is quite pleasing, the print quality seems to be clear (and even throughout the text), and for me the \\"ghosting\\" from the opposite side of the page through the thin bible paper is minimal.A few quick observations on the negative side: The Bible comes in a box with a cut-out \\"window\\" in front . . . the edges of this window left an indentation on the tru-tone material of the front cover. It will be interesting to see if this recovers over time or if it is permanent.The ribbon marker is a nice gold/tan color and longer than most Bible markers. However, it was attached at the top of the spine way to the right (back of the Bible) rather than being centered. This seems rather careless to me.It is completely unclear to me whether this is a sewn or glued binding. I personally believe that any Bible other than an \\"economy\\" or give-away edition should be sewn, as Bible usually get consistent use over long time periods . . . glued bindings fall apart far sooner than sewn. The Crossway site doesn't clarify, the Amazon site doesn't clarify, and previous reviewers of other edition of the single column reference Bible disagree (one said he was waiting for the tru-tone portfolio edition which is supposed to be sewn, another said only the premium leather edition is sewn.) At any rate, I've e-mailed Crossway and asked for clarification. The nature of the binding determines how I'll break this Bible in and how I'll use it.I'm keeping the box, and if it turns out to be glued and a chunk of pages falls out I'll be sending it back directly to Crossway for replacement.***Follow up:I just received confirmation from Crossway that this edition is indeed a sewn binding. It's hard to tell by examining the book itself, although there is a slight \\"ripple\\" where the pages enter the binding that made me think it was more likely sewn. Knowing the type of binding makes me less inclined to handle it carefully; a sewn binding can last through more \\"normal\\" handling.The only problem I have after using this edition for a while is the tiny print used for the verse references and footnotes. It is truly microscopic, and a challenge for my 57-year-old eyes. Unfortunately the only \\"large print\\" edition of the ESV that Crossway offers doesn't have verse references; if it did that would probably be the perfect solution for me."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

This is a simple bible, small in size, it has a nice leather feel too it, easy to read print because unlike trade Bibles, the paper is of high quality, so there is a crispness to the words. It is not a study Bible, it has very few references, if this is your first Bible purchase, I would recommend the ESV study Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"If you are in need of a rugged bible to stow and pack on the go then this is a handy edition. As a United States Marine, I find this bible going with me wherever I go as a back up. I can stuff it in a pack with other gear, throw it around (if I wanted to), or even cram it in my trouser pocket if necessary due to its small size.Now having had the Bible for 4-5 months or so, the Bible is dirty, the cover has dents, and the casing frame is bent somewhat. Nonetheless from rough use, it is still legible, opens fine (the latch issue mentioned in other reviews is neglible), and I percieve that it will hold up for much more time. (years maybe)This Bible is not made for every day reading and won't likely be your primary bible. You could nitpick at the small flaws the design has, though nothing stands out to me. Moreover, it gets the job done for those that want a bible handy and not have to worry about destroying the text.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is due to the strength of the cover. It could be stronger. It dents but it still holds up. A more dense material would likely increase the weight of the product as well as the price. You pay for what you get."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a great Bible! Maybe it's just a mental thing, but the single column format makes it easier to read. The 10-point font is nice too... it's not too big, and it's not too small. Also, I like to make notes in the margins of my Bible and there's plenty of room to do that here. The pages aren't too thin, and there isn't much of a \\"ghosting\\" from the print on the backside of each page. The binding is sewn, which is nice for durability. A very minor complaint that I have is that this Bible is a little big. But when I think about it, the only things that would make this Bible smaller would be thinner paper (which would make the pages almost transparent and too fragile), double column format instead of single (but if you're wanting this Bible it's probably for the single column format anyway), smaller print (which wouldn't be too bad, but current print size seems so perfect as is), and narrower margins (but then you wouldn't have much room for notes). So really, this Bible needs to be this big to include all these features. One other complaint that the manufacturer should have considered is that the box the Bible comes in has a \\"window\\" on the front that leaves an impression on the Bible's cover. After a day, this impression hasn't come out and I'm fairly certain it won't. But really, this Bible is an excellent deal for $36. For the price, you couldn't ask for much more."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The biggest advantage to this Bible is its size. It is about as small as you can get a full Bible and yet still be able to easily read the text. The Crossroads Design and pattern is pretty subtle. The biggest problem I have with this Bible is that it tends to not stay open. The cover is fairly stiff. When it is opened up to Psalms, its lays open flat, but when you are trying to read half of the new Testament or the Pentateuch, the Bible will close. In its favor, it has improved over the few months I've had it. I've been told that it is sewn bound so it should get better at staying open the more I use it."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

When I got it I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a nice compact size. This was perfect because I like being able to have it around with me, and this one is metal which makes that all the better. A disclaimer, however, is that the text is on the small size. It's readable but if your eyes aren't the best, this may not be for you. I personally love this bible, and for my needs it's perfect. The only reason I gave it a 4 star as opposed to 5 star is that like I said the text is small, which could be a problem for some. And just as a warning, it is a red lettered bible so don't say you weren't warned.

The translation is great for personal study and the size is great to be carried in your pocket everywhere so you can read it as you walk or look up anything as it iterests during the day. The binding is holding well and shows no signs of wear. The leather cover is great as it has already saved it from some moisture, and it has a great smooth feel. The type is a bit small than other translations I have seen, but that isn't a problem. The ribbon page marker is designed well as it already has the crease in the top so it easily marks the page without haveing to work to get it so there is no crease in it in the middle to cause extra strain on the binding (a highlight I think).

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"In my judgment, the ESV is indeed a good revision of the RSV. It would also be appropriate to think of it as a &quot;conservative&quot; revision, though such is not necessarily praiseworthy. Solid, factual scholarship is what we should expect from all translating teams, regardless of theological inclinations. I like the fact that the ESV is quite a bit more &quot;gender-accurate&quot; than the RSV and the NIV, though not as much as the NRSV. Crossway has done a real service by presenting the bible reading public with a useful and scholarly translation. I do have what I believe to be a legitimate complaint; the ESV should have been published with a dark, legible, and &quot;large&quot; size print. The current print is too small to be useful for those who want to study the ESV for long periods of time. This has been the most frequent complaint of the ESV/Crossway Publishing Company, and I think it is well deserved. Unless Crossway acts quickly to rectify the problem, the ESV may go the way of the NASB, that is, good translation but low sales due to bad marketing! Nonetheless, I do believe that the ESV coupled with the NRSV makes a great team. If the NRSV had not overstepped biblical bounds in a few places with its gender-inclusive philosophy, it would be my number English text with the ESV following a CLOSE second! Except for the issue of gender language, they are not very far apart. The ESV is not as great as some allege, nor is the NRSV as bad as many affirm. Both have their areas of usefulness, so why not buy one of each and use them? They are both scholarly and based upon the best modern critical texts in both old and new testaments!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

With the current deluxe version of the Classic Reference Bible, all those binding and printing problems seem to have been solved.

All the various \\"read through the bible programs\\" required too much paperwork, divided up the bible awkwardly, or were poorly outlined.With this book, however, the Bible is dividely up beautifully and logically, with no thoughts or passages cut in two without a logical break.Each day you read an Old Testament passage, a New Testament passage, a Psalm or portion of a Psalm, and a few verses from Proverbs. By the end of the year you will have read each Testament once through and the Psalms and Proverbs twice through.If ESV is not your preferred version, the publisher (Crossway Bible) has \\"The One Year Bible\\" in several other translations as well. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"[EDIT: for those wondering about this translation... It is a revision of the \\"Revised Standard Version.\\" From what I can tell, it's probably about 70 - 80% RSV. The translation philosophy is \\"essentially literal\\" so it is more in keeping with the original language. For instance Hebrews 10:39 reads \\"But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\\" Compare with the NIV2011 that ends with \\"and are saved.\\" The ESV follows the literal words of the Greek text while the NIV tends to be \\"thought for thought.\\" Both translation philosophies have their strengths and weaknesses. It depends on how literal you want your Bible vs how easy it is to read. (Yes, I know Biblical Greek...)]EDIT (July 2011): After of year of use (purchased in June 2010) the cover is beginning to break down considerably. Obvious wear on the outside of the cover, creased back cover where it's been folded over, front cover has creased front cover from being held. On the inside crack marks are developing around where the cover and the binding meet.The tear on the cover (from the finger nail) was fixed with a \\"super glue\\" of some type. It has not continued to rip. I have not had a repeat of this kind of tear on the cover.CONCLUSION: The binding is strong and lays flat when open. The soft cover is not durable. If you are used to needing a new Bible every few years this should be good, especially for the low price. However, if you are looking for something more durable.... look someplace else.Why I gave it only one star: This Bible was advertised as \\"new.\\" It did not come in a box or wrapped in any way. It also did not come with the advertised \\"Free ESV Bible Resources software offer included.\\" Vender did not correct this when contacted.EDIT (October 2011): the reason I changed to four stars is because \\"I like it.\\" What can I say? I take it everywhere and if I lose it it's not like losing an heirloom $100+ Bible. If you like the ESV, or just want something different to read/study the price is right... If you just want to \\"kick the tires\\" on the ESV, download the Kindle version first.]The first impression is that this is a beautiful Bible. See pictures for a visual tour.The construction of the Bible is a mystery. It looks like it is Smyth sewn because of the ribbon reinforcement but there are no other signs of this AND it is not advertised as such. I'm guessing it may be a hybrid binding (glued). Crossway has been very silent on the binding of its Bibles up to this point. It is very \\"limp\\" and lays (flat) open very well.The TruTone (c) covering is very soft and attractive. However it tore the third day I used it... picking it up, my finger nail dug into the soft cover. This is my second experience with the TruTone (a NCV with a two color cover that feels more plastic than soft leather) that I've used for years. (EDIT (July 2011): correction, my third type of this cover... the other is a NIV compact did not hold up at all. The NCV is doing fine with no signs of wear.)The pages are bright white, so there is some eye strain if read in bright light. The paper is very thin and the printing on the other side is easy to see through the page...Over all this is a nice Bible... It feels great to hold and easily readable in average light. However, I have serious reservations about how durable this Bible will be due to the easy tear on the cover."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Also, my old KJV bible that I previously took along wherever I went was printed in a font size that I can now read only with magnification, and that doesn't help much... Purchase of this volume solved both problems nicely.Asthetics aside, I do appreciate this Bible as a travel companion. The weight is not burdensome, and the paper is thicker than I thought it might be. What this bible lacks in study helps (there are only a few cross references and footnotes, plus a 30 page concordence in this volume) is vastly made up for in portability. The font size is surprisingly legible for being a bit less than 9 points; in fact it seems nearly twice as large as that old KJV Bible mentioned above, while the page size of this volume is only a little bit larger than the older Bible. The biggest suprise was that the purchase of this volume at just over $10 USD also allowed me a free download of ESV Bible Resources software to install on my computer, which integrates well with other resources I received with the NKJV Study Bible I purchased from a different publisher last year.If you're looking for a suitable Bible to take along on your travels, this one easily fills the bill."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The backing and the cover seem to move together without one feeling like it will pull away from the other. I am sure that there could be the occasional cover that separates from the backing but I have dealt with three of these now, all for different purposes and none of them have given me any problems in that sense and they do not simply sit on a bookshelf.

When you give this Bible to a new believer, you are putting in their hands a great resource to begin their walk with Christ. They are getting:1. The Word of God2. An introduction to the Bible3. A guide to help them read the Bible for the first time4. Scriptural resources for common life situations (i.e. anger, fear, loneliness, greed, sin, faith, grace, prayer, etc.)5. An introduction for both the Old Testament and New Testament6. An introduction for every book in the Bible7. A plan of salvation for the reader (This explains the sinful nature of mankind and the importance of repentance and the saving grace of Christ)8. A one year Bible reading planThe low price of this Bible is not an indication of low quality. The text in this Bible is comfortable to read and is nicely formatted.

The only thing I could think of that this Bible lacks is a bookmark.Just because I recommend this Bible for a beginner doesn't mean a seasoned Christian should overlook this Bible. I frequently used one for myself until I gave it away to a young believer.

I recently purchased the NIV Study Bible as my primary study Bible (since ESV does not have a Study Bible yet) and purchased this as a secondary translation as well as a \\"travel\\" Bible. I have found that there are many refinements from the NIV and in almost all of the difference I have found the ESV seems clearer and closer to the original text.In addition to the translation, I find the format and quality of this Bible impressive.

However, Bibles translations are like tools in my box, and I use most of the accepted translations at different points.NOTE: Do not use the MSG for any reason. This is not a Bible. It's a commentary and contains twisted scriptures that are used to teach false doctrines like \\"felt needs\\" by the Purpose Driven Cult. See Ep 4:29 MSG. Think this is a small matter?

Well if you haven't in a long time this is a book for you! This book starts with an empty universe so God says let there be light and there was light. He goes on doing this for 6 days making animals and plants etc... and create the universe. On the 7th day he rests. From here on this book contains things such as: the downfall of man, a huge ark, Jewish slaves, a newborn king, miracles and the crucifixion of Jesus and an incredible resurrection, also some very inspiring quotes and verses.The theme of this book is the life of Jesus Christ. From his race to Bethlehem to be born, to his doings of the impossible to his tragic death and amazing resurrection. This is part of what makes this book keep you on the edge of your seat all the time while you're reading it. This is all part of what makes this one of the best themes in a book ever.The characters are some of the most believable in any of the books I've read. The main character is the Jewish man Jesus. Nobody knows what he looks like, but a good guess would be long light brown hair, a beard and a mustache just like any other Jewish man. Another important character is Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary likely had long black hair and was a middle aged woman. All characters are believable and you can connect with some of them.The setting is very believable and has great detail. It has settings such as: Ancient Rome, Egypt, Israel and most Middle East countries and some European countries. It also includes the countries customs and geography. It was set around 2007 years ago. (This does not include the book of Revelations which is set in the future.)In conclusion the main idea of this book is believe in the unbelievable. People who should read this book should be able to read a long book and are willing to take there time reading this book and think a little and are maybe tiring to find a path in life. Also for people who are tiring to live there life a better way. This inspiring book is really the one and only Holy Bible."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

All that the ESV has done is to update some archaism, become gender neuter in some places, and taken out the \\"Thou\\" and \\"Thy\\" in reference to God. It is still pretty much the RSV.I find it interesting that both John Piper and Bill Mounce who have served on the translating committe of the ESV, in the preaching and writing, they continue to retranslate the ESV, favoring sometimes the NASB.I thought the goal of the ESV was to be \\"essentially literal and readable.\\" It seems to me like they have failed.Therefore I rate this almost a 2 star, but I will give it a 3 for taking out the \\"Thou's\\" and being gender neuter, without being too ridiculous.Stick with your NASB and use ESV for reference, not the reverse."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Which of course can be taken away at the whim of an all powerful god whenever he feels like playing a game. Like in poor Job's case.Unlike most followers of this book of zeal and hatred, I have actually read it from cover to cover several times.

I want at least one, if not several, ESV's in my stash and liked what I read about this one. Other things equal, I would prefer a single-column layout, but overall bulk of the book cannot be \\"equal\\", at least not easily.Pros:- Great binding and cover, as others have noted- References are just enough, not overbearing like the Study Bible. Readable enough for notes..- Page layout - thankfully unlike some other good bibles, this one opens each book on its own special page with a brief Intro. Nice touch that all should emulate- Paper color is good, and fonts are blackish, although both could be improved [see below]- Made in USA [at least the one I bought was]Cons:- Font is good, not great- Paper is good, not great. 2 things: the color of the paper is not white enough in my view. Compared to the NASB purchase that I compared it to, the latter was whiter, a bit less transparent, and the font color blacker. Secondly, like a lot of modern Bible paper, DO NOT get this anywhere close to moisture. I would imagine if you read this Bible outdoors near the Bay in San Francisco or elsewhere, it would be ruined in short order. The slightest big of vapor hitting the pages causes them to pucker badly, and it cannot be pressed out. One drop of water or anything would be terrible. I have a 30 year old Foundation Pubs NASB single column about the same size as this ESV and it has been through every manner of abuse and yet the pages mostly lay flat and show aging, but not puckering/wrinkling, pulling.- Font is not as readable as the size would indicate. I forget what font selection is used but many of the letters have very thin \\"posts\\".. the vertical lines are very wispy and for my eyes not as readable as a different font choice [fatter, blacker, but not necessarily bigger point size]. No contest between this one and the 'winner' of my quest- Its big. But I knew that going in.- A Temporary problem, according to Crossway, was that the copy I had suffered impressions made on the front and back cover by the 'window' in the box. What happened was that they upgraded the paper in this bible [a good move] but it is now thicker, but they used older boxes to pack them in, so when shrink-wrapped the window of the box left a marked impression of itself on the Tru-Tone faux-skin cover. They said it would eventually work out with handling.All in all its a good addition to one's library, but for me would not serve as a daily driver."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

At first I was doubtful that I would like a larger, heavier bible (having always preached from a Holman Thinline NKJV) but the extra wide margins, coupled with the verse by verse single column make for lots of white space for these little extra notes you need to deliver a powerful sermon.The quality is good, though the cover is a rather stiff at first, it loosens up after about 3 mnths of good use. The pages are good and thick, no flimsy Bible paper in this one. I only write in my Bible with pencil so I can't speak to anything about bleed through.If you want a Bible with the readability of the ESV that is NOT in paragraph form, has lots of white space for notes, and is a good quality Bible for daily use, then this is the Bible for you."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Even though the words should be more important than the packaging, I think the packaging enhances the experience of reading.For any one that wants a nice and inexpensive bible, this is an excellent choice. The bible arrived individually shrink wrapped. Since I also ordered an ESV Study Bible, Amazon place both bibles on a cardboard, shrink wrapped that before placing the whole thing in a cardboard box. The bibles arrived in excellent condition.This bible has a content page, a preface about the translation, explanation of features, section heading, \\"simple\\" textual footnotes and cross reference footnotes. At the end of the bible there is a table of weights and measures and a concordance. No maps.I prefer this binding to a standard hard cover binding. The imitation leather cover looks nice. It has a stamped leather look with stamped self color letters on the spine and a small flame motif in the center of the front cover. It is tastefully done. The spine is sewn, not glued.

Paper is not too thin to cause shadowing problem. The bible overall is thin and feels good in the hand. It can easily be carried comfortably. Will it last? Depends on how you use it I suppose. I think it will last as long as any good hard cover books. The bible was printed in China.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"What is meant by the caption, \\"The Gospels' narrative was known true, otherwise there would be no Christianity today\\"?In the PBS Frontline documentary, \\"From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians\\", Bible scholars interviewed for the program say, \\"Jesus would have represented a kind of activist and resister in Pontius Pilate's experience that he had been dealing with for years, and with varying degrees of success and effectiveness, obviously. Jesus would have been a blip on the screen of Pontius Pilate, because the unrest and the uprisings were so common, part of daily life for the Roman administration of Judea, that Jesus would have been seen, I think, as very little out of the ordinary.\\"and\\"Now I don't for a moment think that Pilate would have been worried that Jesus could have challenged the power of the emperor. That's not the point. The point is, any challenge to Roman authority...any challenge to the peace of Rome would have been met with a swift and violent response.\\"This confirms Josephus' accounts as to what immediately happened to any person claiming to perform miracles in Roman Judea.Between 44 and 46 CE, one Theudas caused some consternation with what may have been a claim to be the Messiah:\\"It came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain charlatan, whose name was Theudas, persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon them unexpectedly, they slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem.\\" -- [(Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98]andThe Roman governor Festus, who was -according to recent research- in office from 58 until 60 CE, was confronted with another rebel:\\"Festus sent forces, both horsemen and footmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness. Accordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also.\\" -- [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.188]Yet the Bible scholars interviewed for this PBS Frontline program fail to explain why Pontius Pilate failed for three years to swiftly deal with the threat of Jesus when if it had been anyone other than Jesus, that threat to the Roman Peace would have been immediately dealt with three years earlier!The PBS Frontline program also fail to explain the similar three-year inaction of the religious leaders in Jerusalem (and Galilee/Perea) to execute Jesus for blasphemy under the Law of Moses, AND why for the next 37 years (before the fall of Jerusalem) Roman and Jewish religious authorities are still refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples and all Jesus Sect members (excepting for three fluke cases: Saint Stephen and the two disciples named James. In the case of Saint Stephen, he was pointed out to the religious leaders of Jerusalem by foreign Jews from what is today Turkey, who were in town for Passover. The religious leaders of Jerusalem were pressed into the arrest and stoning of Stephen by ignorant foreign Jews, otherwise Stephen would not have been arrested in the first place. See my first embedded comment to this review for how the two disciples named James died.)!Note too that during Paul's three-year \\"persecution\\" of Jesus Sect members (33-36 AD), no real persecution is actually taking place in Judea (or Galilee for that matter, since the disciples are moving freely from Galilee to Judea and back), which must of exasperated the newly minted Pharisee. Obviously perplexed, and attempting to \\"impress\\" his superiors, Paul asks (see Acts 9) for a persecution mission to the gentile city of Damascus.Now the gentile rulers of the \\"independent\\" city states of Decapolis (where Damascus is located) didn't allow for the extradition of Jesus Sect subjects to Judea for stoning, so Paul is being sent on a wild goose mission and doesn't know it! In fact, it was on one such wild goose mission (to Damascus) that Jesus had enough with Paul and threw him off his high horse of ignorance. Jesus says to Paul, \\"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\\" Note, Jesus only says this to the obstinate Paul. Jesus doesn't have to tell anyone else to cease persecuting his flock because no one else in Judea is! I bet you never thought about that?The Christian interpretation followed for 2,000 years on this subject is in such egregious and obvious error, that it is a true miracle that it wasn't debunked until now! Roman authorities and Jewish authorities KNEW Jesus was the Messiah, otherwise actions against Jesus (and after Jesus' death and resurrection) would have been immediate and violent for all Jesus Sect members involved.In fact, John 11 (45-55) implicitly tells us that long before Passion Week the priestly leadership of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah (how Christian theists missed this eye-opening passage from John is beyond explanation!):\\"45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.\\"What are we accomplishing?\\" they asked. \\"Here is this man performing many signs. 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.\\"49 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \\"You know nothing at all! 50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\\"51 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.54 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 56 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, \\"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?\\" 57 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.\\"See where the High Priest Caiaphas tells his underlings, \\"You know nothing at all!\\"? Caiaphas knows who Jesus is because the intelligence network he has within the Jesus camp (Rome and Herod Antipas also have their intelligence networks within the Jesus Sect camp, and the agents are reporting that Jesus is unlike the other deluded \\"prophets\\" they've dealt with before, that Jesus is really bringing back to life persons known to be dead and performing other miracles) is affirming that Jesus is the Messiah.Note the inexplicable description Caiaphas makes about Jesus: \\"...he [Caiaphas] prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.\\"Now, if Jesus was merely considered by Caiaphas to be a deluded blaspheming \\"Prophet\\", then when Jesus died, that was it. Jesus would be forgotten. But notice, Caiaphas says about what Jesus' death would bring about, \\"...that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.\\"In other words, Caiaphas not only knew who Jesus was, he knew what Jesus was up to otherwise he would never have made such a blasphemous comment himself about Jesus' death \\"bring[ing] them [the Jewish nation] together and make them one.\\" However, note that Caiaphas is under the misapprehension of Jesus' true mission, which is to die for man's sins. Caiaphas is still operating under the original Covenant God made with man (with the Jews), so he thinks Jesus's death will reconstitute an independent Israel.Now, the next week was Passion Sunday. What happened on Passion Sunday? Jesus arrives in Jerusalem with a large mob. This action was a direct attack on Roman rule in Judea, which put into motion Caiaphas' and Jesus' plan that Jesus must die.Also note Caiaphas' worries about Rome. Caiaphas would have been counting his blessings that Prefect Pontius Pilate hadn't already long ago arrested and executed Jesus for \\"rebellion\\". Caiaphas must have known though that it wasn't just three-years good luck that kept Pilate from doing his duty and arrest and execute Jesus, but that Pilate too obviously knew who Jesus was. But how long could Caiaphas expect Pilate to avert his eyes from Jesus' provocations? Caiaphas had to act, and the Passion Sunday procession was the obvious sign from God that it was time for Jesus to die.This passage from John's Gospel proves that Jewish religious authorities in Judea and Galilee (especially the high ranking authorities) knew who Jesus was.Another proof that the religious leaders of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah, and had no intention themselves of killing Him, was their failure to also arrest His disciples at Gethsemane. In order to operationalize Jesus' mission (as the religious leaders saw it) on Eathh, only the arrest of Jesus was necessary; His death would come at the hands of Pilate, not them, as proved by the three extralegal \\"trials\\" to come, proceedings that ruled out any form of punishment under the Law of Moses (Under the Law of Moses, trials could only take place later, during daylight hours.).This explains why John the Baptist refused to ministry in Judea, and ministry only in Antipas' jurisdiction of Perea (in order to question John, the Elders of Jerusalem had to travel to Perea to do so, because John refused to cross the Jordan River and enter Roman territory). Because John (although born in Judea) knew what would happen to him once he crossed the border into Judea with his disciples and followers: Arrest and execution by Roman authorities, yet Jesus was allowed by Pilate to come and go as He pleased!Since John the Baptist was preaching the Old Testament in Perea (Antipas' jurisdiction), there was no cause to arrest John for blasphemy and leading Jews astray. John was only arrested and executed by Antipas when John specifically railed against Antipas' marriage to his dead brother's wife, who was also his niece.The Gospels' narrative is so ludicrous, so obviously a forged narrative, a badly forged infantile narrative, that the only way it would have been accepted as true by anyone at the time of its release is if the narrative was known to be true already!The Gospels' narrative was known true, otherwise there would be no Christianity today.If I were to publish a history of the USSR under Stalin that affirmed that Stalin allowed the National Socialist Party of Germany to run for elections in the USSR you would immediately know I'm forging history. Or how about a history where Albania was the first nation to reach the Moon in 1959. Now you can appreciate the reactions of any Roman subject when confronted with the Gospels' narrative of how Jesus and His disciples were treated by both Jewish and Roman authorities: Unbelievable, unless known to be true!You see, the New Testament narrative also has the next 9 Roman governors after Pilate also inexplicably refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples who are still performing \\"rebellious\\" miracles (others too besides the disciples are performing \\"rebellious\\" miracles) and attracting large crowds. The Jewish leaders are doing the same...actually protecting the Jesus Sect, where the sect is now tens of thousands strong in Jerusalem alone by the time of Paul's third trip back to the city in 61 AD (the original Greek texts says \\"ten of thousands\\", not \\"thousands\\". New Testament translators couldn't believe the high number, so they removed a zero!).The Gospels' failure to account for the inexplicable behaviors on the part of officials allowing Jesus to live three years beyond which others would have met their deaths, and equally inexplicable failure to destroy the Jesus Sect for the next thirty-seven years before the fall of Jerusalem, is understandable when one observes the precarious situation the new Jesus Sect found itself in. To openly proclaim in the Gospels and other books that found their way into the New Testament that Jewish (and Roman) officials knew Jesus was the Messiah would have forced those officials into actually persecuting the Jesus Sect in order to deflect such claims made in Jesus Sect literature. In other words, for forty years there was a \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy towards the Jesus Sect!In closing, I would like to clear an issue that has perplexed New Testament scholarship for close to a century now, and that is the Testimonium Flavianum, the name given to the passage found in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the \\"Antiquities of the Jews\\", in which the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities, specifically referring to Jesus with the following, \\"He was [the] Christ.\\"It is this reference to Jesus as being \\"the Christ\\" (Messiah) that troubles New Testament scholars since we are told by the early Church Father Origen in his Commentary on Matthew (Book X, Chapter 17) that Josephus did not accept Jesus as Christ. Well, as my research above proves, Jewish officials in Judea and elsewhere did indeed believe Jesus to be the Messiah, though for political reasons kept that belief close to themselves.Josephus' family was wealthy, and his his father came from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Therefore, Josephus would have been well aware of the intelligence reports the Sanhedrin received concerning Jesus' true nature, hence there would be no conflict with Josephus not only accepting Jesus as the Messiah, but knowing Jesus was the Messiah.Christian apologetics is finally dead.Christian verity is born."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I heard about this book from friends and thought I'd try it out. It starts out a pretty decent story about (SPOILER ALERT) some man in the sky creating everything. Some dumb woman eats some fruit she isn't supposed to and all hell breaks loose. It gets a bit boring after that for awhile and I didn't really get that the author had a lot of color in his characters. The part about the boat and all that rain and flooding was pretty cool though, I actually felt like I was there in the story as I myself have lived in flood friendly areas most of my life.In the second half, this long haired Mexican named Jezus comes in and saves everyone. He knows magic and has some of those superpowers like being able to walk on water and separate the ocean (clear rip off of X-Men, but whatever)So just when I'm starting to get a feel for this character they kill him off. I'm like, WTF, ok keep reading.After that it gets really slow for awhile...I pray they don't make this into a movie, cause I'd fall asleep during these parts, but it does pick up at the end when a bunch of winged dudes come out of the sky and start stabbing people with swords.Overall, parts of it are a bit too far fetched to really draw me in and have it be believable. I'd have to relate it Stephen King's work as it constantly switches from slow to drawing you in, then back to slow again. The characters are too one dimensional, the hero dies way too early and he was really the only one with any powers. the man in the sky didn't even really seem that involved with the story and then it turns out him and the mexican Jezus are father and son?

The punishment for any peccadillo is death! It includes a story about how the despot's most faithful follower, a man called Job, loses his health, his wealth and his family just for a wager with the despot's arch enemy. The second part of the book tells how the despot (who is own father) became human himself and instead of liberating an oppressed people encourages them to \\"turn the other cheek\\" and \\"go the extra mile\\". Even worse, the second half of the book forms a new moral code in which the rules are even stricter (e.g. instead of adultery being a crime it is now a crime even to think about it!) and as death is no longer regarded as sufficient punishment the new punishment of eternal damnation in hell is introduced. That punishment will be given to anybody who does not follow the prescribed religion, give all their money to the religion and praise the despot, telling him how kind and loving he is! The book has been used in the past to justify the traditional practices of homophobia and slavery, although nowadays many people who believe in this book claim completely the opposite.Fortunately, the book has many inconsistencies from which anybody of average intelligence can identify it as fiction but there are still too many misguided people around who base their morals on this evil book."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

All that the ESV has done is to update some archaism, become gender neuter in some places, and taken out the \\"Thou\\" and \\"Thy\\" in reference to God. It is still pretty much the RSV.I find it interesting that both John Piper and Bill Mounce who have served on the translating committe of the ESV, in the preaching and writing, they continue to retranslate the ESV, favoring sometimes the NASB.I thought the goal of the ESV was to be \\"essentially literal and readable.\\" It seems to me like they have failed.Therefore I rate this almost a 2 star, but I will give it a 3 for taking out the \\"Thou's\\" and being gender neuter, without being too ridiculous.Stick with your NASB and use ESV for reference, not the reverse."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I tried to get into this book, but it was just bizarre in the way it is structured. In the first few chapters it told of a cute little tale of a guy who got bored, because no one else existed, so this magical man from the sky made him a woman. Yet in the next chapter, they where both born on the same day, but looking past that they went on a picnic and are told not to eat from a certain tree, by this magical man in the sky; but they do it anyway, cause the plot needed some sprucing up at that point. So the story teller wrote in a talking snake to convince them to eat from the tree, which resulted in the man in the sky telling them off for doing so, it just wasn't the kind of ending I hoped for.It got even more bizarre after that, there was all these fictional stories that did not tie in together. One in particular I was reading was about this guy who was informed a flood was coming, by that dude in the sky again, and he gathers two of every animal on the entire planet, and manages to get them in his boat. He must have had a big boat, cause even today's largest freight ships could not possibly fit 2 of every animal, but it never explained how he managed to get 2 of every animal in the world to all meet in the one spot, or on the same land for that matter. And how did he manage to get all the animals to co-exist, or survive? When my cat is in the same room as my dog, they tear the place up as the cat runs for it's life.. which just makes me wonder what it was like on that boat when a Lion caught site of a Buffalo, or an Elephant caught glimpse of a mouse.I also did not quite understand these Jews that escaped from Egypt and wandered around the desert for 40 years and forty nights. Yad think they might colonize or figure out whoever is leading them is walking them around in circles. I find it even harder to believe the group did not split up and say, \\"if you find a civilization, send back a search party... and some sleeping pills, cause this being awake wandering for 40 days and 40 nights is pretty tiresome on our bodies, we could all use a good power nap now\\"... they did find a burning bush that talked to them, but I think it was something else of mother nature burning away that made them see this, cause if they wanted me to buy into this part of the story, they should have had a return by the talking snake in a cameo appearance.The thing that kind of scared me about this was there was all this talk about how people should live there lives. Some of it sounded good, like don't kill people or boink your neighbors wife, even tho she is your neighbor, sounds kind of sexist if you ask me, but I did not like these options that you can stone your children to death if they disobey you, and you can have a slave... wait, what? You can have a slave? that sounds so wrong... oh wait a minute, you have to free them after 6 years, ok, phew, I was worried there for a second that this book might send out some wrong messages.There was also this really gruesome stuff about the guy in the sky getting mad and killing people with a plague, and taking away all the first born children... but yet, he supposedly loved each and every one of them no matter what... sounds kinda messed up if you ask me, and I would not recommend electing this guy in the sky as your leader, especially when it comes off sounding like the guy has split personalities and most likely is bipolar. There was also a lot of contradiction; Things like, telling people they can not kill anyone, as murder is just not on; but yet later says you can stone your kids to death if they disobey you... but then I did find this part that made me realize you get another option, and that is to sell your daughter into slavery or prostitution... which sounded wrong to me at first, but hey, it's better then murdering her I suppose.I did not like the authors homophobic tendencies he wrote all over the book either. There is supposed to be the rule it set that you can not kill someone, they refer to this as a deadly \\"sin\\", yet in it's own words in many parts says any homosexuals should be killed.There was so many more things in this book that just shocked me, and I found the mixture of brutal horror in with children's fairy tales to just not be the sort of thing that should be combined. It's a weird book, and doesn't seem to have much continuity going for it, but overall I can see why it is so cheap to purchase, and why I have been in so many Motel rooms where people have left their copy of this behind."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The ESV is notably less gender inclusive than the NRSV, but it is not a complete reversal either. Unlike the NIV or NRSV, I find it to be well written and readable. My only real complaint is the bad deviation from the RSV. When the man forgives 2 people who can not pay him back, (One owed him 500 coins, and the other owed him 50 coins.) Jesus asks Simon who will love him more. The RSV has Simon answer: \\"I suppose to whom he forgave more\\" (\\"Luke\\" 7:43). Sadly, the ESV does not keep this vital passage.

The ESV translation of the New Testament is wonderful, and they have also included Psalms and Proverbs which is great.4 stars for the actual book:This is actually not as small as I expected, and size was a major reason why I bought it. I measured 3.5 x 4.625 x 0.625 inches at home. While this is small, it is not really tiny. I have a couple of KJV mini-NTs which are a few tenths of an inch smaller in each dimension, which makes them much less noticeable in my pocket. By the way, the KJV translation tends to say the most with the least words, so that may be part of it. However I have also seen a tinier NLT pocket new testament and that version is almost the opposite of KJV, a paraphrase, so one would expect it not to be as brief. This ESV mini NT has nicer, more luxurious leather cover which tends to make it a bit bulkier than most pocket NTs.Another minor complaint is that the pages are a bit transparent, which makes extensive reading less pleasant at least to me. I have seen more transparent pages on other Bibles so this is not really bad. However, one of my tiny KJVs, which was also cheaper, has wonderfully opaque pages. With Bibles, you need to look at them in your hands.Strong points:- section headings in small but bold font (easy to find \\"Jesus calms the storm\\")- words of Christ in red (more purplish red)- verse numbers and footnotes are tiny and don't get in the way when reading (way better than many other small Bibles)- cover and binding seem solid, hopefully will last longer than most pocket BiblesOverall I would give it 4.5 stars.

Also, the construction of this bible seems to be better than my other ESV (same publisher). 5 stars!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Other reviewers complained that there are no chapter links. I'm not sure if it is new, but the version I downloaded recently has both book and chapter links. At the main table of contents, there are links to all the books of the Bible in a single list. Once you select a book, the first page of each book has links to all the chapters in that book. It works really well that way. I can find any verse in three clicks. And the whole Bible is searchable. That along with the ESV translation means a great addition to any Kindle."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a review for the Kindle version! I love this version of the scriptures, so no complaint there. This is the full ESV version. Navigation is where I have the problem. Like another reviewer of a different version, I have some problems getting around. You can choose a book from the table of contents like you would choose a chapter in a regular book, then pick the chapter, but then you must page forward to get to the verse you want. This could be time consuming for long chapters. Also, verse #'s are the same size as the text so they can be a little hard to find. I have used MyBible on my treo for a couple years now and the navigation on it is much easier! Also, MyBible gives you the option to switch between other purchased versions with 1 click while staying at the same point. I will be carrying my Kindle to Sunday service and to Bible studies for at least a couple weeks unless I can't keep up while searching verses, then it would have to be back to the treo or hard copy, which I would hate because I love the Kindle screen and size so much better. I hope other publishers working on Kindle versions take the ease of navigation into consideration."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I have been very impressed with the English Standard Version since its publication in 2001. Of the multitude of English translations of Scripture available, it may well be the best combination of accuracy, readability, and literary quality. Up until now, the one major disappointment, as many other reviewers have noted, has been the rather poor quality of publications in which it was available.WIth this new edition of the Classic Reference Bible, it appears that Crossway has finally achieved the goal of providing a high quality ESV Bible. While the text, references, footnotes, maps, and concordance are identical to the already published Classic Reference Bible, there are, in my opinion, three unique improvements in this edition that commend it to anyone who loves and prefers this wonderful translation:(1) The print type is larger, a 10.5 size (vs 9.5 in the original Classic Reference), which makes it easier to read. This is especially true with regards to the references and footnotes, which were practically illegible to my 40+ year old eyes.(2) The wider margins allow notetaking, a real plus.(3) While I don't claim to be a binding expert, it does appear that the binding used (at least on the genuine leather edition) is of a higher quality than on the original edition, which is a much needed improvement.In summary, I would commend this edition of the ESV without qualification, unlike the earlier editions."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I'll start by saying the ESV version of the Bible is wonderful. This presentation of scripture is eloquent and flowing. I would recommend this version to just about anyone.Now about the binding . . . I own two ESV bibles. I purchased the Heirloom Reference Edition about a year ago, and was beyond delighted when I received it. The Heirloom binding is thick and luxurious. The pages are also thick, egg-white in color, with very generous margins, and \\"large\\" print. It is one of the finest Bibles I own.I wanted a second less expensive ESV Bible to purchase for outside-the-home use. Thus I purchased and began using the \\"Premium Bonded Leather\\" version on July 1, 2006 (three months ago). First of all, it does not feel like bonded leather at all. More like \\"leatherflex\\" (which I believe is textured paper, made to look like leather). More importantly, the binding performs like leatherflex. It does not bend; it creases. Yesterday after only 90+ days use, the spine SPLIT. I can identify about four additional places that will also split in a matter of weeks. Also, the edges are worn down. I have always wanted a worn-out Bible like Kay Arthur's or Beth Moore's, but not this soon. This Bible is in worse shape than the Bibles that I have used extensively for several years.If you are interested in this version, I would recommend purchasing the Heirloom Edition. Granted, it is quite a bit more expensive; however, a Bible is a lifetime purchase, and the Heirloom comes with a lifetime guarantee."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Crossway put this out very quickly in response to Kindle user's asking for it so they are to be commended in that respect. I will second the previous reviewer's issues with navigation, it is difficult to navigate with. I did a short test and timed myself with a paper-based Bible and the ESV on the Kindle. It took me about 5-6 seconds to look up most verses with the paper-based Bible and about 20-25 seconds on the Kindle. Nerdy, I know, but it is a good way to reference this Bible. This is more of a Kindle hardware/software issue though and not necessarily anything to fault Crossway's ESV Bible though.I think the key to fixing this issue involves a combination of Bible publishers and Kindle software designers help. You need to be able to have the ability to search only within the book currently being read so that when I run a search it will not attempt to search all books (which is slower than searching a single book). The ability to jump immediately to the pages that contain the text I searched for rather than having to select the result from the \\"search results preview screen\\" would be good as well. Also, the Bible publishers need to have the commonly searchable names for the books of the Bible in the text so that when I search for Lam 1 I will get Lamentations 1 without having to type in Lamentations, which can take a while to type in. I know this is just partial-text searching, but that doesn't seem to function properly with the current Kindle software release (1.0 121380292 still, I haven't received 1.0.4). It also might be good for the Kindle to have the ability to search through \\"hidden\\" text. Maybe a tag could be wrapped around text that you'd like to search for but would not display while reading, this way I could search for \\"Psa 119:129\\" and I could jump directly there because this verse would have \\"Psa Psalm 119:129\\" in meta-text that is searchable but is not displayed.I know we're only talking a few seconds to navigate, but when you are doing any kind of in-depth Bible study or if you have a pastor/preacher/teacher that likes to jump around the Bible a lot, this is actually pretty important. [...].In summary, I would recommend this version. It might be nice to see cross-references or some of the other ESV editions that Crossway publishes (Literary Study Bible!) in the future but I'm sure these will come as the Kindle catches on."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I have been waiting for an ESV that had enough room for copious notes. The \\"Journalling Bible\\" was not it (the type was too small and thus the space for notes on each verse was limited). The \\"Deluxe Reference Bible\\" came close, but had margins that were just a bit miserly.The \\"ESV Single Column Reference Bible\\" is an excellent bible for study. The ESV translation is one of the best, and the page arrangement of this version is ideal for taking notes (and there is some room for adding to the cross-references, if one desires to do so).The TruTone cover is a nice artificial calfskin; it is so supple and soft that you will feel decadent. Two buddies who borrowed or handled mine actually commented that they wished they could afford such a nice Bible. I didn't get it to induce covetousness, but it is nice to know that SOMETHING I own might be droolworthy.This is a fine Bible, but not perfect.The \\"Single Column Reference Bible\\" is just two strokes off par. These have been mentioned by others, but I think deserve acknowledgment:First and foremost, the pages are indeed thin. One particular example of this is that the bleed-through of printing from the back of each page actually is as dark as the (gray) paragraph marks on the page one is reading. I have had Bibles that had thinner pages, and one can adapt to them. Still, I am approaching the age at which I appreciate any eyesight help that I can get.In addition, the type is a bit harder to read than that of the \\"Deluxe Reference Bible,\\" being both smaller and less heavy.Had this Bible used the paper of the \\"Deluxe Reference Bible,\\" I think I would have little to criticize (except, of course, the unwieldly thickness it would then possess).As it is, I find myself using this Bible quite often for casual verse look-up, and generally carry it to church and bible study. The note-taking space seems to be most important to me in those venues. For most reading and at-home study, I still prefer the \\"ESV Deluxe Reference Bible.\\"If you really want a Bible with room to make plenty of lengthy notes, the Single Column Reference Bible will probably be satisfactory. However if you can get by with modest note-taking space, or if bleed-through from other pages really reduces readability for you, then you would probably prefer the \\"Deluxe Reference\\" over the \\"Single-Column Reference.\\"By the way, for any Bible (including this one) that has enough bleed-through to be annoying, you might find it useful to keep a couple of sheets of black paper tucked inside the Bible. If you put one of these behind the page you are reading, the print from the backside is much less noticeable (although the whole page will sort of look gray)."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I enjoyed reading the RSV for many years but was disappointed with the NRSV for its lack of consitency and its awkward implementation of &quot;inclusive language&quot;. The ESV is a very well done updating of the RSV. It retains the literalness, accuracy and eloquence of the RSV while updating the language to modern usage. It takes a more consistent and sensible (in my opinion) aproach to inclusive language. I always found the NIV language to be too simplified and the NASB too rigid. The ESV reads beautifully (even better than the NKJV) and has become my preferred translation over the many I have tried. Finally, a suitable replacement for my old, beloved RSV. I was also glad to see that this edition does not have a red letter New Testament. Somtimes its hard to find a nice bible that isn't red letter.This black genuine leather bound edition seems to be very durable. The gold-edged paper is strong and thick enough so that the printing on the reverse side of a page doesn't bleed through much. It has wide margins and the print is easy to read. I expect (and hope) it will last for many years of daily reading. It comes with pretty good CD-ROM software that lets you quickly look up passages on the computer (It would be nice if there were a Mac version instead of just Windows) and cut &amp; paste them into a word processor."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I do like this copy of the ESV. In fact, the more I use it, the more I like it. The pages are decent quality, and the suppleness of the cover is a treat, as this bible stays open and lays well in the hand. The print could be a tad darker--more bleed through? presently it is very little-- for my tastes, but the single column paragraphed setting, with decent font and white space, allows for a pleasant reading; essentially like reading any other book. And our bibles really should be read, right?The size is perfect, which is why it got five stars (plus the surprise mentioned below). It is a mere 3/8\\" taller and wider than myNKJV Pitt Minion Reference Burgundy French Morocco NK443XR. It is noticably thicker, however, due to the single column setting, coming in at around an inch and a half (the Pitt Minion is around an inch, but is double column--very readable, with nicer paper and cover... I digress). It fills the hand well, and is perfect for portability. It is a great small bible that is not little.One note: the references--and this is genius!-- are located at the inside of the page, so the text is always easily read. This is like myESV, Single Column Reference Bible (Black, Premium Calfskin Leather, Black Letter), and this makes the references so easy to use.I was just looking at it closer today, and may be pleasantly surprised. I do believe I notice individual sewn signatures, and I also saw stitching inside the crease, so I believe this binding might be sewn! (Or else it is a hybrid sewn/glued, if that makes any sense.)That, and a nicely designed cover that is liquid-like, makes this bible a keeper. A person who prefers this translation (probably the most reliable and accurate, while remaining VERY readable--it has not gone the way of the gender-neutral tide) would not regret this edition, in any of the covers. I gave my sixth grader myESV, Personal Size Reference Bible (Genuine Leather, Black)which I bought cause it advertised the sewn binding. I tried to give her this navy/khaki, but she wanted the 'quality' version... I may have ended up the winner (well, we both win, actually--this form factor is superb).I think the ribbon could have a sibling, however. Who uses only one ribbon?!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The ESV is a wonderful version of the Bible. The purpose of this review is not to discuss whether you should purchase a Bible or whether you should purchase an ESV Bible. This review will focus on this particular ESV Bible.This Compact TruTone edition is a very small and pretty Bible. It'll fit practically anywhere and you can carry it with you whenever you want. The cover also has a very nice texture to it. The colors of the cover are a shade darker than the Amazon photo and, in my taste, better.Unfortunately, the print is very small. You can still read it with moderate ease, but trying to read more than a few chapters at a time will strain your eyes. Also, because the Bible is so small, you can't leave it open on your lap or table. It has a tendency to close itself unless you have a hand on it to keep it open. I definitely do not recommend using this Bible as your primary Bible.I originally purchased this Bible because I wanted to have an ESV Bible to read texts in parallel. I ended up liking the ESV so much, that I tried using this as my primary Bible - and that's when I learned all the impractical problems of a small Bible. I now keep it in my car's glove box for those moments I want my Bible in a bind.Three stars for this particular edition. (Five stars for the ESV.)For day-to-day ESV use, I now useThe Reformation Study Bible: English Standard Version."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Now that I am in my 50s I wanted a Bible that had larger print and I found it in the ESV large print edition. I bought the leather bound copy and it is a truly fine Bible. It comes with a ribbon marker (to keep the ribbon from fraying dab a little clear finger nail polish on the bottom half inch of both sides of the ribbon). The leather is stiff but will soften as it is held and also saddle soap can help. The 12.5 point font size is wonderful. It is so refreshing to read a Bible that is simply the Bible text and nothing else. There are translator notes which enhance the ESV but there are no cross references with this edition (which I am happy with). Just to sit and meditate on the pure text is something I wanted. The ESV comes in many fine variations- the Reformation Study Bible is terrific, their reference editions are also very fine. As far as being a good translation- this is bound to give the NIV, the NAS and the NKJV a real run for the money. I find it is elegant, precise and reverent. All in all, this is worth every penny of investment to have a large print leather bound Bible which with a little care will be a treasured companion for life."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I have just received my Heirloom Reference Edition of the ESV Bible and I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this bible! I have waited a year for this edition to come out. When the ESV debuted last year, I inquired of the possibility of a high quality binding. I was told by Crossway that they had one planned for this year- so I waited. My expectations were exceeded and it was worth the wait. Even though this is an expensive bible, if you consider the years of use that it will give you, it's really a frugal choice in the long run. This is a bible that is built to last a lifetime and from what I can tell, it will. The genuine calfskin binding is the best I have ever seen, it's supple and flexible, with no synthetic inner lining, instead there are actually 2 layers of the finest calfskin. I simply can't say enough about this binding, for those of you who may be having a hard time with it's price, let me just say that there is a very substantial difference in quality between this edition and their standard edition, in other words, it's worth the extra money. They have also widened the margins for notes and the paper appears to be more substantial than a standard ESV Bible. If you know of anyone who uses this translation and spends a substantial amount of time \\"in the Word\\", this would make the PERFECT gift. The ESV is a great translation that the publishers describe as \\"essentially literal\\" which, in a nutshell means that the tranlation is literal and yet has flowing readability. I have used the NASB for years and I find the ESV to simply be easier to read and yet I don't find that any of the specificity or accuracy has been compromised in the ESV translation. This is my personal assessment of this translation and I am not, by any means, a biblical scholar but then again- careful attention to the Word of God has not been reserved only for \\"biblical scholars\\"."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I'm not a big fan of the NRSV because it oftenuses inclusive language in a way that can distort the meaning ofthe underlying Hebrew or Greek. There is also a subtletheological bias in the NRSV (i.e., Gen 1:2 \\"a wind from God\\" vs\\"the Spirit of God\\") that I don't care for. When I heard that someonewas going to do a new revision of the RSV -- which is a fairly good, literal text -- I was excited.The ESV is more inclusive than the RSV but less than the PC NRSV.Good. It includes the most current scholarship. Good. These arereasons that the ESV is better than either the RSV or the NRSV.However, the Crossway / Good News printing leaves much to bedesired. The print is too small. The line breaks on poeticpassages are awkward and difficult to read. The concordance atthe end of the Classic Reference edition is inferior to a similarconcordance in my NIV Classic Reference Bible.My advice: get a paperback ESV, but wait until a more establishedBible publisher (Nelson, Zondervan) takes a shot before you spendbig bucks on a leather edition.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I was given an original hardbound copy of the ESV Bible several years ago and my wife and I started reading through it together. We had both grown up with King James versions and had started using the Darby version a lot because of the accuracy with which it was translated. We were quickly won over by the ESV for its tremendous readability while maintaining an accuracy approaching the Darby (which is very cumbersome). I soon bought an Heirloom Reference Edition ESV for myself and my wife used the hardcopy until it literally fell apart.I bought this beautiful TruTone version as a gift for my wife after a lot of research. It is compact without being tiny, has most of the reference material that the ESV is so strong on (it has a smaller concordance than my Heirloom version, but still substantial), and looked to be very attractive from the online photos. I was not disappointed when my wife opened her present. This is a very nice looking Bible. I'm sure an expert could, but I don't know that I could tell the cover from genuine leather. The colors are warm and rich.My main concern was with the durability of this Bible, especially after our hardcopy (and hardcopies that a couple of friends owned) fell apart. This has not been an issue with this TruTone version at all. We have had this version for a good while and used it extensively and it has held up very well.I have no reservations about recommending this ESV Classic Reference Bible."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Crossway has done a betterjob with this edition of the ESV, but I would love to seeCambridge publish the ESV!The translation itself is excellent for study, preaching,teaching, and devotional reading. It is &quot;literal&quot;, but notso much so that there is no literary style. The literarystyle is very much in the Tyndale/KJV tradition. This isdue to the fact that the ESV is a slight revision (6% I'mtold) of the RSV. The RSV still remains one of the besttranslations available, but needed some updating.I recommend the ESV Deluxe Reference Edition withoutreservation. Again, it is the best edition of the ESVin print and the ESV is a good translation for study ofthe Holy Scriptures."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The English Standard Version (ESV) is an excellent compromise between the readability of the New International Version (NIV) and the literalness of the New American Standard Version (NASB) Updated. I especially like the way the ESV captures the poetic flow of the Old Testament which though not like modern english has a beauty that should not be lost. In the New Testament the ESV does a much better job than the NIV in retaining the connections in the text &quot;so that&quot; you can get closer to the writer's argument. This flow is especially important in the Pauline espistles. Traditional interpretative phrasing is retained. So, move over NIV.Many people are praising the &quot;heirloom&quot; edition binding. I have not seen that binding, but the regular Deluxe leather binding is not very good. It is better than the hardcover which I had which fell apart. The pages are crinkled or bubbled towards the page edge attached to the binding. The pages crinkle when I turn them. I compared the leather ESV binding to the binding of my NIV Study Bible and my old NASB Bible and found that the NIV and the NASB have a far superior binding. The pages turned easily on these latter two Bibles and lay flat in the Bible near the binding point.The type font is bigger in the Deluxe version compared to the classic version, but I still find it difficult to read. The font type and the spacing is not as pleasing as that in the NIV and the NASB. I use my NASB or my wife's large font NIV when I want to read the text easily while preaching. Sometimes, I create notes with enlarged versions of critical texts taken from the ESV online or the CD-ROM. Your eyes may vary from mine.So, get this Bible if you want the ESV in its most accessible and probably most durable form to date. I give the text 5 stars, but I give the binding and font only three stars."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

This cover is made from Trutone, an artificial leather which is soft and flexible. Trutone is a high quality artificial leather which should prove to be close in durability to bonded leather. Artificial leather book covers such as this haven't been on the market long enough to know for sure. The European hand-stitching adds to the beauty and durability of this Bible. Size: 5.5 x 8.5 inchesWhat's inside?The center-column cross-reference in this edition includes over 80,000 cross-references. This is very useful when studying God's Word. The text size of this edition is 9.5 point type, which is very readable, and would be good for devotional reading, or study. The format of this edition is double-column paragraph format, with subject headings. The ESV Classic Reference edition is a red letter edition. The paper is thin, and has a semi-transparent quality. I do not recommend using highlighters in this Bible. If you like to highlight passages I recommend crayola color pencils they work best on thin paper.

I am very impressed with the amount of information found on this site.To the best of my knowledge there isn't a Catholic Edition of the ESV.My Personal OpinionPersonally I feel that the ESV Classic Reference edition is great for devotional reading & study.This Bible is great for devotional reading because1. The ESV is easy to read & understand.2. With the word Concordance you can pick a topic, and read about it in your Bible. (with out using Google)3. This Bible is large enough to be easily read, but light enough to carry with you to Bible study classes or church.This Bible is great for study because.1. TheCross reference system.2. The word concordance.3. The ESV is an essentially literal translationOver all I am very impressed with the quality ,and style of this Bible. Maybe one day Crossway will print this edition with the Catholic or Orthodox Canon. Being a Catholic I would love to see how the ESV would translate the book of Judith or the story of Susanna in the 13th Chapter of Daniel (which one of my favorite Bible stories). The Classic Reference Edition would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys reading God's word. The style of this cover would make a very good gift for Father's Day."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"ESV Single Column Legacy Bible - 9781433530876 - Trutone Brown/CordovanI just received this Bible today, and I'm very impressed. It's strictly a black-letter, paragraphed text Bible: no references (or rather, only a very few), no study notes, no introductions. The page layout is very much like a \\"normal\\" book, i.e., single column instead of the usual two columns of text. The only place where the publisher has continued the typical practice of Bible layout is by including chapter and verse numbers within the text itself. I'd have preferred to see these numbers consigned to a margin (like the original edition of the New Jerusalem Bible), but I really don't mind the verse numbers. Unlike some ESV Bibles, the verse numbers are not in bold, so they don't stick out so much.A wonderful feature of the page layout is that subject headings are not allowed to break the flow of text. They are printed on the page but appear in the margin beside the text, so you can ignore them if you want.Another reviewer complained that the font is too small. I disagree. I think this font is quite readable -- it's not large, but it's certainly larger than the font in most Bibles. To me it seems just right.The Bible overall is bigger and heavier than I expected -- and I would honestly have preferred it to be smaller. This Bible is not something you will be able to easily toss in a backpack or briefcase. But the size feels \\"right.\\" In other words, it's inviting. I find that I keep wanting to pick it up, open it and start reading.Two other minor problems for me: in my opinion the white space on each page is excessive, especially in the area beneath the text. The bottom margin is fully 1 1/4 inches, but the top margin seems to be just under 3/4 of an inch. It's surely odd that the top and bottom margins are not equal.Also, I find the spine is rather stiff. Since the inner margin on each page is pretty small, I have to carefully, but with some difficulty, bend open the gutter to make the pages lie flat enough to read without difficulty. (This is a strong contrast to the ESV compact Bible I also have -- the pages open flat very easily in that Bible.) I expect this will get to be less of a problem over time.Yet all these criticisms are picayune. This is a beautiful Bible. I would go so far as to say I've been waiting for a Bible as attractive and inviting as this one for years. It has class. It has beauty. Sitting on my desk, it simply *wants* to be read.Another improvement in this Bible over previous ESV editions is that the publishers have dropped the very short, and to me simply worthless, introductions that they've put into many of their other text Bibles, such as the compact Bibles. The latter is small enough to fit into a pocket, but the publisher crams the silly one-paragraph introductions into it. But they're gone from the Legacy Bibles.On the other hand, there's still a short (75-page) concordance and eight pages of maps in the back. Not really desirable for me, but okay, no problem. Maybe if I ever need to find a verse reference with a common word in it and don't have access to google, I'll use the concordance. But today I tested it with the first word that came to mind -- \\"Amminadab\\" -- and it's not in this concordance. Oh well.And this is a great translation. I'm not someone who gets into the \\"translation wars.\\" I like lots of translations -- NRSV, New Jerusalem, New Living, as well as oddball versions like those of Richmond Lattimore, Reynolds Price, Everett Fox, Robert Alter, etc.; they're all great to me. And of course even hoary old King James is not to be sneered at. But more and more I find myself using as a \\"basic\\" translation the ESV: it's traditional, it's accurate, its tone is about as \\"high\\" as you're going to get in a modern version, and it's literal enough that many literary elements of the original languages come through. Maybe it can't always be instantly comprehended by a sixth-grader, but so what? That's what commentaries and other versions are for.In conclusion, I love this Bible, and I think anyone who wants a Bible for actual *reading* -- not just referencing or giving as a gift or carrying around as a fashion accessory -- will love it too. My final score: 9.5 out of 10.PS Now I'm just waiting for the soon-to-be-released Clarion Reference ESV from Cambridge: who will win the \\"reader's Bible\\" award -- Crossway or Cambridge? The world waits with eager anticipation ...EDIT:I just noticed this Bible is actually larger than the Crossway website claims it is. Crossway says it's 6\\" x 9\\"; in fact it's 6.5\\" x 9.5\\". That extra half-inch makes a difference: the Bible is bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Since a half-inch could easily be removed from the very wide margins on the pages without affecting the size of the type, it's puzzling the size was increased. But if you like wide margins for note-taking, this will be a plus. On the down side, that extra half-inch means this Bible won't fit into a standard medium size Bible case -- and a standard large size Bible case is a bit too large. Of the Bible cases I've tried, the one that fits best is the large thinline size made by Gregg. (A better option than a Bible case would be a tablet computer sleeve like theCase Logic VLS-110 Sleeve for 7-Inch to 10-Inch Netbooks and iPad.) As for weight, keep in mind this Bible is rather heavy at 2 lbs 10 oz.Also, regarding verse numbering, I just noticed the Legacy ESV does place verse numbers in the margin for poetic texts such as the Psalms, and it works quite well.Finally, after spending some more time reading from the Legacy ESV, I notice the spine is quickly becoming \\"wrinkled\\" -- it's very soft and apparently is *so* soft its shape is becoming distorted from holding the Bible open for any length of time. It's not a serious problem, and this is, after all, an imitation leather binding, so I don't expect perfection. But it's too bad all the same. Better quality bindings will perhaps not have this problem."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"ESV is A+ That being said, I'll talk about the bible rather than the version here -- you can check out the version online etc.A lot of shaky ratings on this, but I think its quite good! Let me provide you with the facts, which I can do because I own this, returned the calf skin one and the hard cover.It is 12.75 text. The best thing you can do is print out something from MS word to get an idea. I don't know the font style which would make a difference, but its similar to Time New Roman in a 12ish area. It is definitely a good size.People are complaining about the light print and terrible paper quality. The font is not light, its just not full and bold. At 12.75 It really doesn't need to be. The print is dark, its the font style that lacks the boldness and I have no problem with this and really think its smooth and a great bible to read for long periods of time. Paper quality? hey I heard great reviews that the calf skin large print had better paper etc and this is not what I saw. I'm not saying the others are lying -- they may have changed something. Its the same exact text style and darkness and paper as the $140 calf skin large print. Perhaps one may argue the paper is slightly better, but I honestly saw no difference between the two.The binder....yeah its pretty poor and the bonded leather is really stiff which is why I couldn't give it more than 4 stars. The $140 calf skin one definitely has a better binder, but its the exact same bible inside and is it worth a $100 for soft leather and a better binder. I haven't owned it long enough to tell you how long it will last. I think If you wear this out you'll be happy to spend another $37.In my opinion this deserves 4 stars. The calf skin one probably only deserves 2 stars due to its price. 12.75 is LARGE.I definitely like it....You'll have to evaluate things for yourself... you can always return it etc"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

It's a decent translation, basically a conservative evangelical modernization of the revised standard version. I would recommend this bible to friends."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I'm a pastor who studies in the original languages for my sermon prep. My wife knows I have grown to love the ESV, and gave this to me so I could have a physical copy (I use BibleWorks 7.0). It's very close to the Greek/Hebrew text, yet very readable in English. So no more do we have to choose between the extraordinarily literal NASB or the very readable NIV (but not as close to the original). The ESV will most likely become a major English bible, if not THE English bible in the next ten years or so. It truly is a wonderful translation...and that is the most important part of a bible that you purchase.This bible is light, easy to carry, and feels so wonderful that everyone who picks it up immediately has wanted their own copy. It's a red letter edition. One reviewer criticized the paper quality. I think for a $20 bible you cannot expect 'the moon'. The paper is not bad, it's prettygood in my view. The printing does bleed through the page a bit, but it is not too strong, and I think that is typical for a thinline inexpensive bible.The one criticism I think is worth considering is that this bible has no cross reference system. It would be really great if they could adopt something like Greek NT cross reference system or something that is accepted by scholars from a cross section of the Kingdom. A good cross reference column would make this bible busier than I would like it to be, but it might be very handy for bible study.One positive feature not mentioned is the 12,000 word concordance in the back. It's very good.The fonts are large enough that I can read this bible without glasses. That's a great feature for those of us who are past 40. I have a lot of bibles. This one is just a great bible. If you need something readable and small, it is the very best ESV I have been able to find. If you want just a readable ESV, I recommend the more expensive single column leather, because it is more enjoyable to read and has a great cross reference system.One more note, if you are into the latest...be aware that in January 2007 Crossway released a digital update of the ESV. That means that digital versions in professional grade software like BibleWorks 7.0 have a slightly different version than these printed copies. I found that out during a bible study on Romans 8 when someone read a paragraph for me.In my final view, I think every English speaking Christian should get a copy of the ESV. I have become a great fan of this wonderful translation, only after doing careful exegesis and my own translations of many paragraphs in the New Testament. In those projects I have compared the ESV, and usually six or seven other translations to my own work and I've found that the ESV is almost always the very best translation. For anyone who does read Greek or Hebrew, this version is a real must. If you've been reading NIV for years, I recommend you make the switch to this new version. We just moved our entire congregation to this bible and people do seem to really love it!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The book itself is very compact and is a great match for anyone looking for a small quick Bible to stash in a backpack, purse, or jacket pocket. The type font is small (size 6.5) but for quick reference it is clear and works well. I would not suggest it for long extended reading (say 30 minutes plus) but for quick reference in class or else where this Bible works well."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a red hard cover pew edition of the English Standard Version (ESV). It is in paragraph format and is black letter. There is no self-pronouncing text. Translator's notes are included, as are a limited number of cross references. The latter are on the bottom of the page. The study aides are limited to 32 pages at the end of the bible, a table of weights and measures, followed by responsive readings.The 10 point font is a little larger than most bibles, and the overall size of this bible is larger than normal. The edition is well bound and stays open by itself once opened.The one problem is bleed though, something which most bibles have and this edition probably has less than average. When looking at a page I can also see the text from the other side of the page. The paper is between onion skin and normal book paper, and is thick enough that is difficult to read the next page through blank spots on the current page. All in all the bible is readable even with the bleed through, especially if a page is held up while being read.If someone is looking for an ESV without study aids, this bible will serve them well."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Well I was excited when this Bible finally arrived. That was until I took a close look at it. It was pretty much what I'd expected: small print, relatively compact, cross references, nice \\"trutone exterior\\" = a cool looking new version. Like many others, I like the ESV. So what's my problem? It's the quality. Does Crossway have a quality department or are their standards just low? The spine of this Bible was obviously off center...resulting in the \\"ESV\\" insignia, etc. being off center. Thus the back flap was slightly longer than the front (if that makes sense). This might seem picky but this my second Bible (1st was a thinline) like this from Crossway. I kept the first one, but this is ridiculous. Like the President says: \\"Fool me...once....shame on.................you?.....You can't get fooled again!\\" I know it's an inexpensive version, but they can do better! I guess I may have to wait for the upcoming Cambridge editions.PS. This is my first ever return to Amazon and I must say it is an easy & painless process."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I think there is no way one can give the Bible, based solely on its content, anything less than Five Stars. No other collection of texts has shaped so many lives and so many Civilisation as this text, which remains the most read and most Valuable on the Planet.By it, we are taught all of Humanity and how it is, the True Wisdom of all Ages, and of God himself.So instead, I shall review the Translation, and the Book as a Product.This is a Pew Edition, and a hard Cover, but not overly heavy and the cover is Durable. It will last a good while and through use. The Print is excellent and readable, on solid white paper and with pure Black Ink. The pages are well Glued and Sewn and the Binding Strong. This Bible will be a very good, adequate one for Home or Church use.The Translation itself is an Improvement over the New Revised Standard Version, which it was a revision of. While still retaining some Gender Inclusive texts, it is by and large a Bible that allows \\"Men\\" to be \\"Men\\". It doesn't try to make them \\"People\\", or discuss \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" unless this is what the Text says.The Text follows a Formal Equivalence, and does so well, keeping the text as close as possible to the Original meaning as written, rather than trying to interpret the meaning. They also attempt to make this readable by rendering the sentences in a way that is consistent with modern Speech. Its not small feat but they manage. Even though in some passages this is Clunky, overall it flows nicely.It also inherits some errors from the RSV and NRSV. In Proverbs Chapter 4 Verse 7 for instance, this text, the RSV, and NRSV say \\"Insight\\" when the KJV and most other Formal Bibles say \\"Understanding\\". I think Understanding conveys the meaning of the base text better and is far more understandable to the daily reader.Still, they keep \\"Virgin\\" as \\"Virgin\\" in Isaiah 7:14 instead of \\"Young Woman\\", following in this regard only the Catholic Editions of the Revised Standard Text.If you are a fan of the RSV but want an Updated Text that's not as Gender-Inclusive or that's a bit better than the NRSV, then I think you will like this Text. If you are a Bible Student who wants a Reliable Bible to study, this one is a good Primer, too.I still refer the KJV but, overall this one, which is a Child in the same Family as the KJV, is a fine addition to anyone's Bible Study Library."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The ESV Thinline Bible (TruTone, Midnight, Flame design) is a very well made Bible for around $10 at the time of this review. The size of the Bible is perfect for reading, writing, and highlighting. I like this type of Bible for pure reading since it doesn't come with cross-references, chapter introductions, or study notes. The imitation leather is very pliable and feels great on the hands. I easily give this Bible 5 stars. I did notice that WTSBooks offers the exact Bible but with different colors for $7.79 if you're interested in buying at least $50 worth to get free shipping.Buy this Bible and most importantly READ YOUR BIBLE, don't let it sit in the car, on your shelf, on your nightstand, or worst on display. As the Lord said to the prophet Ezekiel,\\"And he said to me, 'Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.' So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat. And he said to me, 'Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.' Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.\\" Ezekiel 3:1-3 (pg 693 on this Bible)King David said of God's Word:\\"The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.\\" Psalm 19:7-11 (pg 456 on this Bible)May the Lord raise a new generation of men and women who will love God's Word and delight in that which is sweeter than honey."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I got this Bible because it was seven dollars and less than an inch thick and I needed one for my backpacking, but the more I read it the more it becomes my favorite. The translation seems to capture God's wildness more than the NIV I'm used to. \\"The LORD roars out from Zion\\" in this version, not \\"raises up a shout\\" (comparison from passages in Joel). I love it. It can get a little repetitive because it is literal, such as saying \\"the house of Aaron\\" over and over again, but that just makes me want to dig in and see what about the house of Aaron was so special as to be mentioned six times in one psalm. The cover has stayed remarkably clean, it stays open when I'm studying, and the pages have taken a fair amount of abuse so far and bounce back every time. It doesn't have archaeological notes and commentary, but I was looking for a straight up \\"this is God's word\\" kind of Bible and I got it.

The imitation leather feels terrible and the gold tipped pages also look cheap. If you are looking to give it as a gift, there is no presentation page, or place to mark down important family dates. If, on the other hand, you are looking for an inexpensive Bible that you can give away, this would be a good one to buy.

It's trutone cover nicely mimics leather in both appearance and touch. It feels much softer and durable to the hand than the bonded leather and is soft and supple. The ribbon marker is a handsome gold color that matches the rest of the bible, is attached firmly, and is long enough to use easily. As another reviewer mentioned the ribbon is also already bent for you and makes it really easy to use compared to several of my other bibles, very handy. The layout of the text on the page and the font used are easy to read if you have normal eyesight or corrective lenses. This is a pocket bible so if you have trouble reading small fonts you should probably get something in a large size. There is a nice sized concordance in the back of the bible which is nice for it's compact size. By the way the dimensions are 4x6in (10x15cm) and only 3/4 of an inch think (2cm). My copy states on the copyright page \\"ESV Text Edition: 2007.\\" and I am very pleased to have the latest update to the ESV available in this bible.CONSThe binding does not permit the bible to lay flat. I wish it was sewn similar to some of the other ESV compact bibles, but it seems that it is glued. I hope that the binding holds up over time, and it appears that it will, however if it were to lay flat and was sewn I would be more confident in the binding. Additionally, the pages are a bit too thin. I would have preferred to leave out the concordance and have some slightly thicker and more opaque pages. My major complaint about the ESV compact bibles from Crossway is that they are Red Letter editions. Hopefully in the future they will make an offering with black letter text, but for now that is not an option.SummaryIf you want an affordable and attractive compact bible than this is a great choice. It feels good in the hand, is easy to use, and the translation is one of my favorites. I bought it for it's pleasing aesthetics, the excellence of the ESV translation, and finally because the handy size is the same as my Moleskine for weekly use at church.

This draws my eye away from the text and sometimes makes it harder to follow what I am reading. That may not be an issue for some, but it is for me. These types of marks in my previous bibles do not distract me to the extent as the ones in this bible.

Bibliophiles will delight in simply handling this calfskin-bound volume, and those of us who are advancing toward what a ministerial colleague of mine likes to call \\"the high middle ages\\" will appreciate its 10.5 font size -- a significant improvement over the 9-point font used in all the Classic Reference Editions. Prospective buyers should be aware, however, that this is definitely not a compact, travel-sized Bible. Its larger print and wider margins necessitate a book that's not as portable as other editions of the ESV. Nonetheless, if you appreciate the many virtues of this fine translation, and are looking for a truly beautiful edition that will stand up well to daily use, I would recommend this one without reservation."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I picked up a copy of the ESV a few months ago. I had heard that it was accurate yet readable. I am happy to say that this is absolutely true.I've always used the NIV for general reading. Lately, I've wanted to do more intensive studies and found myself drawn to the NASB. This is a good translation for its accuracy but not so good for general reading or reading aloud. The ESV is very good at both accuracy and readability. I also have no trouble following along when someone is reading from the NIV.This translation has, I think, the potential to become one of the foremost Bibles for the 21st Century. It achieves a new standard for it's accuracy and attention to the English language.My compliments to the translators."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I could not use it, and will be sending it back. I finally ordered one through a local bookstore, after some research - apparently there are no standards qualifying what 'large print' is.I ultimately purchased one touted as 'GIANT LARGE PRINT', which is still not as large as the print in the LP books you rent at the library, but at least my Mom can read it OK."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a decent bible for the price. The cover is certainly supple and high quality. The drawback is that the inside of the bible is no different than the much less expensive genuine leather version, which costs considerably less. The paper is the same and the imprint pressure seems to be even less solid; the lettering of the genuine calfskin edition seems more faint than the cheaper versions. So you'll have to decide if you want to pay that much for an improved cover, b/c no positive changes can be found on the inside. It's exactly the same if not slightly less quality. I've owned both the genuine leather and the genuine calfskin, and consider the genuine leather to be a better value.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Honestly, if you're looking for an ESV (English Standard Version) Bible that's simple, accurate, and compact, this is the one you may want to give serious consideration. It's simple in the way of being a single column, paragraph formatted text that reads like any other book and it has a minimal reference column that aligns itself on the inner portion of the page (toward the binding). The soft, pliable imitation leather is appealing and allows for the binding to lay flat when the pages are opened. From someone who is a student of Biblical Hebrew, the ESV has been accurate, thus far, as best as the English language is able to communicate the depth and richness of the language it was originally written, with the fewest exceptions. It's compact in that the font size is large enough to comfortably read, yet this ESV's dimensions allow for the portability that most other reference Bibles do not have and it contains a sizable concordance.If you're looking for an ESV that has the words of Messiah (Christ) in red, you may want to consider another format. If you're looking for an ESV that contains maps, this might not be the one for you. If you're looking for an ESV with a plethora of references, another ESV size might suit your needs. If you're looking for an ESV that doesn't have headers over various sections of Scripture, let me know when you find one in this same format!But let me say this: I don't think a Bible should be complex and difficult to handle, much less stressful for the man or woman seeking to choose between what translation to purchase, what the cover should be like, whether or not there are enough cross references, and so on and so forth. I think choosing a Bible should be simple and easy and with the intent of wanting to understand God and know him as he has revealed himself. I've chosen to use the ESV Personal Size Reference Bible as my only version of the English Scripture text because of its simplicity, accuracy, and compact size. I hope you'll consider this in your search for your next primary use Bible."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I will warn those who don't read the description or who don't know that size 8 type is tiny, if really small print bothers you, select a different Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"While the English is good, it strays highly from the original texts of Greek and Hebrew.It still attributes the Gospels and some of the letters to falsely assumed authors, when these are mostly anonymously written. The two genealogies still don't match up, though I know that changing the text to match would be forgery. The Genesis account claims people lived to be 500, even 900+, years old. There are talking snakes, donkeys, and 7-horned beasts. Each resurrection story differs on who is actually at the grave. Mark still includes a resurrection story, when the oldest of original texts do not include it. The supposed letters of Paul differ on theology: In one instance he says there is no difference between woman and man, but in 1 Timothy he essentially tells them to STFU. In Numbers 31, their god tells the godly to kill all men, women and boys, but to kidnap and rape the little girls.This is a horrible collection of barbaric books, and should not be considered a moral code. The complete collection (which spans 2000 years of fables, commands, murder, rape, revenge, cheating, and myths) is horrible and should be discarded immediately. However, ALL should read this silly book before burning it. You will not get pass Leviticus without spewing."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I have always preferred real leather, but as a cost issue I went with the TruTone. The cover has proven very durable and feels good to my hand. In response to the complaints of some reviewers about the thinness of the pages in the SCR generally, this particular edition supposedly has 24-lb paper instead of the 21-lb paper used in all other editions of the SCR, so if paper weight is an issue, this one might be the best choice.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I went into the Bible with high expectations; after all, it's the only book to outsell Quotations from Chairman Mao, and that's an instant classic. However I'm glad to say that the Bible did meet my expectations. From the first chapter to the last, the Bible is a real page-turner, full of nonstop action, suspense, romance, and plenty of laughs.The Bible starts out right off the bat with an episode of Andy Kaufman-esque surreal humor, featuring two naked people and a talking snake. It just gets better from there, with some of the adventures including a talking bush and a talking ass (talking snakes, talking bushes, and talking asses? What exactly was on the author's mind when he was writing this?). It seems like with every chapter the book gets better, and even when reciting centuries-long genealogy, the author manages to keep it interesting. Although I don't want to spoil the whole book for you, let's just say that you get to find out who begot Ezra, and believe me it wasn't Nehemiah.The main character of the Bible is an ultra-powerful superhero/wizard named God, clearly in the mold of previous literary characters such as the Green Lantern and Harry Potter. While I do think that God's back story could have been fleshed out a bit, he was otherwise a pretty well-developed and complex character. One of the best things about the character is that the Bible is not afraid to show him as a flawed individual; on numerous occasions throughout the book he demonstrates jealousy, anger, mean-spiritedness, and the willingness to commit murder and genocide on large scales at the drop of a halo.Also adding to God's character development are his Pete Rose-like befuddled quotations, many of which make little or no sense or even outright contradict each other. For instance, in an early part of the book, God says that he thinks birds are bats and rabbits chew cud. I mean, what? But seriously, the mixed-up quotes add a lot to the humor of the book.The main antagonist of the Bible is the Devil. While I would have liked some more motivation behind his character (and a more creative name; I mean, it's just \\"evil\\" with a D on the front) I'd say that the Devil is a worthy nemesis for God.The most important secondary character in the Bible is God's son, Jesus. In one of the best parts of the book, Jesus must go undercover as a human in order to trick the Devil. I don't want to give the whole story away, but just when it seems like it's curtains for Jesus, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Although it does seem as if the whole Jesus subplot was sort of tacked on at the end, the character provides plenty of great dialogue and his down-to-Earth practicality acts as a foil for God's more humorous one-liners.Another aspect adding to the Bible is that, similar to Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby, it has an unreliable narrator, leaving it up to the reader to decide what has really happened. An example of this is the two contradictory accounts of Creation, and the four contradictory accounts of Jesus's life.My biggest problem with the Bible is probably the tone, which seems a bit uneven. At once it can be a screwball sex comedy worthy of Woody Allen, with a woman trying to convince her fianc&eacute; that God is the reason why she's pregnant, but the next instant it'll be a dark comedy, with a bunch of babies being killed. I guess I'm not entirely sure what point the author was trying to get across.Thematic issues aside, I'd say all in all it was a pretty good read. It was no Bhagavad Gita, but I did think it was more entertaining that the Koran. I'd give it a four and out of five, but apparently Amazon doesn't have a feature."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I await the Heirloom edition; an upgrade from the Deluxe edition.1) 10.5 pt type - real plus for over 45 crowd with impending bifocal issues...me.2) Translation: Very good, readable, preachable translation, given the manuscript it came from.3) Not a Textus Receptus manuscript translation. KJV & NKJV readers will wonder where parts of verses went: answer, original manuscript.I upgraded to the Heirloom, and thus am choosing the ESV for focused use because many people have trouble even with the NKJV in our culture. Theological terms are hard for the average reader and both the KJV and NKJV retain these. This is a plus for the purist, traditionalist, and the scholar, but not the uninitiated, the lost, or the newcomer to Christianity.The unintended bennefit for those purists out there CAN BE, that those parts of verses that the underlying ESV Manuscript do not include requires you have to know the Bible even better: to retain that information while teaching, counselling, or preaching. This discipline in the purist actually makes them KNOW the WORD of God more thoroughly...or at least it can facilitate this end.In the end, I would rather reach the needy ear than to impress a scholarly sensibility. The average reading competency in this country is only to the eighth grade. The NKJV is written at an 11th grade reading level and the KJV at the college level. The ESV is accurate to its underlying manuscripts, reads at about an eight grade reading level and yet has a unique ability to penetrate the ears of listeners with God's truth in an undiluted clarity.4 out of 5 stars: Due to underlying manuscripts used, not due to any fault in the actual translation."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The pages are easy to read and the typeset looks very clean, simple, and modern. There is even a nice concordance in the back which might be useful for some people. It doesn't have red-lettering but that's why it's so cheap I guess. Also, the size of the Bible is not as compact as some of the pocket Bibles out there, but that's the tradeoff for having easily readable print.

But, inside this inferior piece of work lies one of the finest English translations of the last fifty years. However!! Customers be aware!: In Summer, 2005, I, and many others, received an e-mail asking for suggestions for changes, because the English Standard Version Translation Committee is now working on a revision already!!!! It will probably be out in 2007. Everything is pretty hush-hush. The egalitarian folks on a few websites are probably pushing for more inclusive language. So, maybe purchasing ANY ESV should wait until the revision appears. Back to this edition. The print is fairly large(12.75),a better font could have been chosen, and could be darker. The ribbon marker barely extends beyond the bottom page. The spine cracks easily in front and back(already sent one back to Crossway for this). It has book intros and a fairly concise Concordance. Most Crossway Bibles are garbage.HEY CROSSWAY!! If you can't make a decent Bible, give the rights to folks who can and will!!! As for me, I love the ESV, but I'm using real quality editions from Foundations Publications who do the NASB."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The ESV Revised Text Single Column Reference Bible, mouch touted, has arrived. This is a large edition in Black True-Tone, which surprisingly feels extremely soft and supple, akin to the much more expensive edition. The cover is plain, thankfully, without 'Holy Bible' scrawled all over the front.It is printed in Belgium, and I haven't noticed any of the weak spots where the spine starts cracking and separating from the pages like most Crossway junk Bibles do. However, it is, again unfortunately, glue-bound. The ribbon marker is a good length. The main emphasis here, unfortunately, is having wide margins; ergo, we are once again stuck with sub-par print. The print appears to be the size of the print used on the Classic Reference edition, which is 9 pt.(I have been told that it is 10 pt). Very, very disappointing. This Bible is in verse format, with the tiny reference column on the side of the page. Book Intros, in teeny-tiny print, are in a shaded grey area at the beginning of each book. A 72 page Concordance with teeny-tiny print is also present, along with coloured maps from Moody Press in the back. A real plus for me is that this is a black-letter edition---no red letter text whatsoever. That is a blessing. On the whole, this Bible is better than some, and worse than others. I am really disappointed with the size of the print. But, I have been disappointed with most Crossway Bibles since they started in 2001. What is it with these guys and small print? Is it an obsession? The NASB editions from Foundation Publications are MUCH better-made; the pages are smyth-sewn, and the print is good-sized. Unfortunately, they don't make the ESV. Crossway needs to get their act together or find someone else who can publish their Bibles for them.(Note 4-12-07: Finally saw a Genuine Leather edition. Not impressed at all. Get the Tru-Tone)."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I recently had to give my ultrathin NASB Bible to my son. At 40 I was having trouble seeing the print. So, I ordered the ESV, which seems similar to the New King James and NASB. The first one I received had defective leather, but Amazon shipped me a new one with two or three days.The print size does not seem bigger than my Ryrie Study Bible or Open Bible, but is very clear and there is good line spacing. The margins are wider and that helps too. The paper is a good thickness and I do not find the many center column references to be distracting.As for the translation, after much study and review, I have switched to the ESV as my primary translation. I use it for reading, study and memorization. The text has a nice flow and reads similar to other more literal translation. At my first sitting, I read through the first 15 chapters of Revelation.So, this Bible is highly recommended and a good buy."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This Bible visually is wonderful for studying. The wider margins are very convenient, the single column format spreads out the text, the size of the text is larger than most Bibles and the I have enjoyed the Enlgish Standard Version. Another thing that is good: all of the verse numbers are in-line (the same vertical column), so finding verses throughout the pages is a piece of cake. The size and spacing of the text helps me not to strain my eyes and provides a little room to circle, underline, box words, et cetera. As several other people have mentioned the pages are thin (that is why I did not make it five stars). However, the thickness of these pages is quite comparative to my compact Bible, which is not preferable but is manageable. All in all, I really like this Bible because it is the ESV and is geared towards \\"sit down for a while\\" Bible study. If I worked for Crossway I would try and make the pages a little thicker, and at the same time I thank and praise God so much for allowing me to have the opportunity to draw near to Him through His revealed Word. We are so blessed to have things like amazon.com and all these Bibles, please remember to thank God for that."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The ESV is easily among the best of the modern English Bible translations. (It compares favorably with the New International Version, the New King James Version, the New American Standard Bible, and the Holman Christian Standard Bible.)It is definitely more of a word-for-word translation than most of its counterparts. However, it flows much easier than either the NKJV or the NASB. On the other hand, it avoids sounding too informal (like the HCSB).Overall, it is a nice balance between the \\"formal\\" NASB and the \\"dynamic\\" NIV. It's just a shame that this translation is often overlooked due to a lack of agressive marketing on the part of the publisher.Don't be afraid to add one more translation to your personal library. The ESV is worth adding to your collection."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I own several of the Nelson Signature Series Bibles as well as the Cambridge Concord Bible bound in genuine goatskin. This ESV edition is simply outstanding. The binding in genuine calfskin is thick and yet soft and very pliable. Smooth as silk. The overall construction is nearly perfect. It feels good in your hands. It smells great. The paper is thick enough, and the margins wide enough, for notetaking. The print is very readable. Two ribbon markers.The translation has been discussed in many other reviews, so suffice it to say that the ESV is a more accurate translation than the NIV, more consistent than the NASB, and more readable than the NKJV or KJV. It is the \\"scholar's\\" Bible.This Bible is also now used and endorsed by one of my favorite theological writers, John Piper.Well worth the investment!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

NOW I can see! The giant type is not really so giant as it is reasonably sized. I can now back off from the pulpit a bit and still see the verses. No more squint and back/forth with the Bible for me. Might I suggest that THIS font become the standard, and a larger one be used for the giant print?

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I have just received my new Heirloom Reference Edition ESV and I am absolutely delighted. Is this the bible I have been looking for, for over a decade? Probably.1. The ESV is an excellent translation - reliable & readable. More reliable than the NIV, more readable than the NASB.2. The binding is a sumptous premier calfskin, leather lined, smyth stitched for durability. It is an aesthetic delight.3. The Comprehensive cross reference system is among the best available & there are useful foot notes, a compact concordance & some excellent Moody bible maps.4. The print is bold & clean, the page layout is crisp & clear,the wide margings (0.75 inch) are large enough for notes without crowding the text.Are there any criticisms? No. But I think a couple of tweaks could have been made, which are somewhat subjective.1. I would like to have seen India Paper used rather than ordinary bible paper. On a bible costing [this much], the best available paper should have been used - this editions' paper is OK, but not top draw.2. I would like to have seen Art Gilt Edging (Red Dye under the gold leaf) as in the best Cambridge Bibles. This adds an additional lustre to the bible, and remains when the gilding has worn away.3. The free CD Rom with various bible helps is OK although I think I would have preferred a larger discount on the bible and no CD Rom! I expect that the people who will spend this sort of money on such a quality bible will already have access to a large seleciton of comemntaries & bible study aids.Despite my personal preferences, I think this is probably the best available bible on the market today. No one who buys it will be dissapointed. It is a delight to the senses.

Like other reviewers, I have been quite underwhelmed by the printing and binding on Crossway's bibles.The pew edition is a pleasant exception. The binding is superior to the classic and deluxe classic editions (excepting the heritage edition's binding, although the heritage still has a terrible layout and poor print/paper quality). The printing and paper quality are better than the classics/deluxe classic, and this edition features an easier to read font.I bought this expecting a cheap fealing \\"gift bible\\" type edition. What I received was a very nice, almost full sized (9\\"x6.5\\") edition that has a quality very similar(although not quite as nice) to a Cambridge Hardback. I have been very pleased.Downsides-no leather (IMO this would make a near perfect version), no concordance, and no maps. Still, I would say this largely overlooked edition is the nicest yet in the ESV, which is quickly becoming my translation of choice. If Crossway could put out a leather volume of this quality the the ESV might become more of an NIV killer. This translation has it all-it is a literal translation without the clunky unatural language of the NASB. Truly a magestic translation. I Can't wait for a great leather edition to come out, but until then this inexpensive ($...) edition will probably become my main Bible.In Christ5 stars Translation, 4.5 stars binding (hardback only)"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The more expensive ESV pew Bible is bigger and the words bleed through the pages (and so I would not prefer it even if it were cheaper). This smaller one does not have transparent pages (the slight downside to this is that the pages are not bright white) and it is the perfect size (i.e., it is not so small that the font is unreadable, but it is small enough that it is not at all cumbersome or intimidating). The only material on the pages other than the text of Scripture are [a] occasional footnotes, mostly having to do with translation variants, [b] the section headings, which are helpful in getting to know one's Bible, and of course [c] the chapter and verse numbers.

From the unique font (Garamond) to the Trutone cover (that feels really good, by the way), this Bible is beautiful. The design is elegant, yet functional, and the size makes it very transportable.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"The accuracy of this translation to fully modern English sets it apart from the NASB, which retains outdated language, and from the NIV, which at times sacrifices accuracy in an effort to make it more easily understood. Written at the tenth-grade reading level, the ESV is not for small children, who would benefit more fromLuther's Small Catechism, with Explanation.The ESV is revision of the RSV, but without some of its biases against supernatural Christianity. Likewise, confessional Lutheran scholars have noted that the ESV more literally translates some highly sacramental passages, including 1 Peter 3:21, than some other Protestant translations. However, like most other Protestant translations, the ESV includes the deuterocanonical books of the New Testament (the \\"antilegomena\\"), but not those of the Old Testament (the \\"Apocrypha\\").By design, the ESV takes a less biased approach to sex neutrality than the TNIV."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I write as a professional translator with knowledge of a large number of languages and, particularly relevant for the present book, a good knowledge of NT Greek and a moderate knowledge of Biblical Hebrew.Over the years, I have come to see more and more clearly that \\"literal\\" translation, so beloved of conservative Christians, is an impossibility. People buy a Bible that touts itself as a very literal translation, and they then think that they have a pure, unimpeded line to the Truth. But the fact is that there are millions (I mean this literally, not as rhetorical hyperbole) of decisions about translation that must be made in a volume the size of the Bible. A great many of them are made so automatically that the translators are virtually unaware of them, particularly if the translators aim to produce a \\"literal\\" translation. They have so many preconceptions that guide their interpretation of the vocabulary and even grammar of the text that it is probably safe to say that 95% of their decisions are predetermined by their prior assumptions about what the text \\"must\\" mean.Even so, in view of the large number of decisions to be made, even 5% is still considerable. There is room to debate the meaning of specific words, many of which can only be interpreted properly if one has sufficient knowledge of the cultural and religious milieu of the writers and revisers of the original texts--and if one is willing to make use of that knowledge. Often, particularly in Hebrew, the Masoretic text is rather garbled, with the result that it is impossible to determine exactly what was meant (see 1 Samuel 13:1 for a famous example). Yes, the translators arrive at conclusions that they put in their texts, sometimes with alternates in footnotes. But the average reader must bear in mind that these decisions are *probable* (some very, some slightly), not definitive and indisputable. Thus, no matter how \\"literal\\" the translation style, there is always at least a little uncertainty about the meaning of many passages.Another issue about which I see people get worked up is translation style. Hebrew has one style, Greek a very different style, and English a style quite distinct from either. Yet literalists are convinced that there is virtue in clinging as closely as possible to the original word order, regardless of how unnatural an even uncommunicative this makes the resulting English.Well, if you are looking for a literal, ponderous style only a shade better that the NASB and considerably below that of the NIV, this translation is for you. I bought my copy a few years ago and used it some, but I was quite unsatisfied with its woodenness. I would much rather read the original languages, and that is usually what I do, particularly with the NT. It's amazing how good Greek becomes such bad English when \\"literally\\" translated."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

While I still lean heavily on the New American Standard Bible (NASB) for study, the ESV is not only right next to it during study (along with a couple others) but is becoming my preferred translation for general reading. It's just as readable as the NIV, but more accurate, and more elegant and memorable in terms of style. I'm very happy to see it growing in popularity.I was very pleased to find this ESV New Testament. I wanted something small to make it easier to carry so I had the Word with me more often. This is just slightly larger than a Gideon NT. I have Bibles on my iPhone, but I don't always want to suck up my battery. Besides, I think it's important to occasionally take a break from looking at screens whether big or small. There's something about the printed word that helps us slow down.The print quality is crisp and while the font is, of course, small the typeface is very readable. I have a couple of other pocket NTs and they are not nearly as readable.The TruTone cover is wonderful. I have other Bibles with TruTone covers and have found them to be soft, pliable, and very durable. Out of the box, the cover is beautiful, smooth black and already very soft (not at all stiff like bonded leather). If it's like my other TruTone covers, it should soften up more with use.When I decided I wanted a small NT I knew I would prefer the ESV, but I wasn't sure what I'd find since the ESV is still relatively new.

Crossway has finally upgraded the paper weight and it is now more suitable for note taking (with the right pens). The cover is nice & durable. The font is readable. The margins are sufficient.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a handsome, inexpensive compact Bible. The Imitation Leather cover is very good considering the price.The ESV is my favorite Modern English translation, except for when I compared the ESV translation of Psalm 2 with the RSV translation. Verse 2:12 can't be translated \\"Kiss the Son\\", for \\"Son\\" would be the translation if the passage were translated from Aramaic. However, the entire passage is in Hebrew. A good translator can't pretend there is an Aramaic word in a Hebrew document. Certainly, many words in Hebrew are the same as in Aramaic and Arabic because these are all Semitic languages. However, not this word \\"bar\\". It is \\"son\\" in Aramaic, but not in Hebrew. The RSV has \\"Kiss his feet\\", which is closer to the original. Neither would be supported by the Septuagint, which was used by the early Church. But thats another story for another day. None of this makes me want to give a rating of less than 5 Stars.Other than this one complaint, I really like the readability of the ESV, and much prefer it to the NIV. If one prefers the Majority Text, there is always the NKJV, but I believe one can be conservative doctrinally and still use the Critical Text. For those of the Reformed Faith, the ESV translation is available as the Restoration Study Bible. Lutherans might want to look at the ESV Lutheran Study Bible, which is due out in October 2009. Keep one of those study bibles by your night stand, and keep the ESV Compact Bible in your briefcase or purse or coat pocket."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

The cover is made from Trutone, an artificial leather which is soft and flexible. Trutone is a high quality artificial leather which should prove to be close in durability to bonded leather. Artificial leather book covers such as this haven't been on the market long enough to know for sure. The European hand-stitching around the edges of the cover adds to the durability of this Bible. Size: 3.75 x 5.75 inches x 3/4 thickWhat's inside?The text in this edition of the compact ESV is 6.2-point type, which is about average for compact Bibles. There is a deluxe edition of the compact ESV with larger 6.55-point type text, if your looking for a more readable edition. The format of this edition is Double-column, paragraph format. I do not recommend using highlighters in this Bible. If you would like to highlight passages I recommend crayola color pencils they work best on thin paper. The paper also has a semi-transparent quality. The pages are edged with silver gild, which matches the cover & silver ribbon marker very well.In the Front1. Presentation Page2. Table of Contents3.

If you are looking for the kind of TruTone covers on the other thinlines, then do not get this. I am torn as I like the inside and updates but the cover is just trash.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I love it! I have been a NASB advocate for years and years because it is a literal, word for word translation. But I have always had a little difficulty reading parts of it because it does not flow, I think some have described it as 'wooden'. The word order of the NASB follows the word order of the original texts, but this is not the typical word order of American English.For the past several years, though, I have been considering the ESV. It, too, is a literal translation but the word order is adjusted to help the text to flow. The result is a very literal text which is very readable and therefore easier to understand.The single column format also aids the reading, it makes the text similar to a book we all read. It is just easier to follow. Being a pastor, the single column also helps me when reading the text aloud and preaching/teaching from it. Paragraph format of many Bibles makes it very difficult to locate specific verses while preaching.As the title explains, I consider this translation and format almost perfect. The only issues I have is this version does not put the words of Christ in red and it does not capitolize pronouns referring to deity. I know these are not a deal breakers, and do not change the accuracy or the validity of the translation. But, dare I use it again, these make the reading and understanding of the text a little simpler.I really like capitolizing pronouns of deity, even beyond the fact that it simplifies understanding to whom the pronoun refers. There is the respect issue, capitolizing the pronoun is a way to differeniate between reference to ordinary people and God. It just seems a way to show respect for Him. I guess, in a way, the same is true for the red letters.As I say, these are not deal breakers, maybe more a personal preference issue. The ESV is a great translation because of its literal adherance. What God had to say is vitally important, and the way He said it helps us understand His intent. The ESV is a great translation because it present a literal translation in a readable form and if people do not read the Word of God, they cannot understand it and know what God has said. The single column format is great because it adds to readability and makes it simpler to find references quickly, even in personal study or a group Bible study enviroment. All in all, I think I will stick with this Bible for many years to come and, when looking for another one I would probably purchase it again, especially if the publishers ever make it a red letter edition!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Although there is no perfect translation of the original manuscripts. The ESV is well written and the translation philosophy of being \\"transparent to the original text\\" make this version truly worthy of study.

It makes finding verses easy and there is plenty of room for notes on the margins as long as you don't use crayons. In reading some of the other reviews. Of the other hardcover bibles that I own. They all seem to have cheap paper and a hi-lighter pen will bleed through. That why I now use dry hi-lighter pens and I have had no problem writing my notes with red gel pens.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I find the ESV translation to be one of the best translations available for accuracy. I also like the NASB. I will not spend time discussing the translation as many have already done so. What I'd like to address is the binding quality and general construction of the Genuine Leather edition.I actually returned my Bible because of the, what I will refer to as, poor quality of construction. the pages are attached to the binding in such a way as the paper near the binding is \\"puckered\\" up and down the entire height of the page. As someone else noted, this makes the pages crinkle when turned and something is just not right about this. I even called the publisher to discuss this issue and the person I spoke to went into the warehouse and opened another Bible which had the same problem I was describing to him.Furthermore, the genuine leather cover is nice quality leather but the way it is put together and attached to the inner pages is suspect. Particularly the back cover...there is a 1/2 inch wide, thick strip from top to bottom, where the paper is attached to the leather which causes the leather to \\"crease\\" at this point. Over years of constant opening and closing, I suspect this could be problematic to the longevity of the leather cover.So unless Crossway can improve the quality of construction of this Bible, I'd research other options.I rate the actual ESV translation 5, the genuine leather cover and binding method 2, and overall I give it a 3."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I received my copy of the Crossway Heirloom Reference Edition today and I must say that I am disappointed with the quality of this bible.I am in a strait betwixt two here as I certainly don't want to slow the adoption of this excellent translation through a negative review, but I have to be honest and admit that Crossway just can't get it right--even when they so explicitly try to produce a high quality edition. The calfskin leather of this Bible is of a fine quality, exactly like the premium calfskin Bibles from Foundation Publications or Nelson's Signature Series. This is not \\"Bible\\" leather like a Cambridge calfskin or goatskin with it's wonderful smell; it's more like \\"shoe\\" leather and smells like a new pair of shoes. For some reason this has become the standard of excellence these days. The paper looks to be the same as that used in their hardback Deluxe Reference edition, a bit of a disappointment in a Bible with an msrp of $195.00. Both the Foundation Pubs and Nelson's Signature Series calfskin's use a fine french-milled paper that is a positive delight to see and touch. This is most definitely not a premium paper--India or otherwise. Perhaps the most disturbing flaw is that the \\"puckering\\" mentioned below in the genuine leather edition is also present in the heirloom calfskin edition--absolutely inexcusable in a Bible at this price point. The pages are puckered or bubbled at and between the stiching where the paper is joined at the inside edge to the binding materials. And, yes, it does \\"crinkle\\" when you turn the pages. I truly don't know what the good people at Crossway were thinking when they priced and released this edtion and can only conclude that they simply don't understand Bible publishing.This is all doubly disappointing as I love this translation. My recommendation is that you purchase the hardback Deluxe Reference Edition and pray with me that Crossway will stop all work on new editions and focus full time on getting the ESV into the hands of a publisher that can produce a quality Bible. In the Feb/Mar 2005 timeframe P&R; Publishing will be coming out with The Reformation Study Bible English Standard Version. This will be the first publisher besides Crossway to offer an ESV edition and I hope they are successful. I too would love to see a Cambridge edition of this wonderful translation."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I love the single column verse format layout of this Bible. For many years I used the NASB in a single column format and I've grown quite fond of it.Unfortunately, this one is published by Crossway. It is glue bound and if you've used Crossway Bibles in the past, you know they are good for about a year of moderate use before the pages begin falling out. I would be fine with that just to have the ESV in a single column format. But, the paper is so thin on this one that I find it unusable. Looking at the page, the impression is that there are actually three pages vying for my attention. It's just too distracting to consider using it.Compare this bible to Foundation Publication's Side Column Reference edition in the NASB. The NASB is about $15 less (MSRP) than this bible in the hardback. For $15 less you get a smyth-sewn binding, lovely layout, and high-quality bible paper that stands up well to note-taking with very little bleedthrough. The only thing you don't get is the ESV, and that is what I would prefer."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is the large print edition of the ESV, bound in black premium calfskin leather.First off, the print size is definitely large at 12.75 type, too large? I'm not used to print this large in my Bibles, so if you read from this one frequently it would probably make all others seem quite small. My 42 year old eyes appreciate large print, but I'm afraid this may make them lazy. I think Foundation's NASB Ultrathin Large Print Reference Bible has the perfect print size for me(maybe a 10-11 pt.type).As for the calfskin leather binding, I can't imagine a more luxuriant leather bound Bible. The Above mentioned NASB ultrathin reference calfskin Bible has a very smooth, silky feel, almost slippery. This ESV has a thicker, more textured, sturdier feel to it. The spine detail and feel is most impressive.Now for the page layout, it is similar to the classic reference edition but without the center-column references. The text and book intros are the same but in a blown-up type. The type is very dark and clear and sharp with the exception of the red letters in the New Testament, which are rather faint. Would have been much better with all black letters. The text is in two-column format with no references, only footnotes. There is no extra margin space for notetaking. Bible text fills entire page but does not seem crammed.The paper seems to be of higher quality than in past ESV editions, there is little or no bleed through. Paper would be good for note-takers, but there is little room for that. I know some reviewers have gripped about Crossways paper quality but there is nothing wrong with this Bible's paper.I sold my ESV single-column black tru-tone edition after purchasing this one but wonder if the single-column calfskin edition would have been the way to go because it is a black letter edition and has cross-references and not so giant of print. But make no mistake this is beautifully crafted Bible and worth the purchase if you need extra large print.As for the size of this Bible, it does not seem too large at approx. 7\\"x 9 3/4\\"x 1 1/2\\".Has two attatched ribbon markers, which are a little on the short side.In conclusion I think this is wonderful edition of the English Standard Bible, my only disappointment is with the red letters. Also if they had reduced the print size a little and added cross-references without the book intros, it may have been almost perfect."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"With possibly one of the strongest opening lines in history, the Holy Bible really starts off swinging. Here we're not only introduced to the main character, named God, but are also informed that he's some sort of magical being (whether that's a vampire or a wizard or something, we don't know yet - we just know he can fly and shoot laser beams). The prose in this section is simply top notch, and you'll find that the action, atmosphere and language of the Holy Bible are carried off with a master's touch. But accompanying this impressive show of skill is also one of the book's greatest flaws: Verbosity. One of the first things they teach you in any writer's workshop is that every word in a novel should be integral to the story; never leave anything in that doesn't absolutely need to be there. So, while we as readers start the book all sweeping through demons and darkness like Ronnie James Dio - rocking out and firing lightbeams and building people out of dirt - it all quickly gets bogged down in unnecessary detail.As readers we're enthralled by the mystic action; wondering exactly what kind of creature this God is, why he has these powers and what on earth he's going to do with them, and then all of a sudden we're pulled out of the action and forced to sit idly while the author describes an entire week (day by day) in God's life. I mean, that's great and all that we're getting some backstory on his character, but honestly, what happened with paragliding through Hell? I don't really care what your Wednesdays are like, or on which days you like to rest - get back to the action! Jesus, if we wanted to hear about your day, we would read your LiveJournal, Christ.Due to the presence of these tangents, a lot of readers won't stick around for the meat of the story, and that would certainly be a shame because once it gets going, it really is one of the most exciting reads around (just to give you an idea of how good it is, the book has apparently gathered such an intense fanbase that some people give it away for free on the streets!). The first half of the book, called the Old Testament, is really more about getting a feel for the setting than it is advancing the story. During this time we get a glimpse of God's troubled past and are witness to a few key events that really allow the depth of the character to shine through (he's kind of a dark anti-hero; quick tempered and sometimes spiteful - but much like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, he actually has a heart of gold deep down).The author takes this set-up time to explore the world thoroughly. But while even supporting characters are given their moment to shine, sometimes that gets distracting. For example, during Moses' adventures, we come to relate to him as a troubled sort of everyman. Sure, he was adopted by royalty, but he never really became complacent. He saw the mistreatment and suffering of the people around him, and he was moved into taking action. All good so far, right? It's kind of like Footloose or a Bruce Springsteen song: It's all about the plight of the working man. (And honestly, who exemplifies the working man more than slaves? All they do is work!)It's a simple little story of class conflict and redemption, and then, almost without warning, everything suddenly gets magical: Oceans are parted, flaming shrubbery starts yelling at dudes and, in what is one of many disturbingly phallic metaphors littered throughout the book, Moses and the Pharaoh's magicians start slinging about their \\"snakes\\" and \\"staffs\\" to see whose is bigger. It's all quite exciting and imaginative, but it feels kind of like a bait and switch: We came into Moses' story reading The Grapes of Wrath, then wham! Moses finds out he's a Jew and everything goes Harry Potter.In all fairness, the Jews are a notoriously magical people.After what seems like 400 years, the Holy Bible finally finishes the setup phase and launches us into the main tale, where we meet our central character for the first time - even though it's still God. Sort of. It gets a little confusing, frankly: Our protagonist, God, is somehow also a character named Jesus Christ, who is the son of God and- listen, it's never quite clear what the genealogy is, or how God is his own son or anything (and what's up with the ghost?) but a lot of the set-up just has to be taken on faith. Now, the character of Jesus may not be the most original creation (he's kind of amalgam of three other prominent protagonists: The \\"awakened man\\" complex, like Neo from the Matrix; a bit of Superman's down home heroics; and an oddly compelling dash of Timothy Leary's \\"freaking out the squares\\" mentality) but he's oddly endearing nonetheless.And it's a good thing Jesus is such a likable protagonist, because his cast of supporting characters seems utterly disposable at times. No sooner are you introduced to an intriguing new character than the author brutally murders them in some bizarre fashion, for no real reason and often with little to no impact on the story itself. The character of John the Baptist, for example, was a personal favorite of mine. He read like a kind of gruff bearish figure (I mentally cast him as John Goodman) and his presence lent the book an almost whimsical twist. But just as I was getting attached to him, the author has him beheaded almost as a footnote!This is all we John the Baptist fans get for a death scene: \\"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.\\"One sentence!The Holy Bible kills off supporting characters like horror movies kill black people. Listen, I know that was kind of a spoiler, but it's quite hard to review a book like this without spoiling something: The plot twists, turns, snakes and gyrates like Axl Rose on ecstasy. John's death was a minor spoiler, but there are some big ones I'm avoiding here (hint: Watch for Zombies!). So, without going further into details that might spoil the work, just know that The Holy Bible is a rompin' stompin' fantasy adventure full of subtle morality and intricate allegory the likes of which we haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Really, there are only a few criticisms I have: The sections where the author obviously forces their own political agenda into the story are rather distracting (at one point the whole story grinds to a halt so the Jesus character can give some sort of \\"sermon\\" on this \\"mount\\"-like thing that is little more than liberal propaganda extolling the benefits of a welfare state) and at times it seems like it could've used an editor with a heavier hand (1100 pages long?! Who do you think you are, David Foster Wallace?). I must say that overall, the Holy Bible is a story everybody should read at least once. Just keep in mind that though this may seem like your run of the mill fantasy adventure, there are a myriad of vicious maulings, explicit torture scenes, rape and prostitution, so it's definitely not for children!Oh, and though there are some hints of a sequel (a Second Coming is mentioned a few times), I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you - no official deals have been signed at this time.So, in summation, I'd give the Holy Bible four out of five."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"To the others that have praised this Bible, I must say \\"amen.\\"I was looking for a Bible that was:1) ESV - No translation is perfect, and I often make margin \\"correction\\" from the Greek and Hebrew myself. However the ESV does the best job most of the time. Yes, I have loved and relied upon the NASB for years. I have used the NIV for reading when the NASB's rendering was halting. However, the ESV is both extremely literal and flows smoothly. The ESV also correctly (in my opinion) tries to preserve the feeling of the words that are in the original texts which other translations ignore. For example, John 4:14 might be literally translated \\"But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will no longer have thirst, forever. Rather, the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing with life, lasting forever.\\" There is a symmetry between the \\"forever\\" of not being thirsty with the \\"everlasting\\" or \\"forever\\" of the life Jesus gives. Check your other translations. I think the ESV comes closest to the emphasis of the original with \\"but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\\"2) Only Bible text and cross references - I have the Scofield and Reformation study bibles in ESV. These are excellent, but I wanted a bible for reading and meditating upon without anyone else's thoughts, except for He Who is the Author and Finisher of my faith. This Bible is ideal if that is all you want. The concordance is puny, but the cross-references are excellent (better than in some other cross-reference Bibles I own).3) Relatively large text- I am getting older, and prefer to read without glasses. For type size, I think it is more helpful to describe type sizes in actual measurements rather than points and picas. In this version, the typical capital letter in the Deluxe Reference Edition (this review) is 2.5 mm tall. That about matches the size of the type in the ESV Scofield III and the Reformation Study Bible (although the typeface on the Deluxe Reference is heavier than either of the study bibles). By contrast, my NIV Thompson Chain Reference has type that is exactly 2.0 mm tall.4) Clear text with no bleed-through or see-through pages. On this score, this Bible is superior to every other ESV I have seen, and is at least as good as any other Bible I own. The paper does not seem like \\"Bible paper,\\" but does seem like good (but thin) book paper. One very nice thing about the paper is that it does not have a sheen to it. The Reformation Study Bible and the Scofield Study Bible that I own in ESV both have slick paper that reflects, producing some eye strain if I am reading in a room with one primary light source or if the main reading light is very bright. By contrast, the paper in the deluxe reference edition has a matte finish. Also, in terms of brightness, the white of the paper is just exactly between the very bright (almost backlit) paper of the Scofield and the duller yellowish color of the Reformation.5) Wide margins- I like taking margin notes, and the margins on this bible are (barely) adequate for that. The bible is not called \\"wide margin\\" or anything, but the margins are larger than those of most bibles. The usable inside margins are about 0.8 cm. (just under 1/2 inch) and the outside margins are about 2 cm. (just over 3/4 inch). For some modest reference additions and the like, this should be adequate. Plus, most pages have extra space in the area that contains the cross-references, especially in the Old Testament.6) Durable and attractive binding- I purchased the bonded leather version, only because the genuine leather was out of stock and I did not want to spring for the calfskin until I saw the quality for myself. The bonded leather is slightly above average for bonded leather these days (just slightly inferior to the bonded leather on my Scofield, but better than most I've seen)If you are looking with a similar list of wants, this bible will do nicely. It is an excellent value in the bonded leather or genuine leather editions.As satisfied as I am with the bonded leather, I think I would have ordered the genuine leather if it had been available without a long wait. I also think I could justify going for the calfskin, if I wanted the treat or if I was younger. As it is, the calfskin would easily outlive me. If I outlive the leather, I can always buy another."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"First let me comment on this translation of the bible. The ESV will become the standard english bible among evangelicals in the next several years for a few reasons.This translation follows the Hebrew/Greek more carefully than the NIV, NLT, CSV and all other contemporary translations, except for the NAS.The NAS is equivalent to the ESV in following the original text.So is the NKJ, but the ESV is superior to the NKJV because it uses the best Greek/Hebrew texts available and the NKJV follows the textual tradition dating back to England in the 17th Century inspite of the libraries from Russia, the Middle East and other centers preserved through the ages.The ESV is better than the NAS because it is easier to read in English than the NAS. Let me illustrate:ESV Hebrews 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.NAS Hebrews 13:1 Let love of the brethren continue.This pattern follows throughout the whole NT.So my first point is that the ESV follows the Hebrew/Greek as well as the most literal translations. (NAS). ESV sounds more like the way we speak today, which is a crucial element in a translation of the bible. The ESV avoids adding phrases and words to accomplish this. The NIV and many others err by adding phrases/words to try to help the translation process out. Let me illustrate:Philippians 2:1 has a phrase in Greek 'En Kristo' which basically means 'in Christ'. It can carry a lot of nuances to it, but it literally translates as 'in Christ'. Note how the ESV carries this through, but the NIV and the NLT try to interpret it by adding other words.ESV Philippians 2:1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ,NIV Philippians 2:1 If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ,NLT Philippians 2:1 Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ?So En Kristo with the NIV becomes 'from being united with Christ' when it probably should be just 'in Christ'.The NLT makes it out to be 'from belonging to Christ' when it should be just 'in Christ'.So both of those translations actually add an entire prepositional phrase to the Greek text 'En Kristo'. For those of us who read Greek, this is exactly why we have grown to love the ESV. It's just more accurate.So almost everyone I know who reads Greek/Hebrew loves the ESV and has switched to it. I certainly did, after comparing about 50 passages over a year or so with other versions, I have come to trust the ESV above all the other english versions I have.Now on this particular format, it is an inexpensive paperback with inexpensive paper. That is expected in a low cost give away bible like this. Having said that, the paper is a bleached white with pretty good font (Kind of like a high quality newspaper). Here's my test for a good font...'if I can read it, that's pretty good'. I cannot read the fonts on many bibles because I'm in my mid 40's and my eyesight is not as good as it used to be. I can read this one without any trouble at all...so it's a good font.The spine is glued, and holds together without any problems.Also, this bible uses the 2001 text for the ESV. There is a new 2007 text that is just coming out. But it is almost the same, and I wouldn't worry about that at all.I heartily recommend this version. Our church has switched to it as our 'official worship service version' and we have copies of this edition scattered throughout the sanctuary for people to use.We bought a case of these and have given most away. Our youth use them in SS class and they are holding up after about 6 months of use.I think this particular bible is a great deal on a great translation!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"English Standard Version (ESV, a revision of RSV) is a fine translation. And my review here is not about the version, but the quality of the physical Bible itself. Overall, it is good, but not great.1. While it is not leather, it is a fine imitation leather (TruTone). It is soft and flexible. As for its durability, imitation leathers fall in somewhere between genuine leather and hardcover. But it also depends on the user.2. It is NOT Smyth Sewn binding (stitched). Pages are glued to the spine. This is one of the weakness of the Bible. ComparableKing James Reference Bibleis Smith Sewn and so isUltrathin Reference Bible-NASBand they are cheaper than this ESV Bible.3. While the font is readable, the darkness of the font is not evenly printed. For example, the print in page 1202 (Philemon) is darker than the print in page 1203 (Hebrews). And there are more pages with this minor problem. Now, it is possible that only my copy has this anomaly, but I doubt it.Overall it is a good Bible but the quality could be better."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"This is a review of the ESV Compact TruGrip Orange Bible, ISBN 1581346875.PROSThe binding is sewn and not glued so this bible lays completely flat and should stand up to some abuse. The rubber cover seems very durable and looks to withstand much use. The silver ribbon (marker) is attached well, is long and wide enough, and of quality material. The page layout is two column without cross references, with text notes, and pretty readable. They managed to fit a concordance into the back of this bible, in an even smaller font than the text but still usable in my opinion. The overall dimensions are very compact and handy 4x6x1 inches.CONSThe paper used is as thin as many of the other ESV bibles by Crossway and you can see two pages worth of text underneath the page being viewed. What I can't understand is why this bible is thicker than the other compact ESV bibles yet the layout is the same. Perhaps the pages are less prone to tearing by being thicker. The cardboard to which the rubber cover is glued is separating into many layers as the glue pulls the rubber away from the paper. Words of Christ in red; I'd prefer an edition with all black text. Uses the original 2001 text and not the updated ESV text released this year.SummaryI love the ESV translation and highly recommend it, just not this particular bible. Crossway got many parts right, but the thin paper combined with rubber cover fails miserably as it is starting to separate after only a few uses.[edit]Two months later; I gave this bible to our youth pastor last month. He loves it and takes it to church every Sunday now. Not my cup of tea but perhaps it deserves more than the two stars I gave it."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Having recently received and begun using the single-column legacy bible, I can say that of the many ESV bibles I have purchased and used, this edition is the best yet. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the various features of this bible as follows:* the Tru-tone cover (amazing look and feel of goatskin leather) - 10* yapp (cover overhang - semi-yapp which doesn't catch the paper or get in the way) - 10* binding method (sewn signatures) - 10* edge treatment (gold foil applied lightly and tastefully; almost no flaking or page sticking) - 10* ribbons (1, brown, standard) - 9* page layout (sin col, wide mar; this layout is just perfect giving text/poetry room to \\"breath\\") - 10* font type style (beautiful font that is easy to read for long periods) - 10* font size (not too small, nor to large to keep the bible a reasonable size) - 10* font density (darkness of type) and uniformity across pages (best printing I have ever seen) - 10* paper (I have a $200 bible, but this edition has the best paper I have ever seen; smooth, ivory color) - 10* bible size (overall size of bible feels right - 6\\"x9\\"x1.5\\", not overly floppy yet sufficiently large to use - 10* OVERALL - 10The overall bible is beautiful. the Tru-Tone cover is the best I have seen and rivals the look and feel of $200 goatskin bibles (I have one). The text block and layout is the best I've every used - poetry and prose flow naturally across the page and sentences/phrases are not cramped/disconnected as in double-column bibles. The paper is the finest I've touched and is ivory in color, smooth, with minimal ghosting (text on other side of page visible through page). Printing density of text from page to page across entire bible is beautifully consistent. The wide margins allow ample space for making notes (I highly recommend a Pigma Micron #005 technical pen for notes).This is the finest ESV bible I have ever used at any price.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Quite simply the highest quality product of any kind that I own. I often stop in the middle of reading and just smell it. The translation is very readable and accurate, the font is newspaper sized and high quality, with a timeless look. The paper is thin enough that you aren't hauling around a dictionary, yet thick enough that you can't see the words through the page. It isn't painfully bleach-white so I imagine it will age really well. The binding and cover are simply top notch, although the pages wrinkle a bit where they connect - I don't know much about binding, does this mean it just needs to break in a bit?Also, I have a study bible with an abbreviated commentary on each page, but I really like reading this one much more, because you get great study tools (like alternate interpretations of words when appropriate, thorough cross references indicating different types of links, etc) but the text sinks in on its own, without someone giving you a slant on it every step of the way.I love this bible and really enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Hi:I am incredibly hard on Bibles. And I mean hard. I carry one with me every day in my backpack. I drop them frequently, twist the pages, jam a million things in the backpack with them, spill water on them, fall asleep on them, etc. etc. etc. I just have not managed to throw one out of a plane yet. Hmm..This Bible held up for two years against my monstrous treatment of it. Many times I never even closed it (and clasped it) but just jammed it in my backpack. Two years for me is a loooooooooooong time. The metal is still intact. The clasp still functions fully (although it may look flimsy, it is not.)In the end, I ripped a page while falling asleep on it open, which was okay. Then eventually, the bible ripped away from the metal casing because I kept throwing it around without actually closing it when in a giant hurry. (I am super tough on Bibles.) This is the longest lasting every day Bible I have ever had. I am only on here reviewing this because I am planning to buy another one - from Amazon this time as they have a great price.)I have no problem with reading the print. I found it the perfect size. But for me, the main necessities are: 1) Good translation (ESV - check!), 2) Good size to carry around everywhere every single day (Check!), and 3) durability (Lasted two years - check!)Do not hesitate to get this Bible. If you actually clasp it closed, it probably would last a lot longer for you than me. :-) Very sturdy Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I recently bought the ESV Compact Thinline Bible with a bonded leather cover. I've been very pleased with the translation - I appreciate the poetic (and historically significant) language of the NKJV, but wanted something that took modern scholarship into account. In my opinion, the ESV walks the line between those parameters well.This compact version is highly portable, but I find the font to be unnecessarily small - it seems they could have increased the font size and still kept the same words per page. Thankfully, my eyes are good, but this is not one for granny. The spine width is surprisingly narrow, so it could be thickened up a bit (bigger font, more pages) and still maintain its &quot;compact&quot; size. My compact NKJV Bible has the same cover size, is slightly thicker, and much more legible. Also, I know the ESV is young, but I'd eventually like to see a paperback version. But these are just nitpicks. I am thankful for this new translation, and am sure the publishing quality/variety will get better over time."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"When I opened the box of the Heirloom ESV I was delightfully stunned at the quality and beauty of this bible. It has the highest quality leather in a bible that I have ever seen. It is even better than Cambridge's goatskin models. I can't wait to show it off to some of my minister friends.I read just about every review on the web I could find about the ESV most were favorable. However, there is a very detailed, academic review by Dr. Rodney Decker of the Baptist Bible Seminary [\\"The ESV NT: A Review Article\\"] on the web that everyone should consult before purchasing this bible. Dr. Decker is a NIV user so take this into consideration before making your decision. He does, however, bring out a number of very good observations: (1) the ESV is not nearly as literal as the NASB and is a mixture of formal and dynamic equivalence translation methods, (2) the ESV does include some \\"inclusive language,\\" (3) and the current sales of the ESV are very low.The NASB is still the king and I will continue to use it as my primary bible translation. The ESV will be used as a reference. If you are a NIV user, then the switch to the ESV will be painless and beneficial. But if you are someone who wants a truer word-for-word translation then the NASB, KJV, NKJV, or Green's Literal Translation is the best choice.I personality do not like the paragraph type formatting in a bible. I find it more difficult to locate verses and more cumbersome for verse comparisons and memorization. Also, although the margins are wider, as compared to previous editions, there is not enough room for serious note taking. Cambridge's Concord Wide Margin KJV or In Touch Mininstry's NASB or better examples."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

It's a great size-- not too big, but big enough to house an appropriate text size. I don't care for the soft cover too much, but it's fine and isn't cheaply bounded. The font size is very readable, and is around the size of that in the ESV Study Bible. Now for the bad news: Words of Christ in Red. WHERE was that in the description and/or other reviews? I've never been a fan of this, particularly because it seriously distracts me and doesn't look as visible on paper as black text. Suffice to say, I am sorely disappointed in paying a pretty penny for an edition that has this useless (in my opinion) feature. I'll likely give it away to someone who doesn't mind the feature.I love the ESV. I started off with the NIV, began actually reading it for study, and was told the ESV was a better translation. After getting the ESV Study Bible and comparing, the ESV grew on me, and I find it preferable to the NIV. Many churches today are switching over to the ESV, as it is also being backed by big-named theologians like RC Sproul, John Piper, and most recently John MacArthur(which can be argued as a good or bad thing, depending on your view of such people). I'd recommend the translation to anyone wanting a solid translation. It's definitely better than the Contemporary English, God's Word, or any such translations. I would highly recommend checking out key verses from the Bible (John 3:16 is an easy one to compare) online and giving the ESV a comparison to whichever translation you tend to use so that you can make your own choice."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I was really excited about this single column setting. When I received it I was happy, but not elated like I was with the Clarion (goatskin) and NCPB (hardcover). I think this bible would be better if the size was slightly smaller. You pick it up and you expect it to be full of cross references or notes or something, but what you'll find is just the text. Everything else about the bible is great and you may like the size because it gives you 'some' room for notes, but if you are buying it as a study bible then I wouldn't get it. This bible kind of floats out there with no real identity (is it a personal study bible or a reader??). If you are getting a bible for personal note taking and don't want to spend the money then get a hardcover Cambridge wide margin bible. If you are getting it for reading then wait and save money to buy the ESV Clarion by Cambridge. You can't go wrong with Cambridge bibles ... they are all smith-sewn and will last a long, long time. I did give it 4 stars because you may be different than myself and like a little thicker and heavier bible and if you do this is a perfect way to experience the way the bible is supposed to be read. Another important aspect and why I gave it 4 starts is the paper quality ... it has great paper!

According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Good News Publication's English Standard Version (ESV) Bible (2003 Thinline Battlezone edition), as a 21st century emergent biblical translation, may soon become a Christian classic. With only 1106 pages this two columned red letter Thinline Bible is a handy pocket size. The lightweight \\"Battlezone Edition\\" sports a sturdy steel cover protecting the text from damaging creases, bends, and tears.Inspired by Tyndale's 1526 original English and King James' 1611 Authorized translations the ESV is rendered from the Hebrew Masoretic and Greek Septuagint texts. The Greek New Testament and various Dead Sea Scrolls were also consulted for this new translation. The ESV continues the holiness biblical tradition (perhaps as a follow up to the TEV and CEV).The ESV preserves various translation traditions from the past while offering a new look in portions of its presentation. For example, the English Standard committee retained the sermonic nature of Deuteronomy offering most of the book in Mosaic quotes (in similarity to the venerable KJV and RSV, but different from the more contemporary NIV and REB).The ESV oddly avoids footnoting. Various historically troublesome scriptural texts, i.e. John 8:1-11, lack critical review. Perhaps, the ESV prefers readability rather than academics (a point preventing the additional star). If so, perhaps future revisions will better teach readers.Religious language here leans more towards the KJV than CEV. In deed, its most popular verses are almost exactly the same as the King James' Version (see John 3:16-17, Psalm 23, and Luke 2) and the RSV (see James 1 and Ecclesiastes 3).This Thinline edition, without the Apocrypha, is a quick read (I read it leisurely over a 90 day period). It is recommended to everyone with an interest in the Holy Scripture and those wanting to rapidly read a portable tough Bible."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I bought this little bible, my first compact, at our local Christian retailer. They are going out of business so instead of the suggested retail of $16 or $17 I got it for a little more than $13.Even on the shelf it looked a little worn and torn and I'm wondering if it was a return. A little wear and tear befits the style a little bit I think. It wasn't long after using the Bible that I wish I had bought a compact Bible with some kind of closure. The rubber flaps tend to curl out and open most of the time. I'm not so sure about how it would hold up in a pack or bag. I'm thinking about wrapping it in something or shelving it.I like the vibrant color, very eye catching and easy to see. This would make a great gift for a hunter or other outdoorsperson. I also like the textured rubber cover but when I look closer I can see the beginning of cracks along the outside of the spine. I like how it lays flat, not what I would have expected for such a small book. The place marker ribbon is a touch and I was very impressed they didn't skimp when I found an impressive concordance in the back. Other generosities include footnotes and headers. All these niceities add up and does make the Bible a little bulky and weighty.I'm not too keen on the translation but it will do. I mostly bought it for its cover. I've also since ordered a different compact bible as this does not seem like the one I will primarily carry but it should make a nice backup."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I personally believe that the ESV is the best translation out there - faithful to the original languages, beautiful in its style and presentation. Crossway is continuing to provide new sizes and styles as well. This version is a great size for travelling, single column with cross references. One reason I chose this particular one is that this one has the words of Christ in black letter, since ALL scripture is God-breathed! The cover is outstanding and I love the little crest on the bottom right of the cover. I had planned to use this for travel and pastoral visits, but I'm enjoying it so much that I'm using it in the pulpit and for Sunday school as well. Some reviewers have complained about the text size, but I find that it is sufficiently readable and is actually easier to read than their Pocket size reference version (which I also own). God's Word is powerful in any form, but if you are looking for a easy to carry and easy to read version of a great translation, you would do well to check this one out!"},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I wanted something in the ESV, small enough to fit in the back pocket of jeans, words of Christ in red, and both testaments. This product provides all that I was looking for and more. The only problem I have is not with the product as much as it is with my poor vision. Whatever size the font is, it is tough for me to read. I don't have to wear glasses to read it but I probably should. I guess that is the price you pay for needing a Bible that fits in the back pocket. If you have good vision or if you want a small and complete Bible, this is a great choice. The price that Amazon offers was also less than anything else I was able to find. Another great benefit is that it comes with a free offer for the ESV software.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"I am a seminary student and I have LOTS of Bibles. And among them is this one: the ESV small-sized, brown chestnut Bible with the diamond design on the front. This is my favorite of them all. The somewhat decorated Bible looks really good. The cover feels very soft. The ESV is, in my opinion, the best translation that is on the market (I work alot with the NIV and the NRSV and the KJV as well, and this is the best). It has the very best blend of literary beauty, readability, and strict translation. It is a 2001 revision of the old RSV. It preserves the majestic language of the RSV much better than does the NRSV and it is also a much more literal translation of the original texts. It is more readable than the NASB, and the language much more beautiful and compelling. This Bible is small, so it has very small text, but I think the handsome presentation more than makes up for that."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

I'm well pleased."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible. Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"For the translation alone, I give the ESV five stars. The English Standard Version is a remarkable and fresh translation. It's a conservative translation, capturing the beauty and truth of God's word. However, for this review, I will limit my remarks to the binding and presentation of this edition, the \\"Classic Reference Edition.\\"The binding is solid. It's not a thinline edition, but it's not a very thick edition either. It's a good size that carries well.Each book is headed by a short introduction, which explains the theme and historical position of each book. Approximate dates are given for authorship, along conservative lines (i.e., Matthew is not a second century text, but first century writing -- 50s or 60s, which follows an evangelical reckoning).The center column references are excellent and serve one well in study. These include reference notes from the original King James. These center column references are marked in the text by small reference letters, which I found to be slightly distracting while reading. Also, the center column occupies so much of the page that the columns of scripture are too narrow. This version would have been better served if the references were placed in the footer (bottom of page) than in the center.The center margin is painfully tight. One has to really spread the pages apart to read the text in the center of the binding.The concordance in the back is excellent: 14,500 references. In the age of computers and handhelds, this feature is not so essential, but it's great to have for quick reference.The maps are also good, providing good insight into the movements of biblical figures.So, as a translation, five stars. As for the binding and presentation, four stars.P.S. If you are looking for the \\"right\\" translation, do a little research and visit the ESV website as it provides good information about the translation and approach of the English Standard Version."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"Crossway's ESV Single Column Legacy Bible has a beautiful layout with the design philosophy of the perfect page. It has wide margins, thick paper, and a large font. Made with readers in mind, Crossway has set a new standard in page layout.Cover and BindingThe cover a two-tone brown TruTone (a soft imitation leather) with paper liner. I was able to curl it around in any shape I wanted and it went back to lying flat. To me it feels like calfskin. I love the look and feel of the grain. The cover is sewn around the edges, adding strength. The cover is very flexible. The binding is Smyth sewn, so it lays flat. It does take some breaking in before it will lay flat in Genesis.PaperThe paper is 36 gsm (grams per square meter) Thincoat Plus. It feels very thick. I kept trying to separate the pages, thinking I had two pages, when I actually just had one. It is smooth and not at all shiny. Although it is opaque it does have more show-through than I expected for the page thickness. The paper is very white.Text and LayoutThe font is 9-point Lexicon with a 10.75 leading, giving lots of space between the lines. It is a black-letter text and is sharp and readable. The text is printed with line-matching, so the lines of text line up with the text on the backside of the page. This improves contrast which greatly helps readability because there is no text showing through between the lines of text. The print is consistently dark.The layout is the real star of the show. It follows the renaissance concept of the perfect page, with roughly a 2:3 ratio page geometry, and looks great. It is unique for a Bible with section headings. This is a wide-margin edition, but instead of the section headings placed within the text, they are placed in the margins. This helps in readability. I was able to read without any distractions or disruptions between paragraphs. Since they are in the margin, they do take up some of the writing space. Moving the headings to the margins in order to improve readability was the purpose of the wider margin. The margins are great for writing, but they're also great for leaving clean.This is my favorite layout for wide-margin editions. I like the writing space on the outside margin because inner margins are too difficult to use. I badly want Crossway to make a KJV edition of this Bible.The top outer corner of each page shows the page number, book name, chapter number, and verse number of the first verse that starts on that page.NotesThis edition doesn't have cross-references, but it does have translation notes. The notes are located at the bottom of the page and are keyed to the text with numbers. This works, but I could also see a benefit of the notes being in the margin next to the verse. I think that would make the headings blend-in too much though. The text for the notes is small. I'm guessing it's a 5-point font.ConcordanceThe concordance is 72 pages and in double column. The text is small but readable, so there are lots of entries. The primary word is in bold and the verses are offset with each verse on its own line. I found it easy to use.MapsThere are 8 color maps. These are the same maps that are standard in other Crossway editions. My only complaint or suggestion is there needs to be an index to the maps. This would make the maps much easier and faster to use. The maps are labeled well, so they're not hard to use. I just think an index would be nice.RibbonThis edition has one ribbon. It's brown and very long. I think it's too thin, but making it wider would increase the cost. For its price it's fine.ConclusionThis is one of the most readable layouts I've seen in any Bible. Moving the headings to the margin and the overall page design make this a Bible I want to read for long periods of time. The size feels right too- not too big or too small. The wide margins are great for taking notes and adding references, or just leaving blank. The paper is nice and the print is amazing. Crossway seeks to set new standards with the Legacy. They've done a great job. I highly recommend Crossway's ESV Single Column Legacy Bible.See this review on Bible Buying Guide for photos and comparisons to the Clarion.Crossway Publishers provided this Bible free for review.

Premium Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Text (English Language)","review":"(This review applies to all editions.)Choosing a holy book is harder than choosing a romance novel. To help you choose, I will compare this one to another best-seller in this category, the Quran. These are the two holy books that get the most buzz around here.Based on all the marketing hype, I expected these two books would be really different. All readers like one or the other, never both, and they all HATE the other book. However, these two books turned out to be a lot more similar than their marketing led me to expect.For example, to judge from the marketing propaganda, many men choose a holy book based on how many virgins or wives they can have. If you are one of these men, you might think the Quran is the obvious choice for you. Not so! Buyers of the Bible can have lots of virgins too, and also multiple wives and plenty of sex slaves (called concubines in these holy books, which have their own special code words for dirty stuff). Abraham, a main character in this book (and also, coincidentally, in the Quran), had children with several concubines and a slave girl, while he was married to another woman. Lot even had children with his own two virgin daughters! No prudes here! Jacob, father of the twelve tribes at the center of the Bible plot, had two wives and two concubines at the same time. Solomon, another of the book's heroes, had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. Virgins are hot property in this book just like in the Quran. That's why the main character, Yahweh, always orders his followers to collect virgins after committing genocide. (One time they collected 32000 Midianite virgins!) I haven't done a virgin-by-virgin count, but my impression is that this book's virgin count is right up there with the Quran's.It's tough to keep women under control, so if you are a man, it pays to buy a holy book that puts the fear of god in your wives and lovers. Again, men might think the Quran is the clear choice here. It is full of instructions for stoning rape victims and non-virgin brides, and for beating wives. The Bible PR team thinks this would hurt US sales, so they like to give the impression that the Bible is different on this score. However, it turns out that the Bible says pretty much the same thing:\\"If ... the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.\\" Bible, Deuteronomy 22:13-21\\"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city.\\" Bible, Deuteronomy 22:23-24So male buyers, you don't have to go with the competition if you want to stone women. There is an important lesson here: DON'T LET THE MARKETERS FOOL YOU! Read these books for yourself before you decide on a purchase.If you are a woman, there is not much to choose from here. My advice-- just buy the holy book that your husband or neighbors buy. And after you buy it, study it hard.As a bonus feature, whether you are a man or a woman, you can use this book to control your children, as it tells you to kill them if they talk back: \\"Whoever curses father or mother shall die\\" Bible, Mark 7:10. What teenager wouldn't behave, with that inscribed in big Gothic letters over his or her bedroom door?Sometimes, abortions are necessary to save the life of the mother, and abortions can ensure that people don't have babies they can't raise. If you listen to the marketers, you might be thinking the Bible is a poor choice if you want to be flexible about abortions. But here too you would be wrong. Remember, DON'T TRUST THE MARKETERS, read the actual book before purchasing. The Bible is actually big on killing young children (see above) and unborn babies:\\"Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.\\" Bible, Psalm 137.Yahweh also kills virtually all the pregnant women on earth (along with their unborn babies) in a big flood. He also repeatedly orders people to kill entire nations, including all their pregnant women and their unborn babies (of course, saving the virgins--see above). Sometimes he gets mad when his people don't kill them. So apparently this is all ok with him.By the way, when this is mentioned to Bible marketers like William Lane Craig (from the \\"Evangelical Christian\\" marketing firm), they respond by saying that Yahweh did the kids and/or unborn fetuses a favor, because they go straight to heaven. Here is what WL Craig says about baby-killing, from his website:\\"... if we believe, as I do, that God's grace is extended to those who die in infancy or as small children, the death of these children was actually their salvation. We are so wedded to an earthly, naturalistic perspective that we forget that those who die are happy to quit this earth for heaven's incomparable joy. Therefore, God does these children no wrong in taking their lives.\\"So apparently abortion and baby-killing is not only ok, but BETTER than having kids that might grow up to break some rule and not go to heaven.Another thing to consider in any holy book is its treatment of \\"days of rest\\". Those days are nice, but sometimes you might need to cook or turn on a light or lift a rock that falls on your foot. So again, you want a holy book that is flexible. Here I am afraid you are out of luck, as both these books say you should be killed for doing things like that:\\"They found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. ... And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones.... And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\\" Bible, Numbers 15:32-56What to do with people who criticize your purchase? It can be uncomfortable to be ridiculed for buying the wrong holy book, so I highly recommend buying one that tells you to kill anybody who bought a competing title. Again, marketers would have you believe that the Quran should be your choice here, but I found the Bible has this department covered just as well as the Quran:\\"If there be found among you ... that ... hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them ... Then shalt thou ... stone them with stones, till they die.\\" Bible, Deuteronomy 17:2-5\\"They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\\" Bible, 2 Chronicles 15:12-13One downside to both books is the number of weird rules you must obey (e.g. no planting of two crops in the same field, or wearing clothes made of two kinds of threads). But don't worry, the Bible is so long that nobody actually reads the thing, so you can plausibly deny you ever saw those parts, or deny they exist. If that doesn't work, you can always say those parts were mistranslated.I have to warn you that there is a confusing change of the rules toward the end of the book, as noted by many other reviewers. Not to worry. The main character of that section, Jesus, says: \\"For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law [the rules in the first section]...\\" So as long as the stars are still shining at night, I guess you can pick your rules from either section. Polygamists and virgin-lovers will want to pay most attention to the first section.I conclude that because of their similarity, it is tough to choose between these two holy books. Their prices are also about the same, $5 to $15 + a chance at eternal damnation. Luckily there is one important difference between the Bible and Quran. You are not allowed to burn or destroy the Quran. On the other hand, after reading the Bible you can use the pages as tinder to light campfires or fireplaces, or use the whole thing as a doorstop. In this reviewer's opinion, that tips the balance in favor of the Bible over the Quran.As an alternative, you might reconsider this whole holy book genre. These books don't get updated very often (the Bible's last update was 2000 years ago) so you may prefer something that incorporates all we have learned about the world since then. (For example, it turns out the world is not flat, the earth actually goes around the sun, and humans and animals didn't just appear magically all at once!!!) I see Richard Dawkins' \\"The Magic of Reality\\" is available on Amazon; that might be a good place to start for holy book fans who want to catch up on some of the really exciting post-Bronze-Age developments."},{"Title":"(ESV) English Standard Version Large Print Bible.

This book, first published in Britain, reminds me why British fantasy remains among the best.In &quot;Lady in Gil&quot; Rebecca Bradley has managed to take that classic fantasy plot of the reluctant hero, and turn it in to something that is uniquely and wholly her own.From the first, the reader suspects that the scholarly and hopelessly unathletic Tigrallef will make a far better hero than his musclebound and unimaginative brother. The wonder of the story is in how Tigrallef achieves this transformation, as the author turns familiar cliches on their head, culminating in Tigrallef being transformed into something that even he did not expect-- a genuine hero, who achieves success for his people, but at a terrible cost to himself.Here's hoping that Ace will soon release the sequel in the US."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Lady in Gil is the first of a trilogy that follows the adventures of Tigrallef. Told in first person narrative, the novel has a punch lacking in quite a few fantasy novels with a quest storyline. Put simply, a nasty group of conquerors, the Sherank, have brutally acquired Tig's homeland. The conquered native people are treated viciously, but a group of exiles keeps trying to retake what was once theirs.Within the boundaries of the conquered kingdom lies a statue said to have powers that would defeat the Sherank if only one of the exiled Scions could but get his hands on it. Unfortunately, the first string Scion has a mishap that sidelines him. His brother Tig, a glorified librarian/historian, is selected to replace him as a last resort.Lady in Gil is a stand alone book. One does not need to read the other two books that follow, but most will feel compelled to continue reading about Tig and his misadventures. Rebecca Bradley does a masterful job of characterization, but her strongest point is plot development and pace. She is a savvy writer that delivers a completely satisfying story full of love interest, betrayal, humor, despair, and perhaps one of the most intriguing harems ever detailed within any fantasy work."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Tig is a reluctant 'hero'. He thought he had escaped the duty of the princes of his family by becoming a librarian - something he loved. However, an unfortunate accident by his very heroic elder brother leads him being sent to find the 'lady in gil' and save his homeland island of Gil from invaders who have held for the last 70 years.Tig is great character, intelligent and sceptical of heroics - and their ability to get you killed quick. The story is told with a realism and a regard for the consequences of actions rare in fantasy novels. The author has also given Tig a great dry sense of humor.I'm reading the second book at the moment, and it's also excellent. So far these have been much better than your 'average' fantasy. An author whose work I intend to keep an eye out for from now."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This review contains minor-medium spoilers.Lady in Gil is really a wonderful book. Not only is the story captivating, the writing is good as well. It's not overly intellectual, making the reader feel stupid; nor is it simplistic barely bolstering a shaky plot. The thrust of the story is simple: generations of Scions struggle to overtake their captured ancestral land. Lord Tigrallef would most likely not have seen combat -- had his brother not lost his leg. Tigrallef (Tig as he becomes known) journeys to the cesspit land of Gil to find the ancient divine artifact known as &quot;the Lady&quot;.In Tig, one sees the process of character development clearly; the maturing of a character as he struggles through trial and tribulation. He is an alienated person thrust into an alienated land, and the outcome is most interesting. If you'd like a good read that doesn't take too much time, Lady in Gil is for you. My only regret was that the book was not longer. It's definetly an &quot;I can't quite put this down just yet&quot; affair with words.To be sure, there were a few minor problems. The Lady seems absurdly powerful at the end, even though what was going to happen was set up from around mid-book. What ended up happening with Shree, while hinted at, seemed too sudden. I would have loved to see more chapters, more character development. In a way, the pace of the book suited the crumbling city of Gil; someone hesitant with a bright flash here and there making you eager to streak past some of the more sedate parts. The rest of the ending, what happened with Tig's circumstance and the Flamen attitude towards the city as well as the reactions of the world, were very realistic.It is definetly worth at least one read. I found it worth more than that; you may as well. Despite some slowness, I am very eager to read the next two books."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've only just started this book, but I love it already. Tigrallef, a young clumsy and bookworm-ish memorian, is content spending his life surrounded by books. His people, the Scions, have been exiled from their lands----and the only way to re-claim them is to find the legendary Lady of Gil----a statue of mytical powers. When Tigrallef's brother loses a leg (the brother put his leg armour on backwards and broke his leg in three places, eventually leading to it being amputated), no one but Tig is left to go on this quest. And so he goes . . . reluctant but accepting! Tig reminds me of myself . . . awkward and clumsy, but at least intellegent and with a remarkable sense of humor. This book is wonderfully ironic, yet at the same time Rebecca Bradley spins a magnificent fantasy yarn. This is a great book for anyone who likes imaginative, ironic, and fun yet serious fantasy. Read it!"},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Lady in Gil is the first novel in the Gil series. About a thousand years before, Oballef the first came to Gil in a rowboat, climbed to the top of the Gilgard, a great flat-topped plug of volcanic rock, held over his head a glowing object about the size and shape of his forearm, and a golden cloud emitted from the object rolled across the entire surface of the island. Where the cloud passed, the yellow clay turned to black soil, new plants sprung from the ground, and clear springs arose. The natives unanimously installed Obaleff as King and High Priest and worshipped the glowing object as the Lady in Gil.Nine hundred and twenty-seven years later, the barbarous Sherank invaded the Kingdom of Gil by stealth, caught the current Priest-King, Oballef the Eleventh, and most of his court, away from Gilgard Castle, butchered them, and then occupied the island. Despite their successful invasion, the Sherank failed in their efforts to find the Lady in Gil.In this novel, seventy-two years have passed and the Gil Exiles have created a tradition of sending the Scions, descendants of Obaleff, one by one back to Gil to find the Lady. Tigrallef is a Memorian who is happy recording facts and filing scrolls, but his brother has a training accident and Tig suddenly finds himself selected as the twentieth Scion to venture forth to Gil. He doesn't impress anyone as a likely candidate, but the Primate insists on his selection. He is been put through a vigorous course of physical, mental and moral instruction. Six months later, finally able to swing a sword without endangering himself or his allies, he is taken to Gil by fishermen and put ashore. Hiding behind a stack of barrels by the sea-wall, Tig observes the current residents of Gil and notices his clothes are in too good a condition. Moving cautiously through back alleys, he finds another hiding place in a semi-demolished shed near the main street and then occupies himself converting his clothes to filthy rags.In the evening, Tig ventures out for a bite of noisome stew and is accosted by an old man with only one eye, one hand, and one leg. The old man says that he knows Tig, knows what he is, calls him \\"Scion\\", and then tells him to follow. Thinking murderous thoughts, Tig does follow and finds himself among the Web, an underground movement started by the old man, Bekri, the only surviving priest on Gil. Tig agrees to accept their help, which none of his predecessors had done, and, with the help of Calla, the old man's great-granddaughter, is taught disguise, current maps and many other things pertinent to his survival. They make plans to insert him within Gil Castle, but then he catches the Gil-gut, a disease that, combined with the necessary medicine, lays him out for three days.When he recovers from his sickness, Bekri sends him to witness an execution by the Sherkin. Within the market square, the Sherkin construct an elaborate device which allows a clutch of pointed rods to slowly descend upon the victim and pierce most of the way through his body. However, a faction within the Web kills the intended victim with a poison dart shortly after he is placed within the device, expecting the Sherkin to react with anger and start slaughtering the crowd of Gilmen; this faction is ready to kill as many Sherkin as possible with their poison darts, hopefully triggering an uprising. However, Lord Shree, an anomalous Sherkin noble, covertly disposes of the dart, dismisses the Gilman crowd, and orders the Sherkin to let them leave.Bekri is old and tired and has finally found a Scion who is willing to listen. While Tig has yet to enter Gil Castle, Bekri has already begun to abdicate his Web leadership to the Scion. All the hopes of Gil are focused on his efforts. Tig is beginning to feel the pressure.This novel begins as a simple heroic quest for a magic object, but the hero is less than heroic and the enemy are worse than villainous. The story becomes a tale of cunning and stealth, more like a thief's story. The author throws in a few genuine heroes for contrast; Hewelli, for example, is willing for the entire population to die so that the Gilmen can recover their dignity in a great uprising.Since this story is much more realistic than most quest tales, the hero and heroine are far more believable and therefore the vicarious impact is more immediate. Tig's attitude reminds one of the worldview of General William T. Sherman. He will never be a classical hero, but may become a wise leader. His character has great potential for development in the sequels.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys fantasy stories wherein the characters grow and mature within a intricate plot.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"An ordinary person thrust into the role of hero is a fantasy standard these days. But Lady in Gil stands out because of the originality of its plot and the depth Rebecca Bradley brings to her characters.Tigrallef is one of the Scions of Oballef, one of the hereditary rulers of the island of Gil. When Gil was invaded by the Sherank, the magical artefact that guaranteed their power, the Lady in Gil, was lost and most of the Scions were slaughtered. Seventy years later, Gil is a hellhole under the brutal rule of the Sherank, and the Scions are well and truly under the control of the Flamens, the priesthood of the Lady in Gil. Every so often, the Flamens send a Scion off to Gil to try to find the Lady so that they can all return in triumph to Gil and reclaim their lost power. But now, the bookish Tig, who was so unpromising a heroic prospect that no-one ever bothered to train him, is the only Scion available for the latest mission.Tig might not be a hero of the type the Flamens wanted, but he is well educated and has a very sharp mind. So when he arrives in Gil and realises how woefully underprepared he really is, he is more disillusioned with the Flamens and the Heroic Code than ever, and decides to do things his way. And then he meets some unexpected allies . . .Bradley does an excellent job of bringing the clever, but oddly innocent Tig to life, and showing how he grows into the role of a hero without ever losing the qualities that made him so unique and likeable in the first place. Lady in Gil is very much a character-driven story, with the choices Bradley's characters make the source of the action and pathos in the story. It's certainly not just another find-the-artefact-and-save-the-world story. Supporting characters such as Calla and Hawelli, Shree and Lissula, are very well drawn too, and highlight the different responses people can make to the tragedies in their lives.Does Tig succeed in his quest? Well, sort of . . . I was stunned by the ending - and then very glad to find that there was a sequel. Read this book.

Limited myself to books of 300 pages or less; no trilogies, must have characters speaking in modern-not-archaic English, that sort of thing. Mind candy. So imagine my shock when this particular bit of mind candy turned out to be unique, thought provoking, and ultimately borderline Greek-tragic.Bradley takes your biggest, hugest, most dusty-hoary fantasy cliche of all time -- unlikely hero must find talisman to free the land from evil -- and turns it upside down simply by injecting a bit of reality into it. A cold dash of fist-to-the-gut realism. The evil empire is not magic, for one (nice!). And what happens when the upheaval is over? No happy-go-lucky jaunt off into the perfect sunset for these revolutionaries.Of course now I hop onto Amazon to gush in surprise, only to find that this is indeed a trilogy and now I'm hooked.

Means \\"first,\\" from the Latin \\"Primus.\\") And a \\"flamen\\" is an ancient priest of Rome. So don't let the odd terms bother you -- Bradley has actually done research and is not merely making up stuff for the heck of it.(I also have to point out -- the cover art has no bearing on the story whatsoever.

I would strongly reccomend anyone pick up this book without hesitation, as its uncommon hero and the world he lives in will not fail to please any fan of fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book was excellent. It had great character development, and an easy-to-follow(but still very interesting)plot. When I bought this book, I had no idea what a great find it was. This book is about a bookworm named Tigrallef who is descendant of the line of the Scions. The Scions were the rulers of the kingdom of Gil, but were exiled from their land. Now it is up to Tigrallef to seek the legendary Lady of Gil, a statue with power enough to overthrow the evil Sheranks. The only thing about this book that I wasn't completely satisfied with was the ending. I couldn't believe what happened to Calla(even the names in this book are interesting). I encourage everyone to read this book, and I bet that if you have any doubts about reading this book, you'll forget about them once you start reading. Rebecca Bradley has surely created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was an exceptional book. It was okay for most ages, it reminded me of Marion Zimmer Bradley books, but Rebecca has a style of her own. The unlikely hero thing was great, Tigrallef was funny and serious, all at once. It was great."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Gil started out a desolate desert island. Until the Lady changed it. Then it became a paradise, until it was invaded by the bloodthirsty -(I can't remeber what they are called). Some of the royal family escaped to a small island near by. Here they have spent 70 years trying to find the lost Lady of Gil. The newest hero to be sent to Gil in search of the Lady is every thing a hero should be - strong, good looking, and athletic. And so devoted to the Heroes code that when he breaks his leg he ignores the pain - and the wound. It then becomes infected and has to be amputated. His brother Tigalif is the only one available to replace him. And according to Tig himself, he is just abut the opposite of everything a hero should be - a failure at the fighting arts, and as he puts it, half of an athlete. That doesn't stop the elders though, and before he knows it he is on his way to Gil, seasick to boot.I really, really liked this book. Tigalif is a great character. Very funny. The plot to was good. The worst thing about this book is that it dosn't go on forever - it ends!"},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Bradley has created an interesting world in this book, one I am curious to know more about and would love to explore more. The social, religious, and geo-political dynamics appear to be well thought out, and are intriguing.However, I found most of her central characters whiny, annoying, and childish. While those traits, in small measure, can add depth and richness to characters, as the major personality traits I found my enjoyment of the book damaged. The occasional predictable plot twist was a further disappointment."},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the best sensations in the world is picking a book up not knowing what to expect, and finding that you have a gem!

I was quickly sucked in by the interesting world she details and the wonderful main character. For those who critize the book for Tig being so immature - he's a teenager! I actually thought he was doing really well maturity wise - he's thoughtful, knowledgable, a quick study and very aware of his own shortcomings. Overall the book had very good pacing, multi-leveled characters that had quite a lot of development in a very short book, and an ending far different from 90% of other fantasy out there. I wish the sequels were out in eBook formats because I'm very limited on shelf-space but I am dying to read them!"},{"Title":"Lady in Gil (Gil trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Very well written book with well-rounded characters. There was even a touch of dry humor, which made the main character easier to relate to. What I liked most about the story was that the characters were not the most beautiful, intellegent, and outstanding physique all wrapped up in one body. I also didn't expect the story to end in the way it did, which is always a good thing, since I'm the queen at guessing the end on almost every book I read.

After all, those of us who read fantasy are usually all bookrooms secretly wanting to be heroes. The grungy realism of Gil and the political situation on the island transported me there, faster than most other books. I was afraid not only for the characters, but also felt the danger to myself. Kind of spooky!I don't want to ruin the tale for anyone, but the revelation of some of the characters toward the end was a bit predictable and too pat. All that said, I stayed up until 2:00 a.m. finishing this book--evem when I had to go to work at 7:00 a.m. the next day! It held me spellbound for the entire evening.

The main character Tigrallef is fun and easy to relate to. Another main character Calla is a great mysterious character who keeps you guessing at what she is really thinking right up to the end. The setting is great. Who can resist an underground movement with secret hand signals and undercover agents? The book is fun as I have said but what I like is a little bit of realism that makes it feel as if what you just read was real and Rebecca Bradley did this. Unfortunately most readers will be very angry at her when you finish this book (don't worry I wont give away the ending) but if you do read it (and please do)just read the sequel &quot;Scions Lady&quot; and the urge to strangle the author will pass.

Teenagers will relate to the main part of the book as it contains tasty, nutritious recipes that are easily prepared. Most of the recipes are vegan, and each contains the number of servings that the recipe makes as well as the calories, protein, fat and carbohydrates for each serving. Recipes are divided into the following sections: \\"Smoothies &amp; Shakes,\\" \\"Breakfast,\\" \\"Salads, Dressings, Spreads, &amp; Dips,\\" \\"Soups,\\" \\"Main Dishes\\" and \\"Cakes, Pies, Candies, Pudding.\\" Laura Holzapfel offers an insightful message at the beginning of the book in \\"Notes from a Vegetarian Teen\\" and Suzanne Havala, who is a vegetarian, author and consultant on food and nutrition, provides important information for teenagers (and their parents) in \\"Vegetarian Nutrition: A Primer for Teens.\\" Havala effectively covers such topics as protein, calcium, iron, vitamin C, vitamin B12 and fats - to name a few.

I have the utmost respect for her and her family of super-vegans because it baffles my mind as to how they do it. Whenever Rebecca and I have enough of a lull in our schedules to eat lunch together, I'm in for it if any part of my meal comes from \\"some poor animal.\\" The speech usually starts with, \\"Did you know?\\" and continues with Rebecca trying desperately to prove to me that all of the world's problems are my fault because of what I'm eating. Rebecca's argument is rehearsed and usually flawless, which is why I enjoy so immensely trying to prove her wrong, but deep down I know that she is absolutely right on most points. And that's why I've eliminated red meat from my diet.If you happen to be in the same situation as me - that is, questioning your dietary identity - you might want to pick up this book. It's not just a cookbook. It also includes solid information about vegetarianism, weighs the pros and cons, gives sources for more info, and, here's the best part, nutritional information for every recipe. Plus it's geared specifically for teens so that all of the recipes are quick and easy, and it even offers tips on talking to your relatives and friends about your dietary choices.But even if you aren't planning on switching your diet completely over to the green side, this is still a good book to check out. After all, according to Rebecca, if we all reduce our meat consumption by 10 percent and use the surplus grain we would have fed to livestock to feed people in Third World countries, we would have solved world hunger already.Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Media, Inc."},{"Title":"Munchie Madness","review":"In Munchie Madness, Dorothy R.

I couldn't tell that it was a vegan cookbook by the title, but I could tell that it would appeal to my fifteen- and nine-year-olds. I was right. The recipes were easy enough to follow- and the write-ups compelling enough- that my daughters were salivating over many of the recipes despite the lack of photos.However, I found the illustration used for the Asian dishes offensive. It was a caricature of an Asian man, presumably Chinese, with a long mustache and traditional straw hat. Was that really the best they could do for Asian dishes?

Her mother Suzie is a social butterfly who cannot imagine not having a date or two and challenges Alice to find a date to take to Suzie's 60th birthday. The challenge is on... only three months to go. But while Alice isn't really interested in making the effort, Suzie is managing to lasso them in by the handful - her most promising date is a handsome younger man she met on a train named Tom. Alice hopes that best pal Zoe will join them in the internet ads and speed dating, but she is busy trying to locate her birth parents. When Tom takes Suzie up on her recommendation that he could benefit from working with a life coach, he son finds himself attracted to Alice. Unbeknownst to the trio, Tom is soon involved with them both.Diving back into the dating pool can be hard enough, but Sigaloff turns it on its ear with her mother/daughter twist in a wry and humorous manner. The two could not be more different. I loved the relationship between Alice and Richard - they might not have been cut out to be lovers (he was gay), but they were still very close friends. And Alice's relationship with Zoe brings out further vulnerability - and a nice surprising twist in their relationship."},{"Title":"Like Mother, Like Daughter (Red Dress Ink)","review":"I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked.

Suzie wants her daughter to be happy so she concocts a plan in which her birthday wish is for both of them to be dating by the time she turn sixty in a few weeks. Though she hates the dating scene, Alice reluctantly agrees to find a man to join her at her mom's sixtieth birthday bashAlice looks around at work and sees few men eligible to escort her to her mom's birthday bash. At the same she struggles to find date, Suzie hones in on a younger man, which makes Alice wonder if her mom is being devious and setting her up to be with this man. Also her best friend Zoe enlists Alice's help in finding her biological parents taking time away from finding her dream date as the countdown reaches two weeks.The strong cast especially the mother and daughter roommates keep this somewhat madcap tale from becoming inane. Instead, with strong secondary characters providing sometimes zany support, Suzie and Alice seem genuine as each seeks in their own way the right man for the big date.

Mr. Segal's book is one of those few. His words carry an energy that calms and opens, their content offers in-sights and practices which truly are helpful.The presentation is in prose, poetry, sketches by the author, interviews with and by the author, and several photographs.Practitioners of Zen (and others) will find Mr. Segal's rendering of the Ten Oxherding Picutres --both in prose and sketch -- incredible aids to experiencing the message and guidance they contain. Practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism (and others) will appreciate Mr. Segal's candid interview with Chatral Rinpoche. Followers of the Way of Mr. Gurdjieff will find substantial help throughout the book: in the interviews with Mr. Segal, reprinted from Parabola Magazine, as well as in his prose, poetry and sketches. Even the photographs of Mr. Segal can stir a higher energy within.A book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Opening","review":"The French aviator, adventurer, and author Antoine de Saint-Exupery, probably best known for his classic children's book The Little Prince, was also an aircraft designer.

Clear of all psycho-pompous fluff, the author painstakingly communicates with a minimalist Zen touch the subtle processes unlocking consciousness from the quotidian of programmed mentation. Opening is not so much a literary undertaking as it is a series of loosely connected revelations on psycho-spiritual matters including lyrical parables, conversations with spiritual aficionados, a dialogue with the Tibetan Master Chatral Rinpoche and an exegetic gem on the Buddhist Ten Oxherding Pictures. Opening is a treasure chest of spiritual insights, a testament to a sage realized in the quest to know thy self.

The author grabs your attention immediately and never loses his readers through his excellent use of vivid imagery, Spanish vocabulary and phrases, profanity, and detailed emotional prose. One can easily get a mental picture of the action described in this book's pages.Down These Mean Streets tells the story of a dark-complected Puerto Rican/Cuban who is viewed by the outside world as Black, rather than Latino. Thomas is the target of racial hostility and bigotry throughout his young life, which fuels his internal rage and anger at the world. To make matters worse, Piri's father is a straight-up accomodationist who believes it honorable to cow-tow to white society - something that leads Piri to lose respect for his dad.I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book has much in common with The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Having read both, I notice parallel's in Piri's and Malcolm's lives: both encountered harsh racial prejudice and discrimination early in life which lead them into criminal enterprise, both had life-altering experiences in prison, and both had serious questions about their personal identities due to their complexions.This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. It is a must read for anyone with an interest in Puerto Rican studies, racial/ethnic relations, or urban literature. I guarantee this book will keep you captivated. I hope one day soon they turn this classic book into a motion picture."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I think that this book should be required for all Puerto Rican people who live in New York. This book talks about what it was like to grow up in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. I think that this book does a good job explaining the experiences of a family. Also it talks about what Piri Thomas does and what kind of problems he is involved with, like drugs, in gangs, and that's very similar of what is going on now. I think people who don't want to be in a real trouble should read this book. I enjoyed the when Piri Thomas was sleeping out of his house because I imaging what can happen to me if I do the same things. This is the best book for anyone who is interested in learning about what is like for a Puerto Rican family to live in New York City."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I loved this book it was comforting and very honest 50 million thumbs up! if u liked this book you'll love always running!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a raw, no holds barred book written by a veteran of the street life.

Thomas, a Puerto Rican, becomes involved in drugs, crime, and violence -- then ending up in prison. The manner in which he describes the events make you feel as though you've been there. It's a really ugly scene, but it's told extremely well and will keep you reading. The writing is so candid it's refreshing."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"\\"Down These Mean Streets\\" gets you three books for the price of one.The first book is true to its title: a young man's coming of age along the dangerous byways of Spanish Harlem.Here we see the perils associated with traversing the concrete jungle, the need for toughness and concomitant death of tenderness in youth.Author Piri Thomas details what life was like for Puerto Ricans moving into what had been an Italian neighborhood and the Italians' response to their displacement.Thomas was born in the 1920s, so that the time covered here ranges from the '30s to, perhaps, the early '50s, rendering his once hip track of new-lit jargon and streetjabber something of a timepiece.Thomas' novel came out in 1967 and one can imagine the liberal chic set of Mayor John Lindsay's New York jumping like cats to nip at his rough-edged peek beneath the shiny Big Apple's skin.Although this kind of literature has become stock in the book trade (James Frey anyone?), Thomas' autobiographical recounting of life among the rough Puerto Rican boys on his street can still shock.His detached description of when the bored kids willingly go up to the apartment of some transvestites for homosexual interaction, pot, and booze, is rather striking and unsettling.The second \\"book\\" deals with young Piri's identity crisis. One which can be extended to all the Puerto Ricans of his time.highwayscribery is ignorant of what they are thinking today, but in Thomas's time, there was much ado over skin color, the islanders running from evening black to lily white as they do.Thomas' problem was that he was darker, while his brothers were white. As a Puerto Rican, he did not, at first, view himself as being in the same boat as the African-Americans with whom his people crowded Harlem.But when the family makes an escape to suburban Long Island, Piri comes in for a bit of a shock, and slinks back to \\"El Barrio\\" with a severe chip on his shoulder and a deeper sense of shared experience with the American Negro.This issue is aired-out in discussions with folks of different skin pigmentation, each of whom expresses a unique understanding of the related questions. For this reviewer, it went on a little too long, and seemed a little self-indulgent.Especially for a young man confronted with the serious matter of economic survival in a cruel and unforgiving city.Nonetheless, Thomas' youthful obsession generates an anger which serves as bridge to the third book, which is a jail tale.Identity issues unresolved, his skin color serving him poorly in prejudiced city, the young man goes on a crime spree, again remarkable for its matter-of-fact execution, which lands him in the state penitentiary.Perhaps it was novel at the time, but today his efforts to maintain a tough guy's rep -- primarily to avoid being sodomized by bigger, harder criminals (no pun intended) -- while rehabilitating himself with a little Nation of Islam cant and some in-house masonry training are now familiar fodder.Thomas' attempt to forge a street-seasoned prose is uneven. He never really finds a groove and seems almost relieved to let more articulate characters do some of the heavy lifting where the expression of complex ideas is involved.Nonetheless, he succeeds in engaging the reader, pulling of that time-tested trick of getting people to root for a guy doing bad things, by peeling back the hard layers and revealing a human and worthy heart."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book was in perfect condition when I received it.

It's so simple and poorly written it would seem to be for slow readers or middle schoolers, yet the filthy language makes its questionable for unsophisticated readers.There is a huge problem with the narration. Mr. Thomas is writing 10 years after the story ends, when he is supposedly a changed and more educated man, but throughout the story reverts to his uneducated gangland Spanish, I guess to keep it real. Throughout, he is incredibly violent, thoughtless, race obsessed, and self absorbed. Yet he offers no apologies to the family members or innocent bystanders he's hurt. He refers to his illegitimate son, but never gets back to him. Ironically, his family tried to better the situation by moving out to Long Island, but he ran back the world of crime and poverty, supposedly because two white kids said something that hurt his feelings.Apparently in prison, and afterward, he dabbled in religion to help get himself straight, yet he makes no clear statement of what his new beliefs are. In one troubling scene he counsels with a black Muslim inmate who constantly refers to whites as devils. In the end, he does not convert to Islam, but seems to have no problem with this form of racism. The story ends with him tempted to share heroin with a junky and barely pulling himself away. This hardly shows him to be a changed man, and we have no idea what's happened since. He constantly refers to Trina, his love interest, but never gives us any feeling for what sets her apart. He mentions she's pretty, but he's apparently not motivated by lust, since he bangs other women throughout while saving her for marriage. Despite his constant mention of her, we really know nothing about her.In the afterword, written in 1997, 68 year Mr. Thomas seems to have learned nothing, blaming the problems of the inner city on racism and the Clinton era welfare reforms. Naturally, there's no mention of single parent families, welfare dependency, radical Islam, or the Balkanization of the American identity as having anything to do with the continued miseries. Guess he knows politically where his bread gets buttered.It's not a bad read, but it has no educational value and does not belong in a school curriculum."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"My mother had this book for one of her college courses while I was in junior high so I gave it a try and loved it.

The protagonist Piri is growing up in Spanish Harlem with his family. growing up in the His brother goes through everything with him. If you are ghetto streets of New York you know what is going on and what you've got to live with every day of your life. Piri Thomas lives his young life going through the mean streets of Spanish Harlem. He is a very creative character with knowledge about his streets and he makes positive decisions about the situations he runs into in his life.This book is very good for anyone to read and realize their life is not to be taken granted, especially if you're growing up in the ghetto of America. I recommend this book for everyone who hasn't read it yet to experience life in the ghetto and walk through Piri's shoes. This book is good. It is one of the best I have ever read and I was hooked on it once I realized that I could relate to it. I was in the mind zone of Piri and it was like I was feeling the streets at the moment and Piri's pain and his way of living and surviving because I know it's not easy growing up in the ghetto. ."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Piri Thomas is a great writer. From the First page this book had me hooked.

I would definitly recommend this book......A++"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Very compelling. Piri Thomas does an excellent job in depicting the struggle of a black Puerto Rican in New York. Touching and Inspirational."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Book Review: Down These Mean StreetsWe recommend this book because Piri Thomas wrote the book in a way that you can visualize the story. This book is interesting because it talks about a young Latino's life growing up in the streets of Harlem New York in the 30's. However Piri the main character in the story gets discriminated throughout his young life for being a black Puerto Rican. We think this book has some strong scenes suitable for children under 13. Little by little the story gets interesting to the point where you don't want to stop reading. To conclude, this story is a good autobiography to learn from"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I remember reading this book for the first time in 1970. I was an eight grader at JHS 117 on 109th Street in East Harlem. Those were difficult times in El Barrio, especially for poor minority teenagers. Picking up this book up again and reading it was like experiencing it for the first time. You see it magnified once you have really lived life! There was so much that I really did not clearly understand as a 14-year-old as I do now. My heart mourns for all of our sisters and brothers who were lost in the struggle to grow and be what they could have become despite that terrible disease of man, Racism. Thank you Peri. I think that because of your book, you inspired many brothers and sisters to write about their experiences in New York as Puerto Ricans."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"TODAYS TROUBLED YOUTH CAN RELATE TO PIRI'S EXPERIENCE. I HAVE READ THIS TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE AMAZED THAT IT WAS WRITTEN 30 YEARS AGO. A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH TROUBLED TEENS."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this book about 28 years ago when I was in JHS in Brooklyn, NYC. I enjoyed reading this autobiography. I also went through racial problems too while growing up. I grew up with Puerto Rican's and my family is from South America. I can relate with Piri, because by me being hispanic & hanging with my PR peeps and my Afro-American peeps, I got jumped so many times by the Italians. I learned how to defend myself & fight. Piri's writing is hardcore & doesn't hold anything back. I couldn't put the book down, mind you, I didn't like to read as a kid but after I read this book, I was happy that I did read it & did my book report for school. I got an A+ I remember. The way Piri Thomas wrote his book; makes you feel like you are actually living it with him. There are many parts where I got emotional, sad, angry because I went through something similar in the late 70's. I have always wanted to meet Piri Thomas in person, and thank him for such a wonderful book he wrote and to tell him, I also, felt his pain and treat him to a good home cooked PR/Hispanic dinner. It's alright though because Mr. Piri Thomas, left an everlasting impression on me. I would recommend everyone to read this book regardless of any race or nationality. It was very well written and Piri expressed himself with true honesty. I love, love, love this book and I now want it on my mobile kindle now. Mr. Piri Thomas if you ever read this review, please, let it be known, that I am writing this with all my heart. Peace be with you & all. GOD bless."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Grabbed it off my english teachers shelf junior year of high school, loved it so much I never gave it back. This is an amazingly wonderful book. Vivid writing style...I could see every last detail in my head. It was like a movie in my brain. Love it."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; by Piri Thomas is absouletly amazing. It depicts a emotional and physical journey through the eyes of a confused and curious Puert Rican American.Not only does the novel describe events and situations that any and all races can relate to but it reveals emotions that everyone is challeneged with throughout there life. I felt that I was experiencing the same emotions as Piri and having this kind of connection with an author definetly defines a well-written book. I am certain that anyone will enjoy this book and maybe learn from it just like I have.Thanks Alot to Piri for having written an excellent book and for having the courage to allow many readers to enter another world."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Priri Thomas didn't have a lot going for him. He lived in East Harlem, a rough neighborhood even in the 1930's. His color barred him from well-paid jobs. His African roots made him unwanted by his Cuban and Puerto Rican relatives. Lastly, his father was a brute.The book begins with Piri running out of the house because he's angry. Angry at his father for hitting him. Angry that his father hit him kust for spilling something. Angry that his father is always hitting him. But soon he's scared; the streets are dark, the streets are cold, he's hungry, and like any little kid, he really just wants to be home with people that love him.Bill Cosby once said that in his day, you couldn't skip school because \\"there was an eye behind every drawn curtain.\\" But even in his day, some parents abused and neglected their children. Those were the children that skipped school, lived on the streets, and joined gangs as a substitute for family.It's like my grandfather used to, there never were any \\"good old days.\\""},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean Streets is the story of Piri Thomas' journey into adulthood. The book is set in Spanish Harlem in the 1940s. The author's writing style is refreshing and lyrical. He uses some Spanish words here and there(readers might find the glossary in the back of the book helpful), and kicks in a few slang words as well, which makes the dialogs that much more genuine.Piri struggles through poverty, family troubles, and desperately wanting to belong. He fights with being a dark skinned Puerto Rican during a time when racism was strong, and trying to find his place as neither black nor white. Piri did some not-so-good things in his life, being in a gang, drug addiction, and armed robbery among other things, but throughout it all it is easy to tell that Piri is a good guy at heart.Overall, this is a captivating story. You might find yourself wondering what you would have done faced with the same situations. I even found myself rooting for Piri at times. This book is still a very accurate depiction of \\"the hoods\\" of New York, despite being published for the first time about 40 years ago.I was sad to have to finish the book, and in the end I felt like I knew Piri. I look forward to re-reading this book over the years. It is truly a classic. Everyone should read it. Anyone can find something in the story that they will be able to relate to."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I've read this book more than a few times and have taught it to different level readers a few extra times. There was one high school student who came to me after the book was done and told me, \\"This is the first book I ever finished.\\" Even if it's not the first book you've read, you'll find writing that is fearless, honest, and powerful.

The teacher handed out a booklet of one of the chapters in this book. I thought that the chapter was absolutely funny, so I showed it to a couple of my friends. The chapter he handed out was called Alien Turf. I felt that there are sometimes in your life that you don't really fit in, and that there is always somebody that is going to give you a hard time. In this case Piri was the new kid on the block, and he was of a different race from everyone else. His family were the only Puerto Ricans that lived in an Italian neighborhood. He was picked on by a group of young Italians and in the end after the battle with these guys, they all became good friends in the end. After this chapter I had to read the book Down These Mean Streets.The book is outstanding. I have never read something that gives you so many emotions and vivid images in your head. He describes what he goes through in a completely understandable and detailed way. You are able to just picture it in you head, like a movie, or television show, or you even could feel it like something you've been through.I recommend this book for anyone who's not read it yet. This book is interesting. You could understand the way he details everything, and it's going to affect you in many different ways. (Emotionally and mentally)."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I was raised in New York and as I get older I love to read what people have written about their experiences living there.

It is in great condition and I received sooner rather than later. Grateful to the house I purchased it from. Thank you."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean StreetsEven though the language Piri Thomas uses throughout most of this book is dated, it doesn't matter. We know we're reading about a young gangster who grew up in Spanish Harlem in the 40's and 50's. He also grew up as a Morenito, a black Puero Rican. He got his racial identity from his father, a Moreno, although all of his other siblings resembled their mother who was clearly a white Puerto Rican. Thus, the book tells a lot about racial prejudice, a young man whose parents seemed to have almost no control over him and who is looking for where he belongs in this country of his. The book is so powerful and it deals not only with the issues of race, but also drug addiction, infidelity, death, prison, and the gangster life. It also deals with redemption, great loss, and learning the hard way, but still learning. I wanted to write to Piri Thomas to let him know that I loved his book so much, but I was reading about him on Amazon and found out that he had passed away only a month before I finished his book. I cried throughout the book, but I also cried when I read that he had passed away after what was a very hard life. I ended up giving this book to one of my students who had fought with an alcohol addiction and a hard life for many years and is black and a recovering alcoholic now. I hope he gets something out of it. This book could easily be made into a movie and I think it should be and now is the time if ever."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Great reading. Growing up in East Harlem New York and readinis this book makes for a \\"blast to the past\\". You will be transported back in time and revisit many similar events that had taken place in your own personal history. Check it out for yourself and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this book when I was maybe 12 years old, in 1967. I had to get \\"special permission\\" from the Philadelphia public library to check it out. I recall the librarian advising me that the content was \\"rather rough,\\" and asking if I was sure I could handle it. I was sure, and I loved it.In his memoir, Piri Thomas makes personal his experience growing up in the barrio in Harlem. His mean streets jump to life for the reader. Sights and sounds are real. You see what he sees, feel what he feels: streets shining in the rain--sometimes dark and empty, dangerous; sometimes alive with neighbors and kids. You suffer with him as he untangles the threads of his relationship with his father, and as he learns to differentiate between machismo and manhood. And you live in prison with him, struggling to survive in a system built to destroy him.The descriptive form of the writing, the music in the narrative, the beat and cadence, all make this the most readable of books. You will live in it for days, maybe years, after you finish, and you will likely read it again.While the language in \\"Down These Mean Streets\\" may at times seem dated, the message is not. (Junot Diaz describes in more current vernacular the Dominican experience in New York and New Jersey.) In fact, any American immigrant from today or past decades could tell a similar story about surviving in a new place. Few, though, can tell it with the same impact as Piri Thomas."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"My boyfriend love this book. I glad I was able to get it for his birthday...Thanks"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book is written so well that you can feel the streets and his life as he felt them, it is as if you were living through that era and through his experiences with him. If you lived through that era or have experienced some of the things he did in your life it brings you back to your own childhood with a nostalgic feeling. It does have some curses which I don't really care for, it is the way he expresses specific feelings, or things he or others specifically expressed at that time, but fortunately is not that much. It has that NYC streets authenticity; the story was written decades ago but certain parts feel as if they were written yesterday. It is an excellent book that is straight forward and hard to put down once you get into it; by the time you know it, you're done."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"Down These Mean Streets was a breakthrough book for Latinos. For a Chicano like me, it was like the Autobiography of Malcolm X was for African Americans. Even though Thomas was writing about an East coast that I have never known, I felt like this was the first book to make me aware that there were experiences that were like mine that weren't only mine. Like the Chicano poet Ricardo Sanchez, anger was something political but dealt with best through poetic words and language."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"If you want to hear the truth about the old days, here it is. This was a perfect example of what many people in El Barrio saw and/or did. Its so real that if you read certain passages slowly, and then close your eyes, you could actually see how it went down. This book can help you look deep and realize that we, in this day and age, have it 50 times better than our fathers and grandfathers. Lets thank our stars and our parents. Praise to you \\"Don\\" Piri."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I first heard this man, Mr. Piri Thomas, speak in the spring of 1993 at Cal State University at Hayward. I was so moved (as a high school student) that I had our school (California High School) invite him to speak at our &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; day on June 4th, 1993. I loved his poetic 'realness' - and it was the first time I felt really empowered as a person of color living in a largely suburban environment.His experience and insight was so raw and so 'real'. In this autobiography, Mr. Thomas addresses issues of racial identity (he was dark skinned, but his brother was lighter skinned/more white looking) and how racism affected him as a Puerto Recan. It describes him growing up in Spanish Harlem, NY, moving down the coast, meeting friends and some crazy situations. I remember him really hitting rock bottom, and then coming out in the end. I always looked forward to reading on.I read somewhere that R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight considers this his favorite book. That's when I knew I just wasn't being easily impressed. This is an excellent life story, well written, and a must read for anyone interested in the topic of racial identity. Yes, we are all individuals, but we should never deny our heritage...thank you Mr. Piri Thomas. I feel nothing but the deepest respect for you...thanks for your vision, insight and generosity.Knyte (Trust Me)P.S. If I could give more than five stars...I would"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"\\"Down These Mean Streets,\\" by Piri Thomas, tells a story of growing up as a dark-skinned Puerto Rican in New York City. First published in 1967, the book has been re-issued in a 30th anniversary edition with an afterword by the author.The book opens in 1941, with 12-year old Piri living in New York with his family. The narrative recounts his growth into manhood; we accompany Piri as he gets into fights, uses illegal drugs, becomes a violent criminal, spends time in prison, and experiences conflict within his own family.This is a raw, powerful book. Thomas has a vigorous, muscular prose style that incorporates many Spanish terms (readers may find the glossary at the end of the book useful). The book raises many questions about racial and ethnic identity as Piri has relationships with many different people of various colors and cultures. Thomas also explores the interconnections of race and religion, and vividly portrays the subculture of prison life.This is an essential book for anyone interested in the Puerto Rican experience on the U.S. mainland. The book has a lot in common with \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\\" Also recommended as a companion text: Miguel Pinero's play \\"Short Eyes.\\""},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I read this wonderful book over 15 years ago. Although most of its details have faded with time, its impact has not. As a Puerto Rican male growing up in the Bronx, I could certainly relate to much of what Piri Thomas was describing. But &quot;Mean Streets&quot; is so powerful and gripping, that anyone who reads it will be moved and mesmorized. This is truly a modern-day classic that will surely withstand the test of time. Its lessons are appropriate for all youth everywhere and always."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!"},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is one of the first books I read, and it was very moving, touching and powerful for me. Being Boricua (Puerto Rican), born and raised in NYC's El Barrio, myself, and coming up on the same streets Piri lived on and wrote about made this book that much more special and personal for me. I was virtually able to re-live Piri's life through his book and eyes, albiet 50+ years later.Piri's writing style is icy clear, lucid, and sometimes pretty raw. He writes so artfully that the entire book becomes like an epic saga, one powerful movie in your mind! It's a story of unvarnished reality. Piri pulls no punches. (I'm imagining you should probably be 15+ or so to read this.) You'll laugh, cry, get angry and go on a roller coaster of emotions with DTMS. I was so moved and touched by Piri's work, that I read all of his other books, and developed a new outlook and perspective on everything from writing, to self identity, and dignity (one of Piri's faves).Buy Down These Mean Streets, in English or Spanish (Por Estas Calles Bravas), and pass it on. (I GUARANTEE you'll love it!) Piri is one of our first...and one of our best! The man's been p'al carajo and back, and tells it all in his unique Boricua style (often imitated, never duplicated).I developed a lot of affection and love for Brother Piri, and was even fortunate enough to meet the Living Legend and have him over our home for an unforgettable dinner as our guest, where my entire familia, friends and neighbors (who I all got to read his books) all had the pleasure of meeting the larger than life Piri!Much love, and respect to Brother Piri and and all of you, mi gente!

Me myself being Black and Puerto Rican and growing up in New York, I was able to identify with so many of his feelings and the way he handled them. I felt as if I was right in the middle of the scene, sometimes wanting to comfort him in his shortcomings and to let him know he wasn't the only one confused on which role to play. This book was so good that I finished it in a time span of 3 days and will recommend it to anyone who's longing for knowledge of insight of a Black Puerto Rican or Latino growing up in NYC."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This has to be one of the most important books in Newyorican literature. Equally as beautifully written as, Esmeralda Santiago's \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\". And Like Santiago's book, this one belongs in every Puerto Rican home. The book is powerful, raw, and holds nothing back. This is the autobiography of Piri Thomas, a Puerto Rican growing up in the harsh streets of Spanish Harlem. His harsh and troublesome relationship with his father. His early loss of his mother. Growing up with his friends in a gang, drugs, facing racism, incarceration, and at the end. Healing and growing.This book was given to me by a School Counselor in High School, and it has been with me ever since. Working with Street teenagers, I have also followed the tradition of my school councilor, and have given it to a few kids from the neighborhood who have never read an entire book in their whole lives. Afterwards, they have come back and thanked me. This is one of those books that hits the mark.Piri Thomas's \\"Down These mean Streets\\" holds an important spot in my library, it is a book that should be read, by all young men, no matter your backgrounds. It shows that no matter how harsh life may be, no matter how many bad cards life deals you, or how many harsh blows it throws at you, there is always hope. If Piri Thoma, as well as my self made it out of the streets alive, and live today in Peace, anyone can. Highly Recomended."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"It caught my eye as soon as I started reading it. It's about a boy living in &quot;El Barrio&quot;.

What made it particularly hard for Piri was his skin color. In Spanish countries it is possible to be black and Puerto Rican, Dominican, Venezuelan or what have you. Sadly many Hispanics (especially Puerto Rican), discovered that in addition to having a different culture, the skin color also represented a much deeper problem. We get a glimpse at life in the heart of Spanish Harlem, the good, the bad and the ugly. The reader will be entertained as Piri walks you through the intricacies of 'el barrio'. He holds nothing back!In the end this is a complex novel that can only make you proud to be Hispanic."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This book is about a boy who grows up in the streets of Harlen, New York. He goes through lots of life changing experiences that change the way his life will go. One of the main events would be when he begins to sell drugs. That isn't the only thing. Many things come around make him have to choose to go the good or the bad way. This is a good book for people who have grown up in the same evironment as he did.I would recomend this book to anybody who has had it hard when they grew up. I could have somewhat relate to him but not completely. I figure this book is good for teenage boys and maybe some adults. It all depends on your choice of book. If you are looking for a book to sit and read on your spare time, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"I thought that piri thomas wrote a great book. his life was very complicated not only with people but his own family. piri's Father was always hitting him and didn't treat him like his other brothers and sisters. Piri went through alot and he shared it in this book. I decided to read this book becuz my sister read this book in her english class and she said it was a good book. i decided to read it and i thought wow! this man has gone through alot. People treat people [in a disrespectful manner] sometimes but i mean this was too much. During his childhood people kept saying just becuz he is black it makes him black but he was pureto rican.i think people can be cold hearted sometimes for doing something like this. Piri is also sent to jail becuz of shooting a cop. he also loses his mother who was sick. his father threw him out of the house and piri didn't really care anymore. Piri also taking drugs which get way out of hand and he gets sick and stays at his friends house so he can get better. he also experiences sex with many woman. he even gets one pregnant and he doesn't love her he love another girl her name is trina. I think piri wrote this book for these reasons to show you he got involed with a wrong group and the way people can be to someone who is black. he was always wondering why couldn't he be like his brothers and sisters white not black. he wanted to be treated like every white person treated each other. he also started to get offended when people called him mean names and i know everyone would get mad if they called you watever he wrote in the book.i think this book was great and this book should be for kids a little older than my age becuz you have to understand this book about piri's life. I think kids in 10th grade like my sister should read it. you wouldn't want to put down this great book."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"This is an intense no holds barred glimpse into the ugly world of drugs, addiction, self-analysis,and the criminal world. The author gives the reader a realistic view into the world that was apart of his daily existance while growing up in Spanish Harlem. He also makes a self-realization about his ethnic identity and his addiction to drugs. He shares his thoughts about being involved in the criminal elements that seemed to be all around him. The author offers graphic images of his experiences in Spanish Harlem, that remains with the reader long after finishing the book. The author's family struggles and his disappointing moments are things that most kids today experience in their lives. I believe this book can serve as an inspiration to anyone who has felt they were an outsider while growing up in a tough neighborhood."},{"Title":"Down these mean streets","review":"It's worth reading now AND again.

If you have ever been hooked on drugs, gangs, the street, this book tells yours story. If you made it out, albeit with a few scrapes, this is your story. It is the tale of all Latinos in one book. It is the Latino experience in America. And that's why it needs to be read. Schools should make it required reading, parents should encourage it as summer reading (however, make sure your kids are mature enough to deal with some of the stronger material included).Buy it, read it, love it.

However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled \\"The Sacred And The Profane\\", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message."},{"Title":"Exposed to the J Curve: Understanding and Managing Private Equity Fund Investments","review":"This new book gives a very good insight and overview into the world of private equity for the interested student and practitioner.In fact, it starts from the very basics, explaining the market and the nature of PE fund investments, presenting the various data providers in the market, and goes on to tread very complex issues like state-of-the-art forecasting & monitoring portfolios, important legal issues, advanced cash flow modelling and risk assessment techniques, funds of funds, CFOs and secondaries.The authors are both highly renowned experts in the PEF industry, Mr. Weidig as a consultant with various publications regarding funds and funds-of-funds, and Mr. Grabenwarter as head of division for Venture Capital Operations at the EIF.Both combine theoretical understanding with years of experience in the PE funds market, as well as hands-on experience with building risk management systems for this specific type of financial investment - a combination rarely encountered in the world of PE funds!"},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"Tideland is a fascinating read that stops just short of being good enough to be considered a classic. Even if at first it seems just another updated version of Alice In Wonderland / The Wizard of Oz / The Neverending Story etc. - a child creating a fantasy world as a way of dealing with difficulties of life and a metaphor for growing up - it becomes abundantly clear very early on that Jeliza-Rose's story is a very different one from those of Alice and Dorothy. Tideland is decisively stronger and darker than those classics, and subtlety is all but forgotten; Mitch Cullin makes no attempt to disguise the horrors he writes about or to disguise his novel as a children's tale. Tideland is definitely a novel for adults, and Cullin gives the reader the awful truth straight and headlong.That is the novel's strength but also its weakness. All too often Cullin seems to be bent on shocking the reader in any manner available to him, and the hopelessness of Jeliza-Rose's life is so obvious and overwhelming, the novel soon becomes unbearably depressing. Jeliza-Rose's optimism fails to convince; her situation is too impossible, and she is obviously far too disturbed and distorted to be taken seriously as a narrator. Which brings me to the biggest problem I had with the novel - even though I got past all the others, this kept bugging me. Cullin seems not entirely certain of the manner and style in which he narrates his story. The story is told in the past tense - in a way that hints at a long period of time passed between the event and the telling. However, Jeliza-Rose as a narrator seems sometimes aware of her situation and sometimes not; sometimes the story is told from the point of view of a little girl in a disturbed state of mind, sometimes that of a grown woman looking back at her own harsh childhood. And all too often Cullin's own voice creeps into the mix.With that chronic stylistic problem in mind, the story of Tideland is still fascinating enough to be an excellent read. Yes, it's depressing and it's frustrating, but it's also not too long for its own good and fueled with enough humor, morbid and dark though it is, to make it quick and engrossing. Tideland is not an easy read, but a difficult and pessimistic tale. While it falls somewhat between the lines, not at all working as a mature and sophisticated children's tale and not quite complete enough to be a real literary classic - Tideland fails to reach the full of its potential but it's filled with original and enticing imagery and descriptions, and a terrific little story. I'm excited to see it transformed to the big screen by the great Terry Gilliam, because the dark and surreal imagery has great cinematic potential and Gilliam is probably the best man to bring out the book's terrific potential. It's all too likely that the film will be good enough to completely overshadow the novel, but it's still worth checking out."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"Both poetic and thrilling, the best thing about this novel in the texture: the language and visual imagery are both stunning. This is a wonderful take on a twisted childhood, and so it's no surpirise Terry Gilliam will direct the movie version: the surreal and dreamy misprision is right up his alley. One might quibble that the voice of the narrator in the novel would be beyond that of a child, but the payoff of the reading experience is probably worth the suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"Tideland seized my imagination from the first page, and I think most readers will follow Cullin's extraordinary conceptions with astonishment and delight. Told in the past tense, thus suggesting a good deal of time has passed before its telling, Jeliza-Rose's adventures among the mesquites are haunting, strange, and often beautiful. Her encounters with the odd pair of Dell and Dickens come at a welcome time, yet leads us down an even darker path of family secrets and hidden boxes of dynamite.Considering Tideland came just months after Cullin's Branches and only a few months before his equally wonderful but different The Cosmology of Bing, one can only imagine what this very talented and singular storyteller has up his sleeve next. Until then, I highly recommend the curious world of Tideland, which is a work of so unusual a nature as to throw new light on Cullin's already brilliant career."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"I unfortunately saw the movie first which was good but this was about eight years ago and since it's first introduction I've been captivated by Jeliza Rose. I remember when watching the movie I felt like a child, a fear always settled down in my gut although I didn't recognize it all the time but I always found the world a scary place. What this book does that the movie neglects is really establish the vulnerability of a child like a chick from from his nest, which comes to the reader as Jeliza's own recollection of her life before What Rocks. Sometimes disturbing but never inappropriate, it paints a picture or rather Jeliza paints a picture with probably no more than five characters which make a bigger world than the one I live in. So when I finished the book it felt like I was saying goodbye to a friend or as if all of a sudden I remembered my dear friend I grew up with in the slums of Mexico because his story could have been Jeliza's."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"Not everyone will love this book, but those who do will love it to death. It is disturbing and uncomfortable yet sweet and beautiful. The movie is awesome too. amen."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"If you're interested in reading books that are strange and possibly disturbing then this might be for you. I saw the movie before I read the book, which I normally hate doing, but it didn't matter so much here. The movie was pretty crazy and did follow the book to an extent, but the book was definitely it's own creature- Compelling from beginning to end.I found the story to be unique and horrifying, but with an element of fantasy that also made the main character's unfortunate circumstances seem easier to accept.I really like this book and have recommended it to several of my friends. It's definitely not for everyone, though. Like, I wouldn't probably recommend it to my grandma."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"I tracked down the book after veiwing the movie adaptation first. I felt like the book was a little too vague for me to really enjoy. I never really connected with any of the characters or cared what happened to anybody. I was disappointed because the plot elements and character sketches were so promising, but the storytelling just fell flat.I think that it's worth a read, but I wouldn't recommend buying a copy to do it. I'd actually suggest watching the movie because it's very well done and makes the story as compelling as it has the potential to be."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"At first I was blown away by Tideland and the protagonist Jeliza-Rose, with no one for company but various pieces of Barbie dolls picked up in a 5/$1 bin at the thrift store, running wild in the wilds of rural Texas. I was enchanted by the Southern Gothic flavor, by Jeliza-Rose's voice--at once childish and yet overly mature for her age--and by Cullins' descriptions that had me right there, running beside Jeliza-Rose watching the lightening bugs and worrying about bog men.But then he lost me.He took the grotesque element of Southern Gothic to the maximum; it was as if he set out to add anything that might possibly be appalling or unappealing or just plain, well, grotesque without making it really fit the plot, throwing it in willy-nilly just for the shock factor.Now, I'm sure that's not the case, but unlike other Southern Gothic authors (Flannery O'Conner springs to mind) who are making a point with their grotesque and unappealing characters and situations, in Tideland, they were just there. It went from a book that, in the first couple of chapters, I was certain would be a 5 star favorite, to being a barely acceptable \\"okay\\" by the time I finished slogging through it."},{"Title":"Tideland","review":"Alas, it seems that Terry Gilliam's film adaptation, beset with problems, will not serve well this fine, imaginative novel. That is a shame, because I am convinced that one day this book will be a classic, with a place of its own next to Flannery O'Connor's \\"Wise Blood\\", and the works of William Faulkner.I entreat those of you who like beautiful, evocative writing combined with indelibly grotesque characters to give this book a try.***SPOILER ALERT!!*** IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE READING A PLOT SUMMARY, STOP RIGHT HERE.To read this book is to inhabit the mind of Jeliza-Rose, the narrator. Jeliza-Rose is an unfortunate young girl, a haunting victim in the mold of Edward Gorey's \\"Hapless Child\\". Both of her parents are junkies, and by the time she is nine, Jeliza-Rose has learned to prepare their fixes for them. When the mother overdoses and dies, Jeliza-Rose's father (a has-been Rock 'n Roller) travels to Texas with her by Greyhound bus to find sanctuary in his family's remote and deserted homestead. Not long after moving into the house, the father also dies of an apparent overdose. As her father reposes untouched in his chair, the utterly alone jeliza- Rose retreats into the shadowy world of her imagination. She occupies herself by battling the natural intrusions of the outside world--red ants and a noisome squirrel that invade the house. There is a beautiful, dreamy suspension about these interludes. Jeliza-Rose further protects herself by engaging in imaginary telepathic conversations with her collection of Barbie-doll heads, particularly one that she calls \\"Classique\\". The dolls are enlisted as her allies. For parts of the book, the doll heads seem to function like a Greek chorus, bouncing comments both satirical and poignant back to Jeliza-Rose as she play-acts through her traumas.As Jeliza-Rose begins tentatively exploring the area around the house, she encounters a mysterious, shrouded woman at work gardening. After observing the woman from a distance, Jeliza-Rose's curiosity moves her toward making contact. The woman at first seems only aloof and severe--but instead of hope for Jeliza-Rose's plight, the woman (\\"Dell\\") offers only a more deeply disturbed pathology. Jeliza-Rose is drawn into her web, where also resides \\"Dickens\\", Dell's freakish, child-like brother. Jeliza-Rose forms a queasy bond with Dickens, as his \\"playmate.\\"At the conclusion of the book, Dickens in effect blasts a hole into the real world by dynamiting a passenger train which runs by the property. Whether Jeliza-Rose will choose to be rescued remains unclear, but Mitch Cullin seems to imply that only another catastrophe can free the girl from her doomed existence.Mitch Cullin has created a character, in Jeliza-Rose, that will haunt your mind long after you have finished this book. She is the wispish, precociously imaginative Alice-in-Wonderland for our dark, drug-addled times."},{"Title":"May You Die in Ireland","review":"This is an enjoyable book with an engaging main character. Professor Foley is rumpled and fuzzy, with a tendency to run to fat, but he knows his own mind and he won't let people walk all over him. The little mathematics professor's life is turned upside down when he inherits a castle in Ireland, and he has to deal with thugs, spies, and a pretty Irish lass, with some help from his best friend Oscar, a vigorous chemistry professor, before he can get his life right side up again. All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"May You Die in Ireland","review":"This is a great vintage chase/suspense type novel that I happened upon by accident. I'm glad I did. Most of the action takes place in Ireland as an unsuspecting math professor has microfilm planted on him. The author writes with wit and humor about this bungling professor.If you enjoy vintage detective novels, you will find this a fun read from the 1960s."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"Dr Billinghurst's book indeed suffers from a pretty bad presentation and the Dr's tendency to be a little redundant, but let's face it : the information inside the book will hit like a freight train, anyone who has been feeding kibble for years thinking it was the right thing to do.I was one of those, I am a University Professor and like to think of myself as rather smart, besides I have been competing and breeding rottweilers at the highest levels since 1995 and feel I know lots of things about dogs... and yet this book really pointed at how stupid and naive I had been, feeding my dogs industrial kibble and not seeing for what they were, the warning signs that my dogs needed something else.I didn't hesitate for long after reading that book, I made the switch to Dr Billinghurst's BARF Diet and my dogs have never been so great !There are probably better books in order to have details on feeding ammounts, precise meal suggestions, etc. But Dr Billinghurst's book is a great starting point because it will really change your outlook on dog feeding."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"Yes, it is terribly written. It is also confusing - often contradicting information is presented. BUT this is the book that got tens of thousands of people taking a very hard look at how they have been feeding their dogs, and coming to the conclusion that a commercial diet is by far from the best choice, and in fact raw, natural foods are the best choice for dog nutrition.For those curious about getting started in changing their dogs' diets, I would recommend Kymythy Schultze's &quot;Ultimate Nutrition&quot; and Carina MacDonald's &quot;Raw Dog Food&quot; before recommending Billinghurst's &quot;GYDAB&quot;.But I would buy this little book too, as it's surely the &quot;Grand Daddy of them all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"I found a boon with Dr. Billinghurst's book \\"Give Your Dog a Bone.\\" I've been an advocate of home made meals for some years now. I knew dogs needed the calcium from bones. I thought it was enough to provide ground bone in their meals. I never anticipated that pets might derive satisfaction from doing what God intended them to. Rip, tear and crunch. My dog, up to that point, had been happily living on pooch meat patties I bought from the market. In this book, Dr. Billinghurst condemned these. He said they robbed a dog of satisfaction.Made sense to me. My dog is a rescue. She has issues. She needed some satisfaction.It was so funny giving her her first chicken wing. She had NO idea what to do with it. This really surprised me! She knew she wanted it. She whined and danced around the bone. She licked it and whined some more. My Persian, on the other hand, took to it like Jabba the Hutt.In the past, she'd had taken only two or three minutes to wolf down her food. Sometimes she'd barf it right back up. Too much, too fast. But with the wings, she takes anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to eat. She really enjoys her food. Often she makes little noises like a nursing puppy.To top it off, she had an emotional break through as a result. As an abused dog, Honey had a lot of issues. Some manifested as her over eating. Some manifested as destructive behavior. After putting her on raw meaty bones (complimented with Orbee Tough toys during the day), these behaviors ended. Also, while she remains a very high energy pooch, she is no longer manic.The sad ending to this story is that, I just discovered Dr. Billinghurst has sold out. I liked his book so much I went looking for more. Sadly, his third book advocates exactly what he condemns in his first book. Prefab doggie meat patties. I guess he smelled the profit factor.While it's true that a dog can live a happy life on these patties, don't deny your dog the satisfaction of a raw meaty bone.Also, I have an issue with Brewer's Yeast. If you won't give your pet by-products of a meat plant, why give them by-products of a brewery? Brewer's yeast is bitter and can cause gas. The alternative is often cheaper as well. Because the focus is health. Not making profit off of trash. \\"Nutritional yeast\\" is grown specifically for its nutrient qualities. It has a mild cheddar taste that both my dog and my cats love. You can sprinkle it on food or mix it with a little water and flax seed oil to make a yummy and nutritious sauce. As a side note, it goes great on popcorn."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"After reading many websites on the BARf diet, I was rather disappointed in this book. Our dog trainer recommended it so I purchased it(rather expensive). The author repeats over and over what could have been said in a few chapters.

It would have been nice to have an index to look up specifics, like the actual diet.If you do a search on the BARf diet on the web you'll get precise, comprehensive information for no cost!"},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"All the info you need to feed your dog the way they are meant to eat is in here. Squeamish Americans may have trouble with this Australian vet's no-nonsense philosophy, but he's right and it works. He is a bit repetitive and production costs were kept to a minimum, but it serves his purpose well - to re-educate people. Great basic nutritonal primer.

It is fantastic. I have been feeding the raw diet to my dog ever since.

He also had lots of other ailments and I was one of my vet's best clients.After starting him on Dr. Billinghurst's ORIGINAL diet of raw meaty bones along with vegetables, I haven't needed a vet, except for rabies shots when I wanted to take him with me to Germany, and when he needed stitches in his ear after a fight. I was so happy that he was so healthy!Of course, unfortunately there is no guarantee that your dog will not get ill when fed an exclusively raw diet.My beautiful boy was diagnosed with malignant lymphoma at the age of 8 years and 9 months. The cell-types were of a kind that couldn't be cured with chemotherapy. We did enjoy another 3 months of playfull and quality time together, until I had to take the final decision.My other dog (now 5 years old) has been fed a raw diet since he came to us at age 13 weeks, and has only been to the vet to be chipped and to have his puppy-shots and/or rabies shots. He has never been ill during these past 5 years.Since Dr. Billinghurst's book I read a lot of other books on this topic, but I did find his book helpful for the starter on the path to B.A.R.F., that I was then. I re-read it a couple of times throughout the years.The only thing that surprised me and I think is a pity, is the price..."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"Good information but very repetitive. The book should include a sample schedule or meal plan for feeding your dog but it doesn't. The author just provides some very broad feeding guidelines. Other than that, the very idea of feeding your dogs the way nature designed them to eat makes perfectly good sense to me. I first experimented with my own dog by giving him a raw chicken wing and my dog devoured it with relish!!! No hesitation there, as there was when I gave him cooked chicken. And indeed, my dog's breath really is sweet after all!!! It's raw from now on for my dog."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"I was introduced to this diet by a relative. I have been personally involved in the rescue of abused dogs for years. I am a rather no-nonsense type of person. I have no interest, normally, in alternative medicine, meditation, accupucture or any other sort of \\"alternative lifestyle\\" trends. HOWEVER, this is a book of significance for any who really care about those animals, who by no choice of their own, depend upon human beings for their existance.Basicly, I see a dog as a dog, not a little, slightly retarded person. If a dog can be saved, save it and give a good life. If a dog can't be saved, give it as much comfort and love as possible in its remaining time. I have found this diet to turn around animals faster and to a more robust state of health than I have often believed possible for my animals. Yes, the book is not going to win any awards for literature, but I read this book for informaion, not to play at being petty editor or a know it all. I consider this to be now a valuable addition to my library. Sure you can get a lot of information off the internet about BARF, but this book is important and the author should be supported by purchasing his extrodinary effort. I know what I know, and I know this information is significant. And, by the by, dogs really are ominvores."},{"Title":"Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life","review":"Okay... first off, I feed my dogs & my cat raw. Pretty much the 'Barf' style of feeding. But, I have found this book to be VERY disappointing as I was hoping for some actual facts supported by 'evidence' that I could back my feeding practices up with. Instead, he says a lot of stuff that, while true, he doesn't bother to provide the sources to his 'facts'. So he makes it easy for someone who is skeptical to just dismiss the whole raw feeding thing altogether. This book is very repetitive, each chapter is basically some new info with a bunch of the old info rehashed over again (with no supporting evidence, of course... just 'take my word for it'). If you are looking for 'proof' that raw feeding is the right way to go, I'd recommend reading Tom Lonsdale's books instead (Raw Meaty Bones, Work Wonders). If you're the type of person that isn't looking for proof, but rather 'how to', then this book is probably Okay for that. Another issue that I have is the cheesy cartoons throughout the entire book. It takes a lot away from the author's professionalism & credibility. The 'Work Wonders' book from Lonsdale has the same sort of silly artwork, ????Oh, & another concern... Billinghurst has his own line of special 'supplements' which are ridiculously overpriced, & has a website 'Barfworld' that you have to pay an annual membership fee to be involved with it.

Unfortunately, each time I read it, I get more frustrated. As a starting point, Mr Billinghurt's book is poorly edited. It is full of spelling mistakes, and has no index.The information contained with it, is duplicated several times through the book, making it at least 60% longer than what it should be.Probably the worst thing about the book is Mr Billinghurst has wrongly classifed dogs as omnivores, when indeed, dogs are carnivores. His approach to feeding, consequently, is fundamentally flawed. In this book he promotes feeding grains, fruits, brewer's yeast, and vegetables - none of which are appropriate to feed a dog.At no stage through the book, does the author refer to scientific studies. Such studies abound, and the average dog person, who is invariably very confused as to what they should feed their dogs, feel frustrated that Mr Billinghurst has been unable to substantiate his claims.While Mr Billinghurst is heading towards the right track - ie: commercial pet foods are indeed poisonous to our dogs - his message needs considerable re-work (and a good editor please!) before being ready to hit the mass market.

The book suggests that the necessary choices will be unpopular.\\"When the Trilateral Commission was founded in 1973...the American right saw the Commission's internationalist outlook as a threat to the assertion of America's nationhood.\\" No sh_t!The Trilateralists are for a global world system, increased interdependence, world economic development and integration.So, what do Trilateralists suggest?* Diluting the force of nationalism* Protectionism is out* Handouts for less developed countries* More education expense, less opportunity to earn money, frequent job changes to eat up your savings, low pay and benefit service jobs, and and a lowering of middle-class entitlements like social security.The solution to everything is an ill-defined globalism.

But after 30+ years of use, its little doors have begun to fall off. I'm grateful for a friend's suggestion to purchase this one. The illustration is beautiful! It leads me to imagine myself in a procession towards the manger to adore the Christ-child along with musicians, animals and other little ones.It was a pleasant surprise to find that this calendar is a larger size. It has a sturdy cardboard backing, similar to the thickness of a jigsaw puzzle. I originally bought two, one for my niece and one for her grandparents. After seeing how nice it is, I've ordered a few extra to give to more family members. This will be a lovely activity to share long-distance as we get ready to celebrate Christmas together."},{"Title":"Holy Night Advent Calendar","review":"Just to make sure you are clear of what you are getting here this is a piece of cardboard with a nic epicture on the front of it and little cutouts that open to reveal a picture of a toy or christmas ornament. There is no little gift or candy behind the windows. It seems a bit expensive for what it is. Also I am having trouble with opening the individual windows and not popping a neighboring window open at the same time.Oh well, next year I will buy one from a local store that I know what I am getting but will do it before December as they were all sold out locally."},{"Title":"Holy Night Advent Calendar","review":"This is just a gorgeous calendar. It makes a lovely gift for a child or even an adult as it is a pleaseure to look at and really brings the spirit of Christmas into your home."},{"Title":"Holy Night Advent Calendar","review":"I'd buy these for the kids when we lived in Germany. When the kids moved to the U.S., I'd still buy them, but had trouble wrapping them for shipment because they're a large, odd shape.

There is so much information presented in this book that people who get bogged down in minutae may never finish the book!I own many of the books cited by the author. His quotes are correct. His conclusions are good too! Some reviewers have become all tangled up in the Japanese Naval Codes and when were they broken. The offical documents do not mean that much to me. The reason these offical documents fail to interest me very much is because I have another book that I do not believe the author has!Radio Magazine, May 1941. This is a little booklet type of magazine popular in the 1930's and 40's. It is geared for the radio hobbiest. Back then, radio was still new and millions of people enjoyed building their own radios from parts or even kits. This magazine was for the people to read, learn, and discuss topics of interest. In this issue is an article showing the home hobbiest how to listen to the Japanese coded transmissions at home. It teaches you how to understand the codes and it even shows you how to break the Japanese Navy Codes at home. So to me much of the arguement over when could our Navy read the Japanese Codes becomes irrelavent with the solution published in a hobby magazine seven months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.Regarding the question: Did they use their radios on the way to Pearl Harbor; the answer is a resounding YES! They had to!The Japanese Navy took a northern route just below the Alutian Islands then turned south to Pearl Harbor. During the third week of November this large convoy was hit by a severe winter storm. These big storms are common in the northern Pacific this time of year.The Japanese convoy was scattered over a huge area of the Pacific Ocean. The commanders had to use radio to form up their convoy again. When ships are thiry and sixty miles away it is not possible to signal them by semephore (signal flags). Radio was the way it had to be done. And yes indeed our West Coast radio amatuers were listneing closely as the Japanese convoy found one ship after another. It was quite time consuming and once the ships gathered around they had to sail into a protective formation taking even more time.Station CAST knew this convoy was coming when small groups began meeting outside several Navy bases and then sailed at random up to the very northern Japanese Islands. Then the time came to sail east. Station CAST was in Corrigador Island. This is why the men and files were smuggled out by PT boat and submarine. These men knew too much to let them be prisoners.As you read more about Pearl Harbor you will also want Stinnets book: Day of Deciet. These two books go hand in hand and both are available at Amazon.Whatever you do read! Let it be a passion in you. Learn and love to learn. Never stop regardless of your age. Some of the Pearl Harbor books are written with a liberal slant. It is too bad because I like a book without a political slant. There are enough politics involved when author Stinnet tries and tries to get informatiom through the Freedom of Information Act. An American law to keep govt records open. The unexpected part of this FOIA is to de-classify SECRET documents.Some authors such a Stinnet have done very well with this, Willey has not done as well. However, Willey has done very well in planting the reading and learning seed in others. Willey helps the student of history learn what it means to be hungry for information. Be sure to Read Willey's book along with Stinnets book. You will have fun for sure! George Morgenstern write an excellent book and never forget Crocker's book : Roosevelt's Red Road to Russia. There are about eight or ten books to read that will shatter your thoughts of how it was. Now you graduate into a small group who know. Harry Elmer Barnes wrote several books and edited one named after a phrase he (Beard) coined himself. Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace. This is a group of eight authors driven to tell the truth just like Stinnett and Morgenstern did. A chapter in Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace deals with George Orwells 1984. This is the real back story for the book or movie. If you read this then the rest you read will fall into place. No more confusion taking place. As you read more you learn that the conspiracy is put forth by our govt, and the anti-dote is given by folks like Wiley who are quiet, sincere information sources. When thinking of Pearl Harbor it is fair to ask yourself ........... why in the world are any Pearl Harbor papers still marked secret after 67 years? Read! Read more! Have fun and fill your mind with thoughts! Travel to far away countries in your mind. Have fun and never leave your couch!!!"},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor: Mother of All Conspiracies","review":"This book is Willey's ne plus ultra - he was clearly driven to write it and to self-publish it. While it adds much to the extant Pearl Harbor historiography; it is not recommended to the uninitiated, however. For example, those who do not know that the United States was a declared neutral country prior to Pearl Harbor and what that means will miss some of Willey's conclusions. Clearly much more editing is needed as Willey's writing is, in far too many places, severely and sadly disjointed.But, even given the above, his text anent the Japanese Naval Operations Code (Chapter Two) and the highlighting \\"pre-Pearl Harbor Japanese Naval Despatches\\" found in SRH-406 (Appendix A) indicate just how unsettled Pearl Harbor remains even today. This is worthy of the reader's attention, with the recognition that many Pearl Harbor materials remain classified even after decades of FOIA requests.In Chapter Two, for instance, Willey makes the connection is to British Navy Cypher No. 3 which troubles the NSA even now as the continued censorship of Safford's SRH-149 shows; further, the notes on page 168 point to the many inconsistencies about \\"codebook\\" values and their \\"source.\\" In Appendix A is shown the basic and elementary linguistic forsenic analysis as to when Japanese Naval message translations actually occurred - that is, those SRNs cited were translated in 1941 via Willey.Also found in Willey is an overview of the well-known (See Kahn's The Codebreakers) attack on codes such as JN-25B, where a detailed example is used. Explained also are the numerous \\"less than secure\\" aspects of the code itself (e.g., divisible by three), Japanese code clerks exercising a lack of proper procedures, for example, \\"tailing.\\" Willey notes that the JN25B code had precisely 16,409 values; far fewer than the often quoted 33,333 or 50,000, implying a much more complicated code. Bring a pad and pencil to \\"follow\\" his examples. JN25B really was a very simple code to break.For those untutored in the many esoteric threads of the Pearl Harbor saga - nescient, naive, and gullible absolutes remain evident. Consider Budiansky's \\"none\\" as compared with \\"some\\" from Gish and Parker (each senior NSA historians). These amply display the many gaps in the fundamental knowledge regarding Pearl Harbor.Obviously the next Pearl Harbor chukker is still to come."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor: Mother of All Conspiracies","review":"The book had a lot of good information, but it was hard to follow. I don't know if it was because I was trying to read it quickly for a project for school, but I think the author could have more clearly linked his evidence for FDR knowing that Pearl Harbor was going to happen to the premise of the book, which is that FDR had foreknowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor and let it happen without giving anyone any warning."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor: Mother of All Conspiracies","review":"&quot;Wllley's book is nothing if not exhaustive.

It was proven false by Budiansky and MANY others. THE KEY documents that CONSPIRACY theorists (like Willey) told us the government was keeping SECRET were DECLASSIFIED in 1998 and 1999 and are at the National Archives at College Park. They state that as of December 1, 1941, only 10 percent of the code groups and 5 percent of the additive groups had been recovered in AN-1 (aka JN-25B). Also a report by OP-20-G on decrypts produced in various Japanese code systems for each month of 1941 reports the number of decrypts in JN-25 as \\"none\\" Futhermore a complete internal history of the solution of JN-25, was written at the end of WWII. This document, which provides great cryptologic detail,explains how JN-25 was broken during each period. It fully confirms the testimony of the USN personnel involved. By the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, no JN-25 message had been read for intelligence value.I'd also like to say that ALL of the Japanese officers involved including, Abe, Chigusa, Fuchida, Fujita, Genda, Goto, Ishiguro, Kusaka, Maki, Matsumoto and Yoshioka all maintain radio silence was strictly observed. Fuses were removed from the transmitters and the transmitter keys were disabled. Read (\\"The Pearl Harbor Papers\\") It was NOT possible! Willey, it seems will not engage in defending his work. More that likely he knows that it is outdated."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor: Mother of All Conspiracies","review":"Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor: Mother of All Conspiracies","review":"Mark's book simply fuels the fantasy world of conspiracy \\"fans\\". He routinely takes quotes out of context, ignores inconvenient facts and distorts information to promote his own program, that of hate for FDR. Compare this book with Gordon Prange's works.

Scholars and fans have had organisations formed, historical markers erected to commemorate fictitious events, and, of course, a never-ending supply of commentary and 'fan fiction'. Hardwick's book is a hybrid, part invention, part commentary.Due to the nature of the material, those who become a Sherlockian or Holmesian love to follow the clues to solve the unknown, the mysteries -- Conan Doyle was not always diligent about filling in the details of Holmes' life; this is where authors like Hardwick come into play. Hardwick proposes answers to many of the questions of Holmes life, such as where he attended university, his American experiences, behind-the-scenes material on many major cases, and Holmes' true activities during his absence from the public eye after his supposed death at the Reichenbach Falls.Hardwick does a good job at incorporating the actual material from the canonical stories (56 short stories and 4 novels), as well as actual historical events of which Holmes could have been a part. His narrative is in keeping with the same style of writing as Conan Doyle for the most part; a bit flat at times, but then, Conan Doyle usually wrote as Watson, rather than Holmes. This is a memoir looking back on early days by an aged Holmes in his retirement, some time after 'His Last Bow', and indeed after the death of Watson.Sherlock Holmes scholars debate the material contained here -- this is presented without annotation as to the divergent strands of Holmesian speculation. As an autobiography, it is plausible if not entirely convincing, and will interest any fan of Holmes."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: My Life and Crimes","review":"This was the most disappointing of the many \\"adventures\\" of Sherlock Holmes I've read. The writer seems to be trying set himself above the original author who created Holmes but Conan Doyle would never have used such sarcasm.

If you need help figuring out sampling and the such, you aren't ready for the book.There are many people who do still use paper surveys and even mail them and given it's in the title, it's a bit surprising reviewers found this absurd.Perhaps more absurd are the complaints relating to how unscientific the work is. Dillman has published a great deal in the scientific literature on how to improve the quality of the data through better visual design. That is not saying he does not understand the importance of sampling. It does indicate the book he is going to write is going to assume you have very basic understanding of survey methodology and you are looking to improve the usability of a survey with the assumption in mind.Dillman's research provides excellent guidelines for creating visual surveys that are likely to improve the accuracy and reliability of the responses.

Dillman's text is far superior to The Survey Kit by Arlene Fink. The only criticism I would offer is that Dillman assumes researchers are designing their own online surveys rather than using commercially available websites such as Survey Monkey. I would contend that the majority of survey research is conducted on commercial websites.

Frontispiece portrait of the author. Among the canon of notorious and well collected 20th century anti-semitic literature. From the jacket flaps: Here is the story that people have said would never be written in our time -- the true history of events leading up to the Second World War, told by one who enjoyed the friendship and confidence of Mr. Neville Chamberlain during the critical months between Munich and September, 1939. There has long been an unofficial ban on books dealing with what Captain Ramsay calls \\"The Nameless War\\", the conflict which has been waged from behind the political scene for centuries, which is still being waged and of which very few are aware. The present work, with much additional evidence and a fuller historical background, is the outcome of the personal experiences of a public figure who in the course of duty has discovered at first-hand the existence of a centuries old conspiracy against Britain, Europe, and the whole of Christendom. \\"The Nameless War\\" reveals an unsuspected link between all the major revolutions in Europe -- from King Charles I's time to the abortive attempt against Spain in 1936 .The author describes the anatomy of the Revolutionary International machine -- the machine which today continues the plan for supranational world power, the age-old Messianic dream of International Jewry. It is the author's belief that the machine would break down without the support of its unwilling Jews and unsuspecting Gentiles and he puts forward suggestions for detaching these elements. (subsequent commentary) \\"There is no limit to the depths of human depravity, Captain Maule Ramsay . . . seems to have made a very determined attempt to plumb those depths.\\" The Jewish Chronicle; \\"The publication of such a book, at this time, underlines the urgent need for the law to be reformed so as to make it a crime to preach racial hatred or publish libels on groups in the community.\\" The Daily Worker. History: From the late 1930s Cpt Ramsay developed increasingly strident anti-semitic views. In 1940 his involvement with a suspected spy at the United States embassy led to his internment under British Defence Regulation 18B, the only British MP to suffer this fate. On January 13, 1938 he had given a speech to the Arbroath Business Club in which he observed that Hitler's antipathy to Jews arose from his knowledge \\"that the real power behind the Third International is a group of revolutionary Jews\\". At the same time, Ramsay was also becoming more sympathetic to Germany: in September he wrote to The Times to defend the right of the Sudetenland to self-determination. In December 1938 The Fascist (journal of the Imperial Fascist League) declared that Ramsay had \\"become Jew-wise\\" (a term which indicated someone who had come to believe in a Jewish conspiracy). On April 27 he spoke to a branch of the (anti-semitic) Nordic League in Kilburn, attacking Neville Chamberlain for introducing conscription \\"at the instigation of the Jews\\" and claiming that the Conservative Party \\"relies on ... Jew money\\"."},{"Title":"Sleeping Murder & The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"This book contains the first and the last of the Miss Marple Mysteries.

I was expecting her to die in her last mystery just the way that Agatha Christie kills of Hercule Poirot at the end of his last mystery. It didn't quite feel the same, I almost expect more Miss Marple Mysteries. It did come full circle with Miss Marple emphasizing fact and not what people say in both. There is also a difference between the first and the last in that Miss Marple is much more of an outsider in the first one (its as if she is experimenting with her craft) and takes \\"center stage\\" in the last (the work of the expert).

Historians are of the opinion that her work neither revealed anything new of the prevailing social decadence nor gave viable solutions to them. The social movements and women liberation advocates existed at the time even before this book was written, got their much needed impetus with the release of her work. Though the mainstream orthodox Hindu groups were on the constant collision course with these movements with jarring opposition, the members of the national congress could not keep their eyes closed on the women issues in the wake of Mayo's book and gave wholehearted support for questioning the intransigence on religious orthodoxy and the indifference of the colonial government on the issues concerning women. On the political front, Mayo's work could neither dampen the enthusiasm of freedom \`fighters' nor could bring the west, who condemned her work as negative American journalism, to consensus with her.It is interesting to note that though Mayo were able to put forward a number of theories both economical and social for the existing moral turpitude in Indian social life, she did not suggest any solutions for it and one would suspect that such solutions if suggested could have been carried out only in the form of reforms on the existing British policies rather than as reforms in the minds and hearts of Indian people, undermining the very objective for which Mayo created her work in the first place.Mrinalini Sinha, who wrote an excellent introduction to \`Mother India' in a different publication, has given many evidences for Mayo's secret collaboration with the British in misrepresenting India. It was widely believed that the targeted audience of Mayo's work was United States who had been pushing British for granting more political freedom for Indians. One can easily notice in her book that her smear campaign was targeted towards Hindu religion, the religion of most of the nationalistic leaders of the time who were demanding home rule. In her opinion the Hindu nationalism was causing \`problems' for the British by their campaign of non-cooperation, civil disobedience and instillation of rural masses when British were doing everything to improve the conditions in India like incorporation of Indians in the administrating positions, improving the economical infrastructure, revival of village industries etc. She was insinuating that Hindus should first address the appalling social conditions in India and then learn, with the help of the British, how to administer a country before clamoring for independence that she thought Indians were still unqualified for. The British on the other hand were delighted to have such a work published around the time when situations were so tensed all around the country following the Rowlatt act, problems in Punjab and most importantly Jalianwala Bagh massacre.Mayo's revulsion towards Hindu religion and its \`superstitions' can be seen all over her work where as she conveniently ignored many of the disgusted customs of Islam, may be fearing a fatwa declared on her by the Muslim community lest she repudiated their customs and traditions. Her rather soft approach towards Islam was due to the fact that most of the Muslim population supported the British rule and alienating them from the British interests in India would be the last thing in her agenda. Being a minority, Muslims always believed that their interests would be better protected under a British rule than under a self-rule with Hindu majority at its helm. In spite of all the venom the book emits, there are some interesting and worth pondering narrations of many Hindu customs in it and how Brahman upper class was able to keep the lower caste people in submission. Chapters \`Brahman' and \`Sacred cow' deserve special accolade.In the chapter, \`Psychological glimpses through the economic lens', she was giving rather clever explanations for why British rule in India is a boon not a bane for both Indians and the rest of the world. The Indian nationalist leaders' claim that the British was plundering India and fleecing its wealth for the benefit of people of Briton is also questioned in the chapter. She draws sloppy comparison between India and USA, some of the countries to which Britain sold clothes. Her argument was that both America and India exported cotton to Britain and if America had no problem buying clothes from UK in return why India should then had problems doing the same? Her rather superficial comparison reveals how badly was she aware of the realities to which Indian cotton industry was submitted to by the British. Then, she has her own arguments for the India's high military expenditure and high remunerations of Indian civil servants (all of them were British). She seemed to have totally unaware of the fact that her very arguments for British's expensive administration were the reasons why nationalists including Gandhi were asking British to leave; a pompous alien power needs more money to run India than what would Indians need to run their own country - the economic disparity between India and Britain had always caused hardship for India.Many controversial topics in her book are related to the moral ascendance of Hindu; practices on marriage and sex such as child marriages, pre-pubertal sexual relations, young pregnancy, Devadasi system, Suttee practices, widow issues etc. Her gross exaggerations of numbers are challenged by many historians, one example being the percentage of Indians inflicted by venereal diseases is only 10% not 90% unlike Mayo reported. On the subject of child marriage, she interpreted totally out of context the comments made by Tagore and Gandhi. At the end, Gandhi's response to Mayo, \`A Drain inspector's report' (published in Young India journal) truly encompasses the spirit with which Gandhi exhorted Indian populace to remain calm but respond positively to Mayo's challenges.However, the truth of the matter is that many of the social blots of the Indian society that Mayo reported in her book were true in a sense that it existed at many places in India as acknowledged by prominent leaders of the time as Gandhi, Nehru and Bose though more patriotic nationalists deprecated Mayo's report outright. What was not true is her generalization. Her language is so powerful to cause a casual reader to mistake the identity of India. Her British friends warned her that India cannot be generalized with a few samples of cases taken from few villages; nevertheless she embarked on her work with a British agenda of slandering India.Ancient or modern, any civilization in the world always has its share of social and moral issues, including one of the so called most civilized countries as Mayo's own. Most recently, the church scandals came in light in the Unites States of incidents happened decades ago in most of the American churches are good examples of where minors are mistreated by the people associated with God (Mayo draw similar cases with priests in Indian temples). Also, the horrible treatment the whites meted out to their blacks brethren in the United States during the same period was no different from the upper caste Hindus' treatment towards \`untouchables'.Mayo's plea at the end of her book to the readers of India to consider her \`pain' as the \`faithful wounds of a friend' was not well received in India. Had only such a work as Mayo's even with its direct attack on many controversial fronts is produced by a scholar who have spent years in India with a genuine concern for the social problems of India could the same be considered as the \`faithful wounds of a friend'. Mayo who just spent three months during 1925-26 to produce such a work and claiming herself to be a benefactor of India and her women community does not deserve the friendship of India as aptly commented by Haribilas Sarda (the architect of the Sarda Act also known as Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929). Ironically, it is Mayo to whom the supporters of the act should thank for the passage of the act would not have been smoother probably without her work.The British who welcomed an average American journalist's inferior work with both hands banned the publication of an excellent impartial book \`India in Bondage - Her right to Freedom and a Place Among the Great Nations' two years later, written by an other American, Jabez T. Sunderland, who was an authoritative on the subject and was a former president of the India information Bureau of America, twice Special Commissioner and lecturer to India and the author of a number of books on India, on the apprehension that they will loose their ground in the west as well as in the east in holding India still in subjugation.Comments of some of the western personalities on the Mayo's book are worth quoting here (from \`India in Bondage' by Sunderland, P.510).Professor Franklin Edgerton of Yale University wrote: \\"I hope you and others in India will believe that there are some of us in America who know how to appraise justly Miss Mayo's scurrilous book. We are deeply ashamed to acknowledge her as our fellow countrywoman, and we neglect no chance to deny the truth of the picture of India which she draws.\\"Mrs. Annie Besant writes with indignation of \`Mother India': \\"Miss Mayo has published a wicked book, slandering the whole of the Indian people...I have spent in India the greater part of my time since 1893, living as an Indian, welcomed in their homes as though I were one of their own people, and I have never come across the horrors she describes...The writer seems to have merely sought for filth. Does she imagine that if her presentation were an accurate picture of Hindu civilization that Hinduism could have produced a civilization in India dating from thousands of years before the Christian era? It would have been smothered in its own putrefaction.\\"This book is good read to understand the social problems existed in colonial India, sadly, some of them still exist in many parts of India and one who genuinely concerned about India cannot disregard these social issues that are challenging India in the 21st century. Though Mayo's work by no means an academic classic, the book has enough stuff to catch the attention of readers and make them ponder over it. But readers are warned not to get prejudiced over India by her work but are encouraged to read many great impartial books written about India and its great culture, social issues, and many other aspects of its social life.Before I end my commentary let me quote a statement Mayo made in her book to compare it with a more \`civilized' act of the same nature. Mayo \`found out' that Indian parents fed opium to their whining kids. While that may be true of uncivilized colonial India, the board certified doctors from Mayo's own country, United States of America , the \`most civilized' country on the planet, are prescribing Tylenol, a medicine that provides almost the same effect as opium does to young children, in the place of opium."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"This is a great take on the original \\"Mother India\\" written in the 1920s by Katherine Mayo. Sinha notes that Mayo's book, in spite of being one of the most viciously racist and imperialistic (and badly written) books ever, served as a guide for US policy makers until the 1980s! Going by Sinha's analysis, it's pretty clear that Mayo was more demagogue than scholar, and very interesting that lots of people cared about her views. That alone makes it worth examining what Mayo said. Sinha takes a good look at (a) Mayo's career and political leanings, (b) new research about her sources of \\"information\\" about India, (c) possible sources of funding for her book, and (d) what Indians at the time had to say about it. Through all this, Sinha does a great job of contextualizing Mayo's book, and provokes readers to think about the powerful seduction that oversimplified (dis)information and propaganda hold for the uncritical mind. In the first part of the book, Sinha presents background and analysis. The rest of the book consists of excerpts from Mayo's original text."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"The positive impact that this controversial book created in the Indian nationalism and feminism during the early part of the 20th century cannot be belittled even when the motives behind such a polemic work on the social and political life of colonial India can undoubtedly be questioned.Historians would not disagree to the fact that Mayo's book came as a bolt from the blue to the leaders of the Indian national congress and social reformers at a time when the whole country was engaged in a political struggle with the colonial government. Historians are of the opinion that her work neither revealed anything new of the then prevailing social decadence nor gave any viable solutions to them. Instead, the social movements and the women liberation advocates that existed long before this book was written got their much needed impetus with the release of this book. Though the mainstream orthodox Hindu groups were on the constant collision course with these movements with jarring opposition, the members of the national congress could not keep their eyes closed in the wake of Mayo's book and gave wholehearted support for questioning the intransigence on the religious orthodoxy and the indifference of the colonial government on the issues concerning women. On the political front, Mayo's work could neither dampen the enthusiasm of freedom fighters nor could bring the west, which condemned her work as negative American journalism, to consensus with her.It is interesting to note that though Mayo was able to put forward a number of theories, including economical and social, for the moral turpitude that existed in the Indian social life, she could not suggest any solutions for it, and so one could easily suspect that any solutions if suggested could only had been carried out in the form of reforms on the existing British policies rather than as reforms in the minds and hearts of Indian people, and thus undermining the very objective for which Mayo created her work in the first place.Mrinalini Sinha, who wrote an excellent academic introduction to \`Mother India' in a different publication,Mother India: Selections from the Controversial 1927 Text, Edited and with an Introduction by Mrinalini Sinhahas given many evidences for Mayo's secret collaboration with the British in misrepresenting India.

Mrinalini Sinha's introduction is written from research standpoint where she tracing back in history and explaining the backdrop of Mayo's work. She also studies both the positive and negative impact the book had on colonial India. This book gives lot of additional information and references to one who is looking for a detailed study of the social issues of colonial India, customs and practices of Hindus, sources and reliability of the data that Mayo used in her book. Also, additional comments have been given at the bottom of pages for Mayo's claims, wherever possible.In tracing back Mayo's career, however, one cannot see her anti-third world sentiments. She had been an average journalist and her life before or after the publication of \`Mother India' does not show her antipathy or affinity towards third world countries. This leads one to believe that her agenda was enforced by external sources, namely political.One would not wonder if this book has been used by the United States government as an introductory book on India until 70s especially when considering America's intolerance and knowledge on the east!Sinha's introduction and comments are invaluable source of information for scholars, historians and even politicians alike. This book does not contain the full text of Mayo's \`Mother India' (don't know why the book is published this way, may be with a business mind), for which one has to read one of the available editions of Mayo's original publication."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"Katherine Mayo originally published her book, _Mother India_, in 1927, when not only was there still a &quot;British India&quot;, but there were still people who thought it was a good thing. This review is based on that original work. I do not know how this new paperback edition has been edited, but since &quot;Mrinalini Sinha (Editor)&quot; has been added to the authorship, I assume there are some differences. In the original work, Mayo, no fan of Mr. Gandhi, outlined in well-documented detail the problems of India at that time (child marriages, health problems caused by lack of hygiene, caste rigidities, the economy, etc.) and presented solutions from a western point of view. She was also no fan of Hinduism, but there is no attack in the book on the religion per se, only on the negative effects that she felt flowed from it. She is a good writer and the book is very easy to read. The political parts were not as interesting to me as the parts about the social problems. Hopefully the editor deleted some of the more tedious passages of old politics. For the most part, I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"The Desert Was Home: Adventures and Tribulations of a Desert Homesteader","review":"This is a book I was specifically looking for.

His narrative is at once informative, thought-provoking and attention-grabbing. It reads much like a work of fiction, compelling one to want to find out how it ends. Many of the facts he shares were never introduced in the public school system. In fact, it was a revelation to me that, not only were many members of the British Parliment in favor of American independence, but the British people benefitted from our struggle, as well. Another interesting angle was the illumination of Washington's military genious. I have recommended this book to my British son-in-law, in hopes he will no longer think of the colonists as self-serving brigands, whose rebellion had much more behind it than a mere desire to avoid taxes."},{"Title":"The War of Independence (Riverside Library for Young People)","review":"This is a must read if you want to understand the American Revolution. The author does a fantastic job of explaining why the revolution happened. I had no clue that two generations earlier, the American colonists in MA were more free. With that knowledge, the revolution makes much more sense. Also, the idea that the revolution was not Americans vs. Brits, but a war of ideas I had never heard.The author clearly states why Washington was so needed.

I started teaching from it earlier this year and have grown to appreciate it very much. I am especially pleased the more I compare this to other books. Most math books these days are little more than pretty colors, crazy fonts, neat pictures, lots of distractions, and very little actual math instruction. This book, on the other hand, actually focuses on the math, explains it reasonably well, and has great sets of real example problems and practice problems of all difficulty levels, including lots of practical problems that aren't forced or contrived. It is not perfect, but it is the best I have seen.Pros:*Lots of math rather than lots of silly distractions*Appropriate difficulty level - not \\"dumbed down\\"*Good examples worked out and explained*Good problem sets for homework and practiceCons:*Some explanations are just a bit short, although most are good*Factoring, the hardest topic, is early in the book, which makes it difficult for some students"},{"Title":"Algebra;: Structure and method, book 1","review":"This is one of only a handful of books that actually covers Algebra 1 in detail, and in an order that builds a strong foundation along the way.

Well-prepared students will find this book a great resource, and should find themselves extremely well-prepared for future classes in mathematics.It is arguably one of the best algebra books available, and is one of the top algebra textbooks as rated by Mathematically Correct, a group that is concerned with the quality of mathematics instruction in California (and beyond)."},{"Title":"Algebra;: Structure and method, book 1","review":"This is a pretty good comprehensive textbook for students of all levels. There are twelve chapters in the book, plus a glossary, various helpful appendices, and an index.

Also, enrichment topics are included, including \\"Extra,\\" \\"Challenge,\\" \\"Historical Note,\\" \\"Application,\\" and \\"Career.\\"Like any other book, this book does, however, isn't absolutely perfect. One thing about this book is that the explanations in this book at the top of every section summarizes important concepts and gives some examples and definitions; however, the examples often only cover the \\"A\\" and half of the \\"B\\" problem sets, and the \\"C\\" problems are often unexplained. Also, the textbook seems to be designed for slightly more advanced students, as the problems and pace of the text isn't for beginning or struggling students.One note is that this book isn't the best tool to teach yourself math, although it is an excellent source for problem sets, and also serves as an excellent reference for algebraic concepts. I would recommend \\"CliffsStudy Solver Algebra I\\" if you are having trouble with Algebra I or if you want to teach yourself math, because this textbook is not designed to be a tutorial. I have tried to teach myself many new math concepts, but this book didn't always help - though I did some new problem solving strategies from here. Sometimes the explanations were simply skimmed over too quickly.Overall, this is a great book. It's really helped me with my math grade, but this is just one of my math books which helped me. With teacher guidance, one or two more study guides, and most importantly, a dedicated self-motivated mind, you are bound to be a success in algebra."},{"Title":"Algebra;: Structure and method, book 1","review":"I think overall, the book, Algebra Structure and method is wonderful.

Supplementary material is necessary because most algebra 1 courses these days are \\"dumbed down.\\" The District of Columbia Public Schools, for example, uses a book (ISBN 0618250182) that has been stripped of traditional problems that show students the power of algebra -- \\"work problems,\\" \\"mixture problems,\\" \\"age problems\\" and so on. And it has been stripped of difficult problems in all of the topics that remain. The book under review here covers the traditional topics and has difficult problems in all topics. The book would be good for a differentiated course, because the problems in each section are grouped into three levels of difficulty, labeled A, B and C.-- Jeff Schmidt, Washington, D.C.

I used Algebra Structure and Method Book 1 as a student in 1991 and 1992 in my high school Algebra 1 class. This was a very good textbook and I had previously hated mathematics. My school also used the second book in this series as well as the Geometry book that goes with it. I learned math and did well at it.

Only when you do a few problems do you realize, oh, [point that could have been made much more clearly], is what they were saying! Truly, a horrible book, one that has inspired me to volunteer for my school district's textbook selection committee.

Especially important is the numerous exercises graded in difficulty that help the student master the material.

So far he has been learning from it without any problems, and with little input from me. While he's accelerated to start with and good at picking things up, I think this shows that the book is well constructed and laid out.As for me, I find the book exceptionally clear in its layout and introduction of new material. The problems are well-constructed and everything is nicely formatted to clearly convey the information. Instead of huge glossy pictures on every page, consistent text formatting using fonts and colors is used (there are a few pictures in sidebars, but mostly tied to challenge or enrichment sections). Exceptionally clear sample problems are given for new material, and the book shows how to work them.My only complaint about this book, which is not severe, is that it definitely takes an approach of direct instruction for new concepts, instead of letting a student noodle through a new concept on his own. (Run a web search on \\"Art of Problem Solving\\" for an example of a curriculum that encourages deep thought and mastery by challenging students to discover mathematical principles even before a new concept is fully explained.) However, nothing prevents one from adding in extra material and using this book as a curriculum \\"spine\\".For its exceptional clarity and good problem sets, I can't rate this book more highly. With the addition of some extra challenge work, it makes for a quite good introduction to algebra."},{"Title":"Algebra;: Structure and method, book 1","review":"I have always been a great student in math.

What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that &quot;separation of powers&quot; did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"Title":"Congressional government; a study in American politics","review":"This book is a classic. As a young academic with a keen interest in national politics, but without any experience, Wilson critiques the American governmental structure on a number of points, examines all of the branches (except judicial), the inner workings and character of each branch, and their inter-workings. Wilson is mostly critical of the system's deficiencies and has few words of praise for Constitutional government. Instead, his ideal model is the British system, with which he is constantly comparing the American. He also touches on the model of French government to provide a broader basis of comparison. The world's other great model Republic, Switzerland, is given passing mention. A broader discussion of the diversity of foreign models, including more discussion of the brilliant Swiss federal system, but also including the German system, would have added much to this book.Wilson's principal complaints with the shortcomings of American government can be summed up with one word: disjoint. He states that there is no structure in the Congress that can be described as \\"leadership\\" in British sense, meaning that even the nominal \\"leaders\\" of the parties cannot claim to speak for the rank-and-file members, who may act on their own initiative, through committees, in the process of drafting legislation (instead of having legislation crafted by a central administration and having members vote or reject it). The result is that there is no cohesive policy, as the various committees draft legislation within their own domains that in the end can be contradictory or mutually abrasive.Wilson also states that there is disjoint between the executive and Congress, largely due to the executive being independent from the legislature. This is almost unique to the American system; in most systems, the functions of administering law are subordinate to those of making law. The independent executive leads to a disconnection between the making of law and the making of policy, which makes forming a cohesive policy quite difficult.Wilson offers more such examples of disjoint in the American government, including the disconnect between those who decide how to tax and those who decide how to spend, but the logic is similar. If one extends the line of Wilson's thinking, the implication is simple: the concept of checks and balances in our Constitution has been a failure. This conclusion harkens back to the spirit of Centinel, who in 1789 condemned checks and balances as snake oil, contending that human intellect is not equal to the task of checking the various interests through an elaborate counterbalancing system. A more effective alternative would be a simple and transparent system (the American system is not transparent but quite obfuscated) in which any attentive observer could determine the chain of events that produces results, and act directly to indicate his approval or dissent of that result. In contrast, Wilson states that in the American system, \\"the voter has no way of knowing how his ballot can any effect on the government or policy, even an infinitesimal one.\\" Wilson's thesis is similar to Centinel's sentiment in his famous letters.Noticeably absent from Wilson's dissertation is any mention of the judiciary (typically presented at the most basic educational level as one of three coequal branches), which in the United States, takes a role in crafting policy through the concepts of judicial review and the setting of precedents that are similar to legislation in effect. One may conclude that this absence is because the judicial branch has only become so prominent in the 20th century, but such a conclusion would be misinformed; the Supreme Court has been crucial to policy in America, since John Marshall. The absence of the judicial branch in this analysis is a minor deficiency, but an intelligent reader should be able to extend Wilson's logic of disjoint to the judicial branch. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to see his thoughts on the matter.In all, this book is quite informative, insightful, and worth reading. On a lighter level, it is interesting to see how some of Wilson's observations on government hold just as true 125 years later, and to see how some that he states as essential have come to change."},{"Title":"Congressional government; a study in American politics","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."},{"Title":"Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic","review":"Right now there is a dearth of good Aramaic grammars on the market. Excepting Syriac, which can claim Wheeler M. Thackston's \\"Introduction to Syriac\\" the Jewish, Old, and Imperial dialects of Aramaic are accessed through grammars which, though in most cases posessing some merit, universally lack many of the qualities of a good grammar or textbook. This little grammar is no exception.Though the compact size is convenient, the text of this grammar is downright ugly, with vocalizations written in by hand and the English text written on an ancient typewriter. The whole of the text is horribly compact, making it easy to overlook sections when searching for answers. The situation would be intolerable were it not for the fact that the book is organized by numbered paragraph markers. Explanations are painfully brief and assume a good bit of knowledge of Semitic languages (if not knowledge of another dialect of Aramaic) and philological training.I would have considered this grammar a total loss except that the little bugger does actually have a huge amount of information in it. Being trained as I am at the business of learning dead Semitic languages, I am able to get around with the book and I have rarely been disappointed in my search for an answer to any particular question. The book is careful to show distinctions between Targumic Aramaic and Midrashic Aramaic, both subdialects that come under the umbrella of Palestinian Aramaic. It also frequently references Biblical Aramaic.Finally, I should note that this book is strictly a reference grammar. It is organized by grammatical structure, and pays no mind to organization in lessons that introduce a student to the language through gradual introduction of concepts based on frequency or ease of learning. There are of course no excercises or glossaries.Not for the novice, but an Aramaist or Hebraist who wants to dig into the Targums could profit much from this work."},{"Title":"Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic","review":"To set the record straight: One comment states that \\"the text of this grammar is downright ugly, with vocalizations written in by hand and the English text written on an ancient typewriter.\\" My copy (the edition pictured here) is professionally typeset."},{"Title":"Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic","review":"This is a beautiful book to learn aramaic from Targum.

This is a college textbook, and it is very thorough. Each unit divided into (1) basic sentences in Estonian (with English translations), (2) notes on grammar, (3) exercises with answers, and (4) conversations. The back of the textbook has an excellent glossary (dictionary). In the preface, the author says &quot;[T]he availability of a native speaker of Estonian for covering the material....would be especially important at the initial stage of study, for going over the pronunciation exercises and the first units.&quot; For self-study, this book is rough going. There are no maps of Estonia, no photos, and no charts or tables; the book consists of only typewritten pages. There are also no accompanying cassettes for practice. The glossary in the back of the book lists the Estonian words with the English translation. A suggested improvement: have a second section where the English words are listed with Estonian translations (a &quot;reverse-glossary&quot;). This text is an excellent resource for the serious student of the Estonian language. It is an excellent textbook for a language course with an instructor, but, in my opinion, less useful for the self-learner (like myself)."},{"Title":"Basic Course in Estonian","review":"For some reason, the Indiana University has published two different courses in Estonian.

The book is a deconstruction of \\"thirdworldism\\", a marxism-inspired ideology prevalent in underdeveloped countries that asserts that all the ills of the third world are a result of exploitation by the rich capitalist countries.Rangel shows the fallacy of thidworldism and the huge network of lies woven around it: Thirdworldism is an expedient device for crooked and ineffective politicians to avoid responsibility for their own actions, as well as a propaganda strategy for marxists everywhere (in fact, the main theses of thirdworldism were formulated in the Second Congress of the Communist International in Moscow). At the end, the ones not benefited by thirdworldism are the inhabitants of the third world themselves.It may be thought that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this book is not as relevant today as it was during the cold war. However, as recent events show in places such as Rangel's native Venezuela, marxism and thirdworldism are alive and well, and pushing for a comeback with their load of hatred of free markets, backwardness, and depauperating policies.Rangel was a brilliant intellectual of uncomprimising honesty and bravery - a rare species in the Latin American intellectual landscape. If you like his work, or if you are interested in an honest explanation of why Latin America remains underdevelped while the US has become the most powerful country in the world, you should also read Rangel's masterpiece \\"Del Buen Salvaje al Buen Revolucionario\\" (translated into english as \\"The Latin Americans: Their love-hate relationship with the United States\\")"},{"Title":"Third World Ideology and Western Reality: Manufacturing Political Myth","review":"Amazon reviews has confused the author of this book 'Third World Ideologies and Western Realities', Carlos Rangel with his son, Carlos J.

Here is a correct bio for this Carlos Rangel, partly as it appears in his other main written work, 'The Latin Americans: Their Love Hate Relationship with the United States':Carlos Rangel {1929-1988} was a native Venezuelan. He was born in Caracas and educated in the United States at Bard College, and New York University, and in France at the Sorbonne University in Paris. For a brief time, he was university lecturer in the United States and at the Central University in Venezuela. He joined the Venezuelan Foreign Service in 1958, was managing director of the Magazine Momento, in the 60's, and later the magazine 'Aut&eacute;ntico'. He was briefly active in politics and became a member of the Caracas Municipal Council for a time, but realized at some point that he preferred the independent stand of a journalist.

By the end of the book, the reader will not only have a general understanding of anthropological theories, but also of how these theories evolved throughout history and how they are interconnected with each other. Layton also extensively uses ethnographic studies and graphs to explain each theory and place it in the social context from which it evolved. He also makes reference to various important figures throughout the book, such as Radcliffe-Brown, &Eacute;mile Durkheim and Karl Marx, among others, and how these figures influenced the development of anthropological theory.In conclusion, this is a great summary of the various social theories used in Anthropology, and I would advice it to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Pattern Languages of Program Design 4 (Software Patterns Series)","review":"Some of the chapters are uninspired formalizations of basic object-oriented concepts, like &quot;Abstract Class&quot; - however, there are a few gems in this book like &quot;Essence&quot; and &quot;Role Object&quot; . . . definitely not as rewarding as the Gang of Four book, however.

His autobiography is as understated and plainspoken, as the Roger Kahn biography is elaborate and flowery. This is particularly the case where Dempsey describes his fights; he has hardly anything to say about ring strategy, or his opponents style. He just states the events leading up to the fight, then gives an account of how the fight went (I don't think he ever spent more than 3 paragraphs on that part). By comparison, I think that Kahn spent at least 30 pages, or so, on just the Willard fight. That's by no means to say that Dempsey's book isn't entertaining, or worth reading -just a remark on the book's style.I don't think anyone would disagree, factually, with what's written in this book, but, of course, it's difficult to know how judicious he was about what he put in. As regards what he did choose to write, he doesn't whine or make excuses for any of the disasters that happened in, or out of the ring ,and there's only one person who I can recall him having anything bad to say about. To read the book, Dempsey comes off as tough, more or less affable roughneck, but also one who's willing to have a laugh at himself.

He reminds me of our own William Faulkner who surely must have read Hardy because he patterned his style in the same manner (Yoknapatawpha County versus Hardy's Wessex, etc.). The blue-eyed girl, Elfride, reminds me of the main character in a book I'm reading now: Clyde Griffiths in Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, also a book describing the conflicts of class and love and, since it's set in the US, lust for money. A long suit of Hardy's is his wonderful quotes from the peasants (&quot;I have no use for a flower that neglect won't kill,&quot; and &quot;dead, but wouldn't drop down.&quot; The other thing I like is his many references which enrich the story and educate the reader. Therefore I look for editions that have explanatory notes. Then too I like to have a pile of reference books on hand to get his fuller meaning: the Bible, Shakespeare, books on English literature, etc. And last, like all Hardy novels, A Pair of Blue Eyes has plenty of sex (if you can read between the lines). Hardy recognized that strongest of all drives beside the basic ones of survival, and despite what he called the Grundyism of the period, he conveyed that truth in his books. Read this book and any other by Hardy. A lifetime of pleasure awaits you. But of course that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"This is Hardy's third novel (1873), and is set in the southwest area of England (Cornwall), where he met his first wife. It is the story of young, impetuous Elfride, and her romance with two men: the young architect Stephen Smith and the urbane, educated lawyer, Henry Knight. As common with his other novels, it reflects elements of tragedy, irony, and class advancement. Elfride and Knight are low middle-class persons trying to advance in society and in love. Though not as intricate and challenging as his later novels, it is an entertaining and illuminating read nonetheless."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"Thomas Hardy's first two published novels, Desperate Remedies and Under the Greenwood Tree, were flawed but interesting works with significant promise, but A Pair of Blue Eyes was a quantum leap. It would be hard to find a greater improvement from one book to the next. Where the first two suggested that Hardy might someday be a notable writer, it proved him a great one. It has some similarities with the first two but essentially points at the great novels to come. The latter are so excellent that Hardy is still best known for them. This is deserved but a true shame for A Pair of Blue Eyes, which has been overshadowed to the extent that it is now Hardy's most underrated novel and his most undeservedly underread. As Hardy's reputation remains high, this will hopefully soon be corrected, as it deserves to take its long-awaited place near his best work.The novel has much in common with most of Hardy's fiction before and after, not least very strong sense of place. Perhaps no other novelist equals him here. He not only has interesting, detailed, and often beautifully lyrical descriptions of his settings but also makes them an integral part of the story as few writers can. His settings are never mere backdrop. Wessex - the part-real, part-dream area based on his native Southwest England that he made world famous - was not formally launched until his next novel, but he is well on his way toward it here. This is a proto-Wessex novel with many of the elements so loved and acclaimed in more famous works. The setting is closely based on his wife's native Cornwall, notable as the farthest west Hardy ever set a novel. It is easy to see from the loving, luscious descriptions that the area had a near-sacred significance for him. These elements were present in the first two novels but are significantly more developed here.Another Hardy characteristic is present - a strong heroine. His first two books had this, but he goes much further here, making the heroine the protagonist. The first two words give her unforgettable name - Elfride Swancourt -, and the focus rarely leaves her. From a later feminist perspective, she was one of the more interesting female characters to appear up to that point (1873). It is quickly clear that Hardy had a far higher view of women than most people of his time, especially men. Elfride is intelligent, educated, and generally capable - no stock Victorian angel in the house. She quickly wins our sympathy; we truly feel for and easily identify with her. That said, Hardy had no intention of painting a perfect character; she is also vain, prone to melodrama and trifling, and has a dependent streak. Above all, though, she is interesting. It has long been assumed that she is largely based on Hardy's wife, and biographers have shown how this is true to a certain extent, but those who thought her a near-exact likeness overestimated. The important thing in any case is not to look for parallels with Hardy's life but to take her on her own considerable terms.Several other characters are also interesting. This is a strong improvement over the first two novels, which had little character development. Elfride's father is little more than a stock overbearing father/pretentious preacher, but the two main male characters are of great interest: Stephen Smith the architect and Henry Knight the scholar. Many have long assumed the former is a self-portrait, but Hardy claimed the latter was more like him. The truth is that there are elements of him in both but that neither is anywhere near an exact portrait. They are in any event interesting and sympathetic in different ways. Both have clear faults, not least a certain selfishness, but we feel for both, making their love triangle all the more dramatic and emotional.Perhaps the biggest improvement and clearest sign of what was to come is how Hardy handles the plot. Leading Victorian critic George Meredith read his first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, and suggested he write a book with more plot. Hardy eventually destroyed this tentative work and put some of it into Desperate Remedies, which has a sensational plot typical of the era's popular novels. It is entertaining and suspenseful but sometimes too melodramatic for its own good. Under the Greenwood Tree drops this but occasionally veers too far in the other direction, arguably becoming overly simple and not interesting enough. A Pair of Blue Eyes also has a very simple plot - essentially nothing more than a standard love triangle -, but the handling is masterful. Hardy weaves several threads together with foreshadowing and suspense to create an extremely moving and utterly engrossing story. The construction is so tight that it is nothing short of brilliant; one could almost use this as a blueprint for how to write a great novel.Yet this is no dry realist work. Hardy indeed considered it one of his \\"Romances and Fantasies,\\" and there is an air of fantasy hanging over much of the tale. The story is put forth so that it has an almost mythic quality, and Elfride has some characteristics common to these genres' heroines. However, giving the book such a cut and dried label does it a major injustice. Interestingly, it perhaps relies less on melodramatic coincidence than any Hardy novel; some who dislike his fiction do so in large part because of this and thus may prefer A Pair of Blue Eyes over more famous work. However, in striking contrast to the first two books but very much like later masterworks, the grand sweep of the story collapses in a way that leaves an overarching view of the tragedy that is humanity. Hardy had a very dark view of life that comes across very clearly here - though, unlike some later works, it is not really clear until the last few pages. His artistry is tightly controlled and immaculately executed, putting his bleak vision forth in full force. Also drastically different from the first two novels but in common with the later is Hardy's early dramatization of what he later termed the Imminent Will - an unconscious force governing human action. It is not merely that he believes the human condition is drastically dark; it is also beyond our control. We are less than insignificant on the cosmic scale, and there is no real, much less a rational, purpose to existence; at least as significantly, there is no benevolent force behind it all to help or even listen. This gives a good indication of the novel's weightier elements, but Hardy was always careful to make such things serve the story. His greatest fiction is philosophical in the broad sense but never preachy or didactic and rarely heavy-handed. This is the first time he attempted such an ambitious undertaking, and he succeeds brilliantly.Other classic Hardy themes abound: the role of women, the nature of love, the dark side of human nature, etc. We must never forget that he wrote fiction in the Victorian era; his views were so far ahead of their time that the divergence eventually became so great that he stopped writing novels. He always struggled with censorship, and A Pair of Blue Eyes is no exception. In contrast to many of the other novels, he did not have to significantly alter original intentions after an editor's objections but, having learned from bitter early experience, took care to guard some of his more unpopular views. The novel thus makes significant use of imagery to get some of its points forth, not least sexuality; there is much treasure for Freudians. Hardy's characteristic religious criticism is also there for the discerning. It should be clear enough in the overall themes and ending for most thinking people, but there are also more direct hints - not least Elfride's dislikable preacher father.There are many other reasons to read this book, especially for fans. I would not recommend starting with it, as Hardy was still developing what became his characteristic prose style. Many signs of it are here, including a highly atypical vocabulary, but the prose is still awkward in some places. Hardy soon ironed out these minor flaws, but the enthusiastic lack of polish has its own charm. Fans and critics familiar with his best work will enjoy seeing it at a stage well beyond embryo but less than full fruition. Those conversant with Hardy's life and thought will find much else to appreciate and enjoy. First and foremost, the novel is autobiographical to a large extent, based partly on Hardy's then-ongoing courtship with what became his wife. The degree of this has often been exaggerated, but there is more than enough crossover to interest the dedicated; indeed, the topic is still popular with Hardy scholars. Of particular significance are the many architectural references. Hardy left school at sixteen to become an architect, practicing for over a decade, and this book gives great evidence of his knowledge. As in much of his other work, many architectural terms are thrown about, and A Pair of Blue Eyes stands out for focusing specifically on neo-gothic church restoration. This parallels most of Hardy's own architectural work, and he met his wife in a manner very similar to how Stephen meets Elfride. All this and much more will fascinate fans and scholars and likely lead relative newcomers to discover more about Hardy's work and life.One cannot review A Pair of Blue Eyes without mentioning its most famous scene - Knight and Elfride's literal cliffhanger. It got the book much attention and continues to be its focal point and was also highly influential. Novels were then serialized in periodicals before being published in book form, and writers taxed their ingenuity to keep readers interested enough to continue reading. Hardy's drastic and novel solution spawned many imitations continuing to this day, and the word \\"cliffhanger\\" itself apparently derives from reference to it. Separating it from the many imitations is how arises naturally from the story. The cliff is a natural feature of the scenery - indeed based on a real one -, there is significant foreshadowing, and the event is precipitated plausibly. Most importantly, it is not just an excuse for cheap thrills - is in fact secondary to Hardy's prime purpose of writing about individual lives' insignificance. The passage describing Knight's thoughts as he hangs is among Hardy's best writing - philosophical yet suspenseful. Less plausible is how Knight is saved, but even here Hardy has an ulterior motive - not least sexual imagery, as who could forget his description of Eflride wearing only her \\"diaphanous exterior robe\\"? The minor controversy over this last hinted at the full-blown attacks he would endure for transgressing his era's strict sexual propriety.Hardy wrote better novels than A Pair of Blue Eyes - ones with more complicated plots, more grandly sweeping execution, etc. It thus does not belong with his three or four best, but that still makes it better than nearly any other writer's masterpiece. It is an absolute must for fans and critics, and while others should not start here, they should not wait long."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"A Pair of Blue Eyes is one of Thomas Hardy's lesser known novels. As with this other works of fiction it is set in the Wessex region of England (essentially the southwestern part of the country) and relates to the efforts of ordinary people to find happiness in love and life. The book centers around three characters. Elfride Swancourt is a young (18) girl who lives with her vicar father in Endelson Vicarage in Lower Wessex. Stephen Smith is a young (21) architect who comes to the vicarage to make some drawings preparatory to his firm doing some architectural work. As we might expect he and Elfride fall in love but their marriage is opposed by the vicar because of Stephen's low social standing--his parents live in the area and his father is a mason. The couple pledge their love for each other and after an abortive elopement attempt Stephen goes off to India to seek his fortune.The widowed, socially ambitious vicar marries a much older (and richer) woman and together they aspire for Elfride to marry into a higher social status. At this point a relative of the new Mrs. Swancourt, Henry Knight, comes to visit. Knight is older (32) and more sophisticated, working as a lawyer and literary reviewer. He is also the mentor of Stephen who has told Efride of his admiration for the older man. Efride soon comes to be attracted to Knight, who is nave in love affairs but comes to return her love. Events lead to the inevitable tragic climax in Hardy's novels when Stephen returns from India hoping to gain the hand of Elfride.In my view Elfride is not a tragic heroine because she brings about her downfall by her own acts. A true tragic hero or heroine suffers because of the acts of others or because of circumstances beyond his or her control. In Jude the Obscure, for example, what happens to Jude is not of his doing and thus what happens to him is truly tragic. But Elfride is unfaithful, deceitful and immature and it is these attributes that lead to her final consequences.One of the joys of reading Hardy is his portrayal of ordinary people in Wessex. For example, when Stephen returns from India his parents have a pig killed and plan a party for him. The professional pig killer comes to the Smith household, as do another couple, William Worm, a jack of all trades who hears a constant buzzing in his head and his new bride. Mrs. Worm and Mrs. Smith get into a discussion over growing flowers, while the men talk about local matters. In particular the pig killer describes some pigs he has killed including one that was deaf (but tasted good!) and one with rheumatism. The book also displays the cultural values of the time and place as well as the physical beauty of the countryside.A Pair of Blue Eyes is an early work of Hardy's and thus lacks the depth of his more developed works--Far from the Maddening Crowd, Jude the Obscure, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, to name but three. Still, it is worth reading if you understand that the ending will be tragic."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"***Possible Spoilers***I admit that this is a slightly lesser novel than many of Hardy's other masterpieces, but the overall quality of the prose is so high that I have to give it a 5-star rating.(Especially when you consider the junky popular fiction that surrounds us). Hardy is a developing novelist in \\"A Pair of Blue Eyes\\" and the Oxford edition has an interesting essay about the autobiographical elements of the text. The story of Elfride, Stephen and Henry is moving and at times quite mesmorizing. Although the story doesn't carry the same level of passionate angst between Eustacia and Wildeve in \\"The Return of the Native\\", this fine novel is obviously an exercise for Hardy to hone those writing skills that later left us some of the greatest novels in the English language. For me, the famous \\"cliffhanger\\" scene lived up to my expectations, although I was surprised that it does not occur near the novel's end. Then I learned that the novel first appeared in serialized form, so Hardy literally left English readers \\"hanging\\", not knowing what was going to happen to Henry who was hanging off a cliff while Elfride looks on. The final 10 or 15 pages made me hold my breath as I waited to see the conclusion of the novel, even though Hardy doesn't make great efforts to hide the outcome from the reader. A great book is one in which we feel compelled to finish as quickly as we can, even though we may already know the outcome of the story. For me, then, this is a great book!Recommended!"},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"Published in 1873, A Pair of Blue Eyes is Thomas Hardy's third novel, and the first to carry his real name. He is believed to have drawn from his own experiences during his courtship of his wife, as he formulated this novel of romance and social restrictions. Less dense and melancholy than his later work, this book is set in Cornwall, and, as always, the setting plays a definitive role in the story. Budding young architect Steven Smith is hired to consult on the renovation of Endelstow Church, where the Reverend Swancourt is pastor. When Steven meets his daughter, Elfride, he is instantly smitten, and within a few days, they decide to marry. But her father objects and sends him back to London, when he learns that Steven is the son of the local mason, too lowly a status for his only daughter. The pair pledges undying love and devotion, as Steven departs for India to make his name and fortune. During his lengthy absence, Elfride meets an older man, Henry Knight, and when she is obliged to rescue him following a fall from a cliff, they become romantically attached, with the blessing of Rev. Swancourt. Better a Mrs. Knight than a Mrs. Smith. What she doesn't know is that Mr. Knight was once Steven's mentor. What Knight doesn't know is that Steven was once Elfride's suitor.By far the most richly developed of the characters is Elfride, who, at 19, is on the verge of womanhood. She is intelligent, educated, and well intentioned, but, in the struggle the ensues between her principles and her emotions, she desperately needs a mother's good counsel. But her mother died when Elfride was a child, and now she makes many mistakes in judgement.Hardy's considerable poetic talents are evident throughout the novel, in his descriptions not only of the landscape and the people, but also of the inner lives of his characters. Nature is viewed as \\"as a person with a curious temper... who does not scatter kindness and cruelties alternately, impartially, and in order, but heartless severities or overwhelmng generosities in lawless caprice.\\" While all of the characters make some bad decisions, in the end, it is circumstances that determine their fates."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"One of the least known of Hardy's novels, it is a good one.

There are also moments of wry humor in the novel, but the stunning end of the story as both men scramble to reunite with Elfride, is Thomas Hardy at his melancholy best. This Oxford edition features an enlightening introduction by a noted Hardy scholar, as well as a exhaustive history of the text. And for this price, you can't go wrong!

I am90 years of age-"},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"Thomas Hardy longed to be a poet and wrote novels reluctantly to make a living by the pen until his poetry found a market. Fortunately for him, he proved a better novelist than a poet and found a wide audience. His literary reputation flagged for a while after World War I, and his ponderous style and occasional purple passages were often pilloried or parodied even during his lifetime. Somerset Maugham's 'Cakes and Ale' is itself a trenchant view of Hardy's literary reputation late in life and the 'industry' that grew up around it. Yet, Hardy is above all that. He seems to get rediscovered anew by each generation -- a sure sign of enduring merit. Hardy is unlikely to be anyone's favorite author. His vision is dark, and he makes few concessions to those unwilling to think. But he is a much better writer than commonly acknowledged, and a much deeper writer than Maugham.Bill R. Moore and John Martin previously analyzed this novel correctly, and I will merely second their well expressed views. Let me merely append a note on the novel's structure. The core of this book is a love triangle between Steven Smith (an assistant architect like Hardy himself) and Henry Knight (the literary man Hardy hoped to be), who vie for the love of the heroine Elfride Swancourt (who is very like Emma Gifford, the sister-in-law of the local rector who Hardy wooed and ultimately won). The book is, therefore, highly autobiographical. The two men -- Smith and Knight -- represent a duality in Hardy's own personality and reflect his ambivalence about giving up a highly promising career in architecture for the uncertainties of writing for a living. This duality expresses itself repeatedly in other contexts throughout the novel. The story is not a melodramatic contest between a good man and a bad man, but a rivalry between two men who are both meritorious and equally flawed, each in his own way. Making this, perhaps, the most personal of Hardy's novels, as reflected by the fact that he continued to work on the book, off and on, throughout his life.The world likes to pigeon-hole talent and render it one-dimensional. But Hardy refuses to be pigeon-holed. He was both architect and creative writer. He was justifiably proud of his accomplishments in the profession of architecture and hopeful, but never quite sure, of his genius in the world of literature. In fact, he mastered both, ultimately. As an architect, Hardy was very conscious of structure and craftsmanship, much more so than most contemporary novelists. The plot of this book reflects his precise nature and his intellect. This book is most assuredly about something, it has direction, and it explores many of the major themes in Hardy's later works. Consequently, it affords those who appreciate the art of literature an opportunity to examine the progress of a novelist learning to weave plot, character, setting, and tone, before he acquires the polish in his later works that make all the seams disappear.I recommend this book, not as great literature, but as great literary skill in the making and as a starkly honest expression of Hardy's literary vision. It is a book to be studied. In that regard, the masterful introduction by Tom Dolin is worth the price of the book in itself. The text is superbly edited by Alan Manford and augmented by a very helpful chronology, bibliography, and notes. It is a scholarly addition to the other esteemed Oxford World's Classics and should find a place on every serious writer's shelf."},{"Title":"A Pair of Blue Eyes (Works of Thomas Hardy in Prose and Verse, Vol 10)","review":"This book probably holds most draw for Hardy fans. Due from time period, from a young author, and from particular style, the book is a jumbled read at points-- but the plot is beyond reproach. Overall, quite entertaining.

Very interesting quotes on female nature to be had as an added bonus."},{"Title":"Introduction to the theory of relativity, (Prentice-Hall physics series)","review":"Don't know of a superior first exposure to relativity. It starts with elementary situations and examines the conflicts with pre-relativistic kinematical viewpoints. This motivates the requirements for special relativities' postulates and their immediate consequences.From here, the more complex issues of special relativity are dealt with in an orderly fashion; e.g. rigid body dynamics, relativistic hydrodynamics and electromagnetic theory from a relatavistic point of view.General tensor analysis is covered in a separate chapter for pursuing the general relativity chapters of the book. Incidentally, this chapter is among the most clear expositions on tensors out there.Finally, general relativity is covered in the same stepwise fashion as was done in the special relativity chapters. The natural introduction of more complex ideas which start from basics is perhaps, the single reason why this book is a hard to beat introduction to relativity.After a thorough digestion of Bergmann, one is ready to spring up to the next level, the masterful Weinberg."},{"Title":"Introduction to the theory of relativity, (Prentice-Hall physics series)","review":"This book describes the foundations of relativity in a clear and concise way. The development of tensor analysis is especially clear. It is great for anyone who has studied calculus, differential equations, and classical physics. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Introduction to the theory of relativity, (Prentice-Hall physics series)","review":"This book is one of the first introductions to the theory of relativity that has the endorsement of the discoverer of the theory. Albert Einstein was alive when the book was first published, and writes the foreward to the book. Individuals who want to learn relativity should still take a look at this book, in spite of the somewhat outdated mathematical notation. In more contemporary textbooks and monographs the physical intuition is usually sacrificed and replaced with mathematical formalism. But here the author puts the main emphasis on the physics behind the subject. It is one of the few books still in print that discusses the relativistic mechanics of mass points and continuous matter.The reader will also get an overview of early approaches to unified field theories. Historians of science will be interested in particular with this discussion. It is amazing how much has changed in this area since this book was published in 1942. The advent of superstring and M-theory has given physicists a view of reality that is set on a mathematical structure that is quite formidable. It now takes years for a student to obtain the necessary mathematical background to reach the frontiers of unified theories. In this book, it only takes the reading of the first two parts to be able to understand the author's overview of unified field theories. Particular attention should be paid to the treatment of the gauge-invariant geometry of Hermann Weyl, because of its relevance to the construction of gauge theories in elementary particle physics. The geometry of Weyl is constructed using a symmetric tensor representing the gravitational field and a pseudovector that represents the vector potential. When a gauge transformation is applied to this vector potential, it changes by a gradient, which, as the author remarks, is the historical reason for calling the addition of a gradient to the electromagnetic vector potential a gauge transformation. In addition, variational principles play a role in this discussion, and these principles have wide applicability to the quantization of gauge theories in modern developments. The role played by adding extra dimensions to formulate a field theory is summarized here by the author in his discussion of five-dimensional field theories and Kaluza-Klein theories. Ten- and eleven-dimensional theories now dominate modern unified theories. It would be very interesting to know what the author and Einstein would have thought about the theories of today, entrenched as they are in the most complex mathematical constructions ever applied to physical theory."},{"Title":"Introduction to the theory of relativity, (Prentice-Hall physics series)","review":"Hey, it's endorsed by big Al, himself.

Unfortunately, that was during a week of law school finals. Although I finished the thousand pages in a few days, my grades turned out to be a full level below all my other semesters. That's how spellbinding Noble House is. This book is certainly top rate in terms of plot, suspense and characters in its own right, but what bound me to it during all my spare time was the interrelationship with the characters from Clavell's previous Hong Kong novel, Tai Pan and, to a lesser extent, King Rat. The same was true later with Whirlwind and Gai Jin, neither of which gathered a speck of dust in the bookstore before I bought it. Even today, I mourn over the fact that Clavell didn't live long enough to write another 2 or 3 books in his series. I have never read any other author who leaves so many questions unanswered and so many critical issues unresolved, but does so in a way that feeds the curiosity so strongly rather than disappointing. It is a tribute to Clavell's monumental skill as a storyteller that this is a strength of his novels rather than a major irritant to his readers. Very few of those readers stopped at one Clavell novel and, as far as I know, almost everyone who has read one goes on to read all the rest. Unlike so many of today's authors, he writes about heroes who aren't made of cardboard and who hold genuine mystery no matter how closely they are observed."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"James Clavell was a WONDERFUL Writer (yes, with a capital W) and NOBLE HOUSE was a gift he left to us!Through his eyes we visit Hong Kong in the 1970's.

Truly beautiful production.Nevertheless, my advice is to first read the book and only THEN watch the TV version."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Author James Clavell wrote six epic novels that he referred to as \\"The Asian Saga\\" consisting of Shogun, Tai-Pan, Gai-Jin, King Rat, Noble House, and Whirlwind. Each book, while not always directly interrelated, has overlapping characters and themes that build upon one another while exploring the experiences of Europeans in Asia. While King Rat is often referred to as Clavell's strongest work, (Whirlwind his weakest) its dark setting of a Japanese POW camp during the Second World War is often too unsettling for many readers. Noble House allows a reader the option of seeing just how engrossing Clavell can be as a writer while not having to deal with the biting nature of humanity's dark side as portrayed in King Rat. Set in Hong Kong during the early 1960's, Noble House's plot evolves around the wheeling and dealing of modern day \\"Tai-pans\\" or Big Bosses of large, wealthy corporations. Clavell balances his hero, Ian Dunross, against an equally imposing counter-hero, Quillan Gornt, creating a clash between two corporate-titans that is exciting, interesting, and at times very witty. At over 1370 pages, Noble House is not a quick read, but if you are interested in reading only one of Clavell's books, Noble House should be your choice."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is one of the best novels I have read lately. Don't let the 1,400-page book intimidates you. I guarantee you'll find it hard to put the book down once you started. The characters were written with such insights that you actually care what happen to them. Put this book into the shopping cart now. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Eeeee, but this novel is long! Perhaps too long, heya?In 1981, Clavell followed his greatest success, SHOGUN, with an even longer epic, covering eight days in 1963 Hong Kong. A sequel of sorts to TAI-PAN, this paean to laissez-faire capitalism follows the descendants of TAI-PAN's hero Dirk Struan, in 1963 Hong Kong.Two Americans from a large corporation, looking to expand in Hong Kong, arrive in the city to explore a deal, either with Struan's (the \\"good\\" guys) or with Rothwell-Gornt, Struan's sworn enemy. Most of the plot centers on Ian Dunross, descendant of Dirk Struan and current tai-pan, or chief, of the Struan company.There's a great deal of Cold War cloak-and-dagger stuff, with more Russian agents and counter-agents than you can shake a stick at (and it gets hard to keep track of them all). The novel is at its best when describing high stakes financial dealing, or depicting the various Chinese characters; the spy sequences are less compelling. Ian Dunross, the hero, is basically just a cipher, a straight-up-and-down cool and collected leading man. (Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of him in the TV miniseries is about right.) The minor characters are rather better developed, although the Americans are boring.Unfortunately for a novel that runs 1,370 pages of small print, the story begins to slow down about three-quarters of the way through, and the last 300 pages are somewhat rambling. SHOGUN has a similar problem --- the story slows down and unnecessary sub-plots are added --- but it isn't that noticeable until you read it for the third time.However, Clavell's marvelous storytelling more than offsets the various flaws, and for those who have the patience to stick with it, this is a very entertaining read. TAI-PAN and SHOGUN are much more satisfying novels, and I would recommend reading those first (also, KING RAT, the shortest of Clavell's novels)."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"James Clavell was a WONDERFUL Writer (yes, with a capital W) and NOBLE HOUSE was a gift he left to us!Through his eyes we visit Hong Kong in the 1970's.

Great plots and it was really wonderful to be able to read such fascinating stories about China and Japan. I've recently read through C's books again, and the stories and the different non-Chinese characters are still great. However, the magic feeling of reading about the Orient is sadly no longer there. I've lived for well over a decade in China, and it is depressing to suddently realize how truly little C actually seems to have understood about the country, the people, the history or even the Chinese language. No Chinese characters are at all believable in the book under review, and pretty much none of the Chinese dialoges found in the book would (or could) ever occur in real life. Chinese (men or women) do not talk openly about sex the way they constantly do in the books, nor would any Chinese use the extremely foul language that C uses in most of their dialoges. Chinese do not all secretly look down upon foreigners as uncivilized \\"devils\\". C portrays the Chinese as sex-obsessed but without love (hence C's absurd notion that the Chinese language has no word for love). No love = no strings attached; sex is just for fun and British sin or shame does not exist in the exotic Orient. The young Chinese women exist simply to \\"pleasure the steaming stalks\\" of both fellow Chinese and middle-aged European expats. This portrayal (which is mirrored in C's books on Japan, where the Japanese coincidentally also are supposed to lack a word for \\"love\\") is clearly a reflection of C's own fantasies about the Orient, and has nothing to do with reality.Still, the books ARE entertaining. The stories and the absurd dialoges ARE fun to read. Just don't expect to learn anything about China or Japan from any of C's books..."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is quite simply the best story I've ever read. Yes, it's insanely long and expansive, but it's well worth the time and effort it will take to read it. I first read it in 1992 while I was travelling - I was looking for a good long book to help me cover empty hours on trains and buses. I ended up finishing it in a week, so riveting it was that putting it down was not an option. At first you may find yourself confused because of all the characters and intersecting story-lines, but that confusion quickly abates and you'll find yourself immersed in a world of political intrigue, big business, clashing cultures, love and loss, espionage, natural disasters, and one of the most compelling main characters you'll ever meet. And it all takes place in the span of one week!!!Like I said, I first read this book in 1992, and I've probably read it fifteen times since and enjoyed it just as much every single time. Clavell's 'Asian Saga' is monumental in scope and each book is a masterpiece, but this is the pinnacle of them all. You don't have to read the other books in the saga to enjoy Noble House, but you'll find yourself compelled to read the others once you're done with it and you won't be disappointed with any of them."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Truly a fascinting book. Ruthless big business in 1960s Hong Kong, well developed characters with goals and feelings. The author gives a good description on how big business really is in this time and place. My only complaint is that the author spent too much time on the plot involving the KGB and Brian Kwok. The ending was very sad but at the same time triumphant for one of the protagonists of the book, the beautiful Casey Tcholok, a woman who just wants to succeed in a man's world of business. Overall I think the book was longer than it needed to be and deviated a bit from the main plot, so that's why I'm taking off two stars, here..."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This book is one of the greatest books of modern times. It is well written and, because it has short chapters, it keeps you turning the pages. It's also nice that you know what all of the main characters are doing at any time. The storyline is fantastic and really shows you what it is like inside one of the great trading companies of the far east. This my favorite book of all time..I can read it again and again and not get bored. Every book collection and library should have this book. It is really sad that James Clavell died so young and did not give us even more novels...especially about Hag Struan. He could have writtten a book just about her (rumor has it he was working on that when he died. If so, I wish his family would get it published.)"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I have purchased this book while looking for some reading materials on the last 50 years of history of Hong Kong. While the book is the fiction, its details are very much close to the reality. And, as I was later told, the description of the life in this book reasonably well corresponds with how it in fact happened those days.Learned a few words, a few concepts and enjoyed several hours of wiki-diving around this book.Even though the book is quite long, the author is a master of suspence and it keep your attention for all those days you spend reading it.Recommended."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is a long, yet utterly absorbing novel that takes place in a single week in the Hong Kong of 1963. While it is the penultimate book in James Clavell's Asian saga, it is not necessary to have ready any of the other books in the series to enjoy this one.The story line focuses on several of the large trading houses that have operated in Hong Kong since the 19th century. These \`hongs' or companies are fiercely competitive, with the richest one holding the title of \`noble house.' At present, the noble house is Struan's, headed by Ian Dunross, a great-grandson of the founder, Scottish privateer Dirk Struan, whose story is told in an earlier novel, Tai-Pan.Most of the Chinese who inhabit the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong are Cantonese, whose ancestors left the city of Canton (now Guangzhou) on mainland China. Their culture is ancient and elaborate, and their language rich and expressive. They are essentially a servant class to the Anglos like Dunross, although many are quite wealthy in their own right.The story is complex and filled with many exceptionally well-drawn characters. There are ethnic Haklo fishermen who appear poor but have made millions in the stock market, wealthy Americans who arrive in Hong Kong to make deals they hope will give them entree to Asian markets, spies for both Nationalist and Communist China, as well as the Soviet Union; Chinese strivers who are chambermaids by day and gamblers by night, prostitutes, social climbers, mixed race Eurasians caught between two worlds, scions, bastards, pampered children, heroes and villains. Somehow, Clavell manages to mix all of these characters into a swift moving and captivating plot that will hold an intelligent readers' attention throughout the 1,000+ pages.The feature I enjoy most is that Clavell includes lots of interesting factoids and cultural tidbits about the Cantonese and British expats as they lived in Hong Kong during the 1960s. Certainly these are generalizations, which some readers may view as stereotypes. Knowing how carefully researched Clavell's novels are, however, I choose to take these as amusing signposts that help me understand the context for his extraordinary story.This is one of my favorite novels, which I re-read recently as part of my preparation for spending a couple of months in Hong Kong doing research with some students. Even the second time around, Noble House holds up as a great book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Thanks for the book. It will go in my collection of my James Clavell's books. aaa sss ddd fff ggg"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Shipment was very fast...received in three days from ordering; however, would not have ordered had the description mentioned it was a Book Club Edition and also that this is only Volume 1...now I have to find Volume 2!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Ijust reread this for the first time in 30 years,having forgotten what a wonderful novel this is. I'm fascinated by Asia and this described the latter part of the 20th century wonderfully well, when HOng Kong still belonged to Great Britain. He has a host of characters, each of whom stands out individually. His main characters are multi-layered, well so are his minor ones now that I think of them. There is no black and white, but vibrant shades of gray. His research is prodigous and, I must admit, I love it when I cry in a book, which I did at the end. For a man with Clavell's background I was surprised at his sensitivity and his understanding of women, better than most men have, certainly. He was not afraid of strong women who were also vulnerable. I loved his women characters and thought the men equally wonderful. It's a long book but I didn't want put it down and as soon as I finished I ordered \\"Tai Pan\\" for my Kindle. I guesss I thought Clavell wrote men's books, but they are also about women who are believable. It was themost interesting novel I've read in a long time. I loved it. Shall start \\"Tai Pan\\" tonight."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House seemingly has it all: vivid characters, a multitude of plots and writing that mostly zips along. One of the problems, I think is that Clavell insists on twisting and turning so many times that it becomes as exhausting as lugging around his barbell of a book. Commie v. Commie, Capitalist Dog v. Capitalist Dog, Capitalist Dog v. Commie Dog. You need a chalkboard to keep track of the overplotted permutations. Another problem is the author's insistence on drawing parallel's to his book, Taipan. It's all a little too neat, a bit too pat the way \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" Others have mentioned the inaccuracy, indeed the racist portrayal of the Chinese characters. At times it felt like a Charlie Chan script. I also object to a \\"deus ex machina\\" ending to wrap up some of the loose ends. After 1200 pages what's a few more chapters to do it right?Even so, it gets three stars. Any book that can entice so many to read 1200 pages can't be all bad. In fact, at times it is pretty darn good. Unfortunately, it came at the peak of Clavell's popularity, and clearly nobody had the nerve to tell him to self-edit."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Strengths:-Strong character development/engaging characters-Pulls you in. It can be tough to put down at times, leading you to tell yourself \\"just one more page\\" multiple times-Rich with detail. The book is split up by different days, all the action taking place in one week. If you subscribe to the \\"if a little is good, a lot is better\\" theory, you'll enjoy the length of the bookWeaknesses:-Long. As enjoyable as it is, reading about the same characters and storylines for 2 weeks to a month can take you to the point where you just want it to be over-The number of storylines can get difficult to keep track of, even for an experienced reader of fiction-The ending is somewhat unsatisfying, wrapping up some storylines and leaving others hanging with a deus ex machina device. It feels like there's little to no resolution.Bottom line: If you've read any of Clavell's other books, you know what you're getting into, and Noble House does not disappoint. If you've never read any of his works, I'd recommend starting with Shogun, the chronological start to the Asian Saga, or Tai Pan, many of whose characters are referenced in Noble House (Noble House is better than Tai Pan, but not as good as Shogun, in my opinion). But if that's not possible you'll find an engaging, if complicated, tale offering both perspectives of the people of Hong Kong from a Westerner's point of view, as well as perspectives of Westerners from Asian points of view. This book has intrigue, suspense, drama, and a moderate amount of romance. Perhaps not high class literature, but much better than \\"beach fiction.\\" Recommended to an audience who loves to read and can handle complex plots with lots of characters, but isn't above enjoying a good spy novel/murder mystery/suspense-thriller type of book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"A fascinating saga written with tremendous talent. Very interesting page turner and one of the best books I have ever read. Clavell includes a bank run, a bear raid, international intrigue, relationship/sexual tension, smuggling operations, natural disasters, multi-generational rivalry, blood oaths, espionage and dramatic natural disasters in an extremely action packed period of little more than one week. A long book (as are all my favorites) but a very interesting read and one which I highly recommend!Since I am reviewing the audible.com version I must also comment on the talent of one of the most talented readers on audible, John Lee. I have listened to many previous books by John Lee, and I have always enjoyed them. However, I have never listened to a book that allowed John to display his talent as well as this one. Lee did an excellent job at all the different accents, the different personalities and the distinct situations.I recommend Clavell's \\"Noble House\\" yet in particular I recommend John Lee's rendition of this great Asian saga."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Still reading Noble House and I have to say it is a fantastic novel. I've read all of Clavell's Asian Saga, and this is one of the best along with Shogun and Tai Pan.The book is physically much larger than I thought it was going to be (physical size of the pages, not the number of pages), but this hasn't turned out to be an issue. I was taken aback at first as I thought that the size would end up being a pain, but for a book this long it is actually quite nice.Clavell has a way of inserting his characters into your head - I find myself saying thinking \\"so and so wouldn't like that\\" as I go about my normal day, even when I'm not reading the book. His writing style, plus the fact that he isn't afraid of taking the time to weave his story makes this book a memorably enjoyable read.This book takes place in the early 1960's and weaves in several characters from his other prior Asian Saga novels. While the read would be enjoyable as it is, it is really a sequel (most directly) to Tai Pan and I would not recommend reading Nobel House without having gone through Tai Pan first. Lucky you! :) Both books are ones that you feel sorry to have finished because now they are \\"over\\".Highly recommended, as long as you don't mind the 1200 pages - I happen to like that, because you get to savor the story..."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is a long but very enjoyable story. It captures the plots and dangers of business and finance in Hong Kong in a way that makes it so the story never gets boring. Clavell has a knack for historical fiction and insight into Asian culture that few if any western authors seem to. Clavell's personal experiences as a prisoner of war in world war II form the basis for King Rat and perhaps help explain his fascination with Japan and Hong Kong. Shogun met with great success despite it also being a rather long novel and Noble House builds on this story several generations later with the same vibrant and multidimensional character development that makes this book a great read as well."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"So far it's only okay.

Along with Tai-Pan, I would rate this as the best book of Clavell. Although at times he goes into too much detail on some topics, such as finance, this is generally a thrilling book, with some genuinely exciting plot twists. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys long, sweeping epics."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This was a book I just couldn't put down. After reading the previous James Clavell books in the series I just loved this one as well."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"A very good novel about Hong Kong. As a native of Hong Kong, it fascinates me.To my knowledge. all the events that took place in this book had happened in Hong Kong or Asia in some ways.I must , however, comment that it is much too long for the layman who is not familiar with Hong Kong or China. This is not a spy novel nor a thriller and I wonder if such a person have the patience or time to go through it. In this day and age of television, this could be a great TV series but such a long and detailed book may not have much appeal. In any case, I must commend James Clavell for producing this book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I guess I'll have to be a wet blanket and say - I couldn't finish it. I made it about half-way through and just couldn't keep all the characters straight and trying to understand the international banking and trading was more like a chore than a reading pleasure. I was also tired of listening to all the obscene and elaborate ways the Chinese characters talked about the \\"filthy, dung-eating, uncivilized foreign barbarians\\" - and that's mild compared to most of the racist insults! And it seems like every single male character, upon seeing Casey for the first time, thought \\"Ah, I would certainly like to possess/bed/pillow that one!\\" Another complaint: It seems like almost every new advancement in the plot was heralded by a phone call. I was so sick of the phone ringing every other page!My problem with Ian Dunross: It kept hammering home the point that Dunross had inherited Dirk Straun's animal power and aura of danger, but I never really saw this come through. He seemed like just a typical ambitous businessman and actually a little easy-going a lot of the time. Of course, I didn't finish the book so maybe the aura of danger cropped up later.I was actually rooting for Gornt by the time I stopped reading; I didn't really get any feeling of loyalty to Straun's - Not like in Tai-Pan where I was cheering for Dirk's side all the way.And yet... I gave it two stars because it's not out of the question that I'll give it another try one of these days, maybe when I'm feeling more ambitious."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I just finished this book, and I am hugely disappointed. The book could have been condensed down to a third of it's current form. There are ramblings that go on for pages that repeat information that just felt like page fillers. It seems like no editing had been done for this book. Clavell tortures us with poor writing, shallow characters, and caricaturization of all Chinese characters and especially completely distorted view and depiction of all women in the book. Perhaps Mr. Clavell suffered from seeing all women as virgins or whores. A total waste of time."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible. Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs. There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself. It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal. Will person A get the contract, or will person B? A business deal? Who cares?SPOILER ALERT:And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out. No climax, no drama, nothing.I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters. I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book. All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on. These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.It's boring, it's long, it's badly written. I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat. But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"After reading the previous four novels of Clavell's Asian Saga, I was very disappointed in Noble House. Shogun, Tai-Pan, King Rat, and Gai-Jin were absolutely fantastic; exciting with a lot of action and colorful characters. The characters in Noble House are excellent, but the constant detailed diatribe about the finances of taking over the Noble House was way overdone and constantly repeated. I'm amazed that Clavell wrote this book because all the hashing about money consistently stopped the ACTION of the story. The first thing a writer learns is to keep the action going. I found most of this book as boring as watching paint dry. The plot lines about espionage were good and Clavell should have expanded that story line and cut out the constant rehashing of the bank's problems and Casey's &quot;drop dead&quot; money. Like, we got the point."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is a really good novel--I was never bored during its almost 1400 pages. However, it didn't rivet me like Tai-Pan or King Rat did. In fact, the story starts fairly slowly, and the ending is very anticlimatic. (Clavell seems to have a penchant for writing disappointing endings. The ending to Shogun was SUCH a letdowm!) Read this novel if you've finished Tai-Pan and King Rat already. But if you haven't, those two novels are much better."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I've read the whole Asian Saga, and this is Clavell's finest masterpiece. I read Noble House twice as an undergrad. Now, taking a break from law school, I'm reading it for a third time and I'm enjoying it like it was the first time.

I liked \\"King Rat\\" very much, and later I enjoyed both \\"Shogun\\" and \\"Tai-Pan\\". So why did I find this book so dull, so boring, in fact, that I didn't finish it? The characters are uninteresting, the events trivial, the politics weird. The book's understanding of business and business practice is naive. Really, it could have been ghost-written by Harold Robbins. And the depictions of modern Chinese are not quaint and amusing, as in the distant world of \\"Tai-Pan\\", but racist."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is a real page turner, and that's really saying something considering that this book is hella long. Clavel is a real student Hong Kong high society, and it is fascinating to watch the Anglo Ian Dunross navigate his way through the Asian way, the mini series of this book is exceptional, I saw it as a kid, and I remember how much I wanted to be Pierce Brosnan, nobody could have inbodied Dunross like Brosnan. If you enjoy a good read and love learning about a different culture then you will love this book, but be forewarned, is is LONG, and be sure to pick up the mini series it is a wonderful compliment to the book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is possibly the best book in Clavells series and that says allot since Shogun & Taipan are two of the better books of all time. Run don't walk, get this book. The characters are top line, the story is stunning and the details are pronominal"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Clavell's novels have a great way of continuing at the end. Life goes on. But in \\"Noble House\\" Clavell simply introduces too many segues. The last 200 pages or so of the book seemed rushed, and the book simply ends with too many loose ends. A little frustrating after 1370 pages."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"welcome to Dirk Struan's Island. welcome to espionage, intrigue, cut-throat ambition, war and love and business, and one big old motherfornicator of an earthquake to top it all off. welcome to the towering rain-soaked skyscrapers and the devil-sea whipped shores of Hong Kong. welcome to a half a week without food, water, or sleep enthralled in this mesmerizing epic from a master of his art."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"The Noble House is by far one of the best of Clavell's works! I got so caught up in the drama between Quillan Gornt and Ian Dunross that I couldn't put the book down. I didn't want it to ever end, and when it did I was very very very upset!! I enjoyed the book so much that I found out I wanted to learn more about the characters. I learned about the stock market and bank counsels, etc. I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone and anyone!! It's the kind of book that once you start reading it, you'll never ever ever want to put down. If you're looking for a book with drama, passion, intenseness, murder, mystery, and thrill, you should read The Noble House. It's a wonderful tie in of all of Clavell's books and I simply loved it!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I'm a big fan of Shogun (4 1/2 stars) and Tai-Pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here. But after 450 pages I gave up. Plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters. I got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when I was ready for development and resolution of what came before.This book picks up with the Straun/Brock rivalry from Tai-Pan after an interval of 120 years. I wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what I read.The writing is still good and I may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but I had to move on to something more satisfying."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is the end of the story of James Clavell's Asian Saga. Having started the history of the Struans inTai-Pan, set in 1840's Hong Kong, Noble House wraps it up in 1960's Hong Kong. If you haven't read any Clavell I recommend you start withTai-Pan.Much of what Clavell's fans expect from him is here: danger, romance, passion, wealth, mystery, high stakes and exotic Asia as the background. Yum.However, I give Noble House only 4 stars for three reasons.(1) Noble House is very different from the others in the Asian Saga because of its modern elements. A major storyline involves the KGB and international espionage, which feels more like Ludlum or LeCarre than typical Clavell. This part is well handled but not really the core of what one is looking for from Clavell.(2) The business storyline is more complicated than in previous works because the tools of business had become much more complex (stock exchanges, international bonds) between 1840 and 1960. This may get a little too involved and detailed for some (and I am a businessman with a law degree!).(3) Most importantly, Noble House was not quite as fun for me as the others because it had less historical importance. Gai-Jin, Shogun and Tai Pan depict historically important events. In particular, Dirk Struan in Tai Pan is changing history. Unfortunately, by 1960 Struan's, even if it is still called \\"the Noble House,\\" is not nearly as significant and is more of a family company trying to make a buck. There are still traditions and mysteries associated with the company, sure, but at the end of the day it is one company among many in the world. Wal-Mart could buy them a million times over and barely notice. They're struggling over single digit millions of dollars. That's a far cry from founding Hong Kong. So that was my main problem with Noble House. While the story was fun, like the previous works, it didn't quite have the historical heft of its predecessors. I still give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Layers of intrigue. I did not want his book to end. TAI PAN was great but this was better. One of my Top Ten favorite books of all time. Even at 1200+ pages, you will re-read it someday."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I read Noble House many years ago. I still haven't found a match to this book. Never have I been so spellbound by a story. Clavell's other books are also good, but this one should have had an extra sixth star."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"One of my 10 favorite books of all time. Better than Shogun. Great plot, well developed characters - I couldn't put the book down! Simply awesome work. Clavell's best and that says much!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is Clavell's last book of his epic series. I am glad that I read Tai-Pan (thanks to another customer review's suggestion), so that I was able to follow the characters and historic development of Noble House. Noble House is much better than Tai-Pan and is definitely an easier read.Noble House has a pretty good plot. I found the Russia, world-domination plot a little underdeveloped and could have been wiped out entirely out of the equation, thus, saving a couple hundred pages of this lengthy 1200+ epic novel.The main characters are exciting to follow: Ian Dunross, Casey, Bartlett, Quillan Gornt, 4 Fingers Wu. Some are developed enough to recognize throughout the novel: Peter Marlowe, Brian Kwok, Philip and John Chen, Suslev. And some could have been left out: Haply, Inspector Smyth, Havergill, etc.A pretty decent read, but very, very long. This could have been shortened and still be a powerful novel - even more so.It makes sense to read these in order because of continuing saga's. I took the shortcut and only read Tai-Pan and Noble House and this was enough to follow the storyline."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"It is a great book, need to read Tia Pan first. Great history of Hong Kong. This is my second time that I have read this book. Would love to hear others comment."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is the fifth book in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\". This is the book that ties the previous installations together. It takes place in modern Hong Kong and the main plot centers around the rivalry between the Noble House, whose current leader is Ian Struan Dunross, and Quillan Gornt.The Noble House is a very tight book. There are many subplots, main characters (each with their own set of motivations and problems) and a ridiculous amount of secondary characters. But everything is pretty easy to follow and, if you lose track of the part a character or two are playing in relation to the story, the next time they enter the plot there will probably be a reminder of who they are.This book was a very fun read. It takes place over the course of one week and in that period is the discovery of a secret ring of Russian spies, a floating restaurant fire, business associates double crossing one another, bank runs, stock market crashes, and a massive mudslide. And those are just some of the events of a very busy week.One of my favorite story lines was the ring of Russian spies. It took everything I had not to flip forward and find out who the spies were out of the main characters. And there are plenty of surprises along the way.I didn't buy Whirlwind (Clavell's sixth book) because of mediocre reviews and I am happy to end my adventures with Noble House. It was my favorite book of the series and probably the most exciting. The only thing that might be a detraction is that this book doesn't concentrate as much as the others on Asian culture. This is partially because it is about Hong Kong in 1963, which has been largely modernized, but also because, if you have read the whole series, you don't have to have a detailed explanation of the culture in the fifth book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"James Clavell is known for his thick books, this one is nearly 1400 pages long! Normally I like thick books - more story to read - but this one simply isn;t as good as Shogun. There were parts of this book that were really good and exciting, but other parts were very podding and I found myself frustrated with them.Shogun was so interesting because Blackthorne/Anjin was immersed in Japanese culture and had to learn how to survive and fit within it, but the rest of the books did not follow this formula. It would have been nice if Clavell had written another book about a European stuck/stranded in another culture - it would be fun to see him try to deal with Chinese life and etc.Noble House is not without its good parts, but again, some parts were really boring, and this book could have done with a good trimming-down and paring away of some of the subplots that bogged this story down. Other enticing bits of the story could have been expanded on but were cast aside. I would have liked to see a book set in the 1900's or 1910's revolving around Hag Struan and her illustrious life and deeds, but alas, since the author is dead, we take what we can get. If you liked the rest of the Asian Saga, try this book, but be prepared for some plodding and repetitiveness."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This book is a gripping as other Clavell books. However, I hope his sources of information on Chinese stuff were better than on Russians. Some Russian names and factoids are downright ridiculous. For example, he clearly can't tell Kazakhs, Mongol-related people from Central Asia, from Cossacks, militaristic communities of Russian origin living in Southern Russia and Ukraine. Too bad he couldn't find a Russian person to help out, I would have enjoyed the book immensely if not for this nagging doubt whether the whole book would sound similarly ridiculous to a Chinese person."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"As always, Clavell puts together a wonderful labyrinth of subplots that keep this capitalist/communist/opportunist thriller moving all 1370 pages. If you loved Tai-Pan, you'll enjoy Noble House. Clavell was fond of Ayn Rand's philosophy, so it was interesting to see him portray those ideals through some of the characters--curious how laissez-faire would sometimes need to hold hands with the bamboo/iron curtain."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"this novel definitely stands out among other novels.the plots and subplots are just facinating.the author sews it all up together into one massive book nicely.the characters are believable with complete human attitude and personality (not those kind of one dimensional characters you get in other novels).my favourite character has to be Ian Dunross who is played by Pierce Brosnan in the tv series (handpicked by James clavell himnself!).his character is what a leader needs become : unnerved in pulsating circumstances,full of confidence and can be witty whenever necessary.one thing that keeps me wondering though as stated in the book is the chinese habit of spitting to get rid of the bad joss.do they still do that nowadays?i dont know.i have to ask my chinese friends whether thats true!anyone who wants to dive into the superb world of the noble house will come out wanting more.james clavell's a genius in what he does...just sad he's not here to produce more...10stars!!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Set 120 years after the events of Tai-Pan, Ian Dunross is the latest in Dirk Struan's line to head Struan's, also known as the Noble House. To survive, Struan's always skates the financial edge, and Quillan Gornt, descendant of Dirk's enemy, Tyler Brock, is quite happy to push it over the edge.Even though we meet many fine characters, from American businesswoman Casey Tcholok to smuggler's son Paul Choy, Hong Kong itself is really the star of this novel. Seeming almost anarchic at times, the colony (as it then was, the novel is set in 1963) and its people, Chinese and British, seem to worship one god, Money.Clavell ties in references to his other novels--characters from King Rat show up and relive their wartime hatred, many of the characters discuss and live out the heritage of Tai-Pan, and a Japanese character mentions briefly the events of Shogun.This is the sort of book that will keep you up reading until 4 a.m.What I didn't like: I found the character of Peter Marlowe most annoying. He shows up all the time, acts like a know it all, and is really Clavell's way of writing himself into the book. Also, about six different times, it is mentioned that the U.S. is starting to get involved in Vietnam, and each time, a precient character chirps (or at least thinks) that the U.S. will regret it. Hindsight is 20/20, the novel was published in 1981.A good read."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is a mammoth of a book. It's not a single story, it is a dozen plots and subplots magically weaved into one colossal tale.As with the other books by Clavell, this beauty is mind-catching, with great, unpredictable, HUMAN characters and, as always, a brilliant ending. This is a book that you'll be sorry to finish -- you'll want to keep on reading it forever.Great epic Asian feel, great detail, great pace, great everything. This book is 100% greatness.Be warned, though, read Tai-Pan first, or things might be a bit complicated for you."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"rich characters and setting great plot"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is one of those rare books that gets really under your skin. The setting, plot,and characterization are written so colorfully it's as if the reader is in Hong Kong watching the novel unfold. Noble House is an ancient British-owned (actually Scottish) Asian trading company based in Hong Kong. The novel captures how difficult it is for such a company to stay on top. The Noble House has to protect itself from hostile takeovers, foreign powers via the KGB, CIA, and MI-6, and internal strife to name a few such difficulties.I consider myself to be an above average reader; the 1370 pages of Noble House flew by in a three day weekend.If you like historical novels, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This novel is told over a nine day period. In Hong Kong, anything can happen. This story is full of intricate twists and turns. A high action and suspensful thriller which all comes together to a climactic and fullfilling ending. An interesting aspect is how the novel is set up; the story is told through dialogue, while we, the reader, sit back and listen in. Along with the twenty-fourty main events in the novel, everyday life is described in vivid detail. If you want to walk along with some of the most interesting characters as they make and break life-or-death decisions, then Noble House is DEFINITELY the book for you."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is the first novel I've read of his.

But if your in upper class well one must have it."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Ian Dunross, in a driving torrential rain, arrives at the Struan Building in Hong Kong. There he meets with Alastair Struan, the current tai pan (ultimate ruler) of the Noble House. At this meeting Struan confers the title of tai pan on Dunross and he must take an oath to uphold the traditions and oaths established by the first tai pan and founder of the Noble House, Dirk Struan, one of the first and certainly the mightiest of the China Traders from the early 19th century. At this meeting Dunross discovers that a ship containing a disproportionate amount of the Noble House's uninsured wealth has gone down imperiling the House's future.The book then jumps forward three years, to August of 1963, and the Noble House's financial predicament has grown, if anything, worse. Linc Bartlett, an American billionaire, and his ambitious and stunningly beautiful prot&eacute;g&eacute;, K. C. Tcholok arrive in Hong Kong aboard his private Boeing 707 (remember this is 1963). They are in Hong Kong to establish a presence in the lucrative Oriental markets and to make a deal with the Noble House or one of its competitors.Hidden in the wheel-well of the jet are rifles, ammunition, and grenades which are strictly prohibited in Hong Kong. Their origin as well as their purpose is revealed to us gradually as we come to know the protagonist and current tai-pan, Ian Dunross and the multitude of complex problems that he must contend with.We discover early on that there is a Judas Iscariot in the Noble House, the comprador Phillip Chen's son, John Chen, who is inexplicably kidnapped. Bartlett is playing the Noble House against it's arch-enemy and biggest competitor, Rothwell-Gornt run by Quillan Gornt, a descendant of Tyler Brock who is the arch-enemy of the first tai-pan, Dirk Struan. Gornt is using his former mistress, Orlanda Ramos, to spy on Bartlett and to manipulate him into a favorable disposition toward his company.Ian Dunross has a highly secret source of intelligence named Alan Medford Grant from a London Strategic Planning Institute and one of his reports to the tai-pan is intercepted by Roger Crosse of Hong Kong Special Intelligence. Shortly afterwards Grant turns up dead in England as a result of foul play. The information in Grant's reports are yet another important element in the complex tale crafted by Clavell. We learn from the report that the Noble House has a Russian mole within and that there is a mole high up in the Hong Kong government.Nearly every rivalry and association has its roots in the past dating back to at least the original China traders of the early 19th century. Clavell does a marvelous job of integrating the past and the present drawing on his knowledge not only of China and the Orient, but of high finance with repeated references to Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War.\\"Even some of the characters from Clavell's marvelous \\"King Rat\\" make an appearance. The King himself does not appear and is only alluded to, but Robin Grey, as a labor MP and Socialist sympathizer, and Peter Marlowe, a writer and thinly disguised James Clavell himself do appear.Clavell is an astute observer of human nature enabling him to craft an amazingly complex and engaging tale tying together a multitude of disparate elements in a believable manner that is too often overlooked in todays half-baked novels. This book is long at over 1300 pages but well worth the effort. I would recommend reading Clavell's \\"Tai Pan\\" first, if possible, but this is not mandatory.I first read this book on a vacation to Harbor Island in 1981 and was so utterly absorbed by the book that I ignored many of my social responsibilities.I've just completed reading the book again at age 54 and have actually enjoyed it MORE than the first time I read it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Clavell was perhaps the greatest Western writer of Asian historical fiction. In this epic novel he captures the spirit of the Western trading companies as they maneuver in British Hong Kong. We find out what has happened to the house and lineage first created in Taipan, and how the trials and tribulations have been passed from generation to generation.This book captures many of the strengths of the entire series:- Characters are portrayed as complex individuals, not just one dimensional drones- There's tons of history and cultural lessons hidden between the story lines- Character lines are carried cross-book in the seriesDefinitely a solid (if not short) read!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This book makes a leap of one century from Clavell's _Gai-jin_, and presents an interesting look at the culture and economy of Hong Kong. I cannot say how accurate it is except in one respect: passion for gambling. Having worked for years with natives of Hong Kong I believe Clavell has captured this aspect well.What Clavell does best with _Noble House_ is to maintain a high suspense level. Every character in the book could die; one must wait a long time to find out how it's going to turn out. Most of the characters are interesting enough. Just the shenanigans involved with the Hong Kong economy would make this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is undoubtedly Clavell's greatest work. Although Tai-pan, Shogun and King Rat are excellent books in their own right, Noble House keeps the reader enthralled to the last page. Tai-pan makes good reading in itself and serves as a prequel to Noble House. However, it is not necessary to read Tai-pan before Noble House. I did not but I still found this work exciting. The plots - CIA versus KGB versus PRC Intelligence versus MI-5/MI-6, Gornt versus Dunross versus Bartlett, Orlanda versus Casey and a variety of characters (other than those already mentioned), makes the 1400 plus pages light work - it is truly a classic by an author with deep insights in the culture and international relations of Hong Kong and its neighbours and trading partners. The boardroom drama is intense and Clavell leaves the reader guessing who will emerge winner until the end. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This book doesn't have the historical sweep, grandeur and other-worldly feel of SHOGUN, but it is even more densely packed with political and personal machinations, intrigue, \\"pillowing,\\" colorful characters and tension than any of Clavell's other books. I began it with feelings of apprehension, thinking \\"Oh, no, 1400 pages of Hong Kong corporate intrigue...how good can THAT be?\\"Well, it's pretty darn good!!! Yes, there's corporate intrigue, but it's actually kept to a minimum. There are murder mysteries, kidnappings, disasters, sexual intrigue, huge sums of money being thrown around, and lots of detailed glimpses into the psyche of the Chinese, Europeans and just the unique world of Hong Kong in general.If I could have, the book would get 4.5 stars. I have just a couple of problems with it. 1) As in TAI PAN and GAI JIN, the end of the book features a major natural disaster which has the effect of sorting out some of the problems the main characters are having...it feels like a deux ex machina from a Greek tragedy, especially now that Clavell has done it three times! 2) The ending feels a bit rushed. We've invested 1300+ pages into the book and its interesting characters...a richer ending would be in order. (Although for rushed, unsatisfying endings, you can't beat GAI JIN!)That being said, the book is richly rewarding, and frankly, quite amazing. Clavell has successfully juggled perhaps dozens of storylines and scores of characters. The outline for the book alone must have been hundreds of pages. And all of it takes place in the course of one week!Please, if you haven't read other Clavell books, read them in order!!! They are all great, but to be truly appreciated, they BEG to be read in order: SHOGUN, TAI PAN, GAI JIN, KING RAT, NOBLE HOUSE and WHIRLWIND. All are very rewarding, exciting reads."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"It's 1963. Hong Kong business conglomerate Noble House teeters on its foundations, dangerously close to collapse. With enemies and fair-weather friends on all sides vying for a chunk of the fallout rubble, Ian Dunross Struan, tai-pan of the Noble House, must somehow wheel and deal his way into at least twenty million dollars to pay off his debts and save his inheritance. But the tai-pan's struggle is just the surface layer of story, for in _Noble House_ James Clavelle weaves an incredible amount of subplots and historical tangents into a seamless whole-a massive tome that should give the consistent reader many hours of entertainment. Included in this week and a half of Hong Kong history: cold war espionage, bank failures and hostile takeovers, stock market fluctuations, drug smuggling, kidnapping, murder, high-price concubines and the men that desperately seek to please them, horse racing with enormous sums on the line, and the ever-present threat of a sudden typhoon or earthquake to interrupt everyone's fun and put things in perspective._Noble House_ is structured in the typical novel format, being a slow, steady rise of tension and the continual addition of complications, always building the conflict and potential consequences, until release: climax and conclusion. Keeping the reader interested in both plot and characters over 350+ thousand words shows great skill on the part of the author. But what impressed me most about _Noble House_ were Clavelle's insights into the human condition: the fallible, fragile nature of both interpersonal and professional relationships; the overpowering lure of greed and lust; the strong contrasts in eastern and western thought processes. Besides the (literally) enormous entertainment found herein, the cultural and socio-political information in itself makes _Noble House_ a worthy read.Interestingly, Claville predicts the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union by detailing the basic flaw in their world policy: spending vast amounts of borrowed capital on military and subversive activities while the infrastructure of the country crumbled away thanks in no small part to poor maintenance and the stifling of innovation. Given that this book was written in 1981, during one of the peaks of the so-called &quot;cold war,&quot; Clavelle's hints and insinuations resonate with a twenty-first-century hindsight.Recommended."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I am not sure why, or how, so many typographical errors crept into the Kindle edition. For some examples, many words, lines, or parts of whole pages appear in bold type or italics in the Kindle edition but are not that way in the printed edition. There are also missing quotation marks, especially the end-quote marks. There are misplaced lines, apparently due to missing carriage returns. I enjoyed the story but the print flaws are just annoying. Please, Amazon, if you are going to charge so much for these electronic books, put a little quality into the product."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is a book that captures the essence of Hong Kong as the adventurers in all of us imagine it: a hot bed of passion, murder, and intrigue. Clavell was a pioneer in fiction about old Asia, and arguably, this is the best example of his work.I found this book to be extreemly satifying and the conclusion of the book left me a bit sad; I didn't want the tale to end! Noble house is THAT kind of book. The characters all seems extremely vivid and capture the imagination, especially the Taipan of the Noble House, a role that Pierce Brosnan performs beautifully in the movie performance of this classic.Recent novels which have attempted to describe Hong Kong and its people have been mediocre at best; many books simply are so far removed from the truth as to be laughable. Yet even here in Asia, Clavell and Noble House have captured a following which attestes to its authenticity and flavour. I can say nothing more than to ask you to read this epic novel and share the enjoyment that many ahve already experienced."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Many years back I happened upon the book 'Taipan' in a used bookstore in Berkeley. Little did I know then that I was about to embarc upon a fictional journey that would span the centuries as well as generations. 'Noble House' the somewhat sequel to Taipan is set in Hong Kong of the sixties and where the battle between the Straun and Brock families continue to wage not their sabres and cutlasses but clout and money in a ceaseless endeavor to dominate, or even demolish one another.Clavell a master storyteller in this and his other epics, but here he plays upon classic battle between families and offers an expose' into the world of the Orient, and those who would venture into this realm of mystique and beauty.Bottomline: Read Taipan before Noble House ...Or you'll be completely lost"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House is, quite simply, one of the five most enjoyable books I've ever read, and re-read, and re-read, and . . . you get the picture. Clavell has taken the wonderful foundation of Tai-Pan and Shogun and added new levels of depth and complexity.At the beginning of the novel, young Ian Dunross assumes the mantle of Tai-Pan of the Noble House of Struan during a dark and stormy night and a dark and stormy period for the Noble House. The company's holdings are stretched to the limit, and that very night it loses a shipment of valuable contraband at sea. Dunross, heir to the title of Tai-Pan, or supreme leader, is also the kindred spirit to the company's founder, Dirk Struan, the legendary pirate, smuggler, and founder of the Noble House and Hong Kong. Dunross has also inherited the enduring hatred of the family's historical enemies, the Brocks, now personified in Quillan Gornt, head of the Second House. Gornt, a worthy adversary, has his own designs to topple Struan's and take over as the Noble House.But so does everybody else in the novel, it seems, unless the characters are interested in international espionage involving the Soviet Union, Communist China, the United States, or good old England. Triple agents, royalty, thieves, kidnappers, murderers, gangsters, and businessmen rub shoulders in this tempest in the teapot of Hong Kong.The key variables in this play are two Americans on a business trip, who hold the key to finiancial success in Hong Kong. Linc Bartlett is CEO, and his right-hand man is the beautiful woman, K.C. Tcholok. The Americans' ignorance of Hong Kong customs reflects the reader's, and injects a considerable amount of humor into the novel.But, as with Clavell's first novel (Tai-Pan), the center of attention remains the tai-pan. Ian Dunross is the personification of what is good in the British Empire, even though he is as ruthless as they come. He guides the Noble House through a minefield without a map, using his business acumen, guts, and joss to see him through. A climactic ending to an epic story of love, business, and war is immensely satisfying, and leaves you begging for more (just like Tai-Pan, Shogun, and King Rat did before). A must-read!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"The Nobel House is another story of a powerful semi-legal family with a charismatic and wise leader. Reminds me of the Godfather in many ways. One of James Cavell best. Nobel House is a fine example of his understanding of human nature and attention to detail. He pulls off a mini education of how the rich think of the poor, Hong Kong and China without detracting from the story. The entire series of the &#34;Noble House&#34; books have been stories worth reading."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I like well done &#34;grand scale&#34; stories. Epics like Dr Zhivago or Asimov's Foundation series... Stories spanning multiple generations with lager-than-life characters, true-to-life characters, greed, hate, love, unreasoning jealosy. James Clavell delivers big time with Noble House.Written in the 70's and taking place in the 60's you may be reminded of Mad Men -- especially with the rampant sexism. It was extraordinarily difficult to be a business woman in the 60's -- and even more so in Honk Kong. The story takes about 1400 pages to tell. I have been reading it slowly, to make it last...One thing I like is: Clavell puts you inside the heads of many characters, so that you see [in detail] what the really think, and then what they say to their fellow characters. Very effective. I like the presentation of HK life and culture. Having been to HK several times myself (never in the 60's tho), I can see differences between modern HK and what it must have been like in the 60's.The story is somewhat dated, but still effective. While some aspects of the story may not hold together in 2012, Noble House is an accurate presentation of what it was like in HK in the 60's. Definitely worth a read. For maximum enjoyment, dial back your PC sensibilty meter before sitting down to read...There is a TV movie of Noble House starring Pierce Brosnan. It barely scratches the surface of what's in the book...And being a TV movie (subject to heavy censorship), it cannot portray language and events realistically."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"As good as James Clavell is, this book was rather disappointing for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good - however not comparable to Shogun or Tai-pan.It's rather similar to Tai-pan but in a different era. There's also way more pseudo-political subplots interwoven into the story, for those who like that type of thing. For me, I thought it was a bit too much. I wish it focused a bit more on Ian Dunross the main character.For those new to James Clavell, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SHOGUN. His magnum opus! It is the best book I have ever read. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This book is one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, but it also has that rare quality of making one feel smarter. I understand the history is not completely accurate, yet I still feel like I am learning about a group of times, places, and cultures that I have never truly encountered. Clavell's writing style and his depiction of protagonists and villains alike are stirring and engaging throughout."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Noble House tells the story of the Tai Pan's dependents after multiple generations. The family is living and conducting business in Hong Kong. The story is well-written with many more characters and interactions than in the original story. I love soft history books often wonder what happened later. Noble House is that book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I first read this book years ago... around 1984 - I just read it again now, and with the years I found it much better, I appreciate more the writing and the complexity. Really I am glad that apart from being able to have it my iPad, I also have the paperback - this book should be part of any seriously interested reader of Asian-inspired historical sagas. It is just a pity that the writer died years ago, it would have been wonderful to follow on the saga of the Struan family and the handover of Hong Kong to China. The real Noble House still exists, but the one in James Clavell's mind could have been really interesting reading...."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I enjoy all of Clavell's works. Shogun first, then Taipan, King Rat, Noble House and Whirlwind. They follow with familiar characters in most cases. They seem to be historically correct and they keep your interest throughout. They're excellent reads."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Although Noble House stands on its own as an excellent page turner, it's a much more enjoyable read as the last of Clavell's novels chronologically. Shogun, Tai pan, Gaijin and King Rat give a delightful history and back story that enriches ever chapter and character of Noble House. Alone or as the end of a series, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Long novel with an intricate plot. I enjoyed it a lot. Other reviewers have covered the plot and given their opinions. I'll just give one tip. Unless you can clear your calendar so you can read without interruptions, I'd recommend buying the Kindle version of this book if you can. That way if you have to put it down for a while and come back to it, you'll be able to search back through the book electronically to remind yourself of plot details that happened several hundred pages ago. This will help you tie everything together.Be warned however, you probably won't want to put it down in the first place. Great story."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"excellent read.follows the pattern set forth by the author's prevous works in the asian theme. where may I find the Whirlwind book?"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"James Clavell was an excellent writer ... I'm always glad to read (and re-read) his material. Just finished Noble House. The way the author ties, weaves and overlaps centuries of stories and people and families is simply astounding.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Noble House&quot;. Mostly. However, I am not as enthusiastic about it as the other reviewers, especially when comparing &quot;Noble House&quot; to &quot;Shogun&quot;. In my humble opinion, &quot;Shogun&quot; (another of Clavell's marathon-length novels) is far more enjoyable to &quot;Noble House&quot;. An explanation about my tastes in books below may illuminate for you why I feel this way.There are three things that make a novel appealing to me: 1) interesting uses of the English language; 2) plots built around complex relationships, especially romantic ones; and 3) books that inspire or &quot;move&quot; me. Incidentally, when I write &quot;an interesting use of the English language&quot; above, I do NOT mean flowery or intellectual language. Rather, I mean I prefer authors who can paint common scenes with common words in uncommon or unique ways. Some of my favorite books, both fiction and nonfiction, include &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;The Class&quot; by Erich Segal, &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; by John Grisham, &quot;Walden&quot; by H.D. Thoreau and &quot;Into the Wild&quot; by Jon Krakauer. On the flip side, genres that I typically DISLIKE include trashy romance, fantasy, science fiction and spy/military thrillers. Some very popular authors whose books I don't enjoy include Tom Clancy, Danielle Steele and Stephen King.Because of my personal tastes, I loved &quot;Noble House&quot; for its character relationships (Dunross v. Gornt, American v. European v. Chinese means of doing business, Casey v. Linc, Dunross, Gornt, et al). However, I equally DISLIKED it for its endlessly painful details about the Russian KGB, double-agents, kidnapping, etc.). Since the book had both, I found myself lapping up some chapters yet wanting to skip others entirely. This was frustrating to me because I needed some of the information in the &quot;spy&quot; chapters to keep the plot flowing seamlessly, yet I dreaded sifting through them to find the facts I needed. This is the reason I cannot sing unfettered praises for &quot;Noble House&quot;. It's worth reading, but I would personally put it off until you've read &quot;Shogun&quot; first.&quot;Gai-Jin&quot; is the next Clavell novel on my plate. I'll let you know how it goes."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"\\"Noble House,\\" James Clavell's epic story of Hong Kong, is long (over 1,300 pages), and it has a rich plot with a rich cast of characters. Over the course of one week, a lot seems to happen, but nothing really happens because not that much changes. There's some deaths and some sex, but really this book is occupied mainly by swearing and intrigue.If Clavell's understanding of Hong Kong is correct (and we have no reason to suspect that it is not), then Hong Kong is run by a bunch of incestuous pirates. Its wealth and power derive from it being mainland China's strategic entrepot to the world, which is also what accounts for its instability and intrigue.It's a great book for those who have some understanding and some contact with Hong Kong. Otherwise, it really is nothing more than sound and fury."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I believe that to many are trying to compare this book to shogun when obviously it has been a progression of the story line. I think that history is magical in the sense that it's hard to comprehend. That is what makes shogun so much of a good read. Now, as we progress through the story line...we... as the reader... start to associate and therefore, lose that magic. Like the Disney ride... It's all about imagination"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Start with Shogun by Clavell and work up to Gai-Jin, Noble House, King Rat and the rest of the Asian saga. They are tremendous and educational"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"An all time great read. I loved it! I am already planning on reading it a 3rd time.Noble House and Shogun are tied for the top spot in my personal list of top ten books I have read in my life.Just buy it and read it, you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Excellent story - Well written characters. I particularly enjoyed the mannerly byplay between the English and Chinese characters vs the blunt and straightforward Americans. Good read."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"if you've only heard of clavell because of the excellent shogun, then you have so far missed out on his greatest work: noble house. the plot is so rich and there is so much humour also that you will wish the book was even longer than it is. you cannot miss this book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I really enjoyed it. A classic that will definately go on my list of all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This has to be one of my top 5 best reads to date. James Clavell manages to tear you away from present day life by offering you a detailed look at the remarkable history of Hong Kong and the colonisation of the uninhabitable rock off China.Guranteed to have you calling in to work sick, you will not be able to put this down with more action than you can handle as well as amazing facts that you probably never knew.Noble House follows James Clavell's Thai Pan which I strongly recommend you read before hand, also 5 stars."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"If you liked Shogun, you'll love Noble House. I couldn't put it down. One of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I am busy reading this book for the second time and I love it. It got me to writing Tai-Pan, King Rat, and Gai-Jin(uh!!). I liked the other two. Casey is a wonderful character and the drama between her, Gornt, and Dunross is good too. You must read this book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This novel will grab you in the first five pages like no other I have read. Although some of the subplots become a bit Byzantine, you hold your breath through the twists and turns of a crisis where the firm fights a corporate takeover, kidnapping, murder, and love affairs.The novel Nobel House is all the more interesting because it is based on a fictional version of the trading giant Jardine Matheson: a company which was founded by the colorful opium smuggler/Taipan William Jardine in the 1830's and 40's in Canton and later Hong Kong (he was called the Iron Headed Old Rat by the Chinese). Jardine's decendents persently control this company which employs over 200,000 people around the world."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"Gripping story that prompted me to start reading Taipan, King Rat, Shogun... Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"author had done a lot of hard work in getting information about local phrases and convention of old china well done mr clavell"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is a worthy sequel to Tai Pan, with excellent continuity (the coins, come to mind) and plenty of action, intrigue and asian exotica. The only areas where I thought it was weak was in the intricacy of the financial details (I am no CPA) and the very poor tie in to Shogun with the Japanese reporter."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This installment of James Clavell's Asian series is by far my favorite. The characters, the interweaving plotlines and the drama of the book are all intricately played out. It is a pity that Clavell never got to finisht he series and ended on what I consider the suppar Whirlwind."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"You will never read another book like this. Noble House will teach you culture, history, language...taking you under the very skin of a people. A must read."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"The book Noble House is an absolutely entrancing roller-coaster ride of a adventure! It is an account based on the famous trading house giant Jardine Matheson and Co. of Hong Kong which was founded in the early 19th century by William Jardine (the Dirk Struan of Clavell's Tai-Pan).This book is absolutely a stunning tour-de-force of knowledge of the Bysantine complexities of Hong Kong's social and political intrigue- where long memories trigger hatreds and alliances that are invisible to those ignorant of custom and hisotry.This novel absolutely gripped me. It has provided me with THOUSANDS of dollars of entertainment for a few pennies per hour! Read the first few pages, and you will be hooked! it is that good."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"i'm only 16, and i loved this book. i've read all of Mr. Clavell's asian saga novels except whirlwind (i can't find any in stock). it's not good as Tai-pan or Shogun, but it's still one of the best book i've read. if you read this you'll have a very hard time letting go because of all the interesting stuff that happens from previous books like the four coins, Struan's and Dunross', and the pirates of Lotus. one thing i was dissapointed was that i had a hard time understanding the stock dealings they went through."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This is a long book, but then it is just part of Clavell's running story, and really fits in with well with Tai-Pan. This is a lot more up to date, as it is set in the early nineteen-sixties. I love how the author has the orientals characterize the Americans and English (loud, rude, obnoxious, etc). There is several threads of rommance that run through the book, all the while it is mainly a spy story. You have to stretch a little bit to think this is a believable story, but just kick back and enjoy the different cultural flavor the book brings. The fact that Hong Kong was a British Territory helped me believe some of the improbable legal and financial situations that developed. All in all a long enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I intended to read this book a long time before I did. I've always been fascinated by the slippery world of the market players. It's a lot more fun reading about it than being on the other end of it, and I have done both.A covertly ambitious businessman and his female assistant arrive in China with secret designs on wresting financial power from the existing controller of Hong Kong business, Ian Dunross, who's company (s) of Struan's holds the title to Noble House, a Chinese term for \\"Biggest Guy\\" I guess. (it's a boys club - no girls allowed) Dunross has maintained a tenuous hold on the title by sheer strength of his wits because he is developing financial problems, which he is trying to keep under wraps while he stabilizes his game plan, plagued by all sorts of intrigue and undermovements, made noteable by one of his arch enemies and rivals in business, who has inside information and sees this as his golden opportunity to move in for the kill. There are many other sub-plots tying all of it together, and the Chinese names are difficult to maintain a grip on. I found myself going back every now and then just to keep track of them. But that, too, was part of the storyline puzzle, since the police were having the same difficulty.The story is extremely well written, showing the seamy side of floating Chinese culture existing comfortably beside high rises and billionaires; with politics of the Viet Nam era driving everything. The high-stakes players were openly hostile to one another, laying their gargantuan egos on the table along with the challenge to one another, in a winner-take-all - except the American played by a third set of rules which is all that should be divulged by a review, leaving the ending to the winds.It was everything I wanted in a read of the subject."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"This was the first James Clavell book I had read, and now I am eager to read all of the others. In a word, Noble House is amazing. In its breadth and scope it is unsurpassed by any novel I have ever read. It is gripping from the Prologue where you introduced to the main character, Ian Dunross to the awe-inspiring conclusion. The characters are all well-formed, and you feel like you know them intimately. Their faults and good qualities are all known by the reader. Don't be discouraged by the book's weight and length. It will fly by. Even though the book weighs a pound, it is very hard to put down. This is a book that makes me want to tell anyone who can read that they should read this book."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"In this book Clavell truly surpasses himself and writes a story equivalent to that of his earlier work, Shogun. The plot is riveting and exciting, and completely unique. Overall, it's a fantastic read that shows an extrodinary perception of the fast-paced world of Hong Kong and the effects the intrusion of Europeans has had on it."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"The book Noble House is an absolutely entrancing roller-coaster ride of a adventure!

The book is huge. When I brought the book to the pool at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Las Vegas, I had people tell me that is was the biggest book they had ever seen in there lives. One guy mentioned that the book was longer than the dictionary. Which is true. Someone else asked me how you remember characters and events in a book that is so long. And that is the beauty of this book and its writer James Clavell.Despite being over 1300 pages, Noble House will hold your interest the entire time. You will not want it to end. The characters in this book are so great, you will be sad when the book is finally over.The book is about Hong Kong in 1963, it is also a sequal to Tai-Pan and in a way a sequal to King Rat. It makes references to Shogun as well. The book is also a history of the cold war, and of Hong Kong and China in the early 1960's. That is one of Clavell's greatest gifts, the historical background he brings to his Asia saga.This is no quick read, but its a great read and full of great stuff about China and Chinese culture."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"James Clavell didn't disappoint me. The story is exciting, you never know what comes next. The ending is great, unlike Tai Pan's abrupt conclusion. I agree with one of the reviews: one doesn't need to read Tai Pan before in order to understand Noble House. However, there are some side stories that are brought in Noble House whose comprehension requires previous reading of Shogun, Tai Pan and King Rat. Besides, I enjoyed seeing how the characters of those books (or their descendants) get to know each other in Noble House."},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"NOBLE HOUSE IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ ABOUT HONGKONG.I FIRST READ THIS BOOK ABOUT 2O YEARS AGO AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS A LONG BOOK IT IS SO WELL WRITTEN THAT I FINISHED IT IN TWO SITTINGS. the kindle addltion has same effect me. THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK SHOULD EXPERIENCE IT ONCE"},{"Title":"Noble House","review":"I found the characters amusing for a while, but after it just slowly grinds on and on for page after page I started to just wish they would die.I can't believe this relatively simple story takes so long to tell. Worse than that it is padded with repetition, so it isn't a huge painting with a small and interesting subject, it's a lot of nothing much with some minor relief to the boredom.And then in five minutes it's all sorted out. The main character does the obvious thing, which would probably make anyone else a pariah. Everything before and after those five minutes hardly matters. Even the disasters don't really matter to the story. Though they do matter to the characters."},{"Title":"Frontier Religion: Elder Daniel Parker: His Religious and Political Life","review":"Having spent much time myself researching the controversy over missions between the Maria Creek and LaMotte Baptist churches of the Wabash District Association, I can appreciate the amount of work Dr. Wimberly has put into this book. Dr. Wimberly does an excellent job of putting Daniel Parker's life into the context of the historical events of his time. He portrays Parker as a man shaped by his beliefs and his environment in both his political and religious life from his birth to his final years in Texas. I found this book to be informative and enjoyable reading. I was worried when I ordered the book that it would not meet my expectations because I had already read much about Parker's life and the people he came in contact with. The book, however, much exceeded my expectations."},{"Title":"Frontier Religion: Elder Daniel Parker: His Religious and Political Life","review":"This book is wonderful. Not only does it tell about early religion in the United States, but Daniel Parker is one of my ancestors. Even so, this book not only talks about his life, but it talks about his personnal and political views on religion. This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Frontier Religion: Elder Daniel Parker: His Religious and Political Life","review":"This book places Daniel Parker in the context of his times. Interesting &amp; Informative"},{"Title":"Becoming a Mother: From Birth to Six Months","review":"This book made me feel ready to be a first time mom. Great education through others' stories.

I loved it!!"},{"Title":"Becoming a Mother: From Birth to Six Months","review":"I first read this book in its original language - Norwegian - and I really enjoyed the author's style. Furthemore, it has great illustrations and beautiful black/white photography.The author, Gro Nylander, is quite famous in Europe as a champion of breast-feeding, and this book covers this topic in great detail without becoming too lecturous.If I could have only one pregnancy-help book, this would be the one! It would make a very nice gift as well."},{"Title":"Pattern of Blood","review":"Rosemary Rowe gets most of her historical information from books written for the layperson, this is her claim in the 'Foreword'. So while I could point out the minor differences in historical interpretation I don't think that most people are looking at this book to replace a textbook on the Empire in Britain. Three of the characters are repeat performers: the pavement maker (not quite how I would describe him given what he creates) Liberatus, his slave and apprentice Junio and his patron Marcus (who may be related to the Emperor Commodus). This time the mystery involves the murder of a local administrator and a murder of his slave, a boy whom did far more than merely serve meals to his master. This is an interesting twist because in order to understand the more important murder, the minor one must be solved as well. Rowe overplays the differences in status a bit too much for my taste and she underestimates the power and authority of women by the end of the 2nd century CE. Overall if you liked the first book, this one will please you as well."},{"Title":"Pattern of Blood","review":"Rowe's second Libertus offering - \`A Pattern of Blood', has our erstwhile sleuth hotfooting it to Corfinium, with Junio in tow, to the townhouse of the decurion, Quintus Ulfinus to investigate the latter's stabbing after the races, a few days earlier. It just so happened that Libertus was present during the attack having visted Corfinium to investigate the whereabouts of his missing wife, Gwellia.Just after he turns up with his patron, Marcus Septimus, Quintus is murdered as he lies recuperating. The suspects are immediately limited to his playboy son, Maximillius, his wife, Julia, her ex-husband, Flavius, the aging Lupus, and the medicus, Sollers. Mingled in are the household slaves, Rollo being the most prominent, particularly as he ends up in the latrines the next morning as the second murder.What Libertus suffers from here (and notes several times in hindsight as he relates the tale) is that he allows personal emotions to lead to poor character judgement which, in turn, clouds him to the blatant facts that are under his nose. A case of not wanting certain people to end up being the culprit(s). It effectively humanises him and we begin to see the flawed human beneath the brilliant mind.Each of the suspects has good motive and each has good reason to attempt to implicate most of the others as it becomes evident that the murder is part of a power struggle to obtain Quintus' estate.Blood is very important to this murder mystery, notably where it is present and on whom. Once Lupus is incarcerated in the \`attic' and Mutuus (having been freed in the reading of Quintus' will just after Libertus discovers the culprit behind the original stabbing and the subsequent blackmailing) has further denounced his adopted father (Lupus) we have a lengthy denouement as Libertus grills Julia (who is not quite as angelic as the Libertus would have us believe and Sollers in Marcus' presence. We then move very quickly to find the ambiguous soothsayer in the town whose predictions ultimately come true, though not in the manner our protagonists first assumed they would. Finally we end up with the uncovering of the culprit(s) and Libertus' lengthy explanations to his patron as to where the clues lay. As with the previous novel the clues are there in the text from the beginning (unlike many other authors who introduce essential facts as we go along) so whilst suspicions are confirmed, the reasoning is a delight to uncover.The continuing growth of the main characters has added more flesh to the bones given in \`The Germanicus Mosaic'. Libertus and Junio are an excellent team, though Marcus is protrayed as an impulsive intellectual buffoon as times. It is hard to see what he brings to the show, other than as a well-placed man to get things actioned for Libertus when he cannot himself. The supporting characters are excellently drawn, their interplay a delight to watch as Libertus teases out the true facts of their relationships..Overall it is an improvement on the first offering and makes me reach eagerly for the third - Murder in the Forum."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],P={key:0},C={key:1};function V(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",L,[(e(!0),t(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),w(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(A,[["render",V],["__scopeId","data-v-910cf0ab"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/44.md","filePath":"guide/44.md"}'),R={name:"guide/44.md"},N=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(H)]))}});export{q as __pageData,N as default};
